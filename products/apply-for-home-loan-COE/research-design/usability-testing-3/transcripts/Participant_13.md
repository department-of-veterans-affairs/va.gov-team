00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:28.119
#### Moderator: let's see here, remote control, stop remote control. Yeah. So just say, just say, scroll. And if you see something you want me to click on just tell me to click, and I'll do that. So.

54
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.809
#### Participant 13: Okay under check eligibility. Let's find out if I'm eligible.

55
00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:43.749
#### Moderator: Right? Okay? So when I said it was a prototype, and there are some links that weren't going to this. This is one of them. That's not for the purposes of this study. We're going to assume that you are, in fact, eligible.

56
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.089
#### Participant 13: Okay, alright.

57
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.880
#### Participant 13: So.

58
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.139
#### Moderator: Good to know you would click on that to find out.

59
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.399
#### Participant 13: Yeah, I would. I would hope that most people would would do that.

60
00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:06.360
#### Participant 13: Let me just say that I I like technology. So I embrace it. Not all of my fellow veterans.

61
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:07.440
#### Participant 13: Duke.

62
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.540
#### Moderator: -

63
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:17.420
#### Participant 13: And so, 1st and foremost, the site has to be logical and.

64
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.389
#### Participant 13: I think you have to take into as much consideration as you can.

65
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.149
#### Participant 13: making it as easy as possible for

66
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:38.570
#### Participant 13: a user to find out a if they're qualified, which I'm assuming that link would take them, and that would do it. And then the

67
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.809
#### Participant 13: oh, just overall simplicity.

68
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.050
#### Participant 13: Yeah.

69
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.810
#### Moderator: Yep, yep, love that love to hear it.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.960
#### Participant 13: You can scroll down some.

72
00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:01.519
#### Moderator: All right.

73
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.820
#### Participant 13: Okay. Stop.

74
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.460
#### Moderator: Okay.

75
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.010
#### Participant 13: Scroll a little bit further.

76
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.280
#### Moderator: All right.

77
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.990
#### Participant 13: Further.

78
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.450
#### Moderator: Okay.

79
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:26.940
#### Participant 13: From my perspective, I think it's good. I think you you have put together a easy to follow

80
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:37.209
#### Participant 13: Portal in order to do this. I mean, you've you've addressed the points that

81
00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:49.120
#### Participant 13: are needed as you progress through it. What type of documentation you may need depending on your service. And

82
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.440
#### Participant 13: you know, right down to what happens after you make the request.

83
00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:01.920
#### Participant 13: I particularly like the area about receiving help if you need it from a local.

84
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.660
#### Participant 13: However, we can scroll up a little bit, scroll, scroll back up a little bit.

85
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.560
#### Moderator: Sure, sure.

86
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.095
#### Participant 13: Yeah, the veteran service organization to help with it.

87
00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:24.109
#### Moderator: Yeah, we love our Bso's. They they are just fantastic.

88
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:33.119
#### Participant 13: Well, I'm in Ohio and Ohio is one of the few states that actually have a veteran service organization in each county.

89
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.409
#### Moderator: That is fantastic.

90
00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:42.349
#### Participant 13: So there are 88 of them in Ohio, so we're very, very fortunate, and I've used them any number of times.

91
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.169
#### Moderator: No.

92
00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:43.444
#### Participant 13: That's

93
00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.609
#### Moderator: Great to hear.

94
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:50.859
#### Participant 13: I I think it's good. Personally, I don't think it's

95
00:08:53.010 --> 00:09:00.870
#### Participant 13: I don't think it's confusing, at least from my perspective and great. And again, that's that to me, is 1st and foremost.

96
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.589
#### Participant 13: to make it as easy for the user to work their way through this.

97
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:13.569
#### Moderator: Great, all right. So if you were going to start, start the request, what would you do next?

98
00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.490
#### Participant 13: Scroll up. Okay.

99
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.090
#### Participant 13: Well, 1st off, I I

100
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:29.499
#### Participant 13: recognize that that I probably would be eligible, but I would still find out I would, I would click on that link.

101
00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:35.890
#### Participant 13: and I would verify the fact that that I'm in.

102
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.220
#### Participant 13: I do qualify for it.

103
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:49.690
#### Participant 13: And then it would be a matter of just reading down and making sure that I had a copy of my Dd. 2, 14, that that would be available

104
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.320
#### Participant 13: and

105
00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.620
#### Participant 13: The rest, of course, doesn't apply to me until we.

106

#### Moderator: Okay.

174
00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:44.609
#### Participant 13: Okay, all right. Continue just just I will.

175
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.320
#### Participant 13: Terrifying here. Now that that was his service.

176
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:57.480
#### Moderator: Yes, yes, yep, yep, and I have a quick question. If you let's say you got out in 72 or 70, excuse me, 71

179
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:09.609
#### Moderator: Is it? Is it clear here how you would handle that.

180
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:12.960
#### Participant 13: They add another service period. Yeah.

181
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.949
#### Moderator: Perfect, great. Okay. Awesome. Thank you for that.

182
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.680
#### Participant 13: Yeah.

183
00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:24.250
#### Moderator: We're not gonna do that today. But I just wanna make sure that. Yeah, that that was apparent. But all right. So continue.

184
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.179
#### Participant 13: Does happen?

185
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.820
#### Moderator: Yeah, absolutely.

#### Moderator: Okay.

189
00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.270
#### Moderator: great. Interesting enough. I did not know.

190
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:51.490
#### Participant 13: Even though I haven't looked into this in countless years, that.

191
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:59.120
#### Participant 13: There could actually be a refinance or an interest rate, reduction, refinance, loan, interest.

192
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:07.680
#### Moderator: Yeah, yeah, if you wanted to. If you wanted to learn more about what any of these things were, is there somewhere on the page you might

193
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:09.940
#### Moderator: find that.

194
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:15.339
#### Participant 13: I would assume it would be right here.

195
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.180
#### Participant 13: Options.

196
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.049
#### Moderator: I'm sorry. Say that again I dropped.

197
00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:24.769
#### Participant 13: Would this not be the place? Understanding your coe options.

198
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:26.600
#### Moderator: Awesome great yep.

199
00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:34.610
#### Participant 13: Right? Okay? Then, that just gives you the explanation of of each of those selections.

200
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.150
#### Participant 13: Yeah, that's good. That's good.

201
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.890
#### Moderator: Sorry it. Yeah, it's a little buggy. Okay? Great.

202
00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:49.189
#### Participant 13: Okay, yeah. And I'll continue.

203
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:57.880
#### Participant 13: You ever had a Va back loan? Well, in my case, I did.

204
00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.940
#### Moderator: Okay.

205
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:04.290
#### Participant 13: So I would collect, or I would click. Yes.

206
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.010
#### Moderator: Okay.

207
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.480
#### Participant 13: And then continue

208
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:19.920
#### Participant 13: okay. I do not own this property or the property that I use the loan for, so no.

209
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.109
#### Moderator: Okay.

210
00:17:22.889 --> 00:17:29.199
#### Participant 13: Continue upload your documents. Okay?

211
00:17:29.979 --> 00:17:33.279
#### Participant 13: Type of evidence. A Va loan paid in full that.

212
00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:51.780
#### Moderator: In this case you wouldn't sorry. So when there were so many different permutations of what a person could select, that in your case the only the only bullet you would see is a copy of your Dd. 2, 14, because you.

213
00:17:51.880 --> 00:18:01.819
#### Moderator: your loan, your Va. Loan, was, you know, was paid in full. You no longer own the property, and also you didn't have a name change, so those wouldn't show. But I couldn't.

214
00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:03.220
#### Participant 13: Okay.

215
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:08.169
#### Moderator: Couldn't. I couldn't do every permutation. So so really, you'd only be looking at. Yeah.

216
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:14.999
#### Participant 13: Alright. So again, the type of evidence for the Va. Paid in full, or the type.

217
00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:17.790
#### Participant 13: Her name. Change would not be there.

218
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.929
#### Moderator: It would not. It wouldn't show.

219
00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:29.090
#### Participant 13: That would because that would be a red, not a red flag. But that would be problematic for me, because I don't even know how I go about proving that I paid for that in full.

220
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.640
#### Moderator: Exactly.

221
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:44.489
#### Moderator: Exactly. Yeah, we're we're implementing quite a bit of of conditional logic in the form, in the final product, so that the veteran only ever sees what they need to see, and and not

222
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.460
#### Moderator: not a single word of what they don't. So.

223
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:58.900
#### Participant 13: Okay, good. I mean again, that that goes back to, you know. Keep it as simple and as logical

224
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:10.249
#### Participant 13: as possible. I know you can't. You can't take everything into consideration. But if you you take somebody's normal IQ, then typically they'll they'll make their way through it.

225
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:19.749
#### Participant 13: But so many government forms are so cluttered with unnecessary information, it just

226
00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:28.589
#### Participant 13: wrecks havoc with the individual is trying to fill it out. But this is this is very intuitive, and it just walks you through it. So

227
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.410
#### Participant 13: so far, I think it's it's excellent.

228
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:33.720
#### Moderator: I love to hear it. Thank you.

229
00:19:34.598 --> 00:19:38.070
#### Participant 13: We scroll down a little bit. Now, this is, of course, where I'm gonna

230
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.319
#### Participant 13: drag my Dd 2 14 into it.

231
00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:47.050
#### Moderator: Okay, all right, I'm gonna I'm gonna do that for you. Here.

232
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.880
#### Participant 13: Okay.

233
00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.715
#### Participant 13: okay, that

234
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.880
#### Participant 13: one of the.

235
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:18.089
#### Participant 13: And I don't think you can do anything about this. But one of the problems that I've seen with some of the government forms is when they ask you for information and you attempt to drag it into the field. It doesn't want to accept it, because the size of the file is too big.

236
00:20:19.810 --> 00:20:20.620
#### Moderator: Yep.

237
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.470
#### Participant 13: I mean, that's that does.

238
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:22.400
#### Moderator: Happened.

239
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:24.489
#### Participant 13: Yeah. And then, you know.

240
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:33.890
#### Participant 13: I know it might not happen with something like this. But I see it happen with medical records, because they can be pretty extensive, and and.

241
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:37.249
#### Moderator: Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, an entire medical record can be.

242
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.389
#### Participant 13: Then you're trying to gigabytes.

243
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.780
#### Moderator: Right.

244
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.459
#### Participant 13: Figure a way to compress them.

245
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.860
#### Moderator: Yeah.

246
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:44.150
#### Participant 13: Okay,

247
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.090
#### Moderator: Great.

248
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.390
#### Participant 13: Continue.

249
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:48.690
#### Moderator: All right.

250
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:55.667
#### Moderator: Now again, I'm assuming that that box below that. Nope, let's go back.

251
00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:01.209
#### Participant 13: Oh, would that be there if

252
00:21:01.784 --> 00:21:08.750
#### Participant 13: all you needed was just the the Dd. 2, 14, or your your discharge papers.

253
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:19.900
#### Moderator: Right. So typically with with this type of download form, it'll it will always regardless of whether you just need one document. It will always allow you to add.

254
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.650
#### Participant 13: Okay.

255
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:21.640
#### Moderator: Another.

256
00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:34.569
#### Moderator: Okay, but but yeah, that's it's an interesting like in in talking about, you know, reductivism, and and only showing what you need. That's an that's an interesting thought. I hadn't. I hadn't thought of.

257
00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:41.080
#### Participant 13: Well, I only brought that up because in the I believe it was the previous screen

258
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:44.310
#### Participant 13: information beyond

259
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.000
#### Participant 13: Well, where where it showed about previous homeownership, that type of thing which won't be there.

260
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.380
#### Participant 13: That's the only reason I brought that up

261
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.759
#### Participant 13: right. All you need are your discharge papers. That's a single document.

262
00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:14.970
#### Moderator: Correct. Correct. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This this particular version is is for somebody who you know, who needs to prove that their Va loan was paid in full and has had a name change. So? But yeah.

263
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:15.770
#### Participant 13: All right.

264
00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.760
#### Participant 13: Continue.

265
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.830
#### Moderator: All right.

266
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.000
#### Moderator: Okay, this. I'm used to this screen.

267
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:33.259
#### Participant 13: Click on H, and it verifies each stage that you've

268
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:38.509
#### Participant 13: you've entered. So can you? Can you hit those.

269
00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:50.809
#### Moderator: Yeah, you know what? Actually, we're gonna I'm gonna because it's it's not in the prototype. I'm gonna take you to a slightly different screen here. But this is this is what it would look like in the expanded state.

270
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:51.690
#### Participant 13: Okay.

271
00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:02.039
#### Moderator: Now, if there was an an error, if you look through this, and, for example, wait a minute. That name's not right.

272
00:23:02.682 --> 00:23:06.810
#### Moderator: I'm Jesse Smith, how would you go about correcting that.

273
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.250
#### Participant 13: I edit it.

274
00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:09.940
#### Moderator: Okay. Great.

275
00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:11.009
#### Participant 13: Hit edit.

276
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.610
#### Moderator: Perfect any anything else.

277
00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.160
#### Moderator: Not a trick question. I'm just wondering if if, how, how this, how this page.

278
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.860
#### Participant 13: No, no! Just looking at this.

279
00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:31.309
#### Participant 13: Well, here again, if you know previous name.

280
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:36.459
#### Participant 13: If that was yes or no, I'd have to either edit or or leave it.

281
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.120
#### Moderator: Yeah, I'm just scrolling.

282
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.540
#### Participant 13: Okay. Previous name. Used. Now.

283
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.580
#### Moderator: Right, and this is not synchronized with the other one. So.

284
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.609
#### Participant 13: Right, right.

285
00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:56.090
#### Moderator: But but yeah, the just wanted to show the the edit state.

286
00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.900
#### Participant 13: Okay, we can continue scrolling down.

287
00:23:59.260 --> 00:23:59.893
#### Moderator: All right.

288
00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:04.860
#### Participant 13: Okay.

289
00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:15.030
#### Participant 13: okay.

290
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.620
#### Participant 13: if this has some information in it that would not normally be there, correct.

291
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:37.920
#### Moderator: No, that. Well, for example, the purple heart recipient question is only for active duty members who are applying for Coe.

292
00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.980
#### Moderator: Yeah, they they get to the the funding fee, waived.

293
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.330
#### Participant 13: Right? If they are

294
00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.360
#### Participant 13: okay.

295
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:58.680
#### Moderator: And this has a whole bunch. You can see, this has multiple multiple service periods. In addition to a current. You know the current one. They're in.

296
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:02.090
#### Participant 13: Yeah, okay, we can go down.

297
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:03.460
#### Moderator: Okay.

298
00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:09.740
#### Participant 13: Okay.

299
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.250
#### Participant 13: All right.

300
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.930
#### Participant 13: Okay.

301
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:40.279
#### Moderator: This person also has 2 2 addresses.

302
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.920
#### Moderator: So so it goes. It gets a little bit repetitive. But here, let's see here, let me get to the bottom here.

303
00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.879
#### Moderator: There's the all their documents.

304
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:50.470
#### Participant 13: Yeah.

305
00:25:54.080 --> 00:26:00.230
#### Moderator: And then below those expanded states, you would see this. So here I'm going to jump back to the prototype here.

306
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.609
#### Moderator: All right.

307
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:11.200
#### Moderator: So at this point we're going to. We're going to assume that you've reviewed and either verified or corrected.

308
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.350
#### Participant 13: Yes.

309
00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.769
#### Moderator: Any, any, and all errors.

310
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:22.360
#### Participant 13: All right, so we can get on to the statement of truth.

311
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:32.530
#### Participant 13: I have pretty straightforward.

312
00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.300
#### Moderator: Okay. Great.

313
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:37.999
#### Participant 13: Type in the name full name.

314
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.060
#### Moderator: All right.

315
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.250
#### Participant 13: And click the I certify.

316
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:48.619
#### Moderator: Great. This checkbox is a little. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Let's see here. No, no, not gonna work for us today.

317
00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.580
#### Moderator: anyhow, and that it did.

318
00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.750
#### Participant 13: And then, submit the application.

319
00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:56.760
#### Moderator: Okay.

320
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.030
#### Participant 13: Okay.

321
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:14.620
#### Participant 13: is there any?

322
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:26.430
#### Participant 13: When the verification process you're going through that to to make sure that all the information you've submitted is

323
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:31.510
#### Participant 13: is correct before you finally submit the documentation.

324
00:27:33.413 --> 00:27:37.780
#### Participant 13: Is there anything, or is it at this stage

325
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.550
#### Participant 13: that would flag something that wasn't correct?

326
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.220
#### Moderator: Oh, well, so so the the.

327
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.310
#### Participant 13: That or that you that you miss, that you've?

328
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.149
#### Participant 13: Or would that have taken place.

329
00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:52.560
#### Moderator: Oh!

330
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.240
#### Participant 13: Prior to even advancing each page.

331
00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:00.799
#### Moderator: If you if you didn't, if you didn't enter something that was required.

332
00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.449
#### Moderator: it would. It would flag it on those individual pages, and you wouldn't be.

333
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:07.839
#### Participant 13: Before you were able, before you could advance.

334
00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:13.499
#### Moderator: Correct. Correct. So it would. It would say it would say, you haven't filled out this field.

335
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:20.339
#### Moderator: But then the the verification, this step is more about you looking for. Oh.

336
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:20.780
#### Participant 13: Right.

337
00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:26.119
#### Moderator: I typed in an A in my email address instead of an E, that type of thing.

338
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.890
#### Participant 13: That would all take place before you ever got to that that.

339
00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:30.640
#### Moderator: Yes.

340
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:32.010
#### Participant 13: Okay.

341
00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:40.619
#### Participant 13: anything I should see below this.

342
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.750
#### Moderator: Absolutely would. Yeah, let's let's scroll here just a little bit. Give you a better view.

343
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.760
#### Participant 13: Page, which I would do.

344
00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.070
#### Moderator: Does this have all the information you would expect.

345
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:13.639
#### Participant 13: Yes, for the for the the certification. I was submitting.

346
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.220
#### Participant 13: Great question.

347
00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:16.260
#### Moderator: Perfect.

348
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:28.820
#### Participant 13: Okay, checking the status. I like that. That's always a hurry up and wait with the Government.

349
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:34.310
#### Participant 13: But at least it gives you an opportunity to

350
00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:37.040
#### Participant 13: see where you're at with any adventure.

351
00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:38.220
#### Moderator: -

352
00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:46.303
#### Participant 13: No, I

353
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:52.020
#### Participant 13: I think it's good. I think it's intuitive. It is logical. That

354
00:29:54.550 --> 00:30:04.589
#### Participant 13: is pretty easy all the way through. The only place that might trip somebody up, and they could always get help doing. It is the scanning or the submission of their Dd. 2, 14. That's all

355
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.489
#### Participant 13: true, but that you're not in control of that.

356
00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.659
#### Moderator: Right? Yeah, it's funny. Not everybody has a scanner.

357
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:17.309
#### Moderator: especially especially now, but a lot. I think a lot of people. It's it can be tricky to

358
00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:20.969
#### Moderator: to take a picture of a thing on your phone and then get that.

359
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:25.920
#### Participant 13: That file from your phone to your computer, or right.

360
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:35.809
#### Moderator: I mean, some people are. Some people do this entirely on their phone, and they're able to grab, you know, grab the image from their phone folder, but.

361
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.169
#### Participant 13: I keep a Dd. 2, 14 on my

362
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.360
#### Participant 13: screen all the time, so.

363
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:45.880
#### Moderator: Smart.

364
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.580
#### Participant 13: Always brag that. Yeah.

365
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.950
#### Moderator: It's nice smart.

366
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:55.640
#### Moderator: So, looking back on this process, now that you've you know, seen it from tooth to tail.

367
00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:01.670
#### Moderator: Is there anything looking back, is there anything that that stands out that?

368
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.650
#### Moderator: You might change or or do differently, or or add, or take away anything at all?

369
00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.400
#### Participant 13: No, Ian, I'll tell you. I've

370
00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:15.709
#### Participant 13: I filled out a lot of stuff for the government, and

371
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.550
#### Participant 13: this was very easy to work through.

372
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.030
#### Participant 13: It.

373
00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:29.169
#### Participant 13: I think it just kind of it affirms each step of the way that you're progressing. And

374
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:36.539
#### Participant 13: honestly, there, there really isn't anything that that I think.

375
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:47.960
#### Participant 13: makes it difficult to understand, or difficult to fill out all the way

376
00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:53.590
#### Participant 13: to the point. You, you submit your information and then

377
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:59.350
#### Participant 13: give a link to check the status. After X number of days.

378
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.050
#### Moderator: Wow! Great!

379
00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.379
#### Participant 13: I like it. I do. I think it's I think it's good. I really do.

380
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.699
#### Moderator: Thank you. Thank you so much.

381
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:11.630
#### Moderator: Well, that's that's pretty much it. That's

382
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:15.019
#### Moderator: that's the that's the task. That's the prototype.

383
00:32:15.959 --> 00:32:20.850
#### Moderator: Thank you so much for for walking through that with us today. It's it's

384
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:26.790
#### Moderator: It's such a privilege to be able to test this with veterans. And and know.

385
00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.429
#### Moderator: you know. I mean, we can guess at what you know.

386
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:38.650
#### Moderator: What makes the thing work? Well, but we don't really know until we test it with you guys. So I really appreciate your time today.

387
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.609
#### Participant 13: Let me ask you a question off the.

388
00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.339
#### Moderator: Yeah, always. Yeah.

389
00:32:43.685 --> 00:32:49.550
#### Participant 13: It has nothing to do with this specifically. But I've I've done a number of interviews for

390
00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:55.689
#### Participant 13: the group, and I was pleased to see that

391
00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:01.160
#### Participant 13: they were kept in place after they initial

392
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.460
#### Participant 13: shake up. If you know what I'm talking about. And

393
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.310
#### Participant 13: initially, there was kind of a cancellation of the program.

394
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.060
#### Moderator: It was touch and go for a minute.

395
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:19.920
#### Participant 13: And I'm I'm very pleased that they saw the folly in that, hey?

396
00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.270
#### Moderator: So are we, so are we.

397
00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:29.780
#### Participant 13: That you're you're back at it. And and again, I appreciate the work you guys do for the veterans, and I appreciate being a part of it.

398
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:55.560
#### Moderator: Oh, thanks, John, yeah, we love Parisian. It makes our job so much easier. So here I've got a little bit of boilerplate before we wrap here. But let's see. Okay. Perigian will be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans. You may know, to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies

399
00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:00.609
#### Moderator: again. Thank you so much, and I hope the rest of the day treats you well.

400
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.360
#### Participant 13: Thank you very much, Ian. Best to you and your group.

401
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.780
Mike King: Thanks so much, John. Appreciate your time.

402
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.110
#### Participant 13: Okay. See you. Bye.

403
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.570
Raquel: You.

404
00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:08.530
#### Moderator: Take care, be well.
