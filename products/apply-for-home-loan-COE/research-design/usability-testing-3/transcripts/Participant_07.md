51
00:04:40.450 --> 00:05:06.049
#### Participant 07: Yeah, so okay, so I want to point this out. This is just my opinion. But like the part that it says, where, if you're a current member of the National Guard Reserves, and you've never been activated like it says you'll need a statement of service. And then I like how at the bottom there's like, what's the statement of service, you know, a link to click on. I know it seems like self explanatory, but you'd be amazed like the simple things that some people kind of like

52
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.780
#### Participant 07: don't know what it means. Because, like, I'm like that, too. We're like.

53
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:18.570
#### Participant 07: you know, like something like that, even something as simple as that I would need like kind of like a a more detailed explanation. So I like that.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.249
#### Moderator : Oh, glad to hear it!

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.339
#### Moderator : You're gonna make me blush. Stop.

57
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:17.439
#### Participant 07: Really like I, and and usually like, there is something to criticize. But, like whoever wrote this is, this is well written. This is very comprehensive.

58
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.619
#### Moderator : Thank you. Thank you.

59
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.389
#### Moderator : We're only one page in. So so there's there's still opportunity.

60
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.549
#### Participant 07: Okay, well, this page has passed. It has my seal of approval, for sure.

61
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.649

66
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:17.599

67
00:07:19.932 --> 00:07:21.330
#### Participant 07: If you could go back up.

68
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.200
#### Participant 07: cause I think there was like a button.

69
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:37.289
#### Participant 07: So actually the that green arrow thing I would click on that. But then up top, I noticed there was also, I think, another option.

70
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.840
#### Participant 07: Okay, good.

71
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.440
#### Moderator : Okay.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.550
#### Participant 07: Okay, no, but.

73
00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:42.000
#### Moderator : Gotcha.

74
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.880
#### Participant 07: So, yeah, I just click on the bottom. The with the green arrow.

75
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.129
#### Moderator : Alright, I'll I'll do that for you now.

76
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.120
#### Participant 07: Okay. You can scroll down.

77
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:02.230
#### Moderator : Alright!

78
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:11.359
#### Participant 07: All of that looks good, and if there's nothing else we can better continue.

79
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.560
#### Moderator : Okay.

80
00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.240
#### Moderator : Now, is there anything.

81
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.080
#### Participant 07: What's good on this page.

82
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.399
#### Moderator : Oh, great! Thank you.

83
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.750
#### Participant 07: Yeah, I I wouldn't change it, because then it it get like wacky and complicated.

84
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.520
#### Moderator : Sure.

85
00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:23.360
#### Participant 07: Sure.

86
00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.970
#### Moderator : Sure, and so.

87
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:43.750
#### Participant 07: I found the right balance like this is not like too overdramatic, but it's also not like underwritten where you're like. What are they trying to say, because usually with with government websites, it's either they're doing too too much or they're doing too little where you don't. You can't even grasp the concept. This is perfect so far.

88
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.790
#### Moderator : It's tricky to strike that balance.

89
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:47.320
#### Participant 07: Yeah.

90
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:53.460
#### Moderator : Is there? So how would you? How would you respond to this before continuing.

91
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.670
#### Participant 07: Oh, I would click! Yes.

92
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.200
#### Moderator : Okay.

93
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.720
#### Participant 07: Yeah.

94
00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:58.579
#### Participant 07: Sorry.

95
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.980
#### Participant 07: No, no, totally fine, and not anyone like.

96
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.839
#### Participant 07: Answer the walkthrough.

97
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:09.629
#### Moderator : Yep, yep, yeah. And it's also a little tricky, because, yeah, the the we have you as Jesse Smith here. So.

98
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.930
#### Participant 07: And that threw me off. I'm like, Wait, sorry.

99
00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:14.960
#### Moderator : Yeah, yeah.

100
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.860
#### Moderator : yeah. And the rest of these, like, the the yeah, the the date of birth. So all the information is made up. So.

101
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.659
#### Participant 07: Okay, yeah. So I just like, put in my date of birth, the Ssn.

102
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.470
#### Moderator : Okay.

103
00:09:37.011 --> 00:09:40.800
#### Participant 07: File number. Oh, okay, so that's only

104
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.849
#### Participant 07: what does that mean? Like, what is the the file? Number 4?

105
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.520
#### Moderator : Right.

106
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.870
#### Participant 07: It's only if it's different than your social.

107
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.849
#### Moderator : Yeah, yeah. What would you expect? The the Va file number to be.

108
00:09:57.987 --> 00:10:00.682
#### Participant 07: Lost me there. I'll be honest. I don't.

109
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.960
#### Participant 07: I would. Okay. My 1st guess would be maybe like

110
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:17.750
#### Participant 07: in some kind of confirmation email, there's a file number, or that might just be like your your case number with the Va. Just in general, like.

111
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:31.240
#### Participant 07: But other than that I have no idea, but I, personally would not fill that out, because it's saying, only if it's different than your social and I don't know, I would just put the social and go to continue.

112
00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.740
#### Moderator : Okay, perfect. Let's do that.

113
00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:01.359
#### Participant 07: Okay, this one's definitely straightforward. You just put in your address and you don't live in the Us. You click on that link and check the box.

114
00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.160
#### Moderator : Okay.

115
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.190
#### Moderator : Great.

116
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.350
#### Participant 07: Phone number and email. Very simple.

117
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.019
#### Participant 07: No questions there.

118
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:23.890
#### Moderator : All right, continuing on.

119
00:11:30.264 --> 00:11:35.930
#### Participant 07: I I mean. Obviously, in my case, I would just say I'm a veteran of active.

120
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.210
#### Moderator : All right.

121
00:11:47.045 --> 00:11:47.840
#### Participant 07: No.

122
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.450
#### Moderator : Okay.

123
00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.235
#### Participant 07: Oh, this is easy. Just your brand or World Marine Corps, and then

124
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:03.429
#### Moderator : Apology use for it.

125
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.970
#### Moderator : We'll put you in the army today.

126
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.719
#### Participant 07: Oh, hey! That works that works.

127
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:07.160
#### Moderator : Right.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.349
#### Participant 07: I've always admired them, anyway.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.610
#### Participant 07: Oh, and all, all the branches.

130
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:16.800
#### Moderator : Right? Absolutely.

131
00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.245
#### Moderator : Service is service.

132
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:30.950
#### Moderator : okay, great and if you, if if you made a mistake or if you didn't, or if you were trying to cancel this, can you? Can you tell where you would do that?

133
00:12:33.004 --> 00:12:39.930
#### Participant 07: I I would rather click on it, and then, like do the backspace. But like this cancel button, I

134
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:42.330
#### Participant 07: I guess it's saying like.

135
00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.950
#### Participant 07: I think it's trying to say cancel like delete. I think it's trying to say delete like the info.

136
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:55.850
#### Participant 07: or like, erase it. But saying cancel makes it seem like you're kind of like abort in the the whole.

137
00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:08.339
#### Participant 07: like application or not the whole application. But like, I guess, this pay this whole page. So I would just click on it and backspace. I wouldn't press that cancel button if I had to make a change.

138
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:09.510
#### Moderator : Okay. Cool.

139
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:10.839

140
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:17.919
#### Moderator : Yeah, alright good to know so at this point you'd continue.

141
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.299
#### Participant 07: Yeah, but I don't. I don't want that cancel button. I do want to say that, though no.

142
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:32.230
#### Moderator : Oh, no, it's it's not. It's not hooked up. I'm just. I'm just wondering. I just want to confirm that people understand. You know how how to get out of this if they need to.

147
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:56.540
#### Moderator : Okay. And if you had had multiple service periods like, maybe you served in the marines and then took a couple of years and and joined the Navy.

148
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.879
#### Moderator : How would you? How would you add your navy service.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:26.439
#### Participant 07: Oh, no, you're good. Some people do like click on it and double check. But I I usually don't do that, because, like I I double check while I, you know, like before I continue each page. So.

187
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:26.829
#### Moderator : Okay.

188
00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:34.329

#### Participant 07: I mean the privacy policy. I usually don't. I know I'm I'm guilty with this, but I don't. I usually don't even like read the whole thing of that.

190
00:17:44.359 --> 00:17:50.359
#### Participant 07: So I would just put my name, and like click the box to certify.

191
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.360
#### Moderator : All right

00:17:55.130 --> 00:18:03.929

193
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.700
#### Moderator : just real.

194
00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:19.930
#### Moderator : And if let's let's say you, you did click on this, and you saw something that that was wrong. Maybe you clicked a K instead of a J, or whatever what would you do to correct that.

195
00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:28.799
#### Participant 07: Click that edit button which I I really appreciate, that it's so obvious. So that you're not like scrambling around, looking confused.

196
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.250

199
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.169
#### Moderator : Oh, yeah, you know what this is? Yeah, that's 1 of the parts of the prototype that isn't working so. But.

200
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:45.730
#### Participant 07: Oh!

201
00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:52.419
#### Moderator : Real thing. No, no, no apology necessary. If anybody owes an apology, it's me I

202
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.721
#### Moderator : that should that should be working, but anyways

203
00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.269
#### Moderator : So then you'd hit the submit application button.

204
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.240
#### Participant 07: Okay.

205
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:20.989
#### Participant 07: now, if it allows it, this is where I would screenshot because, I know some certain websites especially with government, they don't always let you do that privacy policy. If it did, let me, I would screenshot or like.

206
00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:42.809
#### Participant 07: print out this page if I was like at at like a office or desktop, because this, the reference number I've learned like this, the hard way that is so important, because if you ever have to call or you need help like you always want to have that reference number. So this part is the most vital part for me, because I would always save this page.

207
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:48.859
#### Moderator : Break is, there is all the is all the information that you would hope for or expect

208
00:19:49.565 --> 00:19:52.479
#### Moderator : here, or is there anything missing.

209
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.199
#### Participant 07: No, this is

210
00:19:54.310 --> 00:20:00.790
#### Participant 07: no, this is right. This is correct, because that reference number is like super important, just like you're identifier.

211
00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.760
#### Moderator : Great.

212
00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:03.560
#### Participant 07: Great great.

213
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.899
#### Participant 07: So I'm glad that they have this page.

214
00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.790
#### Participant 07: Is there any.

215
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:14.939
#### Moderator : Awesome. And then, if you wanted to know about next steps, what would you do.

216
00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:35.540
#### Participant 07: I would, my, my 1st instinct would be to immediately check my email, because usually in the email, you basically in the email, you'll get the same thing like just basically saying, Hey, you submitted this. And here's your your confirmation number, or whatever. So I would go to my email, whatever email it was that I.

217
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:35.950
#### Moderator : Okay.

218
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.260
#### Participant 07: So an application.

219
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.820
#### Participant 07: And if I had like.

220
00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:47.550
#### Participant 07: like, if if for whatever reason like, I didn't get like that email or something, I wouldn't really worry about it, because, like.

221
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:50.220
#### Participant 07: I don't know like.

222
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:56.700
#### Participant 07: that's just how I work like, I don't know. I I usually go straight to email after something like this.

223
00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:00.049
#### Moderator : Yeah. So you'd you'd expect a confirmation email upon.

224
00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:00.800
#### Participant 07: Yeah.

225
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.360
#### Moderator : Okay.

226
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.360
#### Participant 07: Okay, but I just now I told them, cause I noticed you scroll down. It says.

227
00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.020
#### Moderator : No, no, it's that I.

228
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.749
#### Participant 07: It was. Yeah, you couldn't. You couldn't.

229
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:09.300
#### Moderator : See it.

230
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:09.710
#### Moderator : Hello.

231
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:14.419
#### Moderator : see it at first, st and that so yeah, I kinda I kind of scroll down there a little bit.

232
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.539
#### Moderator : But let's. But let's let's all scroll down here so you can see the whole thing.

233
00:21:21.069 --> 00:21:24.580
#### Moderator : And then just just tell me, tell me your thoughts on

234
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:28.009
#### Moderator : on whether this gives you enough enough information.

235
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:48.169
#### Participant 07: Oh, yeah, this is a definitely.gov situation, because they they always say, like, if you have questions or or something, if they have questions, they'll reach out to you first.st So yeah, this is.

236
00:21:48.260 --> 00:22:07.880
#### Participant 07: see, this is what I meant, like, I wouldn't even try to bother to reach out if I did have questions I would just kind of let it ride. But it says, now this is cool, though you get to check the status of your request. So that's pretty useful, because then you're not like itching to wonder like what's going on. That's pretty useful.

237
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.050
#### Participant 07: Okay,

238
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:16.179
#### Participant 07: just out of curiosity. I I would click to check your status, even though I know I just submitted it. I would

239
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:23.090
#### Participant 07: that that's something I would do just the way get that additional confirmation.

240
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:24.000
#### Moderator : Yep.

241
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:29.780
#### Participant 07: And that's basically it, though, as far as like what I would do next.

242
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.650
#### Moderator : Okay, great.

243
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:50.399
#### Moderator : Well, gosh, thank you. Thank you so much for going through that with us. In in the form. Was there anything you saw that was was confusing, or made you, or gave you questions, or or anything at all, that you would change.

244
00:22:51.570 --> 00:23:03.039
#### Participant 07: Only thing that I would absolutely change is like, what what in the world is the Va file number like? And why? Why would it be different from your social like? Why would the 2 be connected like I don't.

245
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:10.092
#### Participant 07: I don't know what that means at all like I don't even have an inkling of what that means, and it makes me feel down.

246
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:10.740
#### Moderator : It's.

247
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.110
#### Participant 07: It's.

248
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:19.059
#### Moderator : So it's interestingly enough, way back when I believe it. I believe they stopped using them in this. Maybe the Seventies.

249
00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:25.400
#### Moderator : Originally service members had a Va file number

250
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:36.309
#### Moderator : and instead, and then they started using so yeah, social security as the identifier. So there are still veterans who have a Va file number instead of

251
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.379
#### Moderator : a social security number. So.

252
00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.899
#### Participant 07: Oh, wow, I okay, that.

253
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:43.059
#### Moderator : But yeah, because.

254
00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.219
#### Participant 07: I had no idea.

255
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:55.040
#### Moderator : Most people have. I mean, everyone has a social. So they, you know, they they still use. They use that as well. But it's a it's a holdover from from another time. So.

256
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.940
#### Participant 07: Okay, got you.

257
00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:01.784
#### Moderator : Thanks. But thanks for pointing that out. Yeah, I most people, including myself.

258
00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:14.300
#### Moderator : I. At least I didn't know what it was. I had to had to had to look that up. But alright. Well, thank you so much for your time today. I really appreciate you walking us through this.

261
00:24:23.985 --> 00:24:28.815
#### Moderator : All right. I've just got just a little bit of boilerplate reading here.

265
00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.630
