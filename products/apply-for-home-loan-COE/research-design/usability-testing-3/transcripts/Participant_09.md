00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.580
#### Participant 09: So this is.

107
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.580

108
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.310

109
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:57.330

#### Moderator: Or is that? That's what you would expect.

112
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:07.980
#### Participant 09: That's what I would expect, and I would hope I'd find that information in my cause. We

113
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.439
#### Participant 09: I don't have that information readily available.

114
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.060
#### Moderator: Okay.

115
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:18.430
#### Participant 09: And I wouldn't know where to find that information. As far as, like the Va Loan number, the date of the loan.

116
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:19.550
#### Moderator: Gotcha.

117
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:28.799
#### Participant 09: Is I I would think it'd be the date that I close. But if I don't, you know, if that's not an anniversary type date. Then I'm not gonna remember that date. So I'd have to look.

118
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.430
#### Moderator: You and me both.

119
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.369
#### Participant 09: That information. But the question is,

120
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:41.360
#### Participant 09: is that information on like the statements like your mortgage Company statements.

121
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.130
#### Moderator: Right. That's a great question. I I actually don't know the answer to that.

122
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.690
#### Participant 09: Does it affect what you add like? You know how you ask the questions and what questions you do ask for, like the loan history.

123
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.300
#### Moderator: Right.

124
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.719
#### Participant 09: If it's a retired required information.

125
00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:05.530
#### Moderator: Right? Right? So so you're saying you're saying the the title of the of the field. It would help to be more specific.

126
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:10.240
#### Participant 09: Yeah, like, put a help thing to like, where would I find this information?

127
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.679
#### Moderator: Oh, oh! Understood! Understood! Like if it is, if it is on the on the top of your statement.

128
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:29.789
#### Participant 09: Right cause. If this is something, if this is a loan that I got 15 years ago, and I'm applying for another loan because I still have some benefits left. Then I don't know. You know I'm not. Those are some things you know. You just don't keep track of. You're not thinking about it anymore.

129
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.730
#### Moderator: Yep, yep, yep, that's a great point. I love that.

130
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.100
#### Moderator: I love that

131
00:09:36.135 --> 00:09:44.240

#### Participant 09: Okay?

133
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.229
#### Participant 09: And so with the Va, okay? So I guess we'll put down whatever date.

134
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.650
#### Moderator: Okay.

135
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.520
#### Participant 09: And the Va Loan number. Would that just be the loan number.

136
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.579
#### Moderator: Yeah, that that's yeah. And it's also.

137

#### Participant 09: Account.

138
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.439
#### Moderator: It's also not required.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.300
#### Participant 09: Okay.

140
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.090

141
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:09.110
#### Participant 09: Okay.

142
00:10:11.683 --> 00:10:15.319

143
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:16.530
#### Moderator: Okay.

144
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.360
#### Participant 09: And then continue.

145
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.360
#### Moderator: All right.

146
00:10:21.785 --> 00:10:26.500
#### Participant 09: Are you applying for entitlement restoration?

147
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.569
#### Participant 09: I guess it would be no.

148
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.990
#### Moderator: Okay, just an entitlement inquiry.

149
00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.210
#### Participant 09: Okay, I guess so.

150
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.439
#### Participant 09: Entitled No entitlement Inquiry. Only because, if I want to get a whole new Home Loan.

151
00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.150
#### Participant 09: I would hit entitlement inquiry only because it's not cash out from refinance.

152
