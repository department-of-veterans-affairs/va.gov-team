53
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.180
#### Participant 12: Yeah, I got it.

54
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:25.090
#### Moderator: Great great. So as you're going through this prototype, and all the data here has been faked in today. So you're gonna see, you know somebody else's name, and and fake addresses and fake social security numbers and all that kind of stuff. But so just bear with the the fake data. But as you're walking through this sort of page by page, if you could sort of narrate what you know your thought process.

55
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:40.580
#### Moderator: If you see anything that that gives you pause, or is confusing or doesn't, doesn't make sense, or or you think, now that's just dumb, you know, whatever whatever you know, whatever comes across, just just let us know.

56
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.050
#### Participant 12: So is the is that link work.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.730

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:42.660
#### Participant 12: It's so far it's pretty clear. I mean, I understand everything, and it goes step by step. I guess what I do like is that is the 1st one number one.

63
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:50.380
#### Participant 12: You check your eligibility. Evidently that must go to another questionnaire, and you fill it out, and it tells you if you're eligible or not correct.

64
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.529
#### Moderator: That's correct. Yeah. And and for for today's purposes, we're assuming that you you meet the criteria.

65
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.119
#### Participant 12: Well, I'm I know I do, but it's good.

66
00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.809

67
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.120
#### Participant 12: Name change, veteran.

68
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.440

69
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:08.366
#### Participant 12: I don't have any questions on this. I mean, like, I said. It's pretty logical, pretty well laid out it answers all that. Somebody may have a question, but it's covered.

70
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.010
#### Participant 12: so I I don't see anything that I would question.

71
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:20.769
#### Participant 12: Great name change. That's fine. I'm just double checking here. If you're a veteran. That's no problem. Dd, form 2, 14,

72
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:48.229
#### Participant 12: and I like the part about you know it. It kind of follows up to. If you do this, it'll it'll this will happen so it kind of.

77
00:08:03.714 --> 00:08:08.790
#### Moderator: The. It's it's really just the the stepper.

78
