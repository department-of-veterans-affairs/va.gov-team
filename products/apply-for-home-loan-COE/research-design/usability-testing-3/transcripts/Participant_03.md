00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:32.739
#### Moderator: And so what would your plan be to do next like would you want to do you want to purchase another home? Do you want to cash out refinance or do an iirl

61
00:05:33.947 --> 00:05:34.840
#### Moderator: what would you.

62
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:41.680
#### Participant 03: I've already done Irl before. So I'm gonna say, I'll do the cash out refinance.

63
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.660
#### Moderator: Okay. Great.

64
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.940
#### Participant 03: Alright. You may refinance your current va or not. Va loan da da.

65
00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:02.029
#### Participant 03: Okay. And this type of refinance requires an appraisal and credit qualifier. Alrighty.

66
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.249
#### Moderator: Sorry it's it's a little bug of the prototype you'll have to select select it again. Yeah, thanks.

67
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.980
#### Participant 03: Alright.

68
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:23.309
#### Participant 03: Have you ever had a Va backup loan? Yes, I had a loan in the past, and have or have one. Now that is correct.

69
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.820
#### Participant 03: Do you still own any properties? Yep, I do.

70
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:38.809

71
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.940
#### Moderator: We'll we'll pretend that for for these purposes this actually is.

72
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:43.289
#### Participant 03: Okay.

73
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.160
#### Moderator: Yeah.

74
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.619
#### Participant 03: Do you still own a property? I do.

75
00:06:54.090 --> 00:07:07.550
#### Participant 03: Are you applying for eligibility, restoration? Hmm, eeny meeny miny mo choices, I know.

76
00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.370
#### Participant 03: Let me see, I'm just gonna say, cash out refinance restoration.

77
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:22.640
#### Participant 03: And has the property been substantially damaged or destroyed? Nope.

78
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:33.559
#### Participant 03: alright, do you have another Va loan to add no property to own. Okay.

79
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:51.400
#### Participant 03: you would need to upload these documents. Copy of your discharge. Dd. 2, 14 evidence Va. Loan was paid in full, if applicable and document showing evidence. All right. So the type of Va Loan evidence. Okay? So I would need

80
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:55.639
#### Participant 03: a copy of the paid in full statement from the former lender

81
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:03.800
#### Participant 03: copy of the satisfaction and of mortgage from the clerk of court in the county where the house is located.

82
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.260
#### Participant 03: a copy of the HUD. One or closing disclosure settlement. Okay?

83
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.679
#### Participant 03: And then type of evidence of name change. I don't have a name change. So that would be fine.

84
00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:22.290
#### Moderator: Yeah, it's in the, in the real, in the real deal. Since you didn't

85
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:32.650
#### Moderator: select a name change in the beginning. This wouldn't it? Wouldn't the name change information wouldn't actually show up. But again, it's a limitation of the prototype.

86
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:33.400
#### Participant 03: No worries.

87
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:44.860
#### Participant 03: Alright. So the Dd. 2, 14 is uploaded. Let me see, Drake, let's see. Choose another folder. Don't have anything else. Let me see.

88
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:56.890
#### Participant 03: Continue, request a Va loan, CEO. Your information check that.

89
00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.000
#### Moderator: Oh, we did. We don't have the the expandable version in this prototype. So.

90
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.469
#### Moderator: But yeah, and you don't need to worry about the checkbox.

91
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.560
#### Participant 03: Alrighty and submit the application.

92
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:13.160
#### Participant 03: Bamses, that was pretty easy.

93
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.390
#### Moderator: Flying colors. I love it.

94
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.890
#### Participant 03: Yeah. That was, that was that was real easy.

95
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.290
#### Moderator: Yay love to hear it.

96
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.060
#### Moderator: Was there.

97
00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:31.909
#### Participant 03: It helps. It helps that. They give you the dropdown. So that way you can be able to check the options to see which one you actually want to pick

98
00:09:32.365 --> 00:09:46.190
#### Participant 03: especially if someone has already used the coe, because then you have an opportunity to see exactly what they're looking for. If you want to refinance for the cash out refinance, or if you just wanted to do the Earl.

99
00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:53.060
#### Participant 03: Or if you wanted to do a restoration, I think that one right there was. That's a game changer, because

100
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.639
#### Participant 03: it's hard to try to figure out exactly what

101
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:03.680
#### Participant 03: you need to do as far as it goes, for the restoration. I've I've done a lot of

102
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:28.550
#### Participant 03: perusing through the Va's website on numerous occasions to try to figure out exactly what I could do if I wanted to try to do a a restoration. So the ha! Having the option of being able to do a cash out refi restoration, or one time restoration. That that would be significantly, that would be significantly helpful.

103
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:38.879
#### Moderator: Awesome, awesome, awesome. Was there? Was there anything that was that sort of gave you pause, or or was was confusing in in any way or.

104
00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:59.910
#### Participant 03: No like. I said it was pretty straightforward, even if I had never used the coe before. Like, I said for me when I used it. I didn't actually go in to apply for it. It went through a different. It went through a 3rd party. That did the actual

105
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:12.169
#### Participant 03: request for it. So if I hadn't used it before, and I was trying to use it for the 1st time on my own. It made it a lot more user friendly to be able to know exactly

106
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:18.089
#### Participant 03: what I needed to do, what documents I needed to upload in order for me to

107
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:24.739
#### Participant 03: find out the one, the eligibility, 2, to be able to

108
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:33.239
#### Participant 03: apply for it, to get it. Get the application submitted. So it's definitely helpful.

109
00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:41.350
#### Moderator: Awesome. Love it all right. And I I always ask this. I mean you just you crushed that so usually the

110
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:55.820
#### Moderator: these take quite a bit longer, but I couldn't be happier. The question I ask at the end of any study is, if I gave you a magic wand, which means

111
00:11:55.940 --> 00:12:08.290
#### Moderator: reality like you don't have to worry about constraints, or whatever you know, whatever it's like, you wave this, and it's happened. If I gave you a magic wand. Is there anything you would change anything at all

112
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:12.250
#### Moderator: about this form or or this process?

113
00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:19.867
#### Participant 03: I wouldn't change anything. I think that once. Because I know this is the prototype, but once it get

114
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.468
#### Participant 03: If there's any other bugs that needed to be tweaked, the dropdown options for the

115
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:41.379
#### Participant 03: the area that it was requesting to verify if your information was update correct. Just so. The person that was using the

116
00:12:41.860 --> 00:13:08.149
#### Participant 03: system could try to make sure that if they didn't, you know, before they hit submit application that they didn't make any errors definitely. That's gonna be very helpful. Because sometimes we fat finger things. And we think that we get right. And just to be able to say, you know. Hey, let me look over this one more time to make sure that I'm doing this accurately, that I misspell my own name, because sometimes you get the.

117
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.170
#### Moderator: Right.

118
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.829
#### Participant 03: Like little things like that. So once that

119
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.950
#### Participant 03: it's worked out. Yeah, that part.

120
00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:29.529
#### Moderator: Here's a yeah. Here's a here's a peek. The way that the form is filled out is so dependent that this this is never accurate in the end, but which is why we don't show it. But this is

121
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:33.189
#### Moderator: this is what it looks like, and and just to give you a sense of it.

122
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:51.079
#### Participant 03: Yeah, that part. I think this will definitely be helpful. Because, like, I said, sometimes, it's just human error like we get to typing in stuff, and you're not paying attention, and you can misspell your name or type in the wrong digit for your social security number.

123
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.590
#### Moderator: Yep.

124
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:56.069
#### Participant 03: So this in itself, that part right there will really help.

125
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:56.700
#### Moderator: Awesome.

126
00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:01.310
#### Participant 03: If a person is actually like refinancing

127
00:14:01.993 --> 00:14:09.610
#### Participant 03: and want to reuse their cou, I think it would definitely be helpful as well when they choose.

128
00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.789
#### Participant 03: if they still have the property, but they no longer live at that address.

129
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:24.780
#### Participant 03: because, like in my my instance, for me, I live in Georgia, but I own a home in North Carolina. So if I wanted to refinance my home in North Carolina, my

130
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.009
#### Participant 03: be the same because I live at that property.

131
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:39.939
#### Moderator: Yep. So here in in this, in this one. Okay? So we say, we'll, we'll say, is your current mailing address, also a property financed with a Va. Home loan.

132
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:40.770
#### Participant 03: And if you.

133
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:41.390
#### Moderator: J.

134
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.320
#### Participant 03: No. Yeah.

135
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:52.519
#### Moderator: So it'll it gives you the ability to say, Okay, yes. Your mailing address is not the property, you know. Give us the the name of the property and.

136
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:53.250
#### Participant 03: Yes.

#### Moderator: It fills it out.

138
00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:04.110
#### Participant 03: And that would. And that's definitely gonna help because you do have a lot of service members, especially the ones that's on active duty.

139
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:09.520
#### Participant 03: May purchase a home where they're stationed, and then they get stationed somewhere else, and they might want to

140
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.460
#### Participant 03: financed a home

141
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:32.600
#### Participant 03: because they live in another state, and they're going to have to be able to update that information to let them know. Hey, I have a property in this state, but I now live here, and I want to be able to make sure that information is correct, because I know that what the Va. Does is if you're doing anything

142
00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:42.519
#### Participant 03: that requires them to make changes. They have to mail it to you, and it doesn't do you any good for them to mail it to the old, the address where.

143
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.149
#### Moderator: Where? Where? Maybe a renter gets it right.

144
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:51.078
#### Participant 03: Yeah, because then that doesn't help you at all, because you have no what's going on. You'd be like,

145
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.393
#### Participant 03: I thought I was supposed to get something. But yeah, so I think that definitely

146
00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:03.689
#### Participant 03: Other than that, I don't have any. I don't have any other feedback on it like I said. It's pretty straightforward.

147
00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:04.900
#### Moderator: Great.

148
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.909
#### Participant 03: It's easier, for

149
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:16.880
#### Participant 03: I would say it's probably more user friendly for people that's like 65 and below, because, you know, some people aren't as tech savvy? But

150
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:25.429
#### Participant 03: most people that's in their earl this this like hitting their seventies, they're not trying to refinance, anyway, because most of them probably already own their homes right.

151
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.500
#### Moderator: Right?

152
00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:31.880
#### Moderator: Yeah. The brass ring, baby home ownership.
