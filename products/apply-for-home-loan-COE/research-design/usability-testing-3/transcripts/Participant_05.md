#### Moderator: Yes.

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.350

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:01.679
#### Moderator: Awesome. Yay, okay, cool, cool. Good. Good to know. All right. I am going to hit the share button here, and I'm gonna share my screen

16
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.800
#### Moderator: and then give you remote control.

17
00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:09.770
#### Moderator: You should be able to in just a second here

18
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.229
#### Moderator: be able to scroll and click etc.

19
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.120
#### Moderator: on the prototype. If you could just confirm, you're able to.

20
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.019
#### Moderator: To drive, as it were, awesome, perfect.

21
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.850
#### Moderator: great. So yeah, just as you go through. This is the the intro page to the form

22
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.850
#### Moderator: But as you go through the form, if you could just kinda

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:54.889
#### Moderator: speak your thoughts out loud, or you know, like, if there's if you have questions just just ask and just kind of let us know your thoughts and ideas if you if you like something, if you don't like something, and just kind of just kind of narrate your your path through the form.

24
00:01:56.635 --> 00:02:07.899
#### Participant 05: I mean this. This, honestly, was probably one of the easiest things that I did when I did retire. They actually talked about it in the tap seminar

25
00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:19.240
#### Participant 05: and I actually did the paperwork then, even though I didn't need it at that time, and it was fairly easy to do

26
00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:28.909
#### Participant 05: I didn't have any issues with it at all, and I want to say it was about 4 years before I actually

27
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:39.319
#### Participant 05: purchased the home that I'm in now, and I didn't even have to redo the certificate of eligibility they use the one that I got

28
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.789
#### Participant 05: when I retired.

29
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.489
#### Moderator: Oh, fantastic. Yeah, it was a really simple process. And.

30
00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:50.839
#### Participant 05: I'm halfway blind, so I can't read quite everything. I did go.

31
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.040
#### Moderator: Oh, no worries.

32
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.640
#### Participant 05: Thank you very much.

33
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.360
#### Moderator: Yeah.

34
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.670
#### Moderator: Let's see here, there we go!

35
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.620
#### Participant 05: Yeah.

36
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.949
#### Moderator: Gonna say, oh, was it? Did you fill out the paper form or the

37
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.090
#### Participant 05: I did the paper.

38
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.679
#### Moderator: Okay, okay, Gotcha. So this is the digital version of that paper.

39
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.430
#### Participant 05: Okay.

40
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:32.819
#### Participant 05: I mean this, this is all, I think, pretty simple. The only challenge is

41
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:43.300
#### Participant 05: potentially could be for some of those veterans that are a little bit older that aren't as technologically proficient, or maybe don't have a scanner at their house.

42
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.959
#### Participant 05: Sure they could scan those documents in.

43
00:03:46.180 --> 00:04:06.150
#### Participant 05: But I think at this point you either know somebody that could help you, or you go to Staples, or someplace like that, and scan the documents in, and you can email it yourself. But, this is one of the very few in my experience, Va processes that has been very simple to do.

44
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.530
#### Moderator: Oh, good! I'm glad to hear it.

45
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.280
#### Participant 05: Yeah.

46
00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:29.029
#### Moderator: So yeah. So if you if you just as you go as you go through it, if you wanna if you you know, scroll through the it's it's the the page is a little longer than the.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.820
#### Participant 05: Okay, view options.

#### Moderator: Are you able to scroll or.

50
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.170
#### Participant 05: I'm trying to figure out how to scroll.

51
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.460
#### Moderator: Oh, I saw I saw something there.

52
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.830
#### Participant 05: Trying to make it bigger, so I can read everything, and then.

54
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.780

#### Moderator: There's a couple of switches I can.

#### Moderator: Let's see here, fit width.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:07:01.470
#### Participant 05: Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty straightforward process. Once you have all of your documentation. And hopefully, at this point, you know, purchasing a home. You already have that documentation ready, anyways.

353
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:43.999
#### Moderator: That's a really good question. I think it stays in there, but I don't know. For a fact.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:56.790

#### Moderator: Okay, okay?

426
00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:19.039
#### Moderator: All right. And I have kind of a silly question at the cause. We're we're at the the tail end here that I always ask.

427
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.500
#### Participant 05: Okay.

428
00:28:19.961 --> 00:28:24.110

430
00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:35.950
#### Moderator: interacting with the the Va. What would what would it be.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.129
#### Participant 05: Logging into va.gov.

432
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.019
#### Moderator: Okay. Tell me more.

433
00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:42.639
#### Participant 05: That is a pain.

434
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.630
#### Moderator: Okay. Well.

435
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:46.039
#### Participant 05: Because you have all of these different

436
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:57.069
#### Participant 05: ways to log in, and you have to have different passwords. And then it's different verifications. And then you could get emailed or it could get texted to you.

437
00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:12.290
#### Participant 05: And it it takes a while to get to log on. And it's a pain. It drives me nuts like I see an email. Oh, you have a message on my healthy vet, and I'm like, Do I really feel like going through all of that to log in today. No, I don't.

438
00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:13.380
#### Moderator: Oh!

439
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.470
#### Participant 05: So, yeah.

440
00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:19.359
#### Moderator: I will say this about that. You're you're not the first.st

441
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:19.710
#### Participant 05: Yeah.

442
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.720
#### Moderator: And and we are working on it.

443
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:41.042
Mike King: Trish, I feel your pain. So they they just deprecated the Mhv. Log on. And then I believe it's August. Don't quote me. It's either August or September. I believe that they are deprecating the Ds log on and

444
00:29:42.141 --> 00:29:46.818
Mike King: or I'm I may have that backwards, so don't quote me on that. But

445
00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.270
#### Participant 05: It's like the Ds log on, or id log on.

446
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:58.990
Mike King: Yep, yep. So currently the the 2 that we'll be left with are id me id dot me and login.gov.

447
00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:00.050
#### Participant 05: Okay.

448
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:24.860
Mike King: The one that I always use is id dot me I just I just find it cleaner and so I just use that with my, I have my email, my password saved on there. So I can just auto click it to log in. And then I just have it. Text me a pass code, and then I just enter that 6 digit passcode, and then I'm off to the races on va.gov.

449
00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:25.860
#### Participant 05: Yeah.

450
00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:27.320

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.230
#### Participant 05: I appreciate the security I do.

452
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.890
Mike King: Yeah.

453
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.160
#### Participant 05: It's just a pain.

454
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:51.231
Mike King: You would. So I prior to this, not to, you know, go down a rabbit hole. But prior to this I worked in like the security identity log on space with Va. And you would be surprised of how many veterans disability benefits get

455
00:30:51.620 --> 00:31:06.189
Mike King: like the id stolen right like the check. The checking account routing number gets the account number and routing number gets changed and the benefits go get stolen and go to another account, you would be surprised how much that happens.

456
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:07.290
#### Participant 05: That's horrible!

457
00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:08.797

458
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.290
#### Participant 05: Yeah, I definitely appreciate the security.

459
00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:22.549
Mike King: Yup, Yup, for sure. So yep, if I were you, I just I'd focus on Id, dot me and just the others, and and carry on. That's that's what I do, anyway.

460
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.609
