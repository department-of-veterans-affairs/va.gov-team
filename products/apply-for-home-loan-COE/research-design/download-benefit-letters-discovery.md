# Impact of COE on Download benefits letters feature
**VSA eBenefits team | November 2021**

### Background

Usability testing of the new Certificate of Eligibility (COE) feature/design included wayfinding . Most participants expected to find their COE for VA-backed home loans in the "Download VA benefit letters" feature. The documentation quadrant on the VA.gov home page has a direct link to that tool. The benefits letters feature is not in active development.

The feature currently has a series of accordions that contain download link for various VA-issued documents. There is a link to the COE feature on eBenefits below these accordions.

There may need to be a "Download your COE" accordion and link in-line with the other download-accordions.

### Users

Judging from the documents themselves, Download Benefits Letters users are primarily Veterans. Users must authenticate to view the download page.

### Flow
There is a direct link from the "Records" white quadrant on the VA.gov homepage. There is an intermediate landing page [(Download VA benefit letters)](https://staging.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/) providing info and instructions, and prompting users to sign-in. The next screen asks for an address correction/confirmation before allowing the user to continue to the downloadable documents.

**User flow:** Home >> Download VA benefit letters >> Sign-in >> VA letters and documents (address check) >> VA letters and documents

#### VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility references

There are several instances of "coupling" downloadable VA documents and the home loan COE:
- [VA records](https://www.va.gov/records/) hub page
- [Download VA benefit letters](https://www.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/) landing page
- [VA letters and documents]() tool page

Here are several pages referencing the COE process:
- [VA housing assistance](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/) hub page
- [Eligibility requirements for VA home loan programs](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/) content page
- [Buying a home with a VA-backed loan](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/home-buying-process/) content page
- [VA home loan programs for surviving spouses](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/surviving-spouse/) content page


### Functionality
On the Download Documents are a set of accordions containing links to the view and/or download the corresponding PDFs. There are also several links to other "document" resources.

Download accordions:
- Proof of Service Card
- Proof of Creditable Drug Coverage
- Proof of Minimum Essential Coverage
- Service Verification
- Civil Service Preference
- Benefits Summary and Service Verification (Both?)
- Benefit Summary

Links:
- Post-9/11 GI Bill Statement of Benefits
- Request for VA home loan Certificate of Eligibility (eBenefits)
- Request for DD 214 (eBenefits)

### Design considerations
Minimally, the COE link at the bottom of the VA letters and documents tool. If we choose to provide a path to a user's COE, we should consider a new accordion with additional COE content.
