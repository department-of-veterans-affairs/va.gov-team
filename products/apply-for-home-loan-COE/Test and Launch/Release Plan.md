# Release Plan: Certificate of Eligibility

---

## Step 1: Development

You'll need to create a feature toggle (or two) for any moderately or significantly changing feature. Follow the [best practices for creating feature toggles](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/feature-toggles).

List the features toggles here.

| Toggle name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| COE Content | Toggle designed to release the breadcrumb navigation leading to the introduction page. |
| COE App | Toggle designed to release the form to users incrementally. |

## Step 2: Validation

Since we use a [continuous delivery](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/deployment-process) model, once code is in the `main` branch, it will be deployed that day. 

Before enabling your feature toggle in production, you'll need to:

- [x] Follow [best practices for QA](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/qa-and-accessibility-testing).
- [x] Have your team perform as much validation in staging as possible. Validation may be challenging for some teams and systems due to downstream requirements, but the staging system should mimic the production system as much as possible.
- [x] Work any downstream or dependant systems proactively to ensure that the feature is ready for use once it hits production.
- [] Have a go/no go meeting with the team to ensure that the feature is ready for use and signed off by each discipline and your DEPO/OCTO contact. During this meeting, you'll need to:
  - [] review the plan with your DEPO/OCTO representative.
  - [] review the release plan with your team.

## Step 3: Staged production rollout

### Rollback process

Even though your feature has been tested and ready, production is still a different environment than staging. You'll need to create a rollback plan if things go wrong. Usually, this is as simple as a feature toggle flip. Be as specific as possible.

Rollback plan: if the functionality needs to be rolled back out of production, we will do the following:
- Turn on the feature toggle, disabling functionality of the form and status app.
- Reach out to the sitewide content team (Randi is a POC), and request that they disable the introduction page and navigation breadcrumbs leading to the form.
- Document issues in production to be resolved using the bug template in Zenhub.
- Schedule a "war room" session with squad 2 from Benefits Team 1, including the head engineer (Robin), backend engineer (Eugene), and product manager (Sade). 
- Confirm that logging and monitoring are in place to catc hthe issue should it occur again. 
- Conduct a post-mortem on the incident. 
- Schedule a go/no-go meeting prior to re-release with the PO (Matt Self), head engineer (Robin), backend engineer (Eugene), and product manager (Sade).

### Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

#### Planning

- Desired date range or test duration: [10/19/2022 - 11/01/2022]
- Desired number of users: [3-5]
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: [Internal recruit]
- How you'll conduct the testing: [Share the UAT testing instructions and ask users to complete each use case listed.]
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: [Using a feature toggle set at 0%, we will whitelist Veteran volunteers recruited to assist in submitting COE requests (this could include volunteers that are VA employees as well as non-VA employee Veterans).]

#### Results

- Number of users: [FILL_IN]
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: [FILL_IN]/[FILL_IN]
  - [FILL_IN] : list
  - [FILL_IN] : of

- Was any downstream service affected by the change?: yes/no, [FILL_IN]
- Types of errors logged: [FILL_IN]
- Any changes necessary based on the logs, feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? [PICK_ONE]: yes/no
- If yes, what: [FILL_IN] with ticket numbers

### Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

We recommend that the rollout plan has five stages, each increasing the number of Veterans. This plan is a strongly recommended guideline but should only be deviated for precise reasons.

#### Rollout Planning

- Desired date range: [11/02/2022-11/30/2022]
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: [Feature toggle].
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?
  - Reported contact center calls < 2 calls
  - Error rate < 5%
- Links to the dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: [Link to dashboards TBD]
- Who is monitoring the dashboard(s)?: [Sade Ragsdale]

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders?
1. Which assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
1. What technical tasks are needed to clean up (i.e., removal of feature toggles)?
