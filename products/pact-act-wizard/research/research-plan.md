# Research Plan for Usability Testing, PACT Act Wizard, September 2023

## Background
The [PACT Act of 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3967/text) is intended to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for Veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during military service. The law itself is not easy for a Veteran to read and understand whether or not it directly affects them and their benefits. VA.gov currently offers an easy-to-read static page with information on how the PACT Act applies to Veterans and survivors. To complement this page, we’re designing an interactive question-and-answer flow to help Veterans understand how the PACT Act may apply to them.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
1. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (if Veterans move from this tool to online application)
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to find out whether we’ve met these goals: 

- The **questions drafted for the PACT Act Wizard are clear and easy** enough for Veterans (or family members seeking information on behalf of a Veteran) to understand and confidently answer. 

- Veterans (or family members seeking information on behalf of a Veteran) can **understand from the results if they might be eligible** for disability or health care based on the PACT Act. 

- Veterans (or family members seeking information on behalf of a Veteran) can **understand from the results how to apply for benefits** related to the PACT Act based on their situation. 



### Outcome
Learnings will help refine questions and the presentation of results in the wizard.

### Research questions
1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on **individual questions**? 
1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on the **entire set of questions**?
    - Total number of questions 
    - Similar structure of the questions

1. Do Veterans (and others) **know enough about their military service to answer the questions**? If not, what do they need to answer them?

1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on the **results**?
     - Date/range
     - "Presumptive conditions"
     - Next steps
     

1. If the tool says that they're eligible, what do they say they would **do next**?


### Hypotheses
1. Veterans (and others) will find the questions to be clear and easy to understand and answer.
2. Veterans (and others) will find the number and content of the questions to be relevant to their understanding of the PACT Act and how it applies to them (or the Veteran). 

1. Veterans (and others) won't find the number and content of the questions to be overly burdensome. 

1. The results are simple enough for Veterans (and others) to understand and are not misleading. 

1. Veterans (and others) will understand what "presumptive conditions" mean after reading the plain language description in the results flow. 

## Method	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability testing** to observe research participants using a working prototype that presents the questions and results screens in the PACT Act Wizard. The prototype is not a high-fidelity design prototype but instead an **online survey (in Survey Monkey) that presents questions** and branches appropriately to subsequent questions and relevant results screens. In this way, we’re **testing the content of the PACT Act Wizard**—the text and flow of the questions and the logical branching—but not the UI design.   

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**.

## Timeline

### Prepare
Before recruitment starts, I would like to **request a kickoff call with Perigean** to align on recruitment criteria and terminology for screener questions in the survey and emails that will be sent to Veterans. I would also like to discuss the relative priorities of recruitment criteria (e.g., it’s more important to recruit at least 4 people who are 55 years or older than it is to recruit 7 people who will join from their smartphone), and how the criteria are prioritized when recruiting replacements for participants who cancel in advance. 

Amanda and Cindy are available for a kickoff call during any of these times (please also invite Wes in case he can make it): 
- **Thu Sept 21** 12 pm - 3 pm ET
- **Fri Sept 22**  12 pm - 5 pm ET

Our email addresses are cindy.merrill@adhocteam.us, amanda.klausmeier@va.gov, and wesley.rowe@agile6.com

**Prior to the kickoff call, I would like a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey** for this study so we can review it beforehand.

I have scheduled the following two **pilot tests**:
- Pilot 1: **Sept 27 TBD ET** with TBD (tbd@adhocteam.us)
- Pilot 2: **Sept 28 TBD ET** with TBD (tbd@adhocteam.us)

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: **Oct 2 – Oct 9, 2023** 

We would like to request that **Perigean calls each participant** to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. And please include the session time **in each participant's own time zone** (from a screener question).

### Length of sessions
