This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the *content* of the PACT Act Wizard questions and results**.

## Participants
We talked to **9 Veterans**, one of whom was also a Veteran's family member (spouse). 
- *Most (8 of 9) had NOT applied for VA benefits under the PACT Act*. The one who did had applied in the previous week.
- 4 served in *1989 or earlier*, 2 served in *1990 or later*, and 3 served *during both* periods of time.
- *Most (8 of 9) used a computer* during the session; only 1 used a smartphone.


## Preliminary Findings
### Usability Successes
1. **Most participants were able to answer most of the wizard questions easily.**
1. **No comments about too many questions**. Participants were presented with anywhere from 2-10 questions, which varied based on their responses and the branching logic.
1. All participants **understood *presumptive conditions***, but not from the PACT Act Wizard. Most said that they already knew from talking to other Veterans or looking into the PACT Act already.
1. Participants generally **understood the results screens** and figured out what  they should do next.

### Usability Issues
5. Three participants had **difficulty answering the service years question** because they found the options confusing.
1. Two participants brought up (unprompted) that they **didn't know what a "C-123 plane" was**, which was mentioned in one of the Agent Orange questions. Two other participants said, *"If it applied to you, you would know" (p9).*
1. Some participants had **beliefs about whether they were eligible for benefits under the PACT Act** before trying the PACT Act Wizard, and some of these beliefs were *incorrect* and not addressed by any content in the wizard.
1. Three participants were **confused by the jump links** at the top of the results page on Staging because they interpreted them as CTA's (i.e., *file a disability claim* or *apply for health care* right now).

## Next Steps
- Synthesize data
- Write research report
