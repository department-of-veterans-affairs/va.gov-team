## Intro - 5 minutes 
***(At first ONLY MODERATOR & PARTICIPANT, *not* notetaker)***

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

*(Brief conversation)*

I work on making technology easier for Veterans to use in order to get information and benefits from the VA. 

What I *hope to do today* is to get your feedback on something new that we're working on. 

What *I don't want to do* is add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits from the VA. We may look at things that have caused you frustration, and I want you to know up front that I cannot make that better for you right now. I do not have access to your records, nor do I have any contact with claims reviewers. But I'd like to understand your frustrations because they can help me advocate for improvements to the process in the future.

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker.
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks using a website that I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  
  - Last thing: One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image and name. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA online resources. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or won't do this, but I'd like to ask ahead of time. I'll also confirm at the end of this session that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed. 
  - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session** to help our partners understand Veterans' experiences?
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Select Record, then Record to the cloud.*

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session?

*In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save. (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

~~Click Live Transcript and **Enable**, or **Show Captions**~~
~~*Click **Live Transcript > View Full Transcript***~~

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: 
  - Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
  - Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, as long as we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways)* or Share Screen *(on computer, button is green).*
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says **Share**. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control--doesn't work w/iPhones]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## Protocol for Recognizing & Handling Trauma-Triggering
*Remember*: Getting to all the questions on your script isn’t as important as the Veteran feeling heard. Prioritize the participant over the research.
### OBSERVE the participant
*Be PRESENT with the participant. Notice their body language, tone of voice, and the environment* 

*SENSE discomfort, anxiety, nervousness, anger, teary/crying, shakiness, nervousness. Some signs may include:*
- *Prolonged silences*
- *Shifts in tone or attitude or interactivity*
- *New background noises*
- *Staring into space* 

### If notice a change, SAY one of these:
  - Sometimes talking about these types of experiences can be difficult. Do you think you would be comfortable telling me if it starts to affect you negatively?
  - This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?
  - Would you like me to stop recording?
  - I sense that this may be upsetting. We value what you’re sharing with us, but we don’t have to go there if you don't want to.
  - Do you want to just sit here quietly for a few minutes?
  - Would you like to pause, or are you OK with continuing?
  - Is this not a good time for this session?

### If resume after a break
I'm interested to hear more about...Are you up for continuing with that, or would you prefer to move on to the next topic?

### Handling other specific situations
- *If p isn't feeling well in the moment*
  - I'm sorry to hear that you're (not feeling well--repeat their words). Do you feel up for continuing? You will be compensated even if we stop early. 
    - *(If they want to keep going)* Please let me know if you change your mind.
- *If p describes something that seems unfair*
  - I hear you saying that this is unfair. It sounds incredibly frustrating. I'm sorry to hear that you've been going through this.
- *If MST (military sexual trauma) comes up*
  - I am so sorry that happened to you. I hear you, and I'm grateful you felt safe sharing this with me.

### If you notice something and want to make sure they know how to get mental health help
I want to remind you that VA can help connect you to mental health services--even if you're not enrolled in VA health care. To access services right away, call or go to any VA medical center at any time 24/7 or any Vet Center during clinic hours. You can also call 877-222-8387, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. That's 877-222-8387.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you're worried about their situation...
I realize I'm worried for you being in this situation. I don't have concrete help I can offer, but I do have a hotline number. Before we continue, would you like me to give you the number?
- If you need to talk to someone right away, you can contact the Veterans Crisis Line via phone, text, or chat anytime day or night. You can call 988 or text 838255. It's confidential and available 24 by 7.
- You could also call the Benefits Hotline at 800-827-1000.

### If I feel teary or emotional
*Turn off my camera and/or say,* I need to step away for a moment.

### When participant is fine to continue, but you're not sure you can
I hear that you're good to continue. Before we do, I realize that I need a minute--I'm going to go off video, mute myself, and get a glass of water. Is that OK with you? I'll be back in X minutes.

*(If I'm still not OK to continue)* After taking a breather, I realize I'm not able to continue. You didn't do anything wrong, and you will get paid for the full time. I appreciate your time and your willingness to share your experience.

### When a participant decides to stop the session
I don't know if you'd want to call, but the Veterans Crisis Line number is 988. It's confidential and available 24 by 7.

Thank you for your time in having this call. I honor your decision to stop and wish you well. *[Try to maintain a CALM tone]*

### Screen sharing
I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me the same thing you see on your own screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.

Could you please select "Continue"?

  
### Task 5: [Results screen--You may be eligible]
*(If participant notices that locations don't match their answers to the questions asked...)* This is a sample page that doesn't correspond to your answers to the questions. I'd like you to pretend that you served in the Middle East.

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA online resources. 
- **Is it OK if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners?** *(yes / no)*
- *(If participant says yes:)* Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
