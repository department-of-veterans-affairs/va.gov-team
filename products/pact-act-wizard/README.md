## Overview
Provide a (relatively) easy way for a Veteran or Veteran's representative (family member, caregiver, other) to understand whether the PACT Act may apply to them, affect their benefit eligibility, etc. 

## Problem Statement
The [PACT Act of 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3967/text) is intended to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for Veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during military service. The law itself is not easy for a Veteran to read and understand whether or not it directly affects them and their benefits.

How might we help Veterans or Veterans' representatives (family member, caregiver, other) easily understand if the PACT Act applies to them?

In the future, we intend to explore the potential of further expanding this tool (or one like it) to survivors and to more toxic exposures not covered by the PACT Act.

## Desired User Outcomes

- As a Veteran, I want to know whether the PACT Act changes apply to me and affect my VA benefits so that, if appropriate, I can apply to receive these increased or new benefits for which I may now be eligible.


## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veteran frustration or confusion about the PACT act

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Demonstrate increased PACT Act outreach to Congress
- Increase the number of successful disability claims and health care applications
- Increase trust among Veterans and family members by increasing eligibility awareness and making it as easy as possible for Veterans to know if they should file claims
- Reduce need for contact center or other representatives to navigate basic eligibility questions with Veterans

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Veteran frustration

## Measuring Success

We want to funnel folks through the wizard into the "Apply" funnel.
We want a high level of customer satisfaction to indicate that the wizard was relatively easy to understand and complete.
We want increased traffic into the "Apply" process to result in more completed applications, rather than an increase in abandonment.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- The MVP will focus on the dates and time periods of a Veteran's service and how they may relate to the PACT Act
- We are excluding questions about health conditions associated with specific service locations/times from the MVP due to complexity
- We assume that it is possible to create a sufficient, yet not overbearing amount of content that will allow Veterans to successfully understand how to answer each question. (Riskiest, mitigated through research focused on validating the content itself. In particular, ensuring we can test with assistive devices)

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
We are going to build a wizard (based on the Subtask pattern) that focuses on PACT Act places of service.

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
  - The question/response method seems to be the most effective method thus far for helping Veterans to easily understand eligibility.

- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
  - We're excluding a lot of other health-condition-related qualification information and focusing only on Toxic Exposures and service history.
  - This will also be an unauthenticated experience for MVP, therefore we won't have access to any information the Veteran may have already provided to VA in some way.

- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
  - The volume of content/number of screens is an area that we are watching due to cognitive load, time to completion, abandonment rate risk.

### How we are approaching the solution
- [PACT Act wizard (content and branching) MURAL version v.0](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1686687282873?sender=uf8ddb00f0c9a241ee4573555&key=51afbaca-4131-4828-a3c3-eced5a256061)
- [PACT Act Wizard branching logic / flow](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1692989444688/0044b9825c82d8d23920601f68c41a61d047d681?sender=u0b235d03cbd64f7f93673243)
- [PACT Act and the world of toxic exposure content MURAL](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1664903854802/3876e4204edea5dc0e9b52fbca47e9162f752dad): This is a MURAL that helps to visualize all of the toxic exposure content that's out there, how we want to build connections between this content, and how we can use each entry point strategically to drive to the main goal of file a claim/apply for health care.
