[h1] Learn how the PACT Act may affect you
The PACT Act is a new law that expands VA benefits and health care benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances. And we want to make sure you and your family get the benefits you’ve earned and deserve. 

Answer a brief series of questions about when and where you served.

We’ll tell you what the PACT Act may mean for your VA benefits—and what to do next.

###### R1.1. Results screen 1: Eligibility

[h1] You may be eligible for VA benefits

Based on where you told us you served, we think you may have had exposure to a toxic substance. We call this a “presumption of exposure.” 

Here's the presumptive exposure location we think may apply to you:

•	[Dynamic content based on responses. Refer to highlighted section below for dynamic content]

We automatically assume (or “presume”) that these exposures cause certain health conditions. We call these “presumptive conditions.”
		
If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your service caused the condition to get VA disability compensation. You only need to meet the service requirements for presumption.  

You may also be eligible for VA health care.
