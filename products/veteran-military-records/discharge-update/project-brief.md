# Discovery Project Brief & Planning Template

## PROJECT BRIEF

**Project Name** - Discharge Wizard  

**Problem Statement / How Might We statements**

How can Veterans find helpful, user-friendly, customized information on upgrading their discharge status?

How might we point Veterans in the right direction when trying to update their discharge status? 

**What problem are we trying to solve?**

There are Veterans who have incorrectly or unfairly received a less than honorable discharge status and many are currently seeking to have them upgraded.  This process is confusing and there is not a central location where a Veteran can look to get help.

## DISCOVERY PLANNING

**Project Details**

**What do we know?**

We have a starting point for the content, we know the logic and we have a rough mockup. 
We know this content doesn't live concisely in one place. 
We know many Veterans could benefit from getting their status upgraded and that many were given an unfair status. 

Documents that outline what we already know: 
https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-update/readme.md
 

**What don't we know?**

- If Veterans will find it useful 
- If our language is straightforward 

**Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?**

- Do Veterans find the wizard useful? 
- Is the content clear and easy to understand? 
- Where is the best place for this wizard to live on Vets.gov? 

**How are we going to find out answers?**

- Veteran research
- Contact center meeting
- DOD stakeholders
- VA stakeholders
- VSO outreach
- Non-profit outreach 
- Google/FB/Veteran blogs
- First click optimal workshop research

**What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem?**

- Veterans who were less than honorably discharged
- Veterans who have applied before to upgrade their discharge status and were not able to get it upgraded
- Veterans who are looking for information about how to upgrade their discharge status
- VSOs or other groups that work with Veterans to upgrade their status

**Who do we need to talk to?**

- Veterans
- Contact center staff
- DOD stakeholders
- VA stakeholders
- VSOs
- Non-profits

**What secondary research should we do?**

- Facebook
- blogs
- information already published on interwebs 

**Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?**

Wizard will only point user to the correct DOD form.  Not in scope is anything outside of pointing to a paper form. 

**Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?**

- Content is super complicated and it is tricky how to talk about it in both plain language and in a way that satisfies how VA/DOD wants us to talk about it. 

- Involves both DOD and VA.  

## Timeline
