### Notes
- Since this is such a significant change, Cassandra may need some FPO content so she can better determine how to lay out the page.
- It is just the page that provides instructions to people who were in the Air Force and are currently being directed to download and fill out DD149.
- We now will link to the Air Force portal which has its own questionnaire and asks some of the same questions as the wizard.
- Beth will try to get Cassandra the final words today or tomorrow.

### Notes

- New portal allows them to upload directly to an Azure data store

- Extensive 

- Take the incoming PDF and parses out the information and allows that to be

- They are still providing the same link to the DD 149 

- A lot of places are still linking to the 2010 version vs. the 2019 version

- One of the reasons they want them to link to their website and only their website, they can ensure they are linking to the newest for that is considered valid. 

Summary - instead of having the PDF available at VA.gov, the ask is that just create a link to the portal (not really an eApplication) 

What is the Portal called? "To submit your application, go to AFRBA Portal" (Air Force Review Board Agency)

Can Alex share another partner link that is using this? 

What % of people use various browser? Alex doesn't have that information.

Sounds like we no longer need a link or the instructional text.  

On the cert thing, we still don't feel comfortable until the cert thing is resolved.

They are planning to do a bit more to continue to route people to this direction.  Substantially reduces processes.
