## User Problem Statement
Information on how to upgrade a discharge status for eligible Veterans is not currently provided in its entirety on any government page, and is not provided in a user-friendly format anywhere on the internet.


## Solution Narrative
Page delivers customized content based on reason Veteran wants to upgrade discharge, date of discharge, branch of service, etc., which is collected via a short wizard (4-6 questions). No PII collected; no data stored; no backend. The wizard would be a series of questions that would conditionally show content (e.g., recommended forms/steps for updating discharge records, caveats, advice, background information) to the Veteran based on relevance.  Page also includes a few paragraphs of accordion content. 

## Current Status
- Current working doc on the content is [here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Records/Discharge%20Update/dw_content.md)
