# Discharge Upgrade Wizard Product Outline 


## Overview
The Discharge Upgrade Wizard provides information and guidance to discharged service members who want to request a upgrade to their discharge status. 

## Problem Statement
Some service members who received a less-than-honorable discharge in the past were not eligible to receive some Veteran benefits.  With the passage of the 2017 Fairness for Veterans Act, all branches of the military now consider them to have a strong case for a discharge upgrade if they can show their discharge was connected to:
 - Mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
- Sexual assault or harassment during military service (at VA, we refer to this as military sexual trauma or MST)
- Sexual orientation (including under the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy)
 
## Desired User Outcomes
- A user who would like to know how to request a discharge upgrade is able to determine where their request should be directed, and the information required to complete a request.
- If their discharge upgrade request is approved, they will be eligible for the VA benefits earned during their period of service.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users decline to answer the questions because they are afraid their personal information is being stored
- Users are given the impression that a discharge upgrade request is guaranteed to be approved
- Users are not provided with sufficient information after answering questions in the wizard

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Give Veterans the self-service tools and information needed to request a discharge upgrade
- Comply with the 2017 Fairness for Veterans Act

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Users send the wrong documents
- Users send documents to the wrong review board

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*

## Go-to-market Strategy
- Key words and meta data on the content page will allow search engines to index it so that service members can find it through organic search
- VA.gov global search will also leverage key words to help users find the tool
- "Best bets" within global search will also point users to this tool when they search for specific words.
- Campaign landing pages may occassionally be used to drive traffic to this tool.  One such example is the [landing page launched for Pride Month 2021](https://www.va.gov/initiatives/recognizing-lgbtq-veterans-during-pride-month/).
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

## User Problem Statement
Information on how to upgrade a discharge status for eligible Veterans is not currently provided in its entirety on any government page, and is not provided in a user-friendly format anywhere on the internet.

Initial GitHub Issue: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/1941

## Solution Narrative
Page delivers customized content based on reason Veteran wants to upgrade discharge, date of discharge, branch of service, etc., which is collected via a short wizard (4-6 questions). No PII collected; no data stored; no backend. The wizard would be a series of questions that would conditionally show content (e.g., recommended forms/steps for updating discharge records, caveats, advice, background information) to the Veteran based on relevance.  Page also includes a few paragraphs of accordion content. 

## Current Status
- Current working doc on the content is [here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-update/dw-content.md)
