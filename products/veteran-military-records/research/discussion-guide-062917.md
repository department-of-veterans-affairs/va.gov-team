## Test Objectives

Determine usability problem areas within the download letters user interface. Potential problem areas: 

- Navigation: Is it clear how to locate key functions, excessive keystrokes to complete a function, failure to follow screenflow. 

- Presentation: Is it clear how to locate and properly act upon desired information in screens. Are the labels clear? Is the language right?

- Control usage: Are the text fields and buttons used properly?

## Methodology

The unicorns team will conduct one-on-one interviews with veterans. First the following introduction will be shared.

### Intro

Thank you for agreeing to participate in this user testing session. We value your feedback and sessions like these help inform vets.gov, making it a great experience for you. 

The vets.gov team has been working on a new feature thatâ€™ll help veterans get the information they need to prove eligibility or benefit status. For example, you can get proof of service or a benefit verification letter. 

Before we get started, I have a couple of questions for you. 

- Have you recently been asked to provide documentation to support a benefit claim or application? If yes, how did you get the documentation?

- Have you recently used the eBenefits site? Why did you use it?


### Task 1: Describe how you would use this page.

Script: Take a second to look at this page. Talk out loud. Let us know what you are looking at and what it means to you. You can also click around on the page.  

- What do you think this page is for? 
- What would you do first on this page?

_Take notes on these areas_

- Do users find anything about the language confusing? 
- Did the user click on anything?

### Task 2: Find a document with service history. 

Script: Now, imagine you needed a document that shows your service history so that you could enroll in a benefit program. Tell me how you would get that document. 

_Take notes on these areas_

- What did the person click on first? What did they click on next?
- What questions did the person have about the address?
- Was it clear what would happen if the address was not correct?


### Task 3: Find a document to verify you have health coverage.

Script: The Affordable Care Act now requires you prove you have health coverage. Tell me how you would get a document that proves you have health coverage. 

_Questions_ 

- Does anything standout or seem confusing? 

_Take notes on these areas_

- What did the person click on first? What did they click on next?


### Task 4: Open Benefit Summary.

_User may have already covered some of this section. Skip if you feel you've tested the selection of options thoroughly_

Script: Now, I want you to select the Benefit Summary letter. Take a second to look at this section. Again, talk out loud. Let us know what you are looking at and what it means to you. 

_Questions_ 

- Tell me how you would use this section.

_Take notes on these areas_

- Is the hierarchy right in this section?
- Is it clear why they would select options or what the options section purpose is?
- Do they try to click anything before getting to download letter?
- How do they expect the letter to download?

### Task 5: Select Options, Download the Benefits Letter.

_Probe more if necessary._ 

Script: Show me how you would create a benefit summary letter that excluded information about compensation you are receiving.

_Questions_ 

- Think back to how you've used documents in the past. If you can, describe to me a situation in which chosing what information you put on a letter would of been useful.

- What is missing from this section?

_Take notes on these areas_

- Is the hierarchy right in this section?
- Is it clear why they would select options or what the options section purpose is?
- Do they try to click anything before getting to download letter?
- How do they expect the letter to download?
