# Discharge Upgrade Wizard 2021 Content Updates - Meetings and Decisions

## 2021-06-01 Meeting with Margarete Ashmore and John Santos
- John Hashimoto, PO
- Marci McGuire, PM
- Margarete Ashmore
- John Santos

### Notes
- Congratulations to John Santos on the Pride landing page launch
- We are referencing the Word document that Mararete sent last week (about 8 changes listed)
- I asked about the reference to the Kurto memo at the very end - Margarete thinks we already have this on the site
- In talking to the board, they didn't coordinate that, a lot of was along the lines of managing expectations. 
- John mentioned that we would have one of our content experts review/make suggestions that we would then talk with Margarete about
- John Santos said that the major thing is that we make it as easy to read as possible (legalese to plain English)
- If we have a local contact at the VA that we can reach out to, that would be perfect.
- This is ultimately a DoD process.
- Reality is that transgender is not going to be given liberal consideration unless they have another diagnosis that falls under the liberal consideration
- Is there a timeframe after service 
- PTSD does not have to be related to combat
- Maybe we can clarify that bit.  Especially for trans folks may be considering upgrading through that.  Maybe PTSD due to military experience, and then it all becomes related to each other
- Maybe we can clarify that the TBI and PTSD does not have to be combat-related
- In general if someone is discharged due to a mental health condition, that is an honorable
- John Santos is looking at the Discharge Upgrade FAQs - can we clarify a Discharge Process Review?  That is a VA process.  We can look back and see where that text came from.
- We'll still have the Air Force path of the wizard.  I pointed out that the Air Force review board is going to take them through another questionnaire.  John Santos said maybe we explain that "hey, you may be asked some of these questions again.  Please be patient."
- We can also clarify in the wizard that this is NOT a VA process; it's a DoD process.
- Does DoD have any type of "customer care"?  Per Margarete, they don't.  The board members do something else as a job, they do board review ad-hoc almost like a town council.
- Margarete is our point of contact, but not to publish on the website.

### Decisions
- Wizard still plays an important role? 
- Margarete thinks that is true.
- John also thinks this is true.

### Action Items
- John Santos is looking at the Discharge Upgrade FAQs - can we clarify a Discharge Process Review?  That is a VA process.  We can look back and see where that text came from.
- John S and Kayla should review the FAQs and let us know of changes that we needed
- John S and Margarete should go offline and discuss any other changes that are needed
- John Santos and Kayla will go through the Wizard page by page and make it more VA centric and will also incorporate the informatino that Margarete provided, but not ncessarily hold their hand through a process that we can't control.
- We should also ask the DoD to review the verbiage and determine which parts are best left for DoD.
- **Next Steps** John/Kayla --> John/Margarete/DoD Review --> Final list of edits --> Content will review --> May be another review.
- John Santos would like some contact information so that he can reach out with any questions.

## 2021-05-25 Meeting with Beth Potts

### Attendees
- Beth Potts, PO
- Marci McGuire, PM
- Danielle Thierry
- John Hashimoto

### Notes
- Looked at the Discharge Upgrade Wizard
- Each branch has two places you can land on
- We looked at the Air Force page for DD 149
- DoD wants any instructions provided should be provided via the portal
- Beth looked at the portal link
- Danielle and John had an idea - if you go to the Discharge Upgrade landing page on VA.gov - the CLP doesn't allow for 5 different links to 5 different 
- We eliminate the wizard, and we take them to the portals. 
- Instead of the button, we'd have Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard links
- The CLP doesn't lend itself to five equally important links.
- I agree, but think we should mock something up and run it by Kayla and Margarete.
- I'll create a clean content ticket with the links that Margarete provided.
- DECISION: We're going to leave the PDF links as-is (no download instructions for now)
- DECISION: We're going to update the wizard with the new addresses that Margarete sent, but we are NOT going to add portal links since AF still has a cert issue

## 2021-05-21 meeting regarding content updates

### Attendees
- John Hashimoto, PO
- Marci McGuire, PM
- Zach Morel, FE Engineer
- Margarete Ashmore, CIV OSD OUSD P-R (USA) (pronounced Margaret)

### Notes
- Go-live for the Campaign Landing Page (CLP) is June 1.
- John gave some background - working with Kayla Williams on Discharge Upgrade Campaign Landing Page.  Learned from Kayla that some updates may be needed simply because it hasn't been freshened up in a while.  Air Force has its own portal
- How many updates are needed? Some aren't a big deal
   - DD Form 149 is not the right 149; a new one was issued a few years ago
   - A couple broken links
   - A couple of mailing addresses are incorrect
   - Mostly low-hanging fruit
- All the web sites for the services and the Coast Guard are updated already.  It may be less of a list to just point the Campaign Landing Pages to the seperate portals.
- In a little while, there will be a Discharge Appeal board
- Is the wizard still needed? 
- Landing page would have links to the Coast Guard, Landing Page, etc would be better than the wizard?  Margarete thinks it will be.  However, the Air Force is the best.  Navy is getting ready to go to a Portal.  Army's has the info, but doesn't look pretty.
- Marci agrees that given the timeline, pointing the CLP to the respective portals make sense, but not sure what we do in the case of a portal that is not ready.  There is also the question of the certificate issue the Air Force has.
- For Air Force, the PDF we were linking to
- Kayla said that for the CLP, we'd point to the various branches/services.  We just want to be sure we're sending them to an actual page that will render.  If Margarete can send us links for the CLPs, we can vet those from outside the VA/MIL networks.
- If we can also get the new DD 149 link, any corrections, updates, we'll take a look.  We haven't made a definitive decision. 
- Are we in effect no longer going to send people to our wizard, but rather send them to the respective portals.
- Margarete can talk to the board's people and they can connect her to whoever is appropriate.
- Margarete also stated that, having an 80 year old father, totally online is not going to work for everyone.  The old-fashioned mailing it in would also be good.
- Short-term we may fix things, then point everyone from the landing page.
- Next would be the long term-strategy.  Retire the wizard? A hybrid/transitional strategy. 
- Most important is for us to get corrections done. 
- Wizard questions is a branch/tree structure.  We have good documentation from the team that built it from DOD.  If some of the wizard logic is off, then that is where the real work is.  Margarete when through it and got a few things, but she is also talking with the board to get some other feedback.  One thing that is out of date is the really what they've done with the personal appearance. Now it's virtual and there is no travel. There is some wording that she wants to run by the board to make sure they all agree.  For the Discharge Review Board - wording also needs to be updated related to intimate partner violence. 
- Where things are changing here and there, it's hard to keep a wizard updated. Congress was having yearly changes. Those changes are nefarious; don't all happen the same day/month/year.
- Plus would be taking some of that off the VA and working out the kinks.  The VA becomes the hybrid because
- I mentioned that there is no choice for 1992 itself. 
- Within the past 15 years is one reveiew.  
- We will start working on corrections over the next week. 
- They are also starting to go through the forms themselves.  Since they are collecting a lot of PII, they have to go through OMB for updates.  Both expire in 2022.  There will probably be new ones in 2022/2023.
- Google Analytics for last 30 days:

## 2021-05-20 Meeting with Kayla Williams regarding content updates

### Attendees
- John Hashimoto
- Marci McGuire
- Kayla Williams

### Pre-Meeting Notes
- Bug I observed - the drop-down does not have 1992 as an option. Pre-1992 is there, but not 1992 itself.
- How it works - different sections of content are shown based on the user's answers.
- Content logic documented at https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-upgrade-wizard/dw-content.md
- Mapping out logic in Mural: https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1621532440874/8a3ee02c63bf5216b24fb01025e1e109b43d5407

### Meeting Notes
- One thing Kayla heard from DOD - it may be easier to just create links to each of their portals
- Introductions
- John gave some quick background on the tool
- Kayla currently doesn't have much more than she sent John earlier
- Before they launch a campaign to drive more people to it, they realized that the content was outdated
- We may need to change the content to point people to their portals
- John advised that Kayla could put us in touch with the person she's been in contact with
- Do we elimate the instructions, PDFs? We'll find out from DOD and walk through that with this person
- At this point, the tool may be superflous to what the agencies are doing now
- If we can't fix the current upgrade page by June 1, should we do something else? Send them to the landing page with "Click here to explore the process..."
