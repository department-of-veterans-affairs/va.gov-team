## Potential Changes in Content

- Known Issues at Launch:
    - Identify locations where we can clarify that Coast Guard does not fall under DoD
    - Add links to 508-compliant versions of policy documents
    - Identify better link to VSO and lawyer search tools (currently linking only to VSO search, need to confirm that lawyers who list under VA claims and appeals also have expertise in the area of discharge upgrades) 
    - Develop and launch marketing plan

- Potential Changes:
    - Any policy changes from DoD or Coast Guard
    - Forthcoming DoD guidance on clemency
    - Revised DoD application forms
    - Identify additional locations to link tool

## Process for Changing Content
- For immediate changes, stakeholders can submit requests via the stakeholder feedback form that gets sent to the Vets.gov content team: https://form.jotform.us/63385439158163
- Quarterly, the Vets.gov managing editor (Beth Potts) will reach out to Col. Yager, or his successor to review content and make edits if there have been policy changes.
- As we get more Veteran feedback on the tool, the Vets.gov team may make minor changes or edits. When this happens, the managing editor will notify Col. Yager as a courtesy.
- If external members (outside VA or DoD) want changes made, they should contact feedback@va.gov with their suggestions.
