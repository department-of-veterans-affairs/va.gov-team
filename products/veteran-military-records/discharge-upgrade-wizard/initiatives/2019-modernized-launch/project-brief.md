# Discovery Project Brief & Planning Template

## PROJECT BRIEF

**Project Name** - Discharge Wizard  

**Problem Statement / How Might We statements**

How can Veterans find helpful, user-friendly, customized information on upgrading their discharge status?

How might we point Veterans in the right direction when trying to update their discharge status? 

**What problem are we trying to solve?**

There are Veterans who have incorrectly or unfairly received a less than honorable discharge status and many are currently seeking to have them upgraded.  This process is confusing and there is not a central location where a Veteran can look to get help.  

**What Sprint Teams Are Associated with this Discovery?**

## DISCOVERY PLANNING

**Project Details**

**What do we know?**

We have a starting point for the content, we know the logic and we have a rough mockup. 
We know this content doesn't live concisely in one place. 
We know many Veterans could benefit from getting their status upgraded and that many were given an unfair status. 

Documents that outline what we already know: 
https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-upgrade-wizard/Product-Outline.md
 

**What don't we know?**

- If Veterans will find it useful 
- If our language is straightforward 

**Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?**

- Do Veterans find the wizard useful? 
- Is the content clear and easy to understand? 
- Where is the best place for this wizard to live on Vets.gov? 

**How are we going to find out answers?**

- Veteran research
- Contact center meeting
- DOD stakeholders
- VA stakeholders
- VSO outreach
- Non-profit outreach 
- Google/FB/Veteran blogs
- First click optimal workshop research

**What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem?**

- Veterans who were less than honorably discharged
- Veterans who have applied before to upgrade their discharge status and were not able to get it upgraded
- Veterans who are looking for information about how to upgrade their discharge status
- VSOs or other groups that work with Veterans to upgrade their status

**Who do we need to talk to?**

- Veterans
- Contact center staff
- DOD stakeholders
- VA stakeholders
- VSOs
- Non-profits

**What secondary research should we do?**

- Facebook
- blogs
- information already published on interwebs 

**Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?**

Wizard will only point user to the correct DOD form.  Not in scope is anything outside of pointing to a paper form. 

**Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?**

- Content is super complicated and it is tricky how to talk about it in both plain language and in a way that satisfies how VA/DOD wants us to talk about it. 

- Involves both DOD and VA.  

## Timeline

Are there any hard and fast deadlines for completing the discovery work? 
This should launch in PI3 (PI3 starts on Oct 25th and lasts 6 weeks)

When will the following take place?

Discovery Prep: Done
Discovery (ideally 1-2 weeks): Done
User Research: Week of Nov 6th 
Complete & Readout: Week of Nov 13th

## Go-to-market Strategy
- Key words and meta data on the content page will allow search engines to index it so that service members can find it through organic search
- VA.gov global search will also leverage key words to help users find the tool
- "Best bets" within global search will also point users to this tool when they search for specific words.
- Campaign landing pages may occassionally be used to drive traffic to this tool.  One such example is the [landing page launched for Pride Month 2021](https://www.va.gov/initiatives/recognizing-lgbtq-veterans-during-pride-month/).

# Previous Discharge Upgrade Wizard Product Outline

A tool to help Veterans find information about how to upgrade their discharge status. 

## Stakeholders and Product Team
- Keywords: Discharge, Discharge Update, Discharge Upgrade, Discharge Wizard
- Product POCs: 
  - DOD - Alexander W. Reber REBER, GS-13 USAF HAF SAF/MRBX
  - PO - John Hashimoto (USDS, OCTO-DE)

## User Problem Statement
Information on how to upgrade a discharge status for eligible Veterans is not currently provided in its entirety on any government page, and is not provided in a user-friendly format anywhere on the internet.

Initial GitHub Issue: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/1941

## Solution Narrative
Page delivers customized content based on reason Veteran wants to upgrade discharge, date of discharge, branch of service, etc., which is collected via a short wizard (4-6 questions). No PII collected; no data stored; no backend. The wizard would be a series of questions that would conditionally show content (e.g., recommended forms/steps for updating discharge records, caveats, advice, background information) to the Veteran based on relevance.  Page also includes a few paragraphs of accordion content.
