### How to Apply for a Discharge Upgrade

Answer a series of questions to get customized step-by-step instructions on how to apply for a discharge upgrade or correction. If your application goes through and your discharge is upgraded, you'll be eligible for the VA benefits you earned during your period of service.

All branches of the military consider you to have a strong case for a discharge upgrade if you can show your discharge was connected to any of these categories:
- Mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
- Sexual assault or harassment during military service (at VA, we refer to this as military sexual trauma or MST)
- Sexual orientation (including under the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy)

The information you enter on the next page is completely confidential.

_FAQ CONTENT_

### Can I get VA benefits without a discharge upgrade?

**A:** 

Even with a less than honorable discharge, you may be able to access some VA benefits through the Character of Discharge review process. When you apply for VA benefits, we'll review your record to determine if your service was “honorable for VA purposes.” This review can take up to a year. Please provide us with documents supporting your case, similar to the evidence you'd send with an application to upgrade your discharge.

You may want to consider finding someone to advocate on your behalf, depending on the complexity of your case. A lawyer or Veterans Service Organization (VSO) can collect and submit supporting documents for you. [Find a VSO near you](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/varo.asp).

**Note:** You can ask for a VA Character of Discharge review while at the same time applying for a discharge upgrade from the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast Guard.

If you need mental health services related to PTSD or other mental health problems linked to your service (including conditions related to an experience of military sexual trauma), you may qualify for VA health benefits right away, even without a VA Character of Discharge review or a discharge upgrade.

#### Q: What if I already applied for an upgrade or correction and was denied?

**A:** 

If your previous upgrade application was denied, you can apply again, but you may have to follow a different process. Click the **Get Started** button above. When you're asked if you've applied before, select **Yes**. After you've answered all the questions, you'll see application instructions specific to your situation.

Applying again is most likely to be successful if your application is significantly different from when you last applied. For example, you may have additional evidence that wasn't available to you when you last applied, or the Departent of Defense (DoD) may have issued new rules regarding discharges. DoD rules changed for discharges related to PTSD, TBI, and mental health in 2014, military sexual harassment and assault in 2017, and sexual orientation in 2011.


---

#### Q: What if I have discharges for more than one period of service?

**A:**

If the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast Guard determined you served honorably in one period of service, you may use that honorable characterization to establish eligibility for VA benefits, even if you later received a less than honorable discharge. You earned your benefits during the period in which you served honorably. Make sure you specifically mention your period of honorable service when applying for VA benefits.

**Note:** The only exception is for service-connected disability compensation. You're only eligible to earn disability compensation for disabilities you suffered during a period of honorable service. You can’t use an honorable discharge from one period of service to establish eligibility for a service-connected disability from a different period of service.

---

#### Q: What if I served honorably, but didn’t receive discharge paperwork?

**A:**

You're eligible for VA benefits at the end of a period of honorable service, even if you didn’t receive a discharge in the form of a DD214. If you completed your original contract period without any disciplinary problems, you can use this period of service to establish your eligibility, even if you re-enlisted or extended your service and did not receive an "honorable" DD214 at the end of your second period of service. If you completed a period of honorable service that's not reflected on a DD214, make sure you specifically mention this period of service when you apply for VA benefits. We may do a Character of Discharge review to confirm your eligibility.

You can also apply to the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast Guard for a second DD214 only for that period of honorable service. Click the **Get Started** button above and answer the questions based on your most recent discharge. When you're asked if you completed a period of service in which your character of service was honorable or general under honorable conditions, select: "Yes, I completed a prior period of service, but I did not receive discharge paperwork from that period."

---
#### Q: What if I have a DD215 showing an upgraded discharge, but my DD214 still isn't correct?

**A:**
When the Department of Defense (DoD) or the Coast Guard upgrades a Veteran’s discharge, it usually issues a DD215 showing corrections to the DD214. The DoD or the Coast Guard attaches the DD215 to the old DD214—which still shows the outdated discharge and related information. While the discharge on the DD215 is the correct discharge, a Veteran may still want a new DD214 that shows no record of their earlier characterization of discharge.

If you have a DD215 and want an updated DD214, click the **Get Started** button above. On the next page, select: "I received a discharge upgrade or correction, but my upgrade came in the form of a DD215, and I want an updated DD214." After you've answered all the questions, you'll see instructions for how to request a new DD214.

_%% This is not shown for transgender case (b/c we know they want to change name, so Q1b would be yes every time) or for DD214/215 option (b/c we know the change they want is within the DRB's bounds, so Q1b is not binding)%%_

**Q1b:** Do you want to change your name, discharge date, or something written in the "other remarks" section of your DD214?
1. Yes, I want to change my name, discharge date, or something written in the "other remarks" section of my DD214. (This isn't common.)

Supposing the rest of the application were consistent with DRB, that would be the next step. We have to confirm if BCMR denial was from failure to exhaust, *if* the rest of the application is consistent with DRB. If not, we don't bother; answer will be BCMR. %%_

**Q5c:** Was your application denied due to "failure to exhaust other remedies"?
**Note:** "Failure to exhaust other remedies" generally means you applied to the wrong board.

1. Yes, the [BCMR/BCNR] denied my application due to "failure to exhaust other remedies."
2. No, the [BCMR/BCNR] denied my application for other reasons, such as not agreeing with the evidence in my application.

# Your Steps for Upgrading Your Discharge
Based on the answers you gave to our questions, you need to complete Department of Defense (DoD) Form [###] and send it to the [Board] for the [service branch] [if 5b == 3 & 5c!=1: for reconsideration]. [Careful consideration statement if Q1 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]


### Careful consideration statements

**If Question 1 = 1 (PTSD)**

SHOW: Because you answered that your discharge was related to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other mental health conditions, the DoD will apply “liberal consideration” to your case. In 2014, the DoD recognized that many Veterans had received discharges due to behavior connected to their previously undiagnosed or undocumented PTSD or other mental health condition.   

**If Question 1 = 2 (TBI)**

SHOW: Because you answered that your discharge was related to a traumatic brain injury (TBI), the DoD will apply “liberal consideration” to your case. In 2014, the DoD recognized that many Veterans had received discharges due to behavior connected to their previously undiagnosed or undocumented TBI. 


**If Question 1 = 3 (Sexual orientation), and question 1a = 2 (less than hon)**

SHOW: Because you answered that your discharge was due to your sexual orientation, the DoD encourages you to apply for an upgrade. In 2011, the DoD recognized that many Veterans had received discharges only because of their sexual orientation. <br> **Note:** You must prove that your discharge was solely due to your sexual orientation and events specifically related to it. If the events leading to your discharge were unrelated, you may still receive an upgrade, but you'll have to argue that your discharge was unjust punishment for those events.

**If Question 1 = 3 (Sexual orientation), and question 1a = 1 (just remarks/re-enlist)**

SHOW: Many Veterans have received general or honorable discharges due to their sexual orientation, and simply want references to sexual orientation removed from their DD214s, or want the ability to re-enlist. This is a relatively straightforward application.

**If Question 1 = 4 (Sexual assault)**

SHOW: Because you answered that your discharge was related to sexual assault or harassment, the DoD will apply “liberal consideration” to your case. In 2017, the DoD recognized that many Veterans had received discharges due to sexual assault or harassment, and had unfairly received less than honorable discharges. <br>
**Note:** You must prove that your discharge was solely the result of sexual assault or harassment and events specifically related to it. If the events leading to your discharge were unrelated, you may still receive an upgrade, but you'll have to argue that your discharge was unjust punishment for those events. 

**If Question 1 = 5 (transgender & name change)**

SHOW: This is a common request for transgender Veterans whose DD214 name does not match the name they currently use.

[**IF 5b=4 AND Q1!=8, SHOW warning box:**
You answered that you weren't sure where you applied for an upgrade before. The instructions below are for Veterans who have never applied for a discharge upgrade, so your process may be different. For more reliable information on your discharge upgrade process, please review your records to find out which board you sent your earlier application to, and complete the questions again.]

[**If Q3 = 3 AND if DRB, SHOW warning box:**
Because you answered that you're not sure if your discharge was the outcome of a general court-martial, it's important for you to check your military records. The results below are for Veterans who have discharges that are administrative or the result of a special or summary court-martial.] 

[**If Q1 = 8 AND if Q5b = 4 AND date within last 15 years, SHOW warning box:**
Because you answered that you weren't sure where you applied for an upgrade before, it's important for you to check your records. The instructions below are for Veterans who had a successful upgrade application reviewed by the [branch of service] Discharge Review Board (DRB).

**If Q6 = 1**

**You can apply for VA benefits using your honorable characterization**

Because you served honorably in one period of service, you can apply for VA benefits using that honorable characterization. You earned your benefits during the period in which you served honorably. The only exception is for service-connected disability compensation. If your disability began during your less than honorable period of service, you won’t be eligible to earn disability compensation unless you get that discharge upgraded. The instructions below this box tell you how to apply for an upgrade or correction to your final, less than honorable period of service.

**If Q6 = 2**

**You can apply for VA benefits using your honorable characterization.**

Because you served honorably in one period of service, you can apply for VA benefits using that honorable characterization. You earned your benefits during the period in which you served honorably. You don’t need a DD214 to apply for VA benefits—you only need to specifically mention this period of honorable service. (VA may do a Character of Discharge review to confirm your eligibility.)

The only exception is for service-connected disability compensation. If your disability began during your less than honorable period of service, you won’t be eligible to earn disability compensation unless you get that discharge upgraded. The instructions below this box tell you how to apply to an upgrade or correction for your final, less than honorable period of service.

If you want a DD214 for your period of honorable service for other reasons, unrelated to applying for VA benefits, you can request one. [Find out how to request a DD214 for your period of honorable service](link to new page).


### Subway Map

**If Question 1 = 1 or 2 AND IF Question 2= 2001-2009 only, SHOW:**

#### Step 1 (Optional): Apply to the Physical Disability Board of Review
If you believe your disability rating for TBI, PTSD, or other mental health conditions is too low, consider applying to the Physical Disability Board of Review (PDBR). The DoD created the PDBR specifically to review appeals about low disability ratings for Veterans discharged between 2001 and 2009. Some Veterans discharged during this period of time received lower disability ratings than they deserved, especially if they suffered from TBI, PTSD, or other mental health conditions. If you were discharged during this period of time and previously received a disability rating of 20% or lower, you're eligible to apply to the PDBR for review. The PDBR does **not** issue discharge upgrades and cannot review conditions not listed in your military record before your separation. But, if the PDBR finds that your disability rating was unjustly low, it may help you make your case to upgrade your discharge.

**If Q1 = 8, SHOW:**
#### Step 1: Download and fill out DoD Form [###]

**Important tip for completing Form [###]**
Pay special attention to item 6, which asks for the reason for your change. Here you should explain why you need a new DD214, including any problems you face when you have to show both the DD214 and the DD215. You may want to consider attaching additional pages to fully answer this question.


**ELSE:**
#### Step 1: Download and fill out DoD Form [###]

**Important tips for completing Form [###]**
- Pay special attention to item 6, which asks for the reason for your change. Most Veterans attach additional pages to answer this question. 

**If 1==1,2,4 SHOW:**

For discharges related to [1: PTSD or other mental health conditions / 2: TBI / 4: sexual assault], be sure to answer these questions to make the strongest case:
- Did you have [1,2: a condition / 4: an experience] that may explain or contribute to the reason you were discharged?
- Did that [1,2: condition start or get worse / 4: experience happen] during your military service?
- Why does the [1,2: condition / 4: experience] directly explain or contribute to the discharge?
- Why does the [1,2: condition / 4: experience] carry more weight than any other reasons you may have been discharged for?]
- **If 5b=3:** Because you're applying for reconsideration of a previous application, you'll need to enter the previous application number in item 6b. 
**Note:** You're generally only eligible for reconsideration if you have new evidence to present that wasn't available when you applied last time. Make sure you're clear about exactly what that new evidence is. Additionally, changes in DoD policy, like the new consideration guidelines for PTSD, TBI, and sexual assault or harassment, can qualify you for reconsideration. 
 - **If Q1=4:** **Note:** For upgrades related to sexual assault or harassment, you don't need to prove the original assault or harassment occurred—meaning if you didn't file charges or report the incident, you can still apply for an upgrade. The most important part of your application is where you explain the impact of the incident on your service. For example, detail how the incident caused a decrease in your productivity, or was the reason for PTSD.

**IF BCMR/BCNR SHOW:**

- Item 8 asks for the date when you discovered the error or injustice you‘re asking the Board to address. If it‘s been more than 3 years since you found this error or injustice, you‘ll need to include a reason why the Board should consider your application. Examples of good reasons include new evidence you‘ve found to support your claim, or recent changes in policy (like liberal consideration for PTSD, TBI, or military sexual assault or harassment). These kinds of reasons will make it more likely for the Board to decide in your favor. The 3-year time limit isn‘t a strict rule, so don‘t let it keep you from applying if you think you have a strong case.
- Item 10 asks if you're willing to appear in person before the Board in Washington, DC. The Board rarely asks Veterans to appear in person, but if you say you’re willing to do so, it may help show how serious you are about your case.

**END IF BCMR/BCNR**

**If DRB & 5b!=1, SHOW:**

- You can request either a Documentary Review or a Personal Appearance Review from the Discharge Review Board (DRB). If your case is especially complicated and requires detailed explanation, you **may** have more success with a Personal Appearance Review. Note that you'll have to pay your travel costs if you make a personal appearance. Documentary Reviews are generally faster, so we recommend you begin with this type of review. Also, if you're denied in a Documentary Review, you can then appeal through a Personal Appearance Review. But you can’t request Documentary Review after a Personal Appearance Review.

**IF DRB & 5b=1, SHOW:**

- The DRB allows you to request either a Documentary Review or a Personal Appearance Review. Because your application was already denied during a Documentary Review, you must apply for a Personal Appearance Review in Washington, DC. Note that you'll have to pay your travel costs if you make a personal appearance.

**Need help preparing your application?**

The process of preparing a discharge upgrade or correction application can be a lot of work and can take a long time. Although many Veterans are successful on their own, you may want to consider finding someone to advocate for you in this process. Try a Veterans Service Organization (VSO), search online for a lawyer who may provide services for low or no cost, or ask other Veterans for recommendations. [Find a VSO near you](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/varo.asp).


**_If Q1 = 8, do not show step 2._**

_%% no supporting information is needed for these 214/215 cases %%_

#### Step 2: Add supporting information

To improve your chances of success, also include as many of the below documents as you can. 
- **Military Record:** In most cases, your records will be important to the Board's decision. The Board may not have easy access to your military records, especially if you served many years ago, so we strongly recommended you submit any relevant documents yourself. **If Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR):** Note that the BCMR is required to help you collect evidence **if** you can demonstrate you made a reasonable attempt to get your records but didn't succeed. **If Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR):** Note that the BCNR is required to help you collect evidence **if** you can demonstrate you made a reasonable attempt to get your records but didn't succeed.

**If Question 2 = 1997 – present, SHOW:** 

- You can get your complete military personnel record (your Official Military Personnel File, or OMPF) online. [Get your military personnel record](https://pint.eauth.va.gov/ebenefits/DPRIS).

**If Question 2 = Before 1997, SHOW:**

- You can make a request online or by mail to get your complete military personnel record (your Official Military Personnel File, or OMPF) mailed to you. If at first you get only some of the available records, you should request the full set of records. [Get your military personnel record](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records).

**ENDIF**

- **For specific types also SHOW:** Remember, you should try to prove that [FILL IN BASED ON TYPE: If Q1==1: you suffered from symptoms of PTSD or other mental health conditions while in the service. / If Q1==2: you suffered from symptoms of TBI while in the service. / If Q1==3 & Q1a==2: your character of discharge was due only to your sexual orientation and not to bad conduct. / If Q1==4: the conduct that led to your discharge stemmed from military sexual assault and not other factors.] Submit any documents from this record that help support your case for a discharge upgrade.

**If Question 1 = 1, 2, OR 4, SHOW:**

- **Medical Records:** In most cases, the Board won’t have easy access to your medical records, so you should submit any relevant documents yourself. 
  - You can request your **VA medical records** by submitting VA Form 10-5345 to your local VA medical center. [Download VA Form 10-5345](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-5345-fill.pdf). 
  - **If Question 3= before 1992, SHOW:** Your **military medical records** will be included with the VA medical records you request.
  - **If Question 3=1992 to present, SHOW:** [Find out how to request your **military medical records**](https://www.archives.gov/st-louis/military-personnel/ompf-background.html).
  - You can also submit **medical records from a private practice doctor**—contact your doctor’s office to get the records you need.

**For all responses to Q1, SHOW**
- **“Buddy Statements” or Other References from Service:** On top of military records, you can attach statements from friends or colleagues you knew while in the service, or other individuals with direct knowledge of your time in the military. The content of the letter is more important than who it comes from, as long as the writer's opinion is credible and they know you well. The writer should state how they learned about the facts or opinions they're writing about. The letters may include statements about your achievements in the military, positive relationships you formed in the military, why your discharge may be unjust or incorrect, and your good deeds during that time.
- **Testaments of Achievements Since Service:** You may decide to add information about what you have achieved in your life since your discharge, particularly if your discharge involved any issues related to drugs, alcohol, or bad behavior. This can be in the form of a letter from an employer or community leader, evidence of successful drug treatment, or copies of certificates and degrees. The DoD will soon release more specific information about achievements since service, but, for now, add any achievements you would like to call out.

#### Step 3: Mail your completed form and all supporting materials

There are a number of different boards that handle discharge upgrades and corrections. Based on your answers on the previous page, you need to apply to _BEGIN Explanation of which Board; show the **first** of the following paragraphs that applies to the case, and only that one_

**If Q1 = 8 AND 5b = DRB OR not sure AND in last 15 yrs, show:** 
the Discharge Review Board (DRB). The DRB was the Board that granted your previous upgrade request, so you must apply to them for a new DD214.

**If Q1 = 8 AND 5b = DRB OR not sure AND over 15 years, show:** 
the [Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR)/Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR)]. The Board handles all cases from 15 or more years ago.

**If Q1 = 8 AND 5b = BCMR/BCNR, show:** 
the [Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR)/Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR)]. The [BCMR/BCNR] was the Board that granted your previous upgrade request, so you must apply to them for a new DD214.

**If Q5a==1 AND Board==DRB, show:**
the Discharge Review Board (DRB) for the [service branch]. In general, the DRB does **not** handle appeals for previously denied applications. However, because new rules have recently come out regarding discharges like yours, the Board may treat your application as a new case. If possible, review the new policies and state in your application how the change in the policy is relevant to your case. If the DRB decides that the new rules don't apply to your situation, you'll likely have to send an appeal to a different Board.

**If 5c==1 & Board==DRB, show:**
the Discharge Review Board (DRB) for the [service branch]. The [Board for Correction of Military Records (BCMR)/Board for Correction of Naval Records (BCNR)] previously rejected your application because you did not apply to the DRB first. For applications like yours, the [BCMR/BCNR] can review only cases that have already been rejected by the DRB. The DRB is a panel of commissioned officers, or a mix of senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and officers. The deadline to apply to the DRB is 15 years after your date of discharge. After this time period, you must apply to a different board.

**If 5b = 2, SHOW:**
the [Board] for the [service branch] to appeal that decision. This is because your application was denied by the Discharge Review Board (DRB) on a Personal Appearance review.

**If 5b = 3, & 5c!=1 (5c==missing or 5c==2) SHOW:**
the [Board]. This is because, if you've applied before, you must re-apply to the [Board] for reconsideration.

**If (5==NO | 5b=1,4 | 5a=1) && (2&2a define a date >= 15 years ago), SHOW:**
the [Board] for the [service branch]. This is because the Board handles all cases from 15 or more years ago.

**IF 3==1, SHOW:**
the [Board] for the [service branch]. This is because your discharge was the result of a general court-martial.

**IF 1b==1 | 1==5, SHOW:**
the [Board] for the [service branch]. This is because you want to change information other than your characterization of discharge, re-enlistment code, separation code, and narrative reason for discharge.

**IF [Board] == DRB, SHOW:**
the Discharge Review Board (DRB) for the [service branch]. The DRB is a panel of commissioned officers, or a combination of senior non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and officers. The deadline to apply to the DRB is 15 years after your date of discharge; after this time period, you must apply to a different board.

**AND**

**If *NOT* (Question 4 = 1 AND DRB), SHOW:**

Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to submit this form online. 

**IF 5b=1, SHOW:**

Because your application was rejected by the DRB on Documentary Review, you must apply for a Personal Appearance Review.

_END BOARD EXPLANATION_

**If 5a==1 & Board=BCMR/BCNR, SHOW:**

Your last application was made before the release of DoD guidance related to discharges like yours. As a result, the Board may treat your application as a new case. If possible, review the new policies and state in your application how the change in policy is relevant to your case.

### What happens after I send in my application? 

The Board reviews nearly all applications within 18 months. You can continue to submit supporting documents until the Board has reviewed your application.

If your application is successful, the Board will direct your service personnel office to issue you either a DD215, which contains updates to the DD214, or an entirely new DD214. If you get a new DD214, [request a copy](https://pint.eauth.va.gov/ebenefits/DPRIS).

If your appeal results in raising your discharge to honorable, you'll immediately be considered an eligible Veteran to VA, and you can apply for VA benefits and services. For now, you may still apply for VA eligibility by [requesting a Character of Discharge review](https://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/docs/COD_Factsheet.pdf).


### Can I get VA benefits without a discharge upgrade?

Even with a less than honorable discharge, you may be able to access some VA benefits through the Character of Discharge review process. When you apply for VA benefits, we'll review your record to determine if your service was “honorable for VA purposes.” This review can take up to a year. Please provide us with documents supporting your case, similar to the evidence you'd send with an application to upgrade your discharge.

You may want to consider finding someone to advocate on your behalf, depending on the complexity of your case. A lawyer or Veterans Service Organization (VSO) can collect and submit supporting documents for you. [Find a VSO near you](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vso/varo.asp).

**Note:** You can ask for a VA Character of Discharge review while at the same time applying for a discharge upgrade from the DoD or the Coast Guard.

If you experienced sexual assault or harassment while in the military, or need mental health services related to PTSD or other mental health conditions linked to your service, you may qualify immediately for VA health benefits, even without a VA Character of Discharge review or a discharge upgrade.

### Your Steps for Getting a DD214 for Your Period of Honorable Service

To receive a second DD214 reflecting **only** your period of honorable service, you'll need to complete Department of Defense (DoD) Form 149 and send it to the [BCMR/BCNR—based on branch—**do not** send it to the Discharge Review Board (DRB)] for the [service branch].

[subway map]
**Step 1: Download and fill out [DoD Form 149](http://www.afpc.af.mil/Portals/70/documents/Home/AFBCMR/DD%20Form%20149.pdf?ver=2016-12-15-120123-183).

 - Pay special attention to item 6, which asks for the reason for your change. Be clear that you want a DD214 for your period of honorable service, and include the dates of that period.
 - Item 8 asks for your date of “discovery” of the injustice. In this case, it's the day you “discovered” you were missing an extra DD214 that you deserved. If this date isn’t in the last 3 years, you’ll need to argue that the Board should hear your case anyway. This isn't a strict date, so don’t let the 3-year rule keep you from applying if you have a strong case. You may note your recent discovery of new evidence about your situation, such as the ability to apply for a discharge upgrade.
 - Item 10 asks if you're willing to appear in person before the Board in Washington, DC. The Board rarely asks Veterans to appear in person, but saying you’re willing to do so may help show how serious you are about your case.

** Step 2: Mail your completed form

There are a number of different boards that handle discharge upgrades and corrections. Because you want a new DD214, which is seen as a correction of your military record, you'll need to apply to the [BCMR/BCNR] for the [branch].

Unfortunately, there isn’t a way to submit this form online.

Mail your completed form and all supporting documents to the [Board] at:
