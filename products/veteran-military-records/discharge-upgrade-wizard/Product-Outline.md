# Discharge Upgrade Wizard Product Outline 

2024 live product: https://www.va.gov/discharge-upgrade-instructions/

## Overview
The Discharge Upgrade Wizard provides information and guidance to discharged service members who want to request a upgrade to their discharge status. 

### Technical detail
Page delivers customized content based on reason Veteran wants to upgrade discharge, date of discharge, branch of service, etc., which is collected via a wizard. No PII collected; no data stored; no backend. The wizard is a series of questions that conditionally shows content (e.g., recommended forms/steps for updating discharge records, caveats, advice, background information) to the Veteran based on relevance. Page also includes a few paragraphs of accordion content.


## Problem Statement
Some service members who received a less-than-honorable discharge in the past were not eligible to receive some Veteran benefits.  With the passage of the 2017 Fairness for Veterans Act, all branches of the military now consider them to have a strong case for a discharge upgrade if they can show their discharge was connected to:
 - Mental health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
- Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
- Sexual assault or harassment during military service (at VA, we refer to this as military sexual trauma or MST)
- Sexual orientation (including under the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell policy)
 
## Desired User Outcomes
- A user who would like to know how to request a discharge upgrade is able to determine where their request should be directed, and the information required to complete a request.
- If their discharge upgrade request is approved, they will be eligible for the VA benefits earned during their period of service.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users decline to answer the questions because they are afraid their personal information is being stored
- Users are given the impression that a discharge upgrade request is guaranteed to be approved
- Users are not provided with sufficient information after answering questions in the wizard

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Give Veterans the self-service tools and information needed to request a discharge upgrade
- Comply with the 2017 Fairness for Veterans Act

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Users send the wrong documents
- Users send documents to the wrong review board
