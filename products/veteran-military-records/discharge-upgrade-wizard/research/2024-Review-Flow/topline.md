This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Participants

We talked to 10 Veterans.
- 6 of 10 had NOT applied for a discharge upgrade in the past.
- 7 of 10 used a computer during the session; 3 used smartphone.
- 3 used assistive technology; 2 screen readers and 1 screen magnifier. 
  
## Initial Findings


**All participants were able to navigate the edit flow.**

- All participants were able to edit questions with no difficulty.
- All participants understood how to navigate the Back/Continue button functionality when editing answers.
- Three participants weren't asked to complete the task where they needed to use the Back button, but had no difficulty navigating the wizard in general.
> "That's super easy."

**Most participants understand that they may be asked to answer additional questions.**
- Most participants didn't comment on additional questions being asked, but were able to edit questions with ease.
- Four participants noticed the alert on question pages that indicated more may be asked.
> "So it does say here, 'changing your answer may lead to new set of questions', which would be no problem."

**Most participants understand the updated review page and how it relates to the questions they answered.**
- Most participants didn't comment on updated answers on the review screen and continued to the results page with no questions.
- Four participants noticed the alert on the review page that their answer was updated.

**Some participants found the questions confusing or lacking information.**
- Two participants wanted to select multiple reasons for changing discharge paperwork.
- Three participants were confused by the prior service question.
> "I might try to get help for somebody to explain [prior service question] to me"

**Some participants commented on the amount of content on the results page.**
- Three participants said there was too much info on the page.
- Four participants said they would print out the page.
> "It's a lot to take in."

**Some participants wanted a different submission process.**
- Three participants wanted to submit their form online instead of mailing it in. 
- Three participants said the form would be difficult to fill out. One participant expressed frustration that the answers they gave in the wizard didn't help fill out the form.
- Three paricipants would like more communication about the process after submitting their form.
> "This would be a lot of work."

 **Some participants wanted clearer information on the results page.**
- Two participants said they wanted more info on buddy statements. 
- One participant expressed that the info on the page was very general and not specific to the discharge upgrade reason they gave.
> "I know for a fact that buddy statements carry a lot of weight. I know that because I had couple with my disability claim. They carry a lot of weight but it doesn't really say that in here."
