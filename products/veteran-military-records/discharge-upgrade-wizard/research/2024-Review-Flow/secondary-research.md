# Secondary Research

## Synopsis

**Past research indicates that:**
- Some Veterans may be confused by the Back/Continue buttons. 
- Some Veterans expect to go back to the review screen after editing their answer and selecting Continue.
- When returning to the review screen after editing, most Veterans preferred being anchored to the section they just updated with a persistent confirmation notification.
- Veterans acknowledge alerts that are close to the top of the page. 

**Knowledge gaps:**
- Only one of the six studies reviewed used the Edit by Field design that’s present on the Discharge Upgrade Wizard. 
- None of the studies tested editing a flow that contains conditional/branching logic. 

## Past research

**Forms Library Review Page [Round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/110) and [Round 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/143)**
- Although this review page uses the [Edit by Section design](https://design.va.gov/templates/forms/review), some elements are similar to the Edit by Field design that DUW uses. 
- Veterans expressed confusion with the Back/Continue buttons and prefer to be notified of any changes on the review screen after editing. 
- Though nearly all Veterans understood how to save a change and return to the Review Page without explanation, nearly half of them expressed confusion or uncertainty regarding the meaning of the Save & Continue, Back, and Continue buttons.
- When returning to the Review Page after saving a change, all Veterans preferred being anchored to the section they just updated with a persistent confirmation notification.

[**Usability Testing, PACT Act Wizard**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/385)
- This research didn’t test the UI
- One participant found the Back/Continue buttons clear. They said, "It follows a logical pattern--if/then. There's a clear button to take me to the next question...There's not a lot of choices. It flows smartly. And if I need to go back a page, that page is available. It doesn't take me someplace else" 

[**Income Limits App Usability Testing**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/219)
- This study used the Edit by Field design
- Veterans found one-thing-per-page clear and mobile-friendly, all participants were able to use the Continue button with no problems, and one participant expressed a preference on editing behavior.
- All participants found it easy to answer the questions, which were posed one question at a time (the subtask design pattern). A few participants commented that it was really easy to answer the questions on their phone. 
- All participants used the Continue button without any hesitation, and some used the Back button, too (others didn't need to).
- After one participant used the Review Info page to return to the zip code page and then clicked the Continue button, they said they were surprised to see the Dependents page. They expected to see the Review Info page again. Other participants saw this, too, and said that they must be going back through all the screens.
     - **Note:** Participants had trouble with this when editing, which was a limitation with the prototype. The current income limits flow goes straight back to the review screen after editing an answer and selecting Continue.

[**Health care application (10-10EZ) household information section research**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/192)
- Some Veterans believe there are too few fields/questions on the one-thing-per-page design. 
- One-thing-per-page: Two participants commented on the frequency of clicking continue, and that there were too few fields on certain pages.

[**10-10EZ Short Form Usability**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/154)
- Veterans were able to find an alert that was at the top of the page. An edit flow that takes Veterans through each question again is not ideal. 
- Not all participants opened the green alert, but the majority acknowledged its existence. Those that opened, received it positively, especially because it indicated the specific sections that would be skipped (military and income).

- The edit compensation flow from the review page is not ideal, but didn't indicate signs of drop-off.
     - **Note:** This edit flow takes users back to the question they wish to edit. After editing the question and selecting Continue, users are taken back through the entire question flow. ([Staging link to view flow](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply-for-health-care-form-10-10ez/introduction))
- Many self-disclosed participants missed the alert after confirmation (the "you are now on step 3 of 4).
     - **Note:** Was unable find where this alert was when reviewing the staging link and Figma file, but would be interested to know where it is on the page.
