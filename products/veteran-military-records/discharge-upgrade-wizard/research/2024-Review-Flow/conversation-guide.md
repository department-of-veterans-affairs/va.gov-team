## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jordan and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also
have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take
notes. But before we get to them…

I work on making technology easier for Veterans to use in order to get information and benefits
from the VA. Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some
specific tasks using a link that I will share with you.

What I *hope* to do today is to get your feedback on something new that we're working on.

What I *don't want to do* is add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits from
the VA. We may look at things that have caused you frustration, and I want you to know up
front that I cannot make that better for you right now. I do not have access to your records, nor
do I have any contact with claims reviewers. But I'd like to understand your frustrations
because they can help me advocate for improvements to the process in the future.

If you need help with an existing claim or issue, we can connect you with someone after this session. 

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you
much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong
answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your
feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to
participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect
your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not
want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me
know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to
allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we
get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
     - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
     - If yes: Admit observers.
     - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction,
like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the
interaction of observation for the participant.)
     - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the
remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the
recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we
complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will
be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10
participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying
information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
     - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk
today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to
help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share
findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions
with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be
used to identify you, like your on screen image. Sharing these video clips can be a
compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when
using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.
We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the
end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance
to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
     - Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our
session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?
     - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me
recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen
and the audio as we talk today?
- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to
share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify
you?

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share (on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click More...) or Share Screen (on computer, button is green).
     - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
     - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.
- iPad: Broadcast screen
- Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:
     - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? [Give mouse control--doesn't work w/iPhones] Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom.
      - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat.
          - If don't see chat, ASK: Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
     - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right?
     - Thanks for confirming that.
2. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)
3. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. (RECORD)
4. Do you know how discharge status relates to VA benefits?
5. Are you familiar with the discharge upgrade process?
     - (If Y) Have you applied for a discharge upgrade in the past?
          i. (If Y) Can you tell me about your experience? (when, how, results)
     - (If N) No problem. You'll learn about it as we go through this session.

## First Task: Open wizard
Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the web page that I'm going to show you. I'd
like you to try to use it, and please share your feedback while you're doing that. I'm interested
in your impressions of what you see, any questions that you have, and how you feel about
what you're doing.
I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to [dictate/put into the Zoom chat] for you to use:
[https://staging.va.gov/discharge-upgrade-instructions/introduction]

Did you get the link?
- If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my
screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)
- If link doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome),
private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)

## Second Task: Go through questions in wizard
I want to make sure that you feel comfortable, so please know that you don’t have to stick to
your real-life situation when answering any of the following questions. If it feels easier, you’re
welcome to create a fictional scenario or adjust the details in any way that work for you. Our
goal is to test how the system works and make sure each question is clear, we’re not testing
your specific answers.

Please try to **talk aloud** about what you're thinking and what you plan to do BEFORE selecting
anything.

## Consent to use video clips
- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a
video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all
information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the
videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital
experiences.
     - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video
clip?

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your
feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works
for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can
pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future
research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit
strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

We recommend you plan a graceful exit strategy that you will feel comfortable using during a session. Your goal is to simply wrap up the session without any further incident or escalation. It is important not to blame the participant, since it could increase any distress or trauma they are experiencing. If you are exiting for a reason on your side, it’s best not to share any personal details, as it may create additional stress for all. Examples of exit strategies that have worked include:
- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
- Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
