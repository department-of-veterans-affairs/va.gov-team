# Notes: Discharge Upgrade Wizard Usability Testing

## Warm-up Questions
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right?
     - Thanks for confirming that.
2. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)
3. What web browser do you use? (Chrome / Firefox / Edge / Safari / _______)
4. What assistive technology are you using right now? (screen reader / magnifier _______________________)
    
    - (If Dolphin screen reader, won't be able to share screen on Zoom)
    - (if no AT) Do you sometimes use assistive technology?
         - If so, what do you use and when?
              - Would you be willing to start using it now in this session?
              - (if not, discuss w/Amanda--run session w/o AT, or stop and ask Perigean for a replacement participant)
      
5. How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen (reader / magnifier)--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?
6. How long have you been using a screen (reader / magnifier)?
7. Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen (reader / magnifier)? (Yes / No)

     - (If N) No problem, [Laura/CAIA person] can help you do that.
8. Is there anything else that we can do to support you during this session? (RECORD AND DO!)
9. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. (RECORD)
10. Do you know how discharge status relates to VA benefits?
11. Are you familiar with the discharge upgrade process?
     - (If Y) Have you applied for a discharge upgrade in the past?
