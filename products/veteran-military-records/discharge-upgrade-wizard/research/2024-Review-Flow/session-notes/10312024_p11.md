## User Tasks

### First Task: Open wizard
Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the web page that I'm going to show you. I'd
like you to try to use it, and please share your feedback while you're doing that. I'm interested
in your impressions of what you see, any questions that you have, and how you feel about
what you're doing. *Pretty straight forward so far. I would follow the green arrow next. 

### Second Task: Go through questions in wizard
Please try to **talk aloud** about what you're thinking and what you plan to do BEFORE selecting
anything.

(RECORD all feedback on questions. Note: Certain questions don’t appear on every flow.)

- Intro screen
     - especially if p has not previously applied for a discharge upgrade
- Service branch *What catches my eye on this is Space Force. I was Navy but if I was someone in Space Force. 
- Year and month discharge *2009, straight forward.
- Reason *These are comprehensive.
*This isn’t just a change of  characterization but you can also get a change to your DD214. In reality, is that a by product of what you are trying to do here, like change my name, that is a possibility, not sure if that is what you are going for because there are other ways to change your name. 
     - If nothing applies, p should select “I suffered from an undiagnosed,
misdiagnosed, or untreated mental health condition, including posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), while in the service. I was discharged for reasons related
to this condition.”
- Intention
- Court martial *Check No.
- Previous application questions *No.
- Prior service

### Third Task: Review screen
(RECORD which answers they’ve selected, if possible)

- What does this mean to you? *My impression, I like that you can see the answers on one page. It gives me the chance to pause here and fix anything. 
- What would you do now?

Could you please select "Continue"?

### Fifth Task: Results screen

Please tell me about what you see here.

1.	Why do you think you’re seeing this page? *We can take this to a VSO office, that’s convenient. It’s a lot of information, to be honest I’m not on the VA website that much. I like the cues of pay special attention to this block. I would find this really easy if I was filling this out. 
2. What does this page mean to you?
3. What might be unclear to you? *No.
4. What would you do next? *Print this page and find out what happens after I send my application.

## Post-Task Interview
Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"

1. What worked well for you? *It’s intuitive, it flows. Hyperlinks are there to do what I need to do. Easy to follow.
2. What was unclear or didn't work well for you? *No.
3. What would you like to change or add? *I would add Space Force to the front page. When we started with the hyperlink you sent me, maybe the VA.gov home page, I don’t know how it looks to get to there. From the home page, how do I get to go to the upgrade for my discharge? Getting from VA.gov home page to there is the challenge, I guess you can search for it. 
4. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? *No.
