# Notes: Discharge Upgrade Wizard Usability Testing

## Warm-up Questions
1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right? *Veteran
     - Thanks for confirming that.
2. What kind of device are you using today? (Computer / Tablet / Smartphone) *iPhone.
3. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to
receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. (RECORD) *Zoom chat.
4. Do you know how discharge status relates to VA benefits? *I do. It also equates to the type of benefits you are eligible for.
5. Are you familiar with the discharge upgrade process? *Not personally. 
     - (If Y) Have you applied for a discharge upgrade in the past?
          i. (If Y) Can you tell me about your experience? (when, how, results)
     - (If N) No problem. You'll learn about it as we go through this session.

## User Tasks

### First Task: Open wizard
Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the web page that I'm going to show you. I'd
like you to try to use it, and please share your feedback while you're doing that. I'm interested
in your impressions of what you see, any questions that you have, and how you feel about
what you're doing. *Pretty easy language. I would click get started. 

### Second Task: Go through questions in wizard
Please try to **talk aloud** about what you're thinking and what you plan to do BEFORE selecting
anything.

(RECORD all feedback on questions. Note: Certain questions don’t appear on every flow.)

- Intro screen
     - especially if p has not previously applied for a discharge upgrade
- Service branch
- Year and month discharge *2015
- Reason *circled the fist option.
     - If nothing applies, p should select “I suffered from an undiagnosed,
misdiagnosed, or untreated mental health condition, including posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), while in the service. I was discharged for reasons related
to this condition.”
- Intention *No. 
- Court martial *I’m not sure.
- Previous application questions *Yes.
- Prior service *After 2014.
*I served on active duty, I don’t have two DD214. I have friends who had a break in service, and I was trying to think from their lens if the language was clear. It does make sense. 

### Third Task: Review screen
(RECORD which answers they’ve selected, if possible)

Please tell me about what you see here.

- What does this mean to you? *It’s confirmation on what I have selected. 
- What would you do now?
  
### Fourth Task: Edit a question - Pick 1 or 2 of these depending on time

#### Option 1: Year Discharge (Appears on every flow) (If selected year other than 2009)

I’d like you to pretend that you left the military in 2009.

Is there a way you could update that information from this page? *The back button for this particular page. The back button might be confusing. If I go back, will it erase the changes I have made. I don’t know what it means if I click back. Will I start over or take me to the last page or last question that I have previously answered? The back button seems unnecessary at this page. 

(RECORD all comments, especially about alerts. Did they notice them? Y/N)

- Edit

     - Please tell me about what you see here.
     - (If alert is noticed) What does this mean to you?
     - What would you do now?
- Month discharge
- Continue to review screen
     - Please tell me about what you see here.
     - (If alert or updated answers are noticed) What does this mean to you?
     - What would you do now?

#### Option 2: Previous Application (Appears on some flows) (If p has not previously applied for discharge upgrade)

I’d like you to pretend that you have applied for a discharge upgrade.

Is there a way you could update that information from this page?

*To test Back button:*

     - I'd like you to pause here before answering this question.
     - Pretend that you need to change your answer to the last question. How would you do that?
- (Navigate Back) Previous application year
     - Can select opposite option
- Previous application type or Prior Service
     - Can select any option
     - Selecting BCNR will show Failure to Exhaust question

#### Option 3: Edit non-branching question (If options 1 & 2 aren't valid)

I’d like you to pretend that you served in the [branch of service not selected].
(Options: Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marine Corps)

Is there a way you could update that information from this page?

(RECORD all comments, especially about alerts. Did they notice them? Y/N)

- Edit

     - Please tell me about what you see here.
     - (If alert is noticed) What does this mean to you?

     - What would you do now?
After you review your answers, could you tell me what you would do next?

Could you please select "Continue"?

### Fifth Task: Results screen

Please tell me about what you see here.

1. Why do you think you’re seeing this page? *I like the links that take me straight forward. I like the language, it’s not a bunch of jargon and the information where you don’t have to do this form on your own. It is a lot to take in. It would be nice to have a note to click for step one, step two, step three. 

2. What does this page mean to you?
3. What might be unclear to you? *Not at all.
4. What would you do next? *I would print this page.

## Post-Task Interview
Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"

1. What worked well for you? *It was guided well. I didn’t feel like I didn’t understand what was needed from me.  The dropdowns made it really easy.
2. What was unclear or didn't work well for you? *No, the one thing on this page, is there a way- I’m under the impression that I would need to login to the VA because I don’t know how to get to the instructions without filling this out again. 
3. What would you like to change or add? *No.
4. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? *No.
