## Summary
In 2024 the Authenticated Experience Team conducted research to understand the transition from active duty to Veteran, in order to evaluate the the impact VA.gov has to onboarding to VA overall. Research participants were transitioning service members, soon to be separated, or recently separated from service. The full research can be found in [2024-03-onboarding-generative-research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2024-03-onboarding-generative-research).

During the course of this research, participants occasionally offered feedback about the Veteran Status card. Quotes from the participants who mentioned the card are collected here. Overall, participants who came across the Veteran Status card indicated that they have other forms of identification that would serve the same purpose and most did not see a need for the card, except rarely.

**Moderator**: what about that proof of veteran status section? What is that?   
**P7**: I think I’ve seen this in another page, but basically you can prove that you’re a veteran for like discount but not for anything. Like you can’t get on base with this, you know?  

**Moderator**: Yeah. Right, right. Is this something that you think you would use?   

**P7**: No, but that’s because a lot of places that offer discounts now have, well a lot of them use, id.me to verify that because you know, if you’ve used id.me, you know, you can combine different statuses that you have. I used to have it for student verification and then when I was in service before starting giving me issues on va.gov, I would use it for military verification as well. So if there was like sites that offered discounts, a lot of them use like that to verify your status but they can verify it online themselves like for Spotify or for other things. Yeah. So I wouldn’t need this.

#### Participant 12   
**Moderator**: I’m curious to get your thoughts on the proof of veteran status section. That’s something new that I haven’t really had a chance to get feedback on. And curious what your take is about that.  

**P12**: I would say that they actually spent time on this in TAP, talking about how you prove that you’re a veteran so you don’t have to carry around your DD214 everywhere. And it talked about like accessing discounts at various shops and other things. They did talk about, you know, getting a veteran status card. But I don’t know who would use this, you know. How much money are you spending on this would probably be the thing that I would say. And and how much use is it getting? If you’re retiring you have a retired ID card, which obviously proves you’re a veteran, right? If most states have a veteran indicator that you can put on your driver’s license, most states have some type of vehicle benefits that it will give you a tag that says that you’re a veteran. If you’re using the VA healthcare system, that’s another way you have your health identification card that shows you’re a veteran obviously. And so I don’t know who would use this, you know? Because there’s all these other things. Let’s say you’re not a retiree and you’re not using the VA health system, you know, would it be easier to download this instead of go back and redo your driver’s license? I don’t know. Maybe. I guess maybe, maybe if you’re not a retiree, you’re not accessing health benefits and you don’t drive, then maybe this is, this is what you need. I don’t know who’s out there that that’s doing that. Maybe if your disability is such, or maybe you live in New York City and you don’t need a car. I would say that more options to prove that you’re a veteran is better than fewer options. And so, but I personally don’t use this ’cause I have a bunch of forms of ID that show that I’m a veteran.
