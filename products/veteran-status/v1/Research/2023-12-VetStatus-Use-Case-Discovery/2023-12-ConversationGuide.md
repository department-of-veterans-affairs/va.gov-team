## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Cara and I'm a Researcher with the VA.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today, I’d like to ask you some questions about how you access and use discounts provided to veterans by retailers.  


Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 - 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.  We may also end sooner than that, and if we have covered everything I want to cover I'd love give your time back to you.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- **We like to record** to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.

**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  Are you comfortable with it if we share anonymized video clips with our VA colleagues for research purposes?**

- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

**3.** What veteran IDs do you currently have?  Which have you had in the past, post - service? Tell me about how you use them.

      - Probe for: Do they have license plate? The drivers license? What do they use when? For what? What makes them pick a specific card?  How do they describe each card, its purpose and use?  

**4.** Have you ever submitted for travel reimbursement from the VA?
      - If yes: How did you do so? Online? Kiosk? Mail?  What made you do so?  Why did you pick online/mail/kiosk?

      - Where were you?  What was it for?
      - How did you access the discount?  
            - Probe for: 
               - Did they have to validate? 
               - Who was validating their status? 
               - Did that person say what they were looking for? 
               - What did they use to validate? 
      - Did you plan to use the discount before you went shopping?

      - Who denied the discount? (Cashier, manager, etc.)
      - What reason were you given for the denial?

**10.**  Have you ever wanted to use a veteran specific discount but **NOT** been able to do so? Any experience in line with what we have discussed that we have not covered?   

## Desired usage

**11.**  We have talked about how you currently use and access veteran discounts, but if it were up to you, how would you like to access veteran specific discounts? Tell me how you would use and access these discounts.  

**12.**  Where would you expect to find these tools (to access discounts)?  Where would you like to access them?  **What would you call them?
**
**13.** What would you expect to find around or associated with these tools? 

_Time permitting_

**13.**  Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app?
      - If yes: When did you notice it? Have you used it? What has your experience been with it been like? 

**14.** Anything else you would like to share about your experience accessing veteran specific discounts that we have not covered?


## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
