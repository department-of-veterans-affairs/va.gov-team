## OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience


## Veteran Journey
This research fits into all of the Veteran’s Journey post-service, but most specifically: 

- Putting down roots

	- Maintaining my financial, social and emotional health 
 	- Saving for my retirement
	- Engaging VA to access benefits and services


## **Research Goals**

The Veteran Status product aims to provide simplified access to Veterans Status information to Veterans on VA.gov to ease their ability to access non-VA benefits and discounts. This generative discovery research study aims to provide foundational insights into veterans’ current experiences accessing discounts at service providers to inform the future of this omni-channel experience. This study explores how and when veterans use veteran discounts at retail service providers. We will learn more about how and when veterans use veteran specific discounts in retail stores and non-VA health care providers; what their current process is (when, where, medium, etc), what tools they use and what stumbling blocks they encounter.


## **Research Questions**



1. How do participants currently access and engage with VA benefits using digital and physical tools?
2. How do veterans currently access store discounts? What does that process look like? What tools do they use?
3. How would participants like to access store discounts? What tools would help them do so?
4. Where would participants expect to find these tools?

## **Methodology**


We conducted 30 - 60 minute interviews with 12 veterans remotely over Zoom. These interviews covered questions relating to how veterans currently access veteran specific discounts at different retailers, what tools they use to do so, how they would like to access these discounts and what tools would like to do so. 


## **Key Findings**



1. Participants access VA benefits digitally and physically, but prefer digital where possible.
2. Participants have a wide range of Veteran IDs on hand that get the job done
3. For veterans, learning about discounts is inextricably linked to accessing them.
4. Although asking about a discount is a critical way to learn about them, all Veterans are not equally comfortable doing so. 
5. Veterans link learning about a discount with access and want to learn about discounts in a way that makes it easier for them to access the discount.  
6. Participants were excited by the idea of an easy-to-access tool on a mobile device (e.g. mobile wallet).
7. Blind veterans in particular value in a mobile card
8. When it comes to finding tools, participants gravitated to private sector or VA-agnostic destinations.  

## **Details of Findings**


Finding 1

**Participants access VA benefits digitally and physically, but prefer digital where possible**

Participants prefer to access most of their benefits digitally, either online or on the phone.  They cited a number of benefits to online access, including decreased wait times, easier to communicate with Primary Care Physicians and schedule Appointments.  Blind veterans prefer digital interactions because they are more likely to be accessible.

_"... [prefer digital] because I don't have to drive anywhere to go anywhere. I can just point and click and if it works, which most of the time it does…" -Participant 2_

_"…I really don't care too much for paper….I'd rather sign digitally forms and documents from my iPhone digitally... I like the way digitally it talks to me and I can change the speed so I can hear whatever is on that screen clearly, rather than taking my I my accessibility item…"  - Participant 9, uses AT_

Finding 2

**Participants have a wide range of physical and digital forms of Veteran Identifications on hand that get the job done**

Participants have a range of types of Veteran identification.  All participants had either a VA retiree card, the VHIC or the VIC.  Often, they also have more informal methods of identification, including on their drivers license or an article of clothing.  When a Veteran is trying to access a discount, these tools are successful and often on hand.  Digitally, most participants were familiar with ID.me.  The most common challenge reported with ID.me was forgetting passwords.

_“...my military ID. It's always readily right, right behind my driver's license.” - Participant 7_

Finding 3

**For veterans, learning about discounts is inextricably linked to accessing them.**

Veterans learn about discounts from a range of sources, including Veteran organization newsletters, online and physical communities.  A main way Veterans learn about and access discounts is to ask.  An example of what this process looks like can be found with Participant #2, who describes asking the waiter at a local restaurant - where he had been before -  for the discount.  In this case, his (retiree) card and Veteran cap were sufficient:

_[Participant 2]: I tell ‘em, I want my VA discount.. And then they respond either yes or no…_
_[Facilitator]: [You were talking to] the waiter or the waitress…Did they check?_
_[Participant 2]: I showed 'em my card… they didn't have to ask…sometimes, I have my hat on my, my veterans cap…do you don't have to, you don't have to show that the card._

Finding 4

**Although asking about a discount is a critical way to learn about them, all Veterans are not equally comfortable doing so.**

Unsurprisingly, asking for a veteran discount was not comfortable for all participants, especially women participants, who recounted tales of having their veteran status questioned.  This requirement - needing to ask for and verify their Veteran status - places an extra burden on these veterans.  

_“It's kind of embarrassing to ask for. I'm not comfortable with asking for a discount... ​​I'm surprised a lot of times when I am out with my [female] Navy friends and they jump through hoops to make sure that we get the discount. I let 'em go ahead and make a fool of themselves.” - Participant 3_

Finding 5

**Veterans want to learn about discounts in a way that makes it easier for them to access the discount.**

Since knowing about a discount can be a hurdle, participants described a tool that would help them learn about discounts and access them.  Examples include a website with a master list of discounts available or a digital locator tool.  Participant 10’s “Discount Locator” exemplifies this combined tool participants described:

_“An app that you could check and see the places that do offer the discounts…maybe you could have your proof of your ID on there and you could show it to the people so that we don't have to pull out your ID every time…”_

Other ideas included:


* An app that allows in-app purchases that are picked up in store
* An app that locates discounts and generates a QR code to be used in store

Finding 6

**Participants were excited by the idea of an easy-to-access tool on a mobile device (e.g. mobile wallet).**

A digital tool that lived on their mobile wallet appealed to several users.  Participants who described this kind of tool focused on convenience (one less thing to keep track of, hard to lose) and familiarity with the mobile wallet.  Participant 11 described a similar type of card in her digital wallet which she called the **“VAllet”**, a digital ID:

_“The same place as my credit card…say…I'm walking and which I do pretty much every day.. [I] throw my wallet in the trunk and then I can just walk with my phone.  Say I want coffee or water or whatever, I can just flip my wallet open and boom, use that so I don't have to carry my physical wallet around, you know, with the ID in it.” - Participant 11_

Other ideas included:

* An app that generated a unique barcode that could be scanned by retailers

Finding 7

**Blind veterans in particular would value a mobile card**

The convenience and accessibility of a mobile wallet especially appealed to blind veterans, who can struggle with physical or paper cards that they cannot easily access or understand.  

“_I can open it up using my voice..I don't have to go through my wallet. I don't have to open up my backpack…  since I'm blind, I don't carry a purse in my hands 'cause I have the, you know, you have to have one hand using a dog or using a cane… I often have my phone out… it's easier for blind people to open up an app on your phone and, and find it.….[and] you could ask Siri ‘open up my wallet. Okay. Find this’...you don't have to touch your phone.. a lot of the blinded veterans that I know, we use Siri a lot.” - Participant 4_

_“A digital card appeases me much better having a digit card appeases me much better because it's more convenient. It's right there embedded in that phone. So you can use whatever you are using on the phone with that card. You don't have to go and dig in your purse for a paper or plastic card…” - Participant 9_

Finding 8

**When it comes to finding tools, participants gravitated to private sector or VA-agnostic destinations.**

When it came to naming the tool, participants focused on clear and plain language.  Examples of names for this tool that participants included: Discount Locator, Veteran Friendly Discounts, VAllet, Military Discounts.  

For the most part, participants said they would first look on Google, VA community organizations , the mobile app store or retailers themselves for information on how to access Veteran discounts before looking on VA.gov itself.  Participants 7 and 11 are examples of the less common approach.  They describe eventually looking at VA.gov because other sources ultimately all make contact with the VA and VA.gov.  When looking for the mobile wallet tool, after Google, Participant 7 would expect to find this tool on

_“…all of our military sites…all of the VA sites should be able to point you to it, you know, have some banner advertisements you know, register here and so we can verify you so you can get your digital ID”._


## **Recommendations**

* For veterans, being aware of available discounts is a more pressing pain point than having the tools needed to access them.  Consider focusing on a solution that makes discounts easier to find, via a digital tool or website.
* Focus on accessibility and how accessible digital cards can drastically improve the lived experiences of blind veterans.  Consider a solution such as a card for a mobile wallet or other solution that lends itself to voice activation.

## **Who we talked to**

Recruitment criteria

Recruitment focused on participants’ use of veteran discounts.  All participants must have used and been denied a  Veteran discount at least once in the past 6 months.  A further breakdown of recruitment criteria can be found in the Research Plan or Recruitment Request ticket.  We targeted 8 interviews to complete, but ultimately we talked to **12** veteran participants.
