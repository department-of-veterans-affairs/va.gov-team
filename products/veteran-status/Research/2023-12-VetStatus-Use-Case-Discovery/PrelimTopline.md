This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


## Research Questions and Insights


### Research Question #1: How do participants currently access and engage with VA benefits using digital and physical tools? 

**Insight #1: Digital first**

Most  participants (9/12) expressed that they prefer to access most of their benefits digitally, either online or on the phone.  They cited a number of benefits to online access, including decreased wait times, easier to communicate with Primary Care Physicians and schedule Appointments.  2 out of 3 AT users expressed they preferred digital because it is more accessible, the 1 AT user who did not struggles with technology in general and relies on his wife to navigate many of his benefits.  

**Insight #2: Multiple tools**

When it comes to VA identification, participants had a range of tools to do so.  Formally, they include VA retiree card, the VHIC and the VIC.  They also have more informal methods of identification, including on their drivers license or an article of clothing.  When a Veteran is trying to access a discount, these tools are successful.


### Research Question #2: How do veterans currently access store discounts? What does that process look like? What tools do they use?

**Insight #3: For veterans, learning about discounts is inextricably linked to accessing them.**

Veterans learn about discounts from a range of sources, including Veteran organization newsletters, online and physical communities.  One of the major ways participants learned about Veteran discounts was to ask.  An example of what this process looks like can be found with Participant #2, who describes asking the waiter at a local restaurant - where he had been before -  for the discount.  In this case, his (retiree) card and Veteran cap were sufficient:

_[Participant 2]:I tell ‘em, I want my VA discount.. And then they respond either yes or no…_

_[Facilitator]: [You were talking to] the waiter or the waitress…Did they check?_

_[Participant 2]: I showed 'em my card… they didn't have to ask…sometimes, I have my hat on my, my veterans cap…do you don't have to, you don't have to show that [the card]._


**Insight #4: Although asking about a discount is a critical way to learn about them, all Veterans are not equally comfortable doing so.**

Unsurprisingly, asking for a veteran discount was not comfortable for all participants, especially women participants, who recounted tales of having their veteran status questioned.  This requirement - needing to ask for and verify their Veteran status - places an extra burden on these veterans.  For example, Participant 3 describes: 

_“It's kind of embarrassing to ask for. I'm not comfortable with asking for a discount... ​​I'm surprised a lot of times when I am out with my [female] Navy friends and they jump through hoops to make sure that we get the discount. I let 'em go ahead and make a fool of themselves.”_


### Research Question #3: How would participants like to access store discounts? What tools would help them do so?

**Insight #5: Veterans continued to link learning about a discount with access.  They wanted to learn about discounts in a way that makes it easier for them to access the discount.** 

Since knowing about a discount can be a hurdle, participants described a tool that would help them learn about discounts and access them.  Examples include a website with a master list of discounts available or a digital locator tool.  Participant 10’s “Discount Locator” exemplifies this combined tool participants described:

_“An app that you could check and see the places that do offer the discounts…maybe you could have your proof of your ID on there and you could show it to the people so that we don't have to pull out your ID every time…”_

Participant 10 would expect to find the “Discount Locator” is the app store or in another way that could be downloaded on her phone.  

**Insight #6: For some veterans, especially the AT users, an easy to access tool on a mobile device (such as a mobile wallet) was appealing.**

A digital tool that lived on their mobile wallet appealed to several users.  Participants who described this kind of tool focused on convenience (one less thing to keep track of, hard to lose) and familiarity with the mobile wallet (as one said, her credit card is already there).  A digital tool was particularly appealing to blind participants.  Participant 4 described her vision of this tool:

_“... you can't lose it…You don't pull those digital cards out of your phone. They stay in there….[and] you could ask Siri ‘open up my wallet. Okay. Find this’...you don't have to touch your phone.. a lot of the blinded veterans that I know, we use Siri a lot.” - Participant 4_

Participant 11 described a similar type of card in her digital wallet which she called the “VAllet” (sounds like wallet it but with a v instead of a w).  If she knew the ‘VAllet’ existed, Participant 11 would start searching for it on Google or a VA newsletter, and if nothing showed up there she would then go search VA.gov.


### Research Question #4: Where would participants expect to find these tools?

**Insight #7: When it comes to finding tools to help them access Veteran discounts, participants gravitated to private sector or VA-agnostic online resources.**

For the most part, participants said they would first look on Google, VA community organizations or retailers themselves for information on how to access Veteran discounts before looking on VA.gov itself.  Participants  2 and 3, for example, both stated that they would look on the retailer’s website.

Participants 7 and 11 are examples of the less common approach.  Similar to Participant 11, Participant 7 also described eventually looking at VA.gov because other places she would look for ultimately all make contact with the VA and VA.gov.  When looking for the mobile wallet tool, after Google, Participant 7 would expect to find _“…all of our military sites…all of the VA sites should be able to point you to it, you know, have some banner advertisements, you know, register here and so we can verify you so you can get your digital ID”._
