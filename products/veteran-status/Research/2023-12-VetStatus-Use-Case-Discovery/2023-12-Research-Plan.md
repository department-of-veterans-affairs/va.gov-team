# Research Plan for Veteran Status, Use Case Discovery, December 2023 


## Background
The Veteran Status product aims to provide simplified access to Veterans Status information to Veterans on VA.gov to ease their ability to access non-VA benefits and discounts.  This generative discovery research aims to provide foundational insights into veterans’ current experiences accessing discounts at service providers to inform the future of this omni-channel experience.  More about this effort can be found in the Veteran Status Product Brief.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience


### Veteran Journey
This research fits into all of the Veteran’s Journey post-service, but most specifically: 

- Putting down roots

	- Maintaining my financial, social and emotional health 
 	- Saving for my retirement
	- Engaging VA to access benefits and services


## Research Goals	
This study will explore how and when veterans use veteran discounts at retail service providers.  We will learn more about how and when veterans use veteran specific discounts in retail stores and non-VA health care providers; what their current process is (when, where, medium, etc), what tools they use and what stumbling blocks they encounter. 

### Outcome
This research will provide greater insight into the veterans’ experience accessing veteran discounts.  This will inform content and approach for the Veteran Status product as documented in the Product Brief.  

### Research questions
-  How do participants currently access and engage with VA benefits using digital and physical tools?
-  How do veterans currently access store discounts? What does that process look like?  What tools do they use?
-  How would participants like to access store discounts?  What tools would help them do so?
-  [Time permitting] Where would participants expect to find these tools?


## Methodology	
We will conduct remote interviews with minimum 8 veterans over Zoom. These interviews will include questions relating to how veterans access veteran specific discounts at different retailers.


### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.
