## Studies / Problems to Learn About

### Need 1: Use case discovery  --- NOW
This study will explore how and when veterans want to use proof of veteran status.  It will seek to understand how and when vets use store discounts, what their current process is (when, where, medium, etc) and what their current pain points are.  It will use the critical incident technique to focus on a time when a vet wanted to use a discount at a store but was unable to do so.  

### Need 2: Findability --- NEXT 
This study would operate under the premise that a user knows that there is a way to see proof of their service on VA.gov (specifically My VA).  If  a user knows that this can be found, where do they look for it?  This study would test the labeling "Proof of Veteran Status" and 2 hypothesized placements of the Proof of Veteran Status page.   It requires the team to have an idea of where they hypothesize this page should live.  We could also collect some shallow qualitative data about how participants interpret the purpose of the page and how they imagine they could use it. 

### Need 3: Post-launch follow up tracking? --- LATER? 
Once we have launched the page, we need a way to monitor how it is being used.  This could include metrics from Google Analytics and/or pop-up feedback surveys.
