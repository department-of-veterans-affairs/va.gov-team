### Test Users & Scenarios
[Login credentials for test users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/mvi-staging-users.csv)
- LOA3 user that is eligible for the Veteran Status Card \- vets.gov.user+127@gmail.com 
- LOA3 user that is not eligible for the Veteran Status Card and receives the “You’re not eligible for a Veteran Status Card” error message \- vets.gov.user+32@gmail.com 
- LOA3 user who we need more information from to see if they are eligible for the Veteran Status Card and receives the error message “There’s a problem with your discharge status records”. \- vets.gov.user+57@gmail.com
- LOA3 user who is eligible for the Veteran Status Card but has no service history and receives the error message “There’s a problem with your discharge status records”. \- vets.gov.user+90@gmail.com 
- LOA3 user that receives a system error or error message \- vets.gov.user+41@gmail.com 
- LOA3 user that is eligible for the Veteran Status Card, but has no disability rating information. When this user views their Veteran Status Card the disability rating will not be displayed on the card. \- Judy.Morrison@id.me - [link to login credentials](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/0a32dce79d24712c1da04920177f334712c01b33/Administrative/vagov-users/CommunityCareUSERInfo.MD#staging-user-9997)
- LOA1 user will receive a message to “Verify your identity” \- Signup and create an account in Staging via idme and it will be LOA1. For example, you could do vagovtest+myloa1@gmail.com (you would need to control vagovtest@gmail.com to retrieve MFA code), but in general it just needs an email so you can go through idme.
- Test scenarios that were tested locally due to not having a test user or being able to force an error include:
  - A test user who is eligible for the Veteran Status Card and a 0% disability rating. The expected result is that users see a 0% disability rating on their card.
  - A test user who is eligible for the Veteran Status Card, but the PDF link isn't working. The expected result is that the user will see an error message "Something went wrong" in the How do I get my version of my Veteran Status Card" FAQ setion.
  - When the Veteran Status Card page is down for maintenance. The expected result is an error message that states "This application is down for maintenance".
- Profile hub page has a new Veteran Status Card box with the following link, "View your Veteran Status Card". This link will take a user to the Veteran Status Card page where they can find their Veteran Status Card or a respective error message telling them why they can't retrieve a Veteran Status Card. Test with any of the test users listed above. 
- Military Information page no longer displays the Veteran Status Card section, but will provide the following links for users: "Learn how to request your DD214 and other military records" and "Access your Veteran Status Card". The "Access your Veteran Status Card" link will take a user to the Veteran Status Card page. Test with any of the test users listed above.
