# **Research Goals**

As Veterans begin their journey with VA, verifying their Veteran status becomes essential for accessing discounts and other benefits. A reliable and accessible Veteran Status Card (VSC) ensures Veterans can easily access the benefits they deserve. Key moments that matter include Getting out, Starting up, and Taking care of myself.

The purpose of this research is to **get Veteran feedback on the new Veteran status card designs on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) and the VA Health and Benefits app**.

Based on on our findings, usability adjustments will be made to the Veteran status card on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) and the VA Health and Benefits app.

# **Research Questions**

- RQ1: What are the most common scenarios where Veterans need to prove their status?
- RQ2: What methods do Veterans currently use to verify their status, and how effective are these methods?
- RQ3: What are the primary challenges Veterans face when attempting to prove their status?
- RQ4: What are the usability issues and pain points associated with the current Veteran Status Card ?
- RQ5: How do Veterans perceive the redesigned Veteran Status Card in terms of ease of use, functionality, and overall satisfaction?

# **Methodology**

- Interview - For understanding current Veteran verification processes.
- Usability testing - For usability testing of the new prototype
- Contextual inquiry - For reviewing current process of finding and presenting Proof of Veteran Status.

# **Hypotheses and Conclusion**

Our hypothesis is that participants will prefer the updated designs and will also provide additional feedback on ways to improve it. Since the goal is to make usability adjustments to the Veteran status card, the only way to validate and expand on these adjustments is through testing.

**Conclusion: *Definitely True!***

Participants overwhelmingly prefer the prototype over the current version, citing its polished design, ease of use, and helpful features.

The prototype was perceived as cleaner, easier to use, more direct, and more straightforward by all 9 participants.

# **Key Findings**

### **RQ1: Veterans commonly need to verify status for medical, financial, and retail benefits**

Veterans frequently verify their status to access healthcare services at VA clinics, claim tax exemptions at the state and federal levels, and secure discounts at businesses or resturants. Other common scenarios include verifying military service for employment applications, government facility access, and formal identification in various contexts. 

### **RQ2: Veterans use physical IDs but see potential in digital alternatives**

Most Veterans rely on physical IDs, such as state-issued Veteran designations, military IDs, or VA health identification cards (VHIC), to verify their status. While these methods are effective in formal settings, **many Veterans see the Veteran Status Card (VSC) as a convenient digital alternative,** especially when physical IDs are unavailable. 

### **RQ3: Veterans face challenges with inconsistent requirements and privacy concerns**

Veterans often struggle with inconsistent verification requirements across institutions, leading to confusion about which documents or IDs are needed in different situations. Privacy concerns are another major issue, with Veterans expressing discomfort over sharing sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers or disability ratings, when verifying their status.

### **RQ4: Current Veteran Status Card faces criticism for design and usability**

The existing VSC (both web and app versions), is widely criticized for lacking professionalism, practicality, and feel of legitimacy. Veterans find the paper cut-out cards unprofessional and easily damaged, while the app design lacks the credibility of an official ID. Navigation issues, such as difficulty locating the card on the platforms, exacerbate these challenges. 

### **RQ5: Redesigned Veteran Status Card earns praise but room for improvement remains**

The redesigned VSC is highly regarded for its professional appearance, ease of use, and modern features like explicit labeling and VA branding. Veterans appreciated the streamlined design and the removal of sensitive details, which enhance usability and privacy. However, they noted the need for photo integration to improve the card’s credibility and acceptance in formal settings. While the redesign addresses many concerns, additional features such as toggleable disability ratings and expanded support options could further enhance its functionality and appeal.

# **Details of findings & recommendations**

## Interview: Veteran verification

### Identity verification is essential for Veterans to access benefits

Veterans must consistently verify their identity and status to access essential benefits, including medical care, tax exemptions, and discounts. This verification is required at clinics, military bases, businesses, and other locations to confirm eligibility.

### Veterans rely on physical IDs to verify status

Physical IDs, such as state-issued IDs with Veteran designations, Military IDs, or VA Health Identification Cards (VHIC), are the primary tools Veterans use to verify their identity.

*“I show my Military ID for discounts or my VA Health card—whichever one I get to first.”– P10* 

*“Whichever one I grab first in the back of my phone is what I show.”– P4*

### Veterans see value in the Veteran Status Card as a digital alternative

The Veteran Status Card (VSC) offers convenience as a digital option, particularly when physical IDs are unavailable. Veterans see potential in its use for quick verifications, discounts, and travel, despite concerns about its universal acceptance.

*“In a pinch, if I just had my phone, this would be perfect.”– P5*

*“I don’t have to dig through my purse or wallet… just pull up the card on my phone.”– P3*

### Veterans emphasize compatibility and functionality for the Veteran Status Card

Veterans highlighted the importance of the VSC being accepted at VA clinics and military bases. They emphasized ease of use and compatibility for various scenarios, recommending features like barcodes for seamless verification.

*"If this card works for VA clinics and bases, it’s a win. It’s simple, clear, and useful.”– P13*

## Contextual Inquiry: Current Web Version

### Paper cut-out cards lack professionalism and usability

Veterans criticized the web version for offering only a paper cut-out option, describing it as unprofessional, outdated, and impractical. They preferred digital versions for their legitimacy and ease of use, calling for a more durable and polished design.

*“I don’t think I would use this one… If I did, I would have to pull out an ID.”– P14*

*“For a bank or medical office, they’d probably laugh at me if I showed this.”– P2*

*“Paper just does not work in my wallet… it tears up.”– P3*

### Navigation challenges hinder card accessibility

Veterans struggled to locate the card on the web version, citing its placement under "Military Information" as unclear. They recommended making the card more prominent and easier to access.

*“I think of military information as records... not current proof of status.”– P2*

*“I didn’t know it was under my name… it should be easier to find.”– P3*

---

## Contextual Inquiry: Current App Version

### Full page design undermines credibility

Veterans criticized the app’s VSC for its unprofessional design, stating it lacked the appearance of an official ID and diminished confidence in its legitimacy.

*“It just looks like a page someone pulled up... Anyone could make this.”– P4*

*"This just looks like a page… It doesn’t feel like an actual ID.”– P9*

### Clear labeling needed to indicate cardholder status

Veterans noted the app lacked explicit text identifying the cardholder as a Veteran, emphasizing the importance of direct and clear labeling to clarify its purpose.

*“There is nothing direct about it that says, ‘This person is a Veteran.’”– P4*

---

## Usability Testing: Redesigned Both Versions

### **Many Veterans prefer full service dates to enhance credibility**

Veterans expressed a preference for including full service dates on the card, as it added credibility and made the card more useful in official contexts. The removal of this information was seen as a limitation, with some emphasizing the importance of having complete details for verification purposes.

*"If I was verifying something… I would prefer you to have the whole thing instead of just a year." – P10*

### Strong preference for redesigned card’s polished design

The redesigned VSC was overwhelmingly preferred for its professional appearance, usability, and all-in-one layout. Veterans felt it looked and functioned like an official card.

*“This one feels legitimate... I’d have no problem showing this as proof.”– P4*

*"It looks more legit than the current one… It feels like an actual card.”– P9*

### Clear introduction text enhances legitimacy

Veterans valued the professional introduction text, which clarified the card’s purpose and use. The language and emblem conveyed authority and increased confidence in its legitimacy.

*"The status isn’t for me; it’s for them [businesses].”– P11*

### Explicit labeling as "Veteran Status Card" improves usability

Veterans appreciated the explicit labeling of the card, which enhanced clarity and legitimacy. The simplified design reduced confusion and made status verification easier.

*“I like that it actually says Veteran Status Card at the top.”– P4*

*“It actually said ‘card,’ and that’s what I’m looking for.”– P5*

### VA branding adds credibility

Veterans felt the VA logo and branding increased the card’s credibility. The improved layout and use of the VA emblem made the card appear more official and professional.

*"The emblem tells other people it’s official.”– P11*

*"Because this has the word VA on it and it has the logo, people would take it more seriously.”– P3*

### Inclusion of DoD ID enhances credibility

The addition of the DoD ID number was viewed as a credibility booster. Though not widely recognized, it legitimized the card for official use and provided practical utility.

*“I was asked for my DoD ID the other day, and I had to go look it up. This would be easier.”*

*“It just gives it more credibility… people see Department of Defense ID and think, ‘This person is somebody.’”– P3*

### Removal of sensitive details improves privacy

Veterans appreciated the omission of sensitive details, such as birthdates, in the redesigned card. This change enhanced privacy while maintaining functionality.

*“Nobody’s using this card to prove their age, so you don’t need the birthday on there.”– P4*

*“The less personal information a person can gather about you, the better.”– P3*

### FAQs boost confidence and clarity

The redesigned card included FAQs to address common questions and provide instructions, which Veterans found helpful and confidence-building.

*“Having the FAQs there makes it easier… instead of having to call someone.”– P9*

## Usability Testing: Redesigned Web Version

### Improved access through redesigned profile and name tag

Veterans appreciated the redesigned profile’s clear categorization and inclusion of Veteran status card in the name tag, which made the card easier to locate and access.

*“Now it’s instantly clear where to go... that’s much better.”– P2*

## Usability Testing: Redesigned App Version

### Streamlined, scroll-free layout improves usability

Veterans preferred the redesigned app for its concise, one-screen layout. Eliminating unnecessary scrolling improved accessibility and aesthetics.

*“What you needed was right there. You didn’t need to go up or down.”– P5*

---

## Future Consideration

### **Photo inclusion enhances authenticity and usability**

Adding a photo was seen as critical for improving the card’s credibility and versatility. Veterans highlighted the importance of a photo ID to prevent misuse and ensure acceptance.

**Recommendation:** Consider integrating a photo upload feature into the Veteran Status Card platform. This optional feature would allow Veterans to include a photo on their card, enhancing its security, credibility, and usability in formal settings where photo ID is often required.

*"It seems like these days people want photo ID because of identity theft."– P5*

### **Many Veterans prefer not to display their disability rating**

Veterans expressed discomfort with having their disability rating visible on the card, emphasizing privacy concerns. They suggested a toggle feature that would allow them to display or hide the rating based on the situation, ensuring greater control over their personal information.

*"Maybe you could toggle it on and off... IHOP doesn’t need to know my rating." – P2*

### **Digital cards preferred, but physical options remain important**

While most Veterans preferred a digital card, they highlighted the need for a durable physical solutions for older Veterans or official submissions. Many Veterans also expressed strong dissatisfaction with the current paper cut-out version of the Veteran Status Card, describing it as unprofessional and impractical.

**Recommendation:** Eliminate the paper cut-out version of the VSC entirely and instead provide a credible alternative, such as a **letter of benefits summary**. This official document would serve as a polished and professional option for Veterans who need physical proof of their status, particularly for formal or offline use cases.

*"For older vets or those without Google Wallet, the print option is essential."– P2*

### **Expanded contact options improve support accessibility**

Veterans recommended including email and chat options for support, along with clearly listed phone support hours, to reduce barriers to assistance.

**Recommendation:** Provide multiple customer support channels, including email, chat, and clearly defined phone support hours, to accommodate diverse communication preferences and improve accessibility for all Veterans.

*"A lot of people get anxiety talking on the phone... Sending an email is more convenient."– P4*
