### **1. Which Veterans are eligible for the card?**

### **Definition of a Veteran**:

According to **38 CFR § 3.1(d)** (*Veteran definition*):

> "Veteran means a person who served in the active military, naval, air, or space service and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable."
> 

This definition establishes the baseline for determining Veteran status for VIC eligibility. However, **38 CFR § 3.12** (*Character of discharge*) clarifies specific conditions that may bar eligibility for VA benefits, including the VIC.

### **Active service**

To be considered a Veteran, you must have served in the military (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Space Force, or Coast Guard) in one of the following capacities:

- **Active duty**: Full-time service in the armed forces.
- **Active duty for training**: Training duty where you became disabled or died from an illness or injury related to service.
- **Inactive duty training**: Part-time training (like weekend drills) where you were injured, became disabled, or had a serious medical event (e.g., a heart attack or stroke) caused by service.

**Quote from §3.6(a) –** (*Active service)***:**

> "Active military, naval, air, or space service includes active duty, any period of active duty for training during which the individual was disabled or died from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty, and any period of inactive duty training during which the individual was disabled or died from an injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty or from certain medical conditions such as acute myocardial infarction, a cardiac arrest, or a cerebrovascular accident occurring during such training."
> 

### **Discharge status**

Your service must have ended under conditions that are **not dishonorable** to qualify as a Veteran. Acceptable discharges include "honorable" or "general under honorable conditions."

**Quote from §3.12(a):**

> "Pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation is not payable unless the period of service on which the claim is based was terminated by discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable."
> 

Dishonorable discharges generally disqualify you, but some cases may be reviewed or upgraded by the VA.

### **Minimum service requirement**

You usually need to have served:

- At least **24 months of continuous active duty**, or
- The **full period** of your service obligation (e.g., a 4-year enlistment).

Exceptions exist if you were discharged early for hardship, injury, or other valid reasons.

**Quote from §3.12a(a) –** (*Minimum service requirements*)**:**

> "A person who originally enlists in a regular component of the Armed Forces after September 7, 1980, or who enters on active duty after October 16, 1981, and who does not complete a minimum period of service of 24 months of continuous active duty or the full period for which such person was called or ordered to active duty, is not eligible for any benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs."
> 

### **Special recognitions**

Some groups are recognized as Veterans even if they didn’t serve in traditional active-duty roles. For example:

- Members of the **Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs)** during WWII.
- Certain **Filipino forces** during WWII.

**Quote from §3.7(a) –**(*Certain groups certified as active service*)**:**

> "Service in the following groups has been certified as active military service and is therefore considered active duty for the purposes of all laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs."
> 

### **Proof of service**

You must provide official documents to prove your service and discharge status.

The most common document is the **DD Form 214** (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).

**Quote from §3.203(a) –** (*Proof of service*)**:**

> "For the purpose of establishing entitlement to VA benefits, the Department of Veterans Affairs may accept evidence of service submitted by a claimant (or sent directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs by the service department), such as a DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty."
> 

---

### **Discharge types and eligibility**:

Eligibility for the VIC depends on the Veteran's discharge status. Below is an analysis of each discharge type and its implications:

| **Discharge type** | **Considered a Veteran** | **VIC eligibility** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Honorable discharge** | Yes | Eligible. |
| **General under honorable conditions** | Yes | Eligible. |
| **Other than honorable (OTH)** | Yes (case-specific) | Requires a character of discharge determination or compelling circumstances for eligibility. |
| **Bad conduct discharge (BCD)** | No (general court-martial) | Not eligible unless upgraded or insanity exception applies. |
| **Dishonorable discharge** | No | Not eligible under any circumstances unless the discharge is upgraded or the insanity exception applies. |
| **Uncharacterized discharge** | Case-specific | Eligibility depends on service details and circumstances. |

---

### **Bars to eligibility for the VIC**:

A **bar** (a condition that disqualifies a Veteran from receiving VA benefits, including the VIC) applies under **38 CFR § 3.12** (*Character of discharge*) in the following cases:

1. **Statutory bars** (*§ 3.12(c)*):
    - Includes discharges for conscientious objection, 180+ days AWOL, mutiny, spying, aiding the enemy, or general court-martial.
2. **Regulatory bars** (*§ 3.12(d)*):
    - Includes discharges for willful/persistent misconduct, moral turpitude (e.g., felonies), or avoiding trial by court-martial.
3. **Exceptions** (*§ 3.12(e)*):
    - Compelling circumstances (e.g., mental health issues, duress, combat hardships) may remove these disqualifications.

---

### **Additional review options**:

Veterans with disqualifying discharges may pursue the following options to establish eligibility:

- **Character of discharge determination**: A VA process to assess whether service meets the "other than dishonorable" standard for benefits.
- **Discharge upgrade**: Through a military discharge review board or corrections board.

---

### **2. What is required to be on the card?**

Per **38 U.S. Code § 5706(b)** (*Veterans identification card*), the Veterans Identification Card (VIC) must include the following:

1. **Photograph of the Veteran**:
    
    > “Displays a photograph of the Veteran.”
    > 
    
    > Source: 38 U.S. Code § 5706(b)(1) (Veterans identification card).
    > 
2. **Name of the Veteran**:
    
    > “Displays the name of the Veteran.”
    > 
    
    > Source: 38 U.S. Code § 5706(b)(2) (Veterans identification card).
    > 
3. **Disclaimer on benefits**:
    
    > “Explains that such card is not proof of any benefits to which the Veteran is entitled.”
    > 
    
    > Source: 38 U.S. Code § 5706(b)(3) (Veterans identification card).
    > 
4. **Identification number**:
    
    > “Contains an identification number that is not a social security number.”
    > 
    
    > Source: 38 U.S. Code § 5706(b)(4) (Veterans identification card).
    > 
5. **Proof of service**:
    
    > “Serves as proof that such Veteran—(A) served in the Armed Forces; and (B) has a Department of Defense form DD–214 or other official document in the official military personnel file of the Veteran that describes the service of the Veteran.”
    > 
    
    > Source: 38 U.S. Code § 5706(b)(5) (Veterans identification card).
    >

### **3. How the card is required to be delivered/accessed by users**

### **Issuance of the card**:

Per **38 U.S. Code § 5706(a)** (*Veterans identification card*):

> "The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall issue an identification card… to each Veteran who—(1) requests such card; (2) presents a copy of Department of Defense form DD–214 or other official document from the official military personnel file of the Veteran that describes the service of the Veteran; and (3) pays the fee under subsection (c)(1)."
> 

The statute emphasizes issuing a **card**. Whether physical or digital, the card must be a tangible or portable form of identification that satisfies the statutory requirement.

### **4. How the VIC may be used to access MWR facilities**

Under **10 U.S. Code § 1065** (*MWR access*), the VIC can be used to verify eligibility for access to **Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR)** facilities, provided the Veteran qualifies under the eligibility criteria:

### **Eligibility for MWR access**:

The following Veterans are eligible for MWR access under **10 U.S. Code § 1065** (*MWR access*):

- Veterans awarded the **Purple Heart**.
- **Medal of Honor recipients**.
- **Former prisoners of war**.
- Veterans with a **service-connected disability**.

### **Using the VIC for MWR access**:

1. **Verification of Eligibility:**  
  The VIC can be presented at MWR facilities as proof of the Veteran’s eligibility, as it confirms their service and discharge status.  
  - Additional documentation (e.g., disability rating letter) may be required for Veterans with service-connected disabilities.  

2. **Current Limitations:**  
  The VIC does not currently include specific indicators that would allow MWR access beyond confirming service-connected disabilities. This creates challenges for verifying eligibility for other qualifying categories (e.g., Purple Heart recipients, former POWs).  

3. **Future Updates:**  
  A future iteration of the VIC is expected to replace the disability rating marker with a "service-connected" indicator and potentially expand eligibility markers, simplifying MWR access for eligible Veterans.

### **Final notes**

Transitioning from “Proof of Veteran status” to “Veteran status card” ensures compliance with the statutory mandate for a tangible or portable “card.” As the VIC evolves into the VSC, it must meet this requirement, aligning with the law’s intent and providing clear, usable identification.

The VIC provides general proof of Veteran status but does not show specific eligibility for MWR facilities under 10 U.S. Code § 1065 (e.g., Purple Heart or service-connected disability). Additional documentation, such as a VA disability rating letter or award citation, may be required to confirm eligibility. Adding eligibility markers to the VIC could simplify access.
