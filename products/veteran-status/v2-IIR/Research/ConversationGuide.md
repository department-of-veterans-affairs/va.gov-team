**Intro (5 minutes)**

Hi [participant name], thanks for joining us today! My name is David, and Megan will be taking notes. We may have a couple of other colleagues observing the session to gain additional insights.

Before we begin, I'd like to go over a few things:

- This session should take about 60 minutes. We'll keep an eye on the time and may occasionally prompt you to move on to the next question or task.
- We value your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers, and we're not testing your knowledge. Feel free to share any thoughts or feedback you have.
- Your participation is voluntary. You can stop the session or decline to answer a question at any time.
- Are you comfortable with observers joining the session?
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers and ask them for a brief introduction. Then, request they turn off their cameras to save bandwidth.
- Are you comfortable with us recording the screen and audio for research purposes? Recordings will be destroyed after analysis, and your comments won't be attributed to you directly. Knowing this, are you comfortable with recording?
