# Veteran Status Card Redesign Product Brief

## Overview

The IIR team has redesigned the Veteran Status Card in the mobile app (their product brief is [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-status/v2-IIR/new-home-and-ux-product-outline.md)), and they have asked us to support the implementation of this effort for the mobile app.

## Problem Statement

Mobile app and Va.gov designs are not aligned for the Veteran Status Card. How might we ease the burden of Veterans accessing their Veteran Status Card by creating a cohesive design experience between the web and mobile app. 

## Desired Outcomes

* Veterans have consistent designs of the Veteran Status Card on both the web and mobile.  
* Veterans can easily access their Veteran Status Card, since the designs align with industry standards.

## Measuring Success
