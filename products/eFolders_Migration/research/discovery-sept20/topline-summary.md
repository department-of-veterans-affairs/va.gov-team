# Topline Summary

This document highlights the top takeaways from each session. 

Takeaway notes
--------------

### P1:

-   He used eBen to see his DD214 and to check that his appeals materials had been submitted on his behalf

-   Would've expected to find medical records on the claim (e.g. sleep study results)

-   Checks eBenefits often to see status of his open claim

-   Found authentication levels difficult to navigate and struggles with password keeping due to his disability

-   Expects documents to be under Records as "Search historical VA records", but also looks beneath 'Disability' when the document is related to his disability claim. 

-   Defaults to using desktop to deal with VA sites because the mobile experience is poor, but would like to check on mobile.

-   Only had 2 documents, despite having a 5-year-long history with claims at the VA. Expects to see things like disability claims decisions, percentage letters, etc.

-   Would make calls to find missing documents if he wasn't working with a third party

-   Suspects the whole system may be rigged to be confusing so that Vets miss deadlines

-   Looks for categories like: "Claims, award letters, appeals, medical records, service records, things that you would expect to be filed away in a bucket that contains records."

-   Scans and saves documents from the VA digitally, would like the tool to work similarly to iCloud/Gdrive, where he makes folders and categorizes his documents.

-   Noted that, if he's looking up a document, someone is probably asking for it, and he would like a way to easily share the PDF.

###  P2: 

-   The participant has previously used the My Documents tool to find documents that she uploaded regarding a disability rating increase 

-   The regularity that she uses the My Documents tool depends; she used it daily when submitting for a disability rating increase but hasn't used it in about 6 months

-   Would like to be able to access medical documents

-   Prefers using desktop to access the tool because the mobile experience is "quirky" and she prefers using a large screen

-   During the[  VA.gov](http://va.gov) IA task, the participant navigated to the Claim Status tool content page to find documents relating to disability claims; expects a location containing all documents to be under the "Records" hub

-   The participant was unsure whether the documents in My Documents were uploaded by her or VA; she had to open multiple documents to figure out what they were about 

-   The only way she was able to determine which documents were uploaded by VA was by the file name looking different than what she would title documents she uploaded

-   She thought that if VA correspondence wasn't included in My Documents, they would be found in a document with keywords such as "VA letters" or "VA correspondence"

-   She expected to be able to save PDFs to print as hard copies 

-   She didn't immediately find the FAQ section; she noticed a link at the top of the page that redirected her to the accordions 

-   Her next step would be to call in order to receive copies of documents not found within the tool

### P3:

-   Has looked on eBenefits for award letters and "broke down" letters in the past, and was able to get the former but had to call for the later. His claims are finished, so he doesn't use eBenefits much now.

-   Looks in the blue area of the homepage, under "Records", but then decides that it would be under Disability, but then clicks into Benefit letters. Decides that "documents" would be under records, but claims related documents would be under disability.

-   Would like to search for specific documents with search function, does not think he'd know date offhand, so he probably wouldn't use it to search.

-   Notices that only documents uploaded online will appear in the list.

-   Would prefer to call because it would be faster than a PAR.

### P4: 

-   Had to search for multiple DD214s which she said she successfully found through eBenefits, although she was unsure if she found the documents through My Documents

-   Usually needs to access documents because she has to forward them to another person 

-   If she needs to sign a document she will view it on her laptop, but she prefers accessing on a mobile device if she's just viewing a document

-   When asked where she'd find documents she's looked for previously, she immediately went to the Claims Status tool and said she'd expect to find documents/letters about her claim there  

-   The participant wasn't able to sign in due to DS Logon being down, so she viewed screenshots of the My Documents tool

-   She said that filtering by form number could be challenging if she didn't know the specific form number she was looking for

-   She mentioned being able to sort by documents she uploaded and documents VA uploaded

-   She liked that the name of the form/document was included in addition to the form number in Document Type filtering

-   She'd prefer seeing no more than five documents per page on her mobile device, whereas she would be fine with seeing ten documents per page on desktop

-   "My Documents, to me, would be actions I've received from the VA that are complete, actions that have some sort of pending status,  or evidence/data I've provided."

-   She'd likely call rather than complete the privacy request form

### P5: 

-   He was looking specifically for prior submissions from his VSO, but found that the VSOs would call him with details before the site would update with them.

-   He was in the military for 20+ years, has been working with the VA for 14, and has had over 12 service-related surgeries. All 16 of his injuries were reported on an initial submission in 2005, but some took many years to get a determination on.

-   He has been using eBenefits for years, and struggles with passwords and security.

-   He would look up his status once a week until a determination was made.

-   Uploaded copies of examinations and injury changes as evidence, injuries have gotten worse with age.

-   If he wants to check documents related to his claim(s), he'd expect to find them under 'Check my claim'

-   If there was a place for all documents, he would expect to find them under Records, and says he'd expect it to be called 'Check your submission'

-   He had no documents on his page, likely due to being submitted by a VSO with another submission method, expected to see the stuff he's uploaded and VA communications. He went to Your VA Letters instead when nothing appeared.

-   When asked which documents he'd like to see, he said "I'd expect to see the application submitted, its status, they got it on such and such date and it's still in processing, or it's before the board."

-   Wasn't sure if the date was when it was submitted or when the VA looked into it -- he wouldn't use date to search and feels he wouldn't know the dates offhand, anyway.

### P7:

-   When asked about which of his uploaded documents he had searched for in the past, he stated that he wanted to find his claim's status. He also said he looked for medical records on eBenefits as well.

-   Notes that all of the pages and passwords are confusing, and he has been locked out of his eBenefits account after someone changed the address for his payments.

-   To find his uploaded documents, he said he would use search with the keyword 'My Medical Records' 

-   After finding his documents, he would save them to a portable harddrive, since he's asked for these things by different parties often. He was impacted by the St Louis records fire, so he has scanned and kept his hard copies as well.

-   Thinks that all documents would be found under Records, and could be called "Get your military documents," which could be segregated by medical records, service records, etc.

-   He is interested in a phase-of-life post-service checklist of benefits and activities that are relevant to him at his age and circumstance.

-   Would like having a search bar to filter down documents, because he does not know the names/numbers of the forms and would find it easier to type in a keyword

-   Feels there should be few results per page, saying he could handle 5-10

-   Believes that the document types should be rolled up, and that it's confusing when there are duplicates.

-   Didn't seem to find the second column of the table helpful (e.g. what do "Correspondence" and "Medical Opinion" mean?)

-   Is concerned that mailed/faxed/hand-delivered documentation may not be valid and would be troubled if the document did not show here.

### P8 

-   She's looked for documents relating to her claim, DD214, and medical documents through eBenefits

-   Searches for documents a few times a year

-   She would expect to find documents in separate places depending on what she's looking for 

-   Pretty much all her documents in the My Documents tool were "Document.pdf" under "Correspondence", so she said she'd have to go through every document to find what she's looking for

-   She said that she named every one of her uploads and thinks she was given an option when selecting "Document Type"

-   She doesn't think she would know the "Received date" offhand

-   She didn't see either of the "Refine by" options above the table

-   She would expect to be able to print out documents once opened, but she also mentioned needing to email documents to doctors sometimes 

-   She has experienced excessive issues in the past calling VA, so her inkling was to look into the privacy act request section before considering calling for documents she couldn't find in the table

-   She expects all documents to be in My Documents; if a document wasn't uploaded online then she would expect the document there with a tag such as "mailed", "faxed", or "hand-delivered"

### P10

-   Most recently searched for documents about two years ago; however, she didn't remember which site she visited because of her experience being bounced around the multiple VA sites 

-   Expressed frustration with the sign in process and how confusing it is navigating the multiple VA sites 

-   She compared her experience using VA sites with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. She said bouncing between the two sites is intuitive and the separate sites speak to each other in a way that the VA sites don't

-   When asked where she would expect to find the documents she's looked for in the past, she navigated to the "Claims status tool"

-   She took a look at the first claim in the tool and expressed frustration with being unable to click on any of the documents she submitted 

-   "Why cant I click on it and see? What if I don't remember - like now? What if I need to appeal it and I need to see what I sent?"

-   She mentioned wanting to be able to search for documents by keyword or filter by the disability the claim was for so she could view all the documents relating to that claim 

-   She told us that she wouldn't have been able to navigate to view her claims documents in the My Documents tool without the moderator prompting her to go into that tool - finding those documents wasn't an intuitive path

-   Similar to other participants, she was unsure what "Correspondence" meant. Was it documents she uploaded or documents from VA?

-   When asked where she would expect to find all the documents she's uploaded, she mentioned a "block" (presumably one of the white containers on[  VA.gov](http://va.gov)'s homepage) containing something along the lines of "My Documents"

-   Alternatively, she mentioned the documents being found under "Records" with a title such as "My files" or "My uploads"

-   She thought someone on VA's side should be uploading documents that were mailed, faxed, or hand-delivered 

-   She expressed great frustration towards the Privacy act request form because it can take 6 months to receive documents and VA can charge her printing and shipping fees

-   Regardless of these frustrations, she would still prefer to submit the Privacy request act form rather than calling VA 

### P13:

-   When asked about his documents, he assumed we were talking about claims or his health-related documents. He has submitted claims and recently filed for an increase.

-   He usually goes to eBenefits directly rather than searching through VA.gov.

-   He would go to "Check your claim or appeal status" for claim-related documents and "View your lab and test results" for healthcare-related documents.

-   He expected to find supporting documents to be found in the Claim Status Tool

-   Wanted to see these documents to ensure they were submitted properly by opening them, and expected the file names to be links to view those documents. Didn't seem to have a problem with the names of the documents, would just open the documents to see what they were if he was unsure.

-   He does not think all documents should be in a tool together.

-   Even in eBenefits, he expected the documents to be under links like "Work in process" or "Historical Claims"

-   Would not really know a date to search by 

-   When describing how he would like the documents to be organized, he more or less described the CST (i.e. "checklist"

### P14:

-   He's currently on getting disability increase, so he's looked for documents relating to that increase in addition to medical documents

-   He primarily uses VA.gov

-   He prefers going to VA.gov because the information is more up-to-date, and he orders prescriptions through that site

-   Is more likely to access documents using a mobile device, but also uses a laptop

-   He immediately navigated to the CST (Claim status tool) to look for documents relating to his claim.

-   There was some initial difficulty finding the documents because the tool looks different for appeals vs. claims. There isn't a "Files" tab for appeals

-   He expected to be able to open the documents listed in his claim, and when he was unable to and was asked if he would be able to determine what each document contained he stated that the only way he'd be able to tell is by opening the document

-   When he signed into eBenefits and navigated to the My Documents tool, he immediately realized that the documents listed matched those from CST

-   He's more likely to search by Document Type rather than date, but would attempt to search by date if he didn't find what he was looking for

-   If he can't find the document(s) he's looking for, he's more likely to call VA rather than submit a Privacy Request Act because he thinks it's easier to get his questions answered if he talks to a human
