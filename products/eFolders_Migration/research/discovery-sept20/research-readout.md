Goals
=====

Our team wants to get a better understanding of what documents are found in eBenefits' My Documents tool and why Veterans might need those documents.

Background
==========

The My Documents tool needs to be migrated over to VA.gov because eBenefits is being sunsetted. The My Documents tool contains forms and documents that have been digitally submitted by the Veteran or their representative(s). Documents that were mailed in, faxed, or physically submitted reportedly do not appear in the tool. Additionally, some documents may be restricted from user access. Our team wants to uncover reasons why Veterans may use this tool, where they expect it to live on VA.gov, and what pain points they experience using the tool on eBenefits today.

User Research Goal
==================

This study was meant to reveal current tool functionality and Veteran needs as it pertains to their benefit-related documents.

Hypotheses Tested 
==================

-   Veterans will expect to find documents specific to their benefits in individual benefit hubs

-   For example, Veterans will expect to find documents for their benefits claims within the Claims Status tool (CST)

-   Veterans will want to 'type to search' to quickly find the documents they're looking for

-   Veterans may not find the calendar picker component to be an intuitive way to find documents because they may not remember the dates they uploaded the documents they're searching for

-   Veterans may use the My Documents tool for peace of mind that their digitally submitted documents were correctly submitted

-   Veterans may not know what search keywords will return the document(s) they're looking for

Research Method: Guided Interview & Task-based Usability Test 
==============================================================

We spent approximately 10 minutes interviewing participants in order to gauge how regularly they interact with their documents and the legacy eBenefits tool. Afterwards, we prompted them to complete tasks on both VA.gov and the eBenefits My Documents tool.

Who We Spoke With
=================

-   10 total participants (4 female, 6 male, ages from 35-74)

-   Participants served in the following service branches: Army, Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Coast Guard

-   We spoke with participants from both metropolitan and rural areas 

-   Participants had a range of disability ratings; additionally, we spoke with multiple participants with cognitive impairments 

Topics Covered 
===============

-   Veterans' experiences searching for personal documents relating to their VA benefits 

-   Why Veterans need to find these documents 

-   Where Veterans expect to documents on VA.gov 

-   Types of personal documents that appear in participants' My Documents tool, and what documents Veterans expect to find within that tool

-   How Veterans expect to search for the documents they need within the tool

Research Questions
==================

-   What documents do Veterans search for in the My Documents tool and why?

-   How often do Veterans use the existing My Documents tool?

-   How do Veterans use the My Documents tool in relation to the VA benefits that these documents correspond to?

-   Where do Veterans expect to find the My Documents tool on VA.gov?

-   Are the filtering features in the existing My Documents tool intuitive to Veterans?

-   Do Veterans expect a different way to find the document(s) they're looking for?

-   What are Veterans' desired next steps after they've found the document(s) they're looking for?

-   What do Veterans think about the tool potentially containing hundreds or thousands of digitally submitted documents?

-   Do documents sent by VA appear in the My Documents tool?

**1.  Veterans search for a range of personal documents for a variety of reasons**

- 4 participants mentioned searching for their DD214s, which is not found within My Documents

- 6 participants searched for medical-related documents related to their claims 

- 7 participants have searched for documents relating to their claims 

   - Some participants were navigating an appeal and needed to find documents

   - Other participants were interested in finding documents relating to their disability rating(s)

   - Multiple participants were searching to see if their documents had uploaded correctly 

   - 1 participant mentioned searching for letters sent by the VA

**2. Most Veterans initially search for their documents on eBenefits**

- 9 participants searched for documents on eBenefits

- Multiple participants expressed frustration navigating the various VA sites and finding their documents within them

   - A lot of frustration revolved around needing to log into multiple sites and the login process itself

- 1 participant mentioned VA Health

- Some participants were unsure if they had used the My Documents tool

**3. Veterans don't expect to find all their personal documents in one area on VA.gov**

- Nearly every participant stated that documents surrounding their disability claims would be under the disability hub or within the Claim Status Tool (CST)

- Multiple participants mentioned looking in the healthcare hub for medical documents

- Multiple participants navigated into the 'benefits letters' tool to look for letters and documents sent to them by the VA

**4. Veterans expect more documents in My Documents; many were confused by the lack of documents available to view**

- Some participants recognized that there were documents relating to their claims, but some participants expected more documents, particularly those sent in response by the VA. 

- Participants who had navigated to the Claim Status Tool (CST) earlier in the session immediately recognized that the documents were a 1:1 match with CST

- Multiple participants wished that documents mailed, faxed, or hand-delivered were available 

**5. Veterans expect a different way to search for documents compared to the search features available in My Documents** 

- Multiple participants expressed that they'd like "type to search" functionality so they could search keywords such as "claims", "letters", and "conditions"

- Multiple participants also noted that they wouldn't be able to determine documents by VA form number or name 

- Several participants told us that they wouldn't know what date to search for and would rather sort by terms, keywords, or claim.

**6. Veterans want access to personal documents to keep hard copies, ensure documents were correctly submitted, and forward onto other people**

- Multiple participants stated they would want to read the document to ensure it was correct.

- Multiple participants stated that they would save the document in a folder or print it for their records

- Multiple participants mentioned wanting the ability to email the document

   - Some folks need to forward documents to their private doctors and/or attorneys 

**7. Veterans assume that if a document isn't available in My Documents, that means the document is lost within VA or "invalid"**

- Multiple participants said that they'd want to check previously uploaded documents for peace of mind that they were correctly submitted

- Several participants expressed frustration that documents not uploaded will not be represented in the tool

- "What if I need to appeal it and I need to see what I sent?"

- "Get something to drink and start all over again. I guess I would send an inquiry if there was somewhere to do that."

**8. While most Veterans prefer searching for documents using either their desktop or laptop, some Veterans might also use their mobile device**

- Multiple participants mentioned that they've experienced difficulty navigating VA sites using their mobile devices

- Some participants would use both laptop/desktop and mobile device depending on the situation

   - If just viewing, they'd more likely use mobile 

   - If they needed to download, they'd likely use desktop/laptop

**9. Although Veterans have experienced frustrations while calling VA, most prefer calling rather than submitting a Privacy Act Request to access missing documents**

- One participant said they would submit a PAR before calling

- "Calling?? Calling is a nightmare. A series of push 1, push 6, push 32, wait 75 minutes. So, yeah calling would be my very, very last resort EVEN after privacy act. Submitting a privacy act request for my own document is really, really taking it to the limit."

**10. Veterans found document naming conventions to be confusing** 

- Multiple participants didn't understand what the "Correspondence" Document Type meant - were they documents submitted by themselves or VA? 

- One participant wasn't sure what the "Medical Opinion" Document Type meant

- Some participants couldn't tell what the documents were without opening them 

   - One participant had many files that were named "Document.pdf" 

   - One participant named their documents "[Lastname]-#.pdf" (e.g. Walsh-1.pdf, Walsh-2.pdf, etc.)

Recommendations
===============

- The documents available in My Documents should be moved into the Claim Status Tool (CST) since that's where Veterans expect those documents to live

- Documents would logically be located in parity with the claim they are related to

- If filtering functionality is going to be incorporated into the CST, consider using "type to search" so Veterans can search using keywords they're familiar with

- Either include file naming suggestions in the supporting evidence upload section of the CST, or adjust uploaded files to a user-friendly file name so Veterans are able to differentiate between documents

- Explore changing the Document Type dropdown options (i.e. "Correspondence" and "Medical Opinion") to make the designations more useful to Veterans when they return to view the files later.

- Consider the document-viewing experience on mobile since some Veterans are likely to read their documents on their mobile device

- Assess providing links to other areas on VA.gov that house Veterans' documents, such as the Benefits Letters or DD214 tools, in the "Files" tab of the CST

   - This may lessen both the cognitive and time burden on Veterans if they don't find what they're looking for within the CST
