# Research Plan for BaM2, My Documents, September 2020

## Goals
1. **What product & team are you doing this research for?**

This research is for the transition of the My Documents tool from eBenefits to VA.gov led by the Benefits & Memorials 2 team.  

2. **Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

eBenefits is being sunsetted, so the My Documents tool needs to be migrated over to VA.gov. The My Documents tool contains documents that have been digitally uploaded by the Veteran, their representative(s), or potentially VA. Documents that were mailed in, faxed, or physically submitted do not appear in the tool. Additionally, some documents may be restricted from user access. Our team wants to uncover reasons why Veterans may use this tool, where they expect it to live on VA.gov, and what pain points they experience using the tool on eBenefits.

3. **Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?** 

There are two sections with data being pulled from separate API’s, so I have split out the sections 

- What documents do Veterans search for in the My Documents tool and why?

- How often do Veterans use the existing My Documents tool? 

- How do Veterans use the My Documents tool in relation to the VA benefits that these documents correspond to?

- Where do Veterans expect to find the My Documents tool on VA.gov?

- Are the filtering features in the existing My Documents tool intuitive to Veterans?

- Do Veterans expect a different way to find the document(s) they’re looking for? 

- What are Veterans’ desired next steps after they’ve found the document(s) they’re looking for?

- What do Veterans think about the tool potentially containing hundreds or thousands of digitally submitted documents?

- Do documents sent by VA appear in the My Documents tool? 


4. **Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?** 

- Veterans will expect to find documents specific to their benefits in individual benefit hubs

- For example, Veterans will expect to find documents for their benefits claims within the Claims Status tool

- Veterans will want to ‘type to search’ to quickly find the documents they’re looking for

- Veterans may not find the calendar picker component to be an intuitive way to find documents because they may not remember the dates they uploaded the documents they’re searching for

- Veterans may use the My Documents tool for peace of mind that their digitally submitted documents were correctly submitted

- Veterans may not know what search keywords will return the document(s) they’re looking for

## Method
1.	**What method of research are you planning?**
  
  - Remote moderated qualitative user interviews and usability test tasks using the existing My Documents tool on eBenefits
  
2.	**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** 

- We’re using moderated qualitative interviews to discover successes and pain points Veterans experience trying to find their VA-related documents; we’re including task-based usability using the existing tool to uncover ways we can improve the experience as the tool is migrated over to VA.gov.  

3.	**Where are you planning to do your research?**

- Zoom

4.	**What will you be testing?**

- The My Documents tool in eBenefits

## Participants and Recruitment

1.	**Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

### Primary criteria

_This criteria is necessary to conduct the study._

- We would like a total of **15** participants

- Participants will need to log into eBenefits as part of the study. Please include the following screener questions:
   - “Have you used eBenefits to look for VA documents you’ve submitted in the past?”

      - No
   - “Are you comfortable signing into your eBenefits account as part of the session?” 
      - Yes (Qualifies)
      - No 

- We would like 7-8 participants who have previously submitted a benefit claim (VA form 526-EZ). Please include the following screener question:
   - “Have you ever submitted supporting evidence for a disability claim online, through a Veteran Service Organization (VSO), Power of Attorney (POA), or claim agent?”
      - Yes (Qualifies) 
      - No

- Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share

### Secondary criteria

_This criteria contains nice-to-haves that creates a diverse participant pool._

Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
