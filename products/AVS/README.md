# Applications for Visit Summaries (AVS)
Patients can forget or misunderstand the information their healthcare providers share with them. This can lead to problems with treatment, making mistakes with medications, missing appointments, or feeling like the provider is not communicating well enough.

One way to help patients avoid these frustrations is to give them a clinical summary of their visit, also known as an After Visit Summary (AVS). Studies show that when patients get a printed AVS, they trust their doctor more and feel more satisfied with their care. While a lot of patient health information can be found online now (e.g., through MyHealtheVet or Personal Health Records (PHRs)), not all patients have access.

In addition to the AVS, our team has developed the Pre-Visit Summary (PVS) to assist patients leading up to their appointment and the Discharge Visit Summary (DVS) to assist patients upon discharge. Each document will display different pieces of default information. That is, information that is automatically included in the summary, unless configured otherwise. In addition, there is optional information that can be included depending on the needs of the patient.

### AVS Components
|**Use Case**|**Description**|
|--|--|
|[**After Visit Summary (AVS)**]|The AVS is provided to the patient after a healthcare visit. The document is a web-based interface launched from the CPRS Tools menu and is automatically populated with data from CPRS. AVS summarizes important information from the appointment, such as the diagnosis, treatment plan, and any prescribed medications. The AVS may also include follow-up instructions, recommended lifestyle changes, and contact information for further questions. The AVS serves as a reference for the patient to understand their care plan and manage their health after the visit. The following information is included in a typical AVS.
|[**Pre-Visit Summary (PVS)**|A PVS is provided to the patient before a healthcare visit. It typically includes information such as the purpose of the upcoming appointment, any necessary preparations (such as fasting or bringing in medical records), and a list of topics or concerns the patient may want to discuss with the healthcare provider.The PVS helps the patient prepare for their visit, ensuring they have all the necessary information and questions ready to ask, leading to a more efficient and effective consultation. 
|[**Discharge Visit Summary (DVS)**]|A DVS is provided to a patient upon discharge from a hospital or inpatient care facility. It contains essential information about the patient's hospital stay, including diagnosis, treatments administered, medications prescribed, and any follow-up care instructions. The DVS also outlines any lifestyle or dietary recommendations, as well as contact information for healthcare providers in case of questions or emergencies.The DVS serves as a comprehensive guide to help the patient transition safely from hospital care to home or another care setting, ensuring continuity of care and reducing the risk of readmission.
