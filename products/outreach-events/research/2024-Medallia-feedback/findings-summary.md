### Findings with quantitative breakdown
1. The website provides valuable information, but navigation and event findabilty need improvement. (33/189, 17%)
2. Event registration and online seminar access are significant pain points for users. (49/189, 25%)
3. Users voiced a need to find relevant events based on their location.(9/189, 5%)
4. The site's technical issues are impacting user experience and trust such as broken links and registration errors. (9/189, 5%) Note: this may be partly third-party event registration links.
5. Overall satisfaction with the site is lower than the individual ratings for VA.gov experience and understanding.

### Recommendations
1. Implement a more robust filtering system for events, allowing users to sort by location, event type, and relevance.
   - > I would like to filter events by location (eg, ohio) and whether they are online.
   - > Looking for the closest Florida city for this event.
2. Codify in-person events for findability for those that prefer in-person interactions. Include A11Y info for physical accommodations . 
   - > This site is 99% useless to me. Remote resources are meaningless. A lot of us need in person activities and the job postings don't matter for veterans with a lot of disabilities. Remote access materials or zoom courses/support exacerbate our problems.
3. Provide clearer information about event eligibility and capacity to manage user expectations. Are there opportunities for overflow or waitlist? recordings? otherwise? 
   - > Sign up for writing workshop i just read about. I just opened the VA newdletter I just received. Read about the workshop, clicked on link to register and......its already filled up. Is this old news getting sent out?
4. Enhance the registration experience. These are currently done via third-party event host software linked from a listed event.
   - If registration continues to be completed at an external site, how might we add help text in editor flow to provide a better Veteran experience?
   - > Attempted to register for event and got message that I wasn't eligible even though I'm a veteran.
   - > I registered for the hiring event, but then nothing... No contacts, no invites, no access to the participant companies.  No links to anything!
6. Conduct user testing with a diverse group of veterans to identify and address specific accessibility needs.
