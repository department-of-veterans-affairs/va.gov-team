# Research Plan for Public Websites, Outreach & Events, Dec 2021

## Background
The Outreach & Events calendar provides a listing of upcoming national VA events that Veterans can browse and sign up to attend (without logging in). The current user experience is a flat listing of upcoming events, and we are adding the following two new capabilities:
1. Filtering events by date range
1. Viewing recurring events together

[Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/outreach-events/product-outline.md)

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Outreach & Events fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) when Veterans find VA events to attend throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to get user feedback on our designs for the following two new features:
1. Filtering by date range
2. Viewing recurring events together

### Outcome
We will consider findings and recommendations from this research to refine our designs before launch.

### Research questions
1. How intuitive is our design for filtering by date range? 
    1. What do Veterans think about the options for date range? 
    2. What do Veterans think about filtering by a specific date and a date range?
3. How intuitive is our design for recurring events? Do Veterans understand that the event is repeating?
    1. Are Veterans able to register for individual events in the series of recurring events?
4. How do Veterans expect to look for VA events?
5. What kind of location information for events do Veterans want to see in the list of events? (e.g., virtual/in-person, city, address)
    1. For in-person events, what specific information is expected? (i.e., is "city" enough information, or also want street address?)

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans will understand how to use date filters to find events they are interested in
1. Filtering events by date will enable Veterans to find events that fit in their schedules
1. Seeing which events are recurring will enable Veterans to register for all events they're interested in

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability research sessions via Zoom. Research participants will be asked about their experiences with VA events, and then they will be given tasks to do using a mobile design prototype in UXPin. 

### Future research plans
*We want to include some participants who use screen readers, but we will have to wait until we can build a "working prototype" on the Staging server. At that time, we plan to iterate this research with the following additions:*
- *Research question: How accessible to screen reader users is the date range filter dropdown?*
- *Research question: How accessible to screen reader users are recurring events?*
- *Hypothesis: The designs will be accessible to Veterans who use screen readers*
- *Primary recruiting criterion: At least 2 people who use a screen reader*
- *Observer: Angela Fowler will observe sessions with participants using a screen reader*
