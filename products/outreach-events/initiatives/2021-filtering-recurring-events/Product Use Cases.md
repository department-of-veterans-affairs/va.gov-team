# Use Cases: Outreach & Events Enhancements (Filtering/Recurring Events) 

_Track and maintain the various use cases that exist for a given product and is best maintained alongside the product outline._

_The purpose of this document is for designers, PMs, and engineers to align early on on potential use cases and edge cases so these things aren't coming up randomly and late in the process. We recommend the team schedule a 30 minute meeting to brainstorm all use cases/edge cases early on.  Examples of cases that could be captured here include: "Veteran logs in but is not LOA3ed.", "Veteran searches and gets no results." etc etc_
