## IIR Outreach & Events Handoff Meeting Notes

### Date 2024-05-14

### Attendees
- Dave Conlon
- Fran Cross
- Amanda Klausmeier
- Pete Egan
- Liza McRuer
- David Pearl


### Product Approach
- They looked at three main approaches
	- main/national calendar-FE (front-end) only; no updates to CMS
	- FE with CMS support
	- Technical rebuild to support transitioning page from templated build to application (landed on this one as the best option)

### UX Presentation by David Pearl

- The main scope they focused on was the main calendar, and the event details pages
  - 2024 README [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/outreach-events/2024-Readme.md)
  - they prepared for usability testing, but didn't proceed with it
  - they included some items from the 2021 usability research
  - you'll find GA and Medalia links in the REAMDE
  - they focused heavily on using the older research, combined with newer ideas
  - David conducted a usability audit
  - there is a mural patchwork too, according to Liza (Amanda asked that they make sure they are in the VA mural space)
  
### Discussion

[Dave Conlon]
  - There were designs (back in the day). The filter events near me hadn't been done yet, and we'll want to do this eventually.
  - Is there a design or work to see how it works with the other filtration?
    - David: currently only allows to filter by dates. Past/upcoming/specific date; David's designs show location/distance/event date/event type

[Amanda]
- Ensure links don't go to Google docs.

[Fran]
- Any conversation guide written? Any research done on the images?
  - David: It was never submitted or formalized, but he may have started a draft or some ideas.

[Peter] 
- That might be something David can clarify further (if he did start some initial planning), but I donâ€™t think we ever got into writing a full research plan or conversation guide because things were kind of in flux.
