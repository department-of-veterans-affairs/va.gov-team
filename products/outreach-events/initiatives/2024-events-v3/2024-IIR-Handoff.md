# Project Name: Outreach Events (National Calendar)

### Problem Statement

In 2024, the IIR team was [tasked to continue improving the Outreach Events calendar with following goals:](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/15122372/Team.Intro.-.Outreach.and.Events.pdf)


- Increase usability of Veteran facing sites with the intention of increasing attendance for Veterans
- Increase event creation and distribution by improving the event creator user experience

They reviewed past research and designed wireframes to explore new ideas. In preparing for usability testing, a technical review showed
[the need to adjust the page's structure](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/15122384/Outreach.Events.Next.Steps.pdf) to support functions like location-based features – requiring a handoff with the Platform team.

### Background

The [Outreach Events calendar](https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/) was initially developed and launched as a "minimum viable product" (MVP) several years ago, with rudimentary functionality aimed at achieving parity with existing solutions. Over time, the product has witnessed a significant increase in popularity, averaging over 200,000 page views per month according to Google Analytics reports. Correspondingly, the needs and expectations of VA business stakeholders have evolved.

As of spring 2021, the Veterans Experience Office expanded the user base for the national events calendar to include digital communications teams at VHA, VBA, OPIA, and NCA. In response to this growth and in alignment with evolving user needs, an initiative was undertaken to implement a series of functional, UX, and CMS-based authoring enhancements. 

In 2021, [usability research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/outreach-events/research/2021-filtering-recurring-events) was conducted, unearthing  insights that influenced the strategy for enhancing the Outreach Events calendar. The research highlighted several usability issues that warranted attention. These included challenges with the "Next week" and "Next month" options in the date filter, ambiguity surrounding registration for recurring events (specifically, which occurrence(s) to register for), and difficulties in navigating the flat list of events due to excessive scrolling. Moreover, users expressed frustration with the limited functionality of the date filter, as they desired the ability to filter events by location, event type, and keyword search. The findings didn't lead to extensive changes due to potential technical limitations in adapting all the required enhancements.

In 2024, the IIR team was tasked with continuing to explore opportunities for improvement on the Outreach Events calendar page. Building upon the foundation laid by previous research, the team embarked on a comprehensive review of existing findings to identify additional areas for enhancement. This iterative process involved designing wireframes that incorporated new insights and potential solutions, paving the way for further development.

During preparation for usability testing, the IIR team participated in a technical feasibility review, which revealed a fundamental need to adapt the page's development structure to support required functionality, such as location-based features. As of mid-April, the project will transition from the IIR team to the Sitewide team, ensuring continuity and alignment with broader development initiatives within the organization.

### Existing Research Artifacts

The IIR team started their review by examining existing research artifacts, including analytics, a usability study from 2021, and a user-flow diagram.

### Research + Design Exploration

The IIR team analyzed key findings from previous research by using affinity mapping. They conducted a usability audit to identify potential usability issues hindering task completion. Additionally, they performed a design scan to find examples of events and calendars for inspiration on how to handle similar tasks in the UI. Wireframes were then created to test improvement ideas without constraints from the design system. Finally, the wireframes were converted into mockups within the design system, annotated for clarity and easy understanding.
