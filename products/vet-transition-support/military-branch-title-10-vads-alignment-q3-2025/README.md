## Overview
Updates are needed to the Discover Your Benefits tool to better handle military branch + component (national guard, active duty, reserves). With this work the team is also making various updates to the UI to better align with the VA design system (VADS), for example realigning questions to appear as "one thing per page" per the platform and VADS guidance. The team will also be updating the results page with the VADS search results template. These updates are being made per guidancce the previous delivery team received via the Collaboration Cycle.
