# How the Discover Your Benefits product works

**Last updated**: May 29, 2025

## Purpose
This documentation serves as the source of truth for the design, content, and functionality in the [Discover Your Benefits](https://www.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction) product on va.gov.

## Overview

### How the product is organized

The product is organized into three main sections:
* **Introduction**: Provides Veterans, recently-separated Veterans (RSVs), and transitioning service members (TSMs) with an overview and describes the purpose of the product.
* **Questionnaire**: Asks Veterans, RSVs, and TSMs a series of questions to determine their eligibility for specific benefits.
* **Results**: Displays benefits that Veterans, RSVs, and TSMs may be eligible for based on their answers in the questionnaire. The Results page also includes an option to view all benefits, regardless of eligibility.

### How we manage content in the product

#### In production

The **designer** and **engineers** are both responsible for managing content that’s in production. The engineers will maintain the source of truth in [GitHub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/tree/main/src/applications/discover-your-benefits) and the designer will maintain the [Figma (production file)](https://www.figma.com/design/e0L8mXXi5lqywARbnBy5Zx/%F0%9F%9A%80-Production---Version-2.5--Transition-experience-?m=auto&t=ODHjsOOxGnDsLBLf-6). Both files should include the same content at all times. Content that’s in production is live on va.gov.

## Functionality

### How the results are determined

The **all benefits** page displays all benefits that a Veteran (including RSVs) or TSM may be eligible for.

The **recommended benefits** page displays benefits that Veterans (including RSVs) and TSMs may be eligible for based on their answers in the questionnaire. The [Logic Mapping spreadsheet in Sharepoint](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/VESPortfolioOpsManagement/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BC0881268-34D7-4863-936A-DABCD4B7B15D%7D&file=MASTER%20Logic%20Mapping%20Spreadsheet%20-%2001NOV2024.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) is the source of truth for how eligibility is determined for each benefit.
