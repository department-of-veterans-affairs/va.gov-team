## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who’d like to observe and take notes. But before we get to that, I have a few things that I’d like to go over with you:

- For today’s activity, you’ll be testing a tool that will go on the VA website in the future. The tool is supposed to help Veterans and servicemembers learn about benefits and resources that are useful for their specific needs.
- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this activity is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate asked if it was alright for a few observers to join, but I want to double-check with you. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers joining our session?**
   - *If no:* Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - *If yes:* Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **You'll be interacting with a product in development today.** It should work just like a live website, but if you see something that doesn't work as expected, please us know. Your actions during today’s session won’t will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Would it be okay if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** I’m going to ask you to do a series of tasks with the site. If possible, I’d like to record the session to make sure we accurately capture what you say and do during the tasks. After we analyze all of the user testing data, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, would it be okay if I record my screen and audio?
- We work with other VA teams to support Veterans and servicemembers. One of the ways that we share findings with our VA partners is by showing short video clips of our activity sessions. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image and your name. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans and servicemembers experience when using our products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that if this is still okay with you, so you’ll get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be okay with us using clips of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **Great, I’ve started recording.** I'd like to confirm one more time on the recording: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

1. Could you briefly tell us about your military service?
2. How often do you use the VA.gov website?
3. Why do you use the VA.gov website?

## Instructions for the upcoming tasks - 5 minutes

Now I’m going to ask you to do some tasks using our product in development. As I mentioned before, completing these tasks will not affect your VA information or benefits in any way.

We’d like to see your screen while you do these tasks, if possible. Would it be possible to  share your screen on the Zoom meeting?
- If screensharing won’t work, you can also “hug” your computer and record what you’re doing on your phone.
- If that won’t work either, I can share the site on my screen and give you control, so you can move through the site.

While you’re completing today’s tasks, please share your thoughts out loud as you do the tasks. We want to understand your reactions to the site and the reasoning that informs your actions.

As a reminder, you’ll be working with a product in development. If anything doesn’t work the way you expect, please let us know. That feedback is helpful for us.

Finally, you can ask questions at any time.

## First Task: Completing the questionnaire - 10 minutes

Great, now we’re going to start today’s activity. I’m going to share a link in the chat box – it’s the link for our product in development. Please open the site and share your screen.
- *Send the site link, queued up to the “welcome” page.*

What you’re seeing is the welcome page for a questionnaire. This questionnaire will ask a few questions to help you find benefits and resources that might be helpful.

For your first task, please complete the questionnaire. The questions in the questionnaire help us determine what benefits someone might be eligible for. Please answer each question to the best of your ability.

We will keep your answers confidential and we will not share or track your answers in any way. We’re only asking you to answer the questions so you can provide feedback on how we’ve designed this questionnaire.

The last question will be about the GI Bill. When you get to the GI Bill page, you can answer that question, but don’t click the “Continue” button. I will also tell you when to stop.

As a reminder, please share your thoughts out loud while you’re doing the task. You can start the task now by reading this page and then selecting the “Get started” button.

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant feel uncomfortable answering any of the questions?  
- Is the participant confused about any of the questions?
- Is the participant curious about why we’re asking any of the questions?

## Second Task: Using the review page - 5 minutes

Great work, that was our first task. In a moment, I’ll have you go to the review page.

On the next page, you’ll be able to review all the answers you provided. You can also change your answers on the next page without having to go back through the entire form.

When I say so, please click to the next page and share your thoughts out loud about the review page setup. Please also try changing some of your answers to see how that function works.

As a reminder, please share your thoughts out loud while you’re doing the task. You can start the task now by selecting the “Continue” button.

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant investigate areas of the review page that we didn’t expect them to explore?
- Were the participants able to successfully view and edit their answers?
- Were participants confused by any aspects of the review page?
- Do the participants spend a significant amount of time on this page?

## Third Task: Finding information on the results page - 6 minutes

Great, you’ve completed the second task. I’m going to ask you to do one more task.

On the next page, you’ll see the benefits that our product is recommending, based on your answers to the questionnaire. You’ll see results in different categories and you’ll be able to use some additional features on the results page.

When I say so, please click to the next page and share your thoughts out loud about the results page. We encourage you to click around and explore all aspects of the page.

As a reminder, please share your thoughts out loud while you’re doing the task. You can start the task now by checking the privacy policy box and selecting the “Continue” button.

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant investigate areas of the results page that we didn’t expect them to explore?
- Were the participants able to successfully differentiate the time-sensitive benefits, non-time-sensitive recommended benefits, and benefits that don’t align with their answers?
- Did the participants use the filtering or sorting features?
- Did the participants use the “Save your results” button?
- Were participants confused by any aspects of the results page?
- Do the participants spend a significant amount of time on this page?
	
## Post-Task Interview – 5 minutes

Thank you for doing these tasks. I have a few follow-up questions to ask about this experience.

- Were there any tasks that confused you?
- Was there anything on the site that confused you?
- What would you want a guided tool to help you with, even if it wasn’t included in the site you saw today?  
- Would a tool like this be helpful for you? Why or why not?
- You may have noticed that the screens had the title "Discover your benefits."
   - How do you feel about that title?
   - What about "Find your benefits" as an alternative option?
   - Do you have any other ideas or thoughts about the title?
- Where would you expect to find a tool like this on the VA.gov website?
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips – 2 minutes

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing – 2 minutes

That concludes our task for today – thank you for participating! We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans and servicemembers.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans or servicemembers you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Why the Questionnaire Includes Each Question
* The participant may have concerns or curiosities about specific questions in the questionnaire. Below is more detailed information about why included each question. *

- **Goals:** We ask about goals to help us recommend the most useful benefits and resources, based on what you want to explore.
- **Length of service:** Some benefits require you to serve a certain amount of time to be eligible.
- **Are you currently serving:** We ask if you’re currently serving because there are some applications you can start before separating. If you apply while serving, you may be approved for benefits more quickly than if you apply after completing your service.
- **Expected separation date:** Some benefit applications have a specific time window, so you have to apply within a certain number of days before your separation date.
- **How long ago did you separate:** Some benefit applications have a specific time window, so you have to apply within a certain amount of time after separation.
- **Character of discharge:** We ask about character of discharge because it affects your eligibility for certain benefits. You may still be eligible for benefits even if your character of discharge is other than honorable.
- **Do you have a disability rating:** There are some benefits you can only get after you’ve applied for disability compensation and received a disability rating.
- **Have you been approved for GI Bill benefits:** We ask about GI Bill benefits because we don’t want to recommend the GI Bill if you’ve already completed the GI Bill application process.s

## Emergency Exit

- **Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. Perigean will follow up with you. Have a good day.
- **Blame technology:** I am so sorry, but I just learned that the site is unexpectedly not working, so we will have to end today’s session. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time. Perigean will follow up with you. Have a good day.
