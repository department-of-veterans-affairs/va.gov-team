## Research Goals
Our research goals were the following:
* Understand how Version 2 of the Veteran Transition Support product starts to meet the needs of Veterans and transitioning service members 
* Test specific features in the Version 2 prototype: Skipping Questions, Review Answers Page, Sorting and Filtering, Etc.
* Determine expectations of users for the product
* Find out additional features and systems that can be added to VTS in future versions that is helpful to users
### Outcome
The findings from our research will primarily inform any feature or design fixes to include in the Version 3 of the VTS product. We’re looking to validate the design assumptions and choices that we made for Version 2.
## Research Questions
Our research questions were the following:
* What should the VTS be named?
    * We are tentatively calling it "Discover my benefits." How do Veterans and service members feel about this name?
    * How do Veterans and service members feel about "Find my benefits" as an alternative option?
    * Are there other names that might be more appropriate?
* How do users feel about the Review Answers Page?
    * How often to people just skip it quickly?
    * Do people use it to alter their answers just to see changes on the results page?
* How quickly do users orient to the Results page?
    * Is the information hierarchy helpful?
* Are the questions we’re asking able to be answered easily by users?
    * Are the questions valuable to users?
* How many users use the Skip button?
* How many questions are skipped? - Which questions are skipped most often? Why?
* How are users interacting with the Filter option on the Results Page?
    * Which of the filters are used most often?
    * Which of the filters are used least often?
    * Are there any filter options that aren’t listed on the prototype, that the user would wish to use?
* How are users interacting with the Sort Option on the Results Page?
    * Which of the sort options are used most often?
    * Which of the sort options are used least often?
    * Are there any sort options that aren’t listed on the prototype, that the user would wish to use?
* How do users interact with the “Benefits you may not be eligible for” section?
    * Do people want this section?
    * Did the drop down meet their expectations?
    * What do users expect to see here?
    * What are people HOPING to see here?
    * Is there a way that this section could help more?
* How visible is the “Time sensitive benefits” alert?
    * Is this section useful to users? Why?
## Methodology
We conducted semi-structured interviews for this research project. We started with structured user testing: Sending the user a link to the clickable prototype and asking them to click through the prototype while speaking their thoughts.
After the user testing, we asked follow-up questions to the users about their experience and expectations.
## Hypotheses and Conclusions
**Hypothesis #1:** Our hypothesis is that Version 2 of the Veteran Transition Support questionnaire meets some needs of users and sets up the project to meet future needs of Veterans and transitioning service members.

*Definitely True:* Similar to our first round of user testing, participants said our tool was helpful and relevant to their goals. Participants found the questionnaire easy to use. Additionally, participants felt that the benefit recommendations and the “window shopping” option were useful.

**Hypothesis #2:** We expect that we will receive feedback to improve the user experience for our next version and beyond.

*Definitely True:* Participants shared a wealth of feedback to improve the user experience. In particular, participants recommended content and presentation updates to increase the utility of the Results page. Participants also identified opportunities to strengthen the questionnaire wording and provide more broadly applicable answer choices.

## Key Findings
1.	Some participants were confused by the Figma prototype, particularly the limited Review, Results, and window-shopping page functionality.
2.	More participants preferred the name “Discover your benefits,” but participants generally found “Find your benefits” to be a synonymous alternative.
3.	Participants overwhelmingly said they expect this tool’s entry point to be on the VA.gov homepage.
4.	Several participants were confused by the GI Bill question and the answer choices.
5.	Participants recommended some improvements for denoting time-sensitive benefits, which includes grouping time-sensitive benefits and differentiating pre-separation and post-separation benefits.
6.	Most participants found the overall tool straightforward and easy to use.
7.	Many participants said the tool would be helpful and relevant to their needs.
8.	Several transitioning service members said that a timeline, task tracker, or checklist would be helpful for their transition from military to civilian life.
9.	Participants want to see state and local Veteran benefits in our tool, even though these benefits are not offered by any federal agency.
10.	Some participants wanted this tool to be integrated with their authenticated VA.gov profiles. 
## Details of Findings
**Finding 1: Some participants were confused by the Figma prototype, particularly the limited Review, Results, and window-shopping page functionality.**

* RESERCH: Remote
* RESERCH: Usability testing

Our team was actively implementing features on our staging site during the user testing window. Because the staging site was still in progress, we conducted user testing on our Figma prototype, where we mocked up our planned features.
We faced challenges testing with the Figma prototype. In particular, we were unable to replicate the full functionality of the Review and Results pages on Figma. Because of this, some participants were confused about how the product would function in reality.
For future user tests, we plan to incorporate the planned updates on staging and then test with the staging site. This will allow users to explore the tool’s full functionality.
> “[I] thought the results would be personalized to the way I answered the questions.”
“I didn’t immediately see or understand that [the window-shopping page] wasn’t every benefit on the results page.”

**Finding 2: More participants preferred the name “Discover your benefits,” but participants generally found “Find your benefits” to be a synonymous alternative.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* AUD: Veterans
* PDT: Vet Transition Support

Participants responded positively to both “Discover your benefits” and “Find your benefits” as name options. Slightly more than half of our participants (7 out of 12) preferred “Discover your benefits,” which is the tool’s current name, saying it was catchier. However, the other participants (5 out of 12) preferred “Find my benefits,” with some saying it was more straightforward. No participants had strong negative reactions to either of the name options. 
> “On the surface, I think both options are self-explanatory. Both kind of get the point across and I would understand both of them.”

> “I like Discover, it just sounds better. You can discover other things you may not have known about. Discover told me that this [tool] is what’s for me.”

**Finding 3: Participants overwhelmingly said they expect this tool’s entry point to be on the VA.gov homepage.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* AUD: Veterans
* PRDT: VA.gov home page
* PDT: Vet Transition Support

Every participant who commented on the entry point expected the VA.gov homepage to link to our tool. Half of our participants (6 out of 12) expected to see our tool under the “VA Benefits and Health Care” top navigation menu item. Another participant expected to see the tool as a standalone item in the top navigation bar. Participants expected our tool to be in a prominent place that cuts across benefit domains.
> “I would look at the VA Benefits and Health Care dropdown or somewhere else in the top dropdowns?”

> “I'd expect to see it in the top bar, where all the information is when you go to the homepage.”

**Finding 4: Several participants were confused by the GI Bill question and the answer choices.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* AUD: Veterans
* BNFT: Education
* PDT: Vet Transition Support

One-third of our participants (4 out of 12) expressed confusion with our GI Bill question. Two participants were unsure how to answer the question because they transferred their GI Bill benefits to their children. These participants were unsure if that counted as “receiving” benefits. One participant was unsure if they should also count their VR&E benefits when responding about whether they had received GI Bill benefits. Another participant was unsure if receiving an eligibility letter was the same as receiving GI Bill benefits.
> "The question wording is kind of confusing - I've transferred to my children, but they haven't used the benefits yet."

> "I'm going to school, but I'm not using GI Bill benefits, I'm using VR&E benefits."

**Finding 5: Participants recommended some improvements for denoting time-sensitive benefits, which includes grouping time-sensitive benefits and differentiating pre-separation and post-separation benefits.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* AUD: Veterans
* DSC: Experimental
* PDT: Vet Transition Support

Our participants overwhelmingly understood the time-sensitive benefit banner. However, participants were not necessarily clear about which time-sensitive benefits require you to apply before separation and which ones can be applied for after separation. Additionally, some participants said it was difficult to keep track of the time-sensitive benefits while scrolling down the Results page. Two participants mentioned the idea of grouping all time-sensitive benefits at the top of the user’s recommended benefit list.
> “It's not confusing, but there are time-sensitive benefits mixed in with other benefits. [I’d] recommend having all the time-sensitive benefits at the top."

> “I’d assume [the time-sensitive banner] means I have a certain amount of time to get the benefit. It says I’m on a timeline.”

**Finding 6: Most participants found the overall tool straightforward and easy to use.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* AUD: Veterans
* PDT: Vet Transition Support
* VETJNY: Getting out Military
* VETJNY: Putting down roots
* VETJNY: Reinventing themselves
* VETJNY: Retiring
* VETJNY: Starting up civilian life
* VETJNY: Taking care of themselves

Nearly every participant (11 out of 12) said that our tool was straightforward or easy to use. The other participant did not comment on the tool’s ease, either positively or negatively. Four participants said that our questionnaire questions were logical for the tool’s overall goal, which is recommending benefits that are relevant to the user’s goals and service history. Three participants mentioned that the progress bar was a helpful addition, so they could see how much they had completed and how much is left to complete.
Three participants mentioned that they felt comfortable with the filter and sort functions on our Results and window-shopping pages. Three participants also mentioned that the Review page seemed clear and useful.
> “I actually like [the tool]. It was so easy, that’s what I like about it.”

> “This [Review] page allows you to make sure you selected what you wanted to select.”

> “Oh, [the tool includes] a progress bar — thank you!”

**Finding 7: Many participants said the tool would be helpful and relevant to their needs.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* AUD: Veterans

* VETJNY: Getting out Military
* VETJNY: Putting down roots
* VETJNY: Reinventing themselves
* VETJNY: Retiring
* VETJNY: Starting up civilian life
* VETJNY: Taking care of themselves

Three-quarters of our participants (9 out of 12) said our tool would be helpful for discovering relevant benefits or supporting their transition. More than half of our participants (7 out of 12) said the Results page features were helpful, including the personalized benefit recommendations, the time-sensitive benefits banner, the button to save your results, and the alert with resources for transitioning service members.
Four participants mentioned that they appreciated the inclusion of “Apply now” links, so users can go straight to the benefit application if they want. Additionally, four participants said they were happy to see specific benefits, including support for a Veteran-owned small business, life insurance, VA home loans, burial information, and the Foreign Medical Program. Three participants expressed excitement about the window-shopping mode, which allowed them to see benefits they might qualify for in the future.
> "Soldiers may not know about all of these resources, so it's great to have them all in one place."

> "Yes [this tool] would [be helpful for me], because it could list everything I'd want."

> "I've never seen everything on one page before.... I really like [the Results page]."

> “Oh, I like this [window shopping page]!”

> “I think the benefits are all really good options.”

**Finding 8: Several transitioning service members said that a timeline, task tracker, or checklist would be helpful for their transition from military to civilian life.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* PDT: Vet Transition Support

* VETJNY: Starting up civilian life
* VETJNY: Taking care of themselves

Half of our participants (6 out of 12) said they want some way to track upcoming transition-related tasks. Four of these participants mentioned they wanted a timeline or an indicator of how much time they have to apply for a benefit. Two participants mentioned they would like a checklist feature, where they could keep track of outstanding tasks, the application process for time-sensitive benefits, and the documentation needed to apply for those benefits. We have started brainstorming about what this will look like. We will incorporate more robust transition support into future iterations.
> "If there's an app or a website where you log in, use the tool, and then get reminders about when it’s time to start thinking about different benefits, [that would be helpful]. "A few months out, getting reminders or having a checklist to know what's coming up. It could be a dropdown on the [tool] to show which tasks are still outstanding."

> "The army will move you one last time, but when do you have to do that by and what’s the timeline?"

**Finding 9: Participants want to see state and local Veteran benefits in our tool, even though these benefits are not offered by any federal agency.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* AUD: Veterans

* VETJNY: Getting out Military
* VETJNY: Putting down roots
* VETJNY: Reinventing themselves
* VETJNY: Retiring
* VETJNY: Starting up civilian life
* VETJNY: Taking care of themselves

Four participants mentioned they were interested in seeing Veteran benefits offered by their state or local governments. We had previously considered including a benefit card for the VA.gov page with state Veteran Affairs contact information. However, that page moved within the site’s information architecture, so we did not include it in this version. We are still very interested in providing state-specific information for Veterans and service members.
> "Will there be a way to filter the benefits by state? "I know some states don't offer as many benefits as other states."

> “We're getting ready to move to Georgia. We might be curious about new benefits when we move."

**Finding 10: Some participants wanted this tool to be integrated with their authenticated VA.gov profiles.**
Labels:
* AUD: Service members
* AUD: Veterans
* AUD: VA.gov Profile
* PDT: Vet Transition Support

Three participants discussed their expectations around using our tool in an authenticated state. These participants discussed having their authenticated profiles pre-populate parts of our questionnaire. One participant mentioned wanting to see open claims or previously awarded benefits alongside the new benefit recommendations.
> "You know when you click your name and see your info and letters? I'd expect to see [this tool] there."

> "My initial reaction [to using the tool in an authenticated state] is "oh hell no" because its putting PII into a website, but I'm already logged in to the VA. It could pre-fill the [questionnaire].”
## Additional Insights
From our participants’ responses, we gained some additional insights:
* The phrase “previous period of service” caused some confusion on one of our questionnaire pages. Participants said the term “break in service” might be more universally understood.
* Some participants were surprised that there were so many answer options for service length/time since separation and that the highest answer choice for service length was 3+ years. The 3-year marker aligns with eligibility for our v2 benefits, but participants wanted to recognize longer periods of service.
* Some participants recommended grouping the personalized benefits on the Results page by topic area or relevant goal.
* A few participants recommended adding more questions or more answer choices to existing questions. These participants noted that more questions or answer options would accommodate more edge case scenarios.
* On the Goals questionnaire page, one participant mentioned wanting to rank their chosen goals by order of importance.
* One participant expressed that the site design, which uses the VA Design System (VADS), looked “clinical.” If we receive similar feedback in future user testing, we will share this feedback with the VADS team.
## Recommendations
* **Recommendation 1:** Conduct future user testing on the staging site, once all planned updates have been incorporated on staging.
    * This recommendation will address the testing issues noted in Finding #1.
* **Recommendation 2:** Keep the name “Discover your benefits” for the tool.
    * Participants were receptive to both presented name options, but “Discover your benefits” got slightly more votes than the alternative “Find your benefits.”
* **Recommendation 3:** Remove the GI Bill question.
    * Our participants experienced significant confusion with this question. This question will no longer affect the benefit recommendations after we implement separate feedback from VA education subject matter experts, so we do not need this question in future versions.
* **Recommendation 4:** Place additional emphasis on the time-sensitive benefits, both on the Results page and the window-shopping page.
    * Our participants suggested the ideas of placing all time-sensitive benefits at the top of the results list, but we can also consider other ideas.
* **Recommendation 5:** Clarify which time-sensitive benefits need to be applied for pre-separation or post-separation.
    * Participants were unclear about whether they needed to apply for certain time-sensitive benefits before or after they separated from service.
    * We can differentiate pre-separation and post-separation time-sensitive benefits in future versions.
* **Recommendation 6:** Add a timeline or task tracking mechanism to support transitioning service members.
* **Recommendation 7:** Include state and local Veteran benefit information in the personalized benefit recommendations and the window-shopping page.
## Next Steps
We will use the findings to revise our product in early 2025. We will also use the findings to inform our long-term product strategy, ensuring that we are responsive to Veteran and transitioning service member needs.
## Further research needed
Because our staging site was still in-progress, we used our Figma prototype for user testing so we could get feedback on all planned updates to our product. However, testing on Figma caused limitations with how much we could test, specifically around the Review and Results page functionality. For our next round of user testing, we plan to make all updates in staging before testing. That way, we can use the staging site for testing and fully test the functionality of all pages.
Additionally, due to limitations with our Figma prototype, we still need to conduct research with Assistive technology users and mobile users. We may request OCTO’s support with planning this additional research.

## Tools used for Synthesis
We used Mural to synthesize the user testing data. We pulled in quotes and feedback from our sessions, then created affinity groups to identify recurring themes and subthemes. To inform our iterative design efforts, we then identified MVP recommendations that aligned with each major theme.
## Pages and Applications Used
We tested our [v2 Figma prototype]( https://www.figma.com/proto/4J2vqMA2VY6wqgcjvhF2aT/v2-Prototype-Design?node-id=6634-12537&node-type=canvas&t=jNUac4YSUUpQisvO-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=6634%3A11526).
## Who We Talked To
### Recruitment criteria
We sought Perigean’s assistance to recruit Veterans, Transitioning Servicemembers, and Commanding Officers for our study. To be inclusive of diverse perspectives, we recruited participants from various races/ethnicities, genders, age ranges, and service branches. 
We talked to **12 participants**.

Audience segment:
* Veterans: 6
* Transitioning service members: 4
* Commanding officers: 2

Gender:
* Male: 8
* Female: 4

LGBTQ+:
* Unknown: 12 

We were unable to request LGBTQ+ demographic information because we had a limited number of screening questions that Perigean could ask. We needed to ask several other questions to ensure participants met necessary criteria for our specific study (e.g., whether someone is separating from the military in the next year). However, we think it would be beneficial for future research to explore transition and benefit discovery experiences for LGTBQ+ Veterans and transitioning servicemembers.

Age:
* 25-34: 4
* 35-44: 4
* 45-54: 3
* 55-64: 0
* 65+: 0
* Unknown: 1

Education:
* High school degree or equivalent: 0
* Some college (no degree): 3
* Associate's degree, trade certificate or vocational training: 1
* Bachelor's degree: 4
* Master's degree: 3
* Doctorate degree: 0
* Unknown: 1

Geographic location:
* Unknown: 12

We were unable to request urban/rural demographic information because we had a limited number of screening questions that Perigean could ask. We needed to ask several other questions to ensure participants met necessary criteria for our specific study (e.g., whether someone is separating from the military in the next year). However, we think it would be beneficial for future research to explore transition and benefit discovery experiences for Veterans and transitioning servicemembers in both urban and rural areas.

Race:
* White: 7
* Black: 4
* Hispanic: 2
* Biracial: 0
* Asian: 3
* Native: 1

Disability and Assistive Technology (AT):
* Unknown: 12

Due to limitations with our Figma prototype, we were unable to recruit for participants that use specific assistive technology. We plan to include assistive technology users in future rounds of user testing.

## Underserved Groups We Haven’t Talked To
This research does not include the perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups:
* Veterans over 55 years old
* Veterans with cognitive disabilities
* Veterans on mobile devices
* Veterans who live in rural areas
* Veterans with Other than Honorable discharges
* Veterans of immigrant origin

While one participant mentioned something about an Other than Honorable discharge, we cannot verify whether the participant received that discharge characterization.
