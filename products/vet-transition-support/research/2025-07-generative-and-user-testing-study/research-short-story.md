# Veterans Want Simpler, Smarter Tools for Transition Success

*Insights from the Veteran Transition Experience Research Study*

## tl;dr (too long, didn’t read)
Transitioning Service Members (TSMs) and Veterans need clearer, more personalized support and easy ways to save and act on their VA benefits. Usability pain points and missing features slow down progress.

## What we did
The VES Veteran Transition Experience Team at OCTO-DE conducted a mixed-methods study (interviews and usability testing) in July-August 2025. The goal: understand how TSMs organize their transition, discover benefits, and what improvements could help them succeed.

## Key insights
- **Goals don’t drive benefit exploration**
  - "21 of 28 participants chose 'Understand my benefits,' but explored broadly based on curiosity, not goals."
- **Save and return features are hard to find**
  - "68% thought they'd have to retake the questionnaire to see their results again; only 25% noticed the save link."
- **Any organized strategy helps—digital or paper**
  - "What matters most is having an organizational strategy, not the type."
- **TSMs crave easy access to human help**
  - "Participants wanted an easy way to get help from someone knowledgeable about benefits (vs tech support)."
- **National Guard/Reserves face bigger gaps**
  - "Service members from National Guard and Reserve units often receive 'very little support'... highlighting a significant gap."

## Between the lines
Many participants expect a dashboard-like VA experience tailored to their service history and needs. Information overload and friction points—like confusing form questions and impersonal results—leave veterans feeling lost or unsupported.

## Yes, but
Not all veterans have VA accounts or want to log in, so keeping an accessible, unauthenticated tool matters. Also, key groups (Marines, Coast Guard, younger vets, assistive tech users) weren’t represented and need further outreach.

## Why it matters
Making transition easier for TSMs helps more veterans discover and apply for benefits, reduces support burden, and supports VA’s mission to improve long-term outcomes. The findings directly support OCTO’s key results: better self-service, higher satisfaction, and improved equity.

## What’s next
- Prototype better filter designs and save options (email, visibility)
- Make help resources more prominent
- Start planning MyVA integration for personalized results
- Conduct further research with underserved groups and on accessibility
