## Gene’s notes

Transition Experience – Participant (July 18, 12pm ET)

Last VA interaction

* Dental, typically go to military base  
* Had to get a referral to go to an off-base provider due to a 14month backlog  
* Fine but frustrating I had to wait 14 months for a cleaning  
* Possibly CommCare?

Service History

* Retired  
* Separated 2022  
* Army  
  * 22 years Active

Separation

* Fairly smooth, knew what I wanted and had a lot of feedback from people that had already done who helped me navigated  
* Was in a USASOC (?) which helped navigate it, especially the medical part  
* Was in special ops, knew I wanted to do the same kinds of things as a contractor  
* Q: Official prep help?  
  * Care coalition person helped you out with any questions  
  * Most questions were quick to get responses to  
* What was your support system  
  * Former leadership, recently retired that I leaned on  
  * Things like VGLI, Survivor Benefit Program  
* Prioritizing...?  
  * Having a plan and executing on that plan with enough time  
  * Getting a timeline in order, working backwards from that date to starting job seeking  
* How did you manage that process  
  * Made a timeline with hard dates (6mo before apply for jobs, etc)  
  * Came from talking to  a lot of mentors in terms of when we should hit those milestones  
* Harder than expected?  
  * Navigating some of the benefits was more unclear  
  * Disability; CSRP vs other eligibility criteria, a little more explaining and reaching out for answers  
    * Nobody gave details during briefings, so learned about this during briefings  
    * Never ended up applying for the combat zone specific because it’s a different liability on retirement  
    * Fairly easy to understand things like VGLI, and most other benefits  
  * Priorities?  
    * Making sure that medical paperwork was in order  
    * At the time, SF600 docs were physical paperwork that moved from appointment to appointment (keeping track of it)  
    * Made sure things were properly documented   
    * After you’re separated, it’s harder to get your disability claims so it should be as thorough as possible, one less thing to worry about  
    * Career 1, disability 2, everything else less concerned about  
  * Getting out at 20+ years vs at 4 years, different family situations, mine was a lot smoother, had a career already so easier to segue into career  
* Who struggles the most in transition?  
  * The social settings are different; a lot of culture changes.  
  * Going to a more unstructured environment, moving to a new location after retirement

Retirement (out for several years)

* What do you wish you knew at the time of separation?  
  * Mentally preparing for the other side; slower paced, not as intense, be ready to slow down a little bit  
  * It’s okay to not be so aggressively committed as you were in the military  
* What do you wish you knew about VA benefits?  
  * Medical is a little more difficult, things take a lot longer. Once you’ve been through the process a few times it’s easier but knowing that you need to schedule things 2 months in advance you get used to it. System is flooded and backlogged.  
* Using CommCare to reduce times?  
  * Nobody at VA told me about CommCare; it took me 6 months just to be seen, per regulations you have to be seen before you can be referred to CommCare now that you are in the database  
  * That initial consult was really annoying just to get into the system  
  * I go on base now because it’s a lot easier than going to the VA clinic, but not everyone has that option. It’s more familiar to me having been in the military for 20+ years  
* What do you want VA to most understand about your experience as a Veteran in the first few years?  
  * It can be frustrating because VA is so backlogged; sometimes making things easier  
  * Went to a military treatment center, easier to get meds (anti-arthritis), went to VA for meds and they wouldn’t issue it until they had EKG and other things, so possibly without meds for 2+ months, then appointment to get script filled  
  * The protocols were very rigid and made it easier to do at the military treatment facility, they were able to fill the script right away  
  * Main VA center is in Orlando, avoid it because of the drive

Prototype Link

* Goals  
  * Understand benefits  
    * Anything I missed or possibly something new?  
    * VGLI is on my list of things to fix; switched from 400-500k, you can now switch to increased life insurance  
* Service  
  * 3+ years  
* Branch  
  * Army  
  * AD  
* Separation  
  * 3+ years  
* Discharge  
  * Honorable  
* Disability	  
  * Filed and received  
* Review  
  * Recap  
* Results  
  * Interested in State Veteran Benefits  
    * Expected to be a live site (it is)  
  * Is VA Life something different from VGLI?  
    * \[Logs into DSLogon\]  
      * Explores VA Life  
      * Confirms some data  
      * Will return to page, didn’t know about it before today  
      * First would google it and see if it was something I am interested in or would use, then would reach out to folks in my network  
* What would you do if not during a test?  
  * Probably have clicked back until I got back to this page  
* Time sensitive?  
  * Needs to be a priority, but I missed it so I don’t know but it would be a priority  
* Would you recommend this tool?  
  * I would yea, it’s a one-stop shop; not just for someone that’s looking for a very specific thing  
  * Full spectrum of buffet of options to choose from, a great starting point  
  * Now that I know that it’s out there I’ll look more into the VA Life program  
* Who do you think this would help the most?  
  * The window of people that are transitioning to the next year or two, or retired in the last year.  
  * Something there for everyone, knowledge is power, if you don’t know about them

# Intro \- 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is Anna Higgins and \[NOTETAKER NAME\] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experiences transitioning from active service and understanding VA benefits.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.  
    
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.  
    
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.  
    
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?  
    
  - \*\*If no:\*\* Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
  - If yes: Admit observers.

\[\!TIP\]

- Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
- Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth  
    
- *(If applicable)* You'll be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. \*\*Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.\*\*  
    
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.  
    
  - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?


  \*\*\[Record answer here\]\*\*


- Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.  
    
  - Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?


  \*\*\[Record answer here\]\*\*


  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

➡️ Start recording.

\[\!TIP\] After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Yes

- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

Yes

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. Tell me a little about the last time you interacted with VA.   
   - Annual medical with doctor  
   - 3-4 months ago  
   - Prescription renewal  
   - [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) is improving  
     - [ ] UX was very annoying  
     - [ ] Login \- loop  
     - [ ] VA is VA  
     - [ ] Once you’re in it’s easy  
   - 4.5 years  
   - Air Force   
     - [ ] Just active duty 

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
   -   
2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   - Been wanting to retire before that, stationed overseas (lots of messy life changing events) & wouldn’t let him retire for AF reasons   
   - Moved to Florida & didn’t have connections there   
   - COVID just kicked off   
   - Tough time to have a lot of life changing events all happening at the same time (divorce, trying to retire but not able to, COVID, etc). Everything was different & a culture shock   
   - Surprisingly approved retirement, then it was fast. No actual plan \- all of a sudden things were due immediately. Had a plan based on previous family dynamic which no longer existed.   
   - Living somewhere he had no network, relied a lot more on the structure of the VA as some sort of hand hold & it functioned   
   - Went through TAP  
3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - Didn’t have a notebook or anything to track these things. All the life changes, divorce started, COVID, never got my things, so I didn’t have a system.   
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
   - Didn’t have a local network, had friends but no one local in a position who could help with the things he needed. Too many unknowns. Jobs required commitment that I didn’t have at the time.   
   - Psychological idea of having a tribe or a concept of a community continuing. Didn’t have a tie to the local area & no way he was going to leave (kids in the area).   
   - Started looking into VA programs to give him a sense of purpose. Most obvious immediate one was signing up for healthcare & figuring out if & how benefits compensation worked. The learning & education opportunities.   
   - Trying to find out how to get a decent job without knowing anybody in the area or knowing what jobs were around, what childcare he’d need. Lined up what options existed. Interested in figuring out atypical childcare arrangements (ex: have kids one week on & one week off \- most businesses didn’t want to watch kids only part time). Didn’t know what exact situation would be in a few months or years, so looked into what the options were  
   - Priorities: healthcare, childcare, employment  
   - Programs participated in  
     - [ ] Health / Medical  
     - [ ] Education   
           - [ ] This was 3 years ago   
     - [ ] Post 911 GI Bill used  
   - Any benefits you looked into but didn’t end up using?   
     - [ ] Lots of cool vocational programs, so many other niche programs that weren’t technically education but more about peace of mind & such. Ex: friend in Wyoming did beekeeping. Little examples of things that peaked my interest but never did them   
     - [ ] Lots more, but that’s the one that comes to mind  
   - Did you work with a VSO?   
     - [ ] All of the mandatory out processing appointments weren’t actually mandatory, a lot of things got waived but going over records wasn’t waived.   
     - [ ] Yes, the only other person interacted with other than the VA  
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   - Is there anything the VA could have done?   
     - [ ] The TAP process, the tote bag was full of the material. Had I had that, I imagine that would have been a structure I could rely on or build on, I just didn’t personally have that.   
6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For   
   - Money  
7. RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   - Money to maintain shelter food & warmth. 

   

8. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   - Knowing I couldn’t act on them anyway, ask all the questions & take all the notes so I could piece together more of an idea.  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - Getting better. Daunting moving to a new bureaucracy when you’re in need. Those experiences vary as much as humans because it is humans that you’re interacting with. Not knowing what to ask for. I had a lot of friends who told me what to look into & ask, but not everyone has that  
   - We know there are education programs, but not knowing how that could fit into your life. That’s what you’re supposed to do through TAP, right? A lot of us were told we could do TAP before retirement so it wasn’t fresh at all (when I retired).   
   - TAP is still beneficial, but if there was a refresher   
   - How many people can do TAP in advance?   
     - [ ] Most of my unit did it early  
     - [ ] Any time you’re coming up on that set number of years you’re going to TAP, even if you don’t intend on separating. Until you reenlist you are potentially getting out. If you don’t reenlist then you’re screwed without TAP.   
     - [ ] We all had that baseline of knowledge but it wasn’t fresh  
   - Did you know how & why to lock down your DD214 & medical records, was that common knowledge?   
     - [ ] Network & being around 20+ years you pick that up  
     - [ ] It was checklist to request them   
     - [ ] They were a couple of things that weren’t actually required, they were waived  
   - What was most urgent that got overlooked for other folks?   
     - [ ] So many things & everyone’s experience was different  
     - [ ] Lots of debt  
     - [ ] Overwhelming amount of unaddressed administrative things \- decorations, awards, etc. Within the last year we’ve had to write our own decorations & that’s weird to write your own. It turns out if you don’t have your medal, it doesn’t go onto your DD214 & to prove that later is sometimes possible sometimes not depending on who you’re trying to prove it to. It didn’t matter to them “& they gotta go”.   
     - [ ] Historically military people don’t go to the doctor, certainly not when the problem is happening because you have to get the mission done   
     - [ ] Not having a plan. Having an A plan, but not a B plan, & a C plan. A lot of these things happened so fast so people would have to execute on a plan whether or not there was a backup.

## Usability Test

First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Complete questionnaire  
        
- [ ] Interact with results (includes reading results page, filtering results page, printing or screenshotting, redoing questionnaire to understand results, changing answers)

- Using Chrome   
- Questionnaire   
  - Like the progress bar concept knowing its not an eternal question tree, that’s a huge source of frustration usually. Normally just want my info  
  - Understands all of the questions   
  - Took a pause for the review page  
- Results   
  - Took a second to see you had to scroll down to see all benefits   
  - Clicked on Learn More out of curiosity   
    - Oh okay, this takes me to something else I’m guessing  
    - Would you like to learn more is handy   
    - I do like that it’s defaulting to a new tab since there are 15 things I got & I don’t want to keep going back & forth & back & forth for each recommendation  
    - Neat, okay\! I like the elevator pitch, bite size blurbs   
    - This is taking me to the right page instead of a whole new…redirecting to the program page owned by the program so there’s no need to worry about the validity of info from my side at least  
  - Was it clear about the concept of validity of info? Were you wondering about that if this would be updated or be the right place?   
    - Not until a few in when I started to get into the pages. It was a tertiary thought   
  - If you wanted to apply to one of these programs, does the results page meet your needs?   
    - I didn’t think about that until now but I see the apply now button that can take me to the apply page. I still need to look into it and apply, but my confidence is   
    - Not making it harder  
  - Any benefits jumping out to you that you didn’t know about?   
    - Not really   
    - I didn’t really look into housing grants. I knew there was housing allowance associated with the GI Bill, but I didn’t look into anything else. When I saw that just now I realized that I quickly dismissed it because it was related to a physical disability to get access (ex: having to modify your house for a disability).   
  - When you’re transitioning out of active duty, how would you have used it differently? Are there benefits you’d explore then?   
    - I explored all the things I could find since I didn’t know what my situation would be so I tried to educate myself as much as possible on what’s out there. I even got my burial plot not that I was having those thoughts, just so I could be ready so when I knew my life circumstances I could jump on it. I looked into just about everything.   
  - Did you notice the time sensitive tag on them?   
    - No   
    - (Instructed to scroll down to a time sensitive one, had to scroll quite a ways)  
    - I really didn’t see it, it didn’t get my attention   
  - When you were scrolling fast scrolling through, what were you searching for?   
    - Anything new or different. I think I already know what programs are out there so triaging what I wanted to look at first  
  - Are there any benefits on here that you didn’t know about besides the housing?   
    - I don’t think so   
  - Do you feel confident that you’re being shown all the benefits that you’re interested in?   
    - No & my cast of doubt isn’t on the VA, its because I’m clicking buttons. The output is only as good as my input   
  - Do you have any questions?   
    - Am I really going to open all things in one sitting, no. Am I going to follow through on all tabs? No. I’m just gonna have to create my own checklist of what to do. I don’t want all of this in my VA account because the programs I’m interested in could change 4 weeks later.   
  - If you logged in & the VA had the results of your questionnaire & created a checklist on the same page where your pharmacy refills were for example, you wouldn’t want that?   
    - Oh I guess it might. If it was only something like “here are those programs that you wanted to look at”, it would probably make me do it   
    - My own internal thought process was limiting the product to my short sighted vision  
  - What would you like to be saved about this, how would you like to come back to this? 	  
    - Add programs or look at other programs  
  - How would you like to see this again? A link, an email?   
    - It would be easier for everyone for an email & then its stored & I can choose to reference it later. You mentioned that so it has appeal.   
    - You could do the thing where you send a link to the email where the webpage & the login splash page on my VA internet experience, having that as one of those options. What are you here for today? Health, Education. Do you want to know more?   
  - Didn’t look at filters, view all, or back button

Things to watch for:

-   
- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
  -   
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  - I don’t know, there’s nothing else pertinent for you to know   
- Would you recommend this tool to your network?  
  - Yes because I think its generally speaking useful, its serving its intended purpose of aiding & not funneling.   
    - [ ] A lot of the time, intentional or not, we’re led to one of a handful of results. Either because its the providers preferred program or the one with the most vested into it so there’s more hits for it. Whether by intent to drive a product, or just because the architecture.   
    - [ ] Would you rather be overwhelmed & not funneled   
          - [ ] I would rather have 30 of these boxes that I can dismiss 50% of rather than have the same 5 programs I’ve already heard about   
- Who would it help the most?

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


  \*\*\[Record answer here\]\*\*

- Comfortable sharing \- yes  
- Any part of discussion you don’t want to share in a video clip? No 

## Gene’s notes

Transition Experience – Participant (July 18, 2pm ET)

Last VA interaction

* Regular doctor visits, prescription renewals in the last month or so

Experience with VA?

* Has been improving, used to have a lot of issues with login loops, took forever, was super annoying  
* Once I got there, it was easy to find and get through. Seems to be improving a bit

Time since transition?

* Around 4.5 years  
* Air force  
* Active Duty

Experience transition

* Lot of complicated life change things happening  
* Air force wouldn’t let me retire for ‘air force’ reasons  
* Moved to Florida with no connections right as COVID kicked off, but a very odd time for significant life changes, divorce, moving, trying to plan for a retirement (with date unknown)  
* Trying to figure things out having been overseas for about a decade, everything was different and a big culture shock  
* Once it was approved it was very fast  
* Had a concept of a plan, but no real plan  
* A lot of things came due right away; but complicated life situations  
* Relied a lot more on the structure of the VA  
* Had some modest help, tentative job offers, but couldn’t take full advantage since there were a lot of unknowns

TAP Class

* Did complete TAP class

Supports used at VA

* Having a community; really had no ties to local area and no way I was going to leave so I needed some sense of belonging  
* Wasn’t going to go in to hang out, but a sense of purpose  
* Healthcare was the most obvious immediate one  
  * If any how benefits and compensation works  
* Learning more about education opportunities

Priorities (at VA and outside)

* My specific circumstances were not the most common  
* Trying to figure out how to get a decent job with no network  
* Not knowing schedule and availability  
* Not knowing what childcare is available  
* Healthcare and local job prospects, knew the VA was good for that  
  * Health and medical  
  * Looked into a lot of benefits but used education (\~3 years ago), post 9/11 GI bill  
* Q: Assistance?  
  * Worked with DoL employee as part of out-processing function, they were physically there on base sometimes  
  * Not every out process was that necessary at the time  
  * The VA portion was not waived, thankfully

What would you tell yourself?

* Take lots and lots of notes  
* Didn’t have a good system; with all of the life changes, I didn’t have a lot of my things

Could VA have done anything to help with the management of that (during family disruption)?

* TAP process; tote bag full of the material; if I’d had that it would have been a structure to build on but I personally didn’t have it

What were you most worried about during transition

* Money, making sure that I had enough to eat, stay housed, stay cool

Benefits you looked into but didn’t end up using?

* Vocational programs and so many other niche programs that were not technically education  
* Peace of mind; a friend in Wyoming did a beekeeping program, little things like that that got my interest but never did them

What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?

* It’s daunting to move to a new bureaucracy when you are in need and not used to having to navigate it and figure out, which is part of why VSOs exist, those experiences vary (VSOs are almost like free lawyers)  
* Had time to deal with it, and friends to ask but often we don’t know what to ask about  
* We know about the core programs, but not really knowing how they could fit into your life  
* That’s part of the goal of TAP, for a lot of us “Hey you can do TAP now so do it now”  
  * I did TAP years before retirement so it wasn’t fresh when I went through it and my life experiences were much different  
  * TAP is still very useful and beneficial, top-up or refresher that’s not self-driven  
  * Most of my unit did TAP years before they left; you can go to TAP towards the end of an enlistment. Until you’ve potentially re-enlisted, you can be out of luck by not taking TAP. So some take it, then re-enlist, and go years without TAP OR they have the outprocess really quickly (within 1-2 months) and with no TAP available, it was difficult

DD214

* Network, and being around for 20+ years, but it was also a checklist to request many of the steps in the process

Folks leaving separating with urgency

* Biggest issues; immense amounts of debt, overwhelming amount of unaddressed things (admin things), decorations, awards. In last 10 years we had to start writing our own decorations which feels weird. But if you don’t have your Iraqi medal, it doesn’t go onto your DD214 and it becomes much harder or impossible to prove it later on after separation. There were a lot of examples of that. Physical and mental healthcare are often delayed but if it’s not logged in records, it’s harder.  
* Not having a plan, having a plan but no plan B or C

Switch to Prototype

* Goals  
  * Financial support for service-connected  
  * Health and well-being  
  * Understand benefits  
* Time  
  * 3+ years  
* Branch  
  * Air Force  
  * Active Duty  
* Service  
  * No  
  * 3+ years since separation  
* Discharge  
  * Honorable  
* Disability  
  * Filed and received  
* Review  
  * Check box  
* Results  
  * State benefits  
  * \[Learn mores are handy\]  
  * Looked into SBA  
  * Redirecting to the page owned by the program so we keep

Any benefits that you didn’t know about?

* Never looked into housing grants  
  * I dismissed it assuming it required physical disability for housing grants  
  * Will probably click on that later to confirm my assumptions  
* Explored all of the benefits I could find, trying to educate myself on what was out there, things like burial plots, was looking into everything you could find

Time sensitive?

* Didn’t catch my attention

What were you skimming for or looking for?

* Keywords, anything new or different

Are you seeing everything?

* No, and don’t expect to. Output is only as good as my input.

Notes?

* Am I going to look through everything? No  
* Have to make my own checklist of what to do  
  * Putting it on the VA to manage would not be preferable because my priorities can change  
* First thought, I don’t want to redo the questionnaire every time

If logged in, would it be useful?

* If logged in, it would probably make me do it if it was stored in some way

What would you like to preserve about this?

* See the results and be able to go back and update and change, look at other programs  
* Email this to me (send a link), the webpage result content sent to email, or in the login page in MyVA as one of the options; what are you here for today (health, ed, etc do you want to learn more?)

Would you recommend this tool to others?

* Yes, I think it’s useful generally. It’s serving its intended purpose, aided in filtering and not funneling  
  * A lot of the time we’re led to end results because it’s the provider’s preferred program. More roads lead to it (for one reason or another)  
* Would prefer to see more results and filter them out myself rather than be led to the same 5 benefits I’m already aware of

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. Have you used VA.gov before? (If yes: how? If yes: Do you have a login?)  
   - Last interaction with VA was when I went there for a pain management appointment. Had some injections in my upper back / lower neck  
   - Went well   
   - Since reached out to them through the portal to chat with them  
   - Separated 2021  
   - Served in Army, Active Duty & National Guard  
     - [ ] National Guard \- in 8 years and then went into active duty for a total of 4 consecutive years, but total 6\. Combined about 12 years  
   - How did you go from National guard to active duty?   
     - [ ] I had been wanting to do it for a while & a friend of mine asked me if I would be interested in doing it. He talked to a recruiter & they were looking for more chaplains, prior times they weren’t looking for national guard chaplains. I reached out & started application process & by May of 2017 I was on active duty   
   - 

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
   - Been out for about 4 years  
   -   
2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   - My process was unique in that for a lot of different factors, I was medical retirement separation & it started in March 2020 which is when the world shut down due to COVID. My entire process got stretched out for \- it was supposed to take 4-6 months, it took me about a year to get orders in hand.   
   - My process was done with the I des process. The VA & DOD side were looking at my disability ratings in the same time, same board, so it allowed things to be smoother once the world started opening back up from COVID.   
   - Did you use TAP?   
     - [ ] Yes. Some of that was a checking of the box because some of the resources weren’t available with COVID. Fortunately being an officer & having those resources, it wasn’t like going from one job to the next like people who separated prior. I was working a full time job   
   - When did the planning start?   
     - [ ] About October 2019 that the process would start. It was a lot of start stops because of COVID shutting things down. I was stationed in Hawaii which is the most restrictive state because the nearest ICU was 5 hours away which meant a lot of medical services were delayed so a lot of my planning would start stop. I had to turn down about 5 jobs because medical priorities were focused on COVID or risk mitigation. I was pretty much on vacation in Hawaii, but it was stressful because on top of that not only was I retiring, moving off an island in the pacific ocean, but also started an MBA. They worked with me I didn’t have to come in person until I was back into the continental US.   
3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - I’m a list guy in general, I’m a task oriented person. Organized even if its chaotic, its organized chaos. The file will be in this pile, I don’t know where in that pile but it’ll be in the pile   
     - [ ] Big journal guy. Use passion planner, notes app, I use the calendar app. I think digital is good but paper doens’t crash. Notes app that comes on mac  
     - [ ] Can’t remember any other tools used other than a good fountain pen  
   - Worked with a VSO & a lot of their stuff had an app & a checklist which allowed you to stay on top of those things  
   - Accountability piece because of the medical review board & they would stay on top of you. Lot of people calling to ask about things.   
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
   - Yes I did. My commander was really patient iwth me as much as he could be. He & the command wanted to make certain that if I keyed left & a new commander came in, a new chaplain would come in working in a new division stay out of his way \- he was advocating for me  
   - O2O ?   
   - My next door neighbor I grew up with was guiding me through the transition process from a medical standpoint to get credit for what was justified to advocate for yourself (not manipulate the system). I’ve been able to help others with resources like O2O. I’m still discovering resources, my wife just discovered resources. We could get Google Project Management certificate through Coursera. Also got help from Wounded Warrior Project.   
   - Always trying to pass information on to others  
   - What support have you given to other people?   
     - [ ] Wounded Warrior Project, I’ve shared with them Emory healthcare program that works with the VA. Jacksonville has a program.   
     - [ ] Facebook support groups in Alabama, pop up there I’m a veteran & I need help, things like that  
     - [ ] Education benefit. Helping folks maximize their VA benefit, GI Bill, Chapter 31 if they qualify.   
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   -   
6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   - Doing too much at one point in time.   
   - In october 2020 I had a panic attack, I was leaning into too many things at one time. Prioritized what was really important what I really want to go after, still do that now  
   - The other piece is where to work, how to work. Because of the transition we didn’t know where we were going to live, I got out in Hawaii & I didn’t have a job. We went back & lived with family which was its own frustration. Eventually we kept looking at our options, potential, & interests & we figured out what we were going to do next. I didn’t get a viable job until August 2023\.   
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   - I wish that I knew there was going to be a pandemic because it wrecked a lot of things. I had a lot of things lined up but I couldn’t leave Hawaii   
   - One thing, I wish that voc rehab was a little clearer on what you could & couldn’t do. Would have been nice to have a more direct path, a lot got lost in the bureaucracy.   
   - Its something I would like to do at some point. I don’t have to do it now as dire as I did before due to having a viable job, but as I have other education interests & I’m a government contractor. That can come & go, its not a guaranteed thing year to year. If I could get paid from voc rehab to get experience that’s something I would like to have.   
   - Did you have an understanding about what benefits were   
     - [ ] Social workers called me immediately to set up medical appointments. They were clear that all veterans get psychology counseling if you wanted to do that. I researched things pretty well too. Beyond voc rehab, I have had & do have a good understanding of what I qualify for   
8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - What I want the whole veteran transition community is those of us who separated from 2020 \- 2021 had a unicorn experience with COVID & they might want to relook at, in my case I don’t need my percentages relooked at, but relook at did we tailor the transition or what could be tailored differently due to COVID. It became a one size fits all checklist, but a lot of the checklist didn’t apply.   
   - As a chaplain you’ve probably been in an advisor role, is there anything you’ve learned from other people that the VA should know about improving their services? 	  
     - [ ] Travel pay at the VA, it got to the point a notes app on my phone I was taking a picture of the travel form every time because they were saying you’re not in the system. At one point they said I didn’t have any disability ratings, I did because I’d been there before.   
     - [ ] What I’d like the VA to understand is that yes as a chaplain I can be more patient, as an officer I know how to professionally address things, however there are a lot of young soldiers their only life experience beyond high school is the military. They’re still 22 years old & don’t have the life experience to represent themselves in that kind of way & that transition is scary enough. Competence is very important especially for those younger soldiers. 

## Usability test

First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Complete questionnaire  
- [ ] Interact with results (includes reading results page, filtering results page, printing or screenshotting, redoing questionnaire to understand results, changing answers)

- Using Google Chrome browser  
- [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)   
  - The “Get Started” can get lost   
  - Links can get lost  
  - It would be more helpful if it switched to a button type of look   
- Questionnaire   
  - Goals  
    - Was looking at what the header of this question was, looking at what it was listed under  
    - One thing I hope I never qualify for, I’m able to walk right now but my rating is in a place where if I ever need a vehicle with wheelchair access the VA would help with that. That might be under “Take care of my health and well-being” but there are some people who don’t even know that benefit is out there. The uncertainty is how detailed does it need to be here vs how generalized.   
  - Service  
    - Pretty straight forward  
    - That makes sense, I understand what that means \- title 10 vs title 32\.   
      - I would encourage a little bit more clarity around what Title 10 means   
      - Ex: earlier you were having trouble computing my service, probably confused I served 4 years on active duty but 6 total, the other 2 were active duty guard time but it wasn’t deployment, it was local home station (suicide prevention work) for about 2 years. During active duty it wasn’t title 10\.   
      - Most people have had title 10, but if they’ve not then they don’t have title 10 time & its just under title 32\.   
      - Especially because we aren’t going to be in theaters of war anytime soon or anything like that. In these going forward future, more people may be in that situation than in the last 20 years.   
  - Separation   
    - It stops at 3+ years, any reason why it stops there?   
      - Anna: any reason you can think of why it stops there?   
      - M: biggest is the fact that at that point its beyond typical deadlines that people would need. The reason why I’m concerned is there are some folks whose records were so far back they were harder to get  
      - Anna: Is there any way we’re phrasing questions that would cause someone to stop & think VA can’t help me?   
      - M: depends on what bias they bring into it, they have bad information or good information. The 3+ years might give them the left & right limit or make them feel that nothing can be done. The further we go on, most of my generations records are digitized that my concern may not be an issue because so many things are digitized. I purposely download my records twice a year, they’re there a lot easier than what they were 30 years ago when everything was primarily paper.   
  - Discharge  
    - You’ve got a link there about a chart, I’m gonna take a look at it  
    - Good drop downs  
    - I feel like I’ve seen something like this before  
    - I would have spouses & sometimes active soldiers getting ready to get out & they would be getting honorable conditions general so they would come to me hoping I would tell them they would get VA benefits. Spouses who were prior military would ask do I know this or that. I was able to point them to drop down websites similar to this. It takes veterans to the other site so they can get some of the basic common questions answered  
  - Disability   
    - You might want to add to this “I’ve filed a disability claim & received a rating but would like reconsideration or an upgrade or an increase” if something happens even with the CPAP rating situation has changed. Right as I was getting out, plantar fasciatus got to 20% rating, people who got out in 2019 they might have it but want it relooked at if it would allow them to cross into another tier connected to a higher rating.   
  - Review  
    - I like the edit button, you don’t have to go all the way back through it looks like  
    - It takes you straight there, you don’t have to leave the page. I think we’ve all been in the situation where we have to do it all over again  
    - I like how its a drop down   
    - Went back to do the disability rating with Anna’s prompting. Forgot to select something previously because he was talking about increased ratings   
    - Didn’t press submit, thought it didn’t go anywhere.   
      - Anna reassured him it wouldn’t be saved  
  - Results  
    - Copy link to results button   
    - Selected the filters  
    - Hit Learn more about vetsuccess on campus   
      - I’m not familiar enough with vetsuccess on campus and I went two links further when it showed me all the links to the schools. I was looking to see if it was similar to the one on auburn university, it looks like this is more VA led.   
    - When you're scrolling, what are you looking for & reading & decide to stop on?   
      - I’m scanning for the bold to see if its an interest, or the careers & interest section before I read anything else. I’m not gonna read the paragraph if the headings don’t apply to me.   
      - Time sensitive benefit   
        - If you’re gonna have a heading at the top that says time sensitive, it should be at the top. I understand why disability compensation is at the top, but maybe have a heading in blue on disability compensation that says time sensitive & then right underneath it do the time sensitive stuff.   
        - What I’m concerned about is the VA website is informative but its a lot of information. If I’ve gotten to this page, I may be at the point where yes you can filter time sensitive there if I look at the filter, I may just start looking at the headings in the right column or I may be tired & not scroll all the way down to the time sensitive options because its not at the top.   
      - Someone else said they’re looking for the benefits they don’t already know about, how do you feel about that?   
        - These are alphabetical I see.   
        - My initial thought is you don’t know what you don’t know. Unless you go one by one, you’re not gonna know what’s fully here but I don’t know how to fully address that since you can’t put in the filter “things I don’t know” because the website doesn’t know what I don’t know.   
      - If you had a search bar with key words. You can always do the control F, younger soldiers may know about that but older veterans maybe not. Having a search bar that would bring up some of these different categories to take them straight there or say no result would help.   
      - My sense of this page is that it is a detailed table of contents to know where you want or where to go to go deeper into the VA website for your benefits 

Things to watch for:

- Does the participant understand "previous period of service" language?  
- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - Beyond what I’ve already shared, the only thing I will say is need to be consistent with capitalization of the benefit names.   
  - Does the inconsistency impact your trust in the sites or results you’re getting?   
    - [ ] Knowing its a beta it doesn’t, but if not it would affect the trust or think typical government hired the lowest bidder.   
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  - If someone starts at one VA & moves then goes to another VA, what that process looks like. I know some veterans prefer to go to a VA further away due to the care given. At that point you’re looking at a transition beyond the initial transition. 

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


- Yes

* Still discovering resources, wife has also been finding resources like a google PM support through Coursera, Wounded Warrior program  
  * Always trying to pass it on to others

Support to others?

* Wounded Warrior project have passed along, local program (University of Jacksonville FL, FB Support groups, education benefits  
* Helping folks maximize their VA benefit; Post 911, Chapter 35, Chapter 31 for spouse if they qualify

Concerns during transition?

* Doing too much; in Oct 2020 leaned into too many things and got overwhelmed  
* The job; where to work, how to work, didn’t know where were going to live. Didn’t have a job when I left, moving back and living with family. Took until Aug 2023 until a really viable job.

What do you wish you had known

* I wish I would have known there was going to be a pandemic \[really messed up plans\]  
* Vocational Rehab was a little clearer on what does or does not qualify you. I felt like a lot got lost in the bureaucracy  
  * Would like to take advantage of it at some point  
  * Currently a gov contractor, somewhat inconsistent year to year  
  * Would be be good to utilize Voc Rehab (job training, etc)

Time sensitivity of benefits?

* I was aware, VA and social workers setup medical appointments, were clear about benefits like psychology counseling  
* I also researched things pretty well  
* Have had and do have a good understanding of deadlines and what I qualify for

What do you most want VA to understand about your experience

* Veteran Transition Community – those of us who separated in 2020-2021 had a unicorn experience, they may want to look back at the way transition was handled; it was too one-size-fits-all because a lot of the process didn’t apply at the time

Transition from perspective as a chaplain?

* Competence; travel pay used to be paper now online  
  * At a certain point I had to take a photo of travel forms and dates because it kept saying “you’re not in the system”  
  * There are a lot of young soldiers who their only life experience is the military, so at 22-23 years old they don’t have the life experience to represent themselves in the right ways. 

Switch to prototype

One thing that bugs me about the VA website; get started links can get lost, would be more helpful as a gutton

* Goals  
  * Go back to school  
  * Start a new career  
  * Health and well-being  
  * Thinking about if VA rating qualifies me an accessible vehicle in the long-term, some people don’t even know that benefit is out there; uncertainty, how detailed does it need to be here  
* Time  
  * 3+  
* Service  
  * Army  
  * Active  
  * National Guard  
    * Title 10  
      * Encourage a little more clarity on what Title 10 means  
      * Other 2 years of AD were in guard time, but were not a deployment, local home station, suicide prevention work for about 2 years. It was not Title 10 but Title 32 time.  
* Separation  
  * 3+ years ago  
  * Concerned with complicated records but some were so far back they were hard to get  
  * Most modern records are digitized, but older records are often still in paper  
* Character  
  * Discharge link, this is a link that VA created if I had to guess  
  * Something I saw even as a chaplain, spouses or active soldiers would get discharge status like Honorable (General), would they still get benefits?  
* Disability  
  * \[Might want to add a disability increase option\]  
  * Since I've gotten out CPAP rating info has changed (gotten stricter)  
  * As I got out, plantar fasciatis was up to 10%, now might move up to 20% rating increase  
  * Selected 1st option (have a rating)  
* Review  
  * Like the edit button  
  * Like that you don’t have to leave the page to adjust answers  
  * Like that it’s a dropdown list  
* Results  
  * Clicks on the copy  
  * Investigates the filters  
  * Looks at VSOC learn more page, goes to counselor page  
    * Not familiar with it  
  * Looking at bold text if it’s of interest  
    * Looking at careers and employment tag  
    * Won’t read the Paragraph if headings don’t matter  
* If you have a time sensitive benefit, would be better towards the top  
  * VA website is informative but it’s a lot of info  
  * If I’ve gotten to this page, I may just start looking at the headings without using the filters, might miss the time sensitive categories  
* Search bar might be useful as well  
* My sense of this page is almost like a detailed table of contents to go deeper into VA website  
* Consistency between caps on things like “FMP” vs “Disability comp” vs “State Veterans Benefits” vs “GI Bill benefits”

## Semi-structured interview

Last interaction with VA

* Made an appt, annual exam and virtual appointment in May  
  * Went well this time  
  * Tried to schedule a virtual appointment a while back and were not able to see me so had to reschedule

Time since separation

* Separated from AD 5 years ago  
* Was in reserve until 2023  
* Served 8 years in Navy  
  * 5 active  
  * 3 reserve, hopped on active orders  
    * Last AD was in Aug of 2021

TAP during this time?

* As I was separating from AD

Reserves

* Having separated from AD and there’s differences between  
  * A lot of Veterans are hesitant to look at disability claims while in reserves from their AD time

DD214

* My transition from AD to reserves was not that structured  
  * Sea Duty (separated from here)  
  * Shore Duty  
* Was on deployment before hard separation date  
* Command should have allowed me to pursue more of separation stuff (medical, dental, TAP possibly 1x or 2x)  
* Got back in December, separated in January. Process was completely condensed, it was a checklist that got rushed through.  
* DD214 had issues, a lot of back and forth and by that point I was basically out so it took some time to get it corrected  
* Got left feeling pretty angry about the process  
  * Missed the VA disability presentation due to a dental appointment  
  * Had to catch up navigating everything in the reserves as a buffer  
* Command was more focused on my usefulness rather than on my outcomes  
* A lot of this reflects the gaps in personnel, but didn’t give room for me

Tools or process to manage

* Had a checklist sheet from my command a “leaving command” checklist, not even a separation checklist  
* Outside of knowing that I needed to go to TAP and getting DD214, there wasn’t a formal procedure or checklist

Support from network

* Most of my support was from Veterans already separated helping fill those gaps, mentors  
* Would prefer a policy that there’s a minimum 3 months hard line to give someone enough time to figure out  
  * This is not the servicemembers responsibility

Wish you had known?

* About the disability claims process  
  * Didn’t even hear about BDD until I was at TAP  
* Knew about GI Bill, not entirely sure P911 vs Chapter 30  
* I wish TAP wasn’t the first touchpoint I had to learn about some of these things  
* Wanted to make sure I had some medical stuff document  
  * On a ship for 9 months, no Navy doctor  
  * Have a couple of weeks, a lot of issues from the many deployments but very little time to get things documented in medical record  
  * Had many denials because I didn’t have the documentation necessary, didn’t have time to dive into something that needed a specialist or detailed care  
  * My military records were thin vs reality of what issues would crop up later in my life

Do you feel caught up now?

* I think I got to a fair rating based on my issues, but it took significantly longer to prove it vs having a clear picture of what would have been documented while separating to have command prioritize my time

What were the biggest concerns about missing things during transition?

* Didn’t know what would happen if I didn’t complete or miss deadlines or dates  
* I was worried about on getting everything done by the checklist by the deadline

Could VA have done things to help?

* More knowledge of some of the big ticket items are on my mind 6-9 months out  
* Some type of formal communications; automated email over the next 3-6 months things to do  
* Was just after a year \[which meant missing some benefits, like the first year of disability benefits\]

Benefits highest priority?

* Education  
  * Going back to school full time while the economy was in a tough place due to COVID  
* Healthcare  
  * Learned that you could be in the reserves and have a VA rating (without any penalty)  
  * Learned this from someone in my reserve unit

## Usability test

Intro page

* Discover your benefits

* Understand my benefits  
* Plan for my and my family’s future

* GI Bill benefits  
  * GI Bill comparison tool  
* Time sensitive  
  * VR\&E  
  * Maybe it should have been at the top  
* VSOC  
  * Never heard of this one

## Post-task interview

* When you served and how long can affect things  
  * Years of service  
  * Active vs reserve years  
* Intro page should be even clearer that it’s just a helpful tool that’s not exhaustive  
* Possibly a reminder when you finish (sort of there already)  
* Possibly a way to call out the importance of certain benefits that family members could be eligible  
  * CHAMPVA  
  * Chapter 35 (as a separate callout)  
* Want a way to save this as a to-do list after I leave this page  
  * Would try to record this in some way that I can reference them later  
  * Export to PDF or list, some way to save this, or saved under my profile on VA.gov  
  * Copy link to results not very visible  
* If it was affiliated with my VA account, the info in my account could help paint a more accurate picture of my benefits, but don’t mind having a generic list of resources  
  * This list would have been useful to me in 2021 when I first got out

Separation from reserves?

* No support  
* The Navy reserve med center lost my medical records, my reserve leadership had just turned over, viewed it more as an admin action  
* Had to switch from Tricare to VA Health (VA was able to close that gap)  
* My life was already in place by the time I was leaving reserves, a lot less stress about it compared to leaving active duty

Other things we should know?

* I wish that DoD / VA partnership was there during the transition process  
  * In my experience they will use you up and then hand you over to the VA  
  * That handoff should have been more intentional  
  * Firmer policies that requirements for DoD  
    * Couldn’t participate in Skillbridge because had deployment in last 6 months

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. Have you used VA.gov before? (If yes: how? If yes: Do you have a login?)  
   - Changing an appointment for VA healthcare – pleasantly surprised because you used to have to go to MHV and now things are consolidated

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
   - Got out in May 2021  
   - Army (active duty) for 8 years

   

2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   - Wasn’t great/good, wasn’t bad  
   - “I did a lot of the work on my own and that paid off”  
   - Rough time because Covid shut a lot of times down  
   - Self-education prepared him more for making it his own journey  
     * Investigating programs led to being able to do Skillbridge and that internship led to employment for the last 4 years  
     * Get on LinkedIn before transition – started following Vet influencers. Heard about “Hiring our heroes” and got connected with them  
       * Hire heroes – revamped resume for free  
       * Hiring our heroes – guide you through interview process  
       * Commit foundation – workshops for developing resume and figuring out what you want to do  
       * Veteratis? – schedule calls with mentors  
       * American Corporate Partners – gave him a mentor for 12 weeks to develop transition plan  
     * Using a lot more private sector and charity organizations  
   - TAP \- year after eligible  
     * Too high level  
     * Focus on what and not the how (how to navigate)  
     * Recommended VSOs  
     * Got the impression that the briefer was trying to check the box  
       * Everything in TAP was a check of the box  
       * Actual transition courses didn’t feel helpful  
       * “I don’t know anyone that ever had a good experience with TAP”

   

3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - No technology, just organized folders  
   - Probably a spreadsheet and google calendar with deadlines  
   - Definitely need a printer for hard-copy paper docs  
   - Got a packet from TAP \- doesn’t remember too much so probably wasn’t too helpful

   

4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
   - People were coming to him for help with transitioning by the end of it (sergeant major, captain)

   

5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
     
6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
     
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   - How much I would have to do myself  
   - “When you’re a young soldier thinking about getting out, you assume there’s a safety net and guided process, and it’s not really like that.”  
   - Known people who fell on their faces when they first got out  
   - Need to be able to commit the time and meet deadlines  
   - Need to start process of documentation for disability and health benefits

   

8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - People need awareness that they need to own their journey and transition – not going to be a guided tour, will be a self-tour that you can get assistance on  
   - Check the box trainings (TAP) need to be different  
     * “I always thought I paid more attention when I knew somebody was talking that actually knew what they were talking about.” (people who actually went through the process)

## Usability test

First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Complete questionnaire  
- [ ] Interact with results (includes reading results page, filtering results page, printing or screenshotting, redoing questionnaire to understand results, changing answers)

\[\!NOTE\]  
Things to watch for:

1. How does the participant interact with the results page?  
   * Scrolls through list of benefits first  
     * Wants to put in disability percentage to get it more catered to him  
     * Would like to connect it to his VA Profile, so it’s less work he has to do  
2. Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
   * Likes the time-sensitive banner – wants to know when it expires. Maybe call out if there’s an expiration date or if you’re ineligible after a certain date.  
     * Would dive into this one first because it feels urgent.  
     * Chapter 31 – clicks learn more link but doesn’t see anything about time-sensitivity  
       * Annoyed that it doesn’t actually seem like it’s time-sensitive  
3. Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
   * Wants more filters like disability rating, did you lose a limb  
     * Thinks he would have to completely start over if he came back to this questionnaire

- Never stops researching benefits and seeing if anything’s changed (once a month or quarter)

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

4. What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
   - If logged in, it’d be easier to see a dashboard that says you have 2 years left on X benefit  
   - Everything feels so siloed  
   - Dashboard should know what I qualify for since it has all my information  
   - If wife or dependents could have access to this information as well  
   - “Always feels like you have to dig for information and find the right place to go”  
5. After using this tool, what would you do next?  
   - Open in a new tab to come back to it or apply for it  
   - Would prefer it to do that by default  
   - Didn’t see the “copy link” button – looked at breadcrumbs before that  
6. What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
   - Share – Email link to himself or someone else  
7. Is there anything else you think we should know?  
   - Going back through form as a TSM  
     * Likes that Skillbridge is there and is time-sensitive  
     * Time-sensitive should be at the top to emphasize priority  
     * Cards say the “what” and not the “how”  
     * Buttons should show how you do that  
     * Would like to see more “Apply now” links – always confident he can back out if he wants to

Consent to use video clips

8. I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
     
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

   

   Yes

## Gene’s notes

Transition Experience – Participant (July 21, 12pm ET)

Last interaction

* Changing an appointment for VA healthcare  
  * Pleasantly surprised; used to have to my MHV and log into a lot of systems  
  * I got rerouted by overall happy to see consolidated into one VA website, was able to move the appointment  
* Service  
  * Separated May 2021  
  * Army  
    * Active duty  
    * 8 years  
* Separation process  
  * Wasn’t good or great but not a bad experience  
  * Did a lot of the work on my own  
  * A lot of my own research  
  * COVID shut a lot of things down, but had a lot of time to do research on what I should be doing, made it my own journey  
  * Self-education  
    * Investigating different programs  
    * Skillbridge, was able to take part in an internship, that employer is still my current employer. Wouldn’t even have known about it if I hadn’t done the research and gone through the motions  
      * A lot of posts on linkedIn  
      * Followed Veteran orgs and “vet influencers”  
      * Found an org called Hiring our Heroes through Skillbridge with a pre-selected group of employers  
      * Found a bunch of others; Commit Foundation, private sector orgs. Using a lot more of the private side, charity orgs  
      * Hiring our Heroes  
        * Helping with the job matching  
      * Hire Heroes  
        * Free resume reviews  
      * Commit Foundation  
      * American Corporate Partners  
        * Gave me a mentor for 12 weeks, develop transition plan  
      * Can’t think of any VA resources I used in that way  
    * By the end of the process some of my COs were coming to me to help with their transition  
  * TAP?  
    * Did it as soon as I was eligible, around 1 year out  
    * The TAP (VABS) course was maybe too high level  
      * “If you have disabilities you can get these benefits”  
      * Didn’t talk about the how or how to navigate or recommend VSOs  
      * Got a sense the person briefing was just trying to check the boxes  
      * Once I got connected with VSOs and VFWs they were a lot more helpful on how to navigate the process  
        * How my packet would be submitted, my record would be collected, things like that  
        * Didn’t get any of that from TAP  
    * Everything in TAP felt like it was checking the box except for getting the clearing checklist  
    * Transition courses didn’t really feel able to answer my questions, just that I had to do it to get out and the people briefing it had to do it because it was their job  
  * Questions?  
    * How the healthcare worked, how much, if family was covered, etc. Was aware there was some financial incentive but not aware of how much  
  * Tech or tools used?  
    * Organized folders, probably a spreadsheet somewhere  
    * Maintaining Google calendar of appointments and deadlines  
    * Definitely need a printer when you’re getting out because of all of the hard copies  
  * What do you wish you knew going in?  
    * About how much I’d have to do myself  
    * You assume there’s a guided a process that lines up for a job  
    * I knew a lot of guys that got out and fell on their faces a bit and then eventually figured things out  
    * So many programs and benefits, you have to take the time to investigate. There’s deadlines that you need to be ahead of the curve with.  
    * The entire disability process is long, the documentation process needs to start very early or you won’t benefit  
  * For those with a bad experience, what do they need?  
    * Awareness that they need to own their process and transition. You can get assistance on it, but it’s yours to own  
    * Some of those check the box processes \[TAP?\] need to have a different atmosphere  
    * I paid more attention when someone talking was knowledgeable (private sector, Veteran, charity org), you weighted their opinions more than someone just reading off a slide  
    * A lot of colleagues waited until the last minute (3-6months). For some folks it’s a 1-2 year process, especially for folks that have been in for a longer time (20+ years) who have no idea what they’re doing

Switch to prototype

  * Disability  
    * Have rating  
  * Review  
    * Brief check of first box  
* Results  
  * I like this time sensitive banner, it told me when it expires, I don’t know how until I call or go down a rabbit hole  
    * Is there an expiration of when I need to use it by, am I ineligible by a certain date  
  * Annoyed that VR\&E has time sensitivity when it doesn’t  
    * Ed note: hard to gauge just based on responses  
  * State benefits  
    * Ed note: has a bug at the moment  
  * Would be nice to have it more personalized based on my personal disability rating % or screening through those qualifications  
  * Think it makes more sense as part of VA.gov account  
    * Maybe there’s two, more of an intro one but after setting up a VA account and rating then you could choose to go through that one logged in  
    * Better filters (have children, disability rating, missing limbs, etc)  
  * GI Bill has been confusing with the recent legal changes  
  * Constantly checking on my status of benefit eligibility (monthly, quarterly)  
* Not seeing but would like to?  
  * It would be easier if there was more of a dashboard feel  
    * 2 years left on GI bill  
    * 100% rating with 2 dependents  
    * A very streamlined visual  
    * Everything feels siloed, have to go to that specific thing  
    * I’d have to go answer questions for GI Bill for some opaque responses  
    * Doesn’t feel like VA information is ever like that  
    * Dashboard should also know what I qualify for (if I haven’t applied for it yet, could inform)  
    * If wife and children could create their own profile and see their eligibility  
* Looked at VA Life but didn’t apply because it’s a 3rd party program through Prudential but it was a seprate application, and supposedly VA needs to waive fees based on eligibility, seemed like it could backfire  
* If I found something really interesting, I would open it in a new tab and look, probably go to the learn more link, maybe apply for it  
  * Would be nice if it already opened up in a new tab so I wouldn’t have to keep clicking back  
* How to get back to this?  
  * Assume I have to complete this again every time  
  * Would be good as part of profile; keeps up to date with life circumstances  
  * Looked at the breadcrumbs (rather than copy link to results)  
  * Would trust results would stay consistent with copied URL  
* Anything else helpful?  
  * Copy link results, only helpful if you can copy it  
  * Would be helpful if I could email it to myself  
* For transition any suggestions? (starting as ‘transition servicemember’)  
  * Goals  
    * Added 2  
  * Separating  
    * In 7 months  
  * Etc  
  * Adds Skillbridge and TAP, transfer GI bill benefits  
    * The transfer benefits action should be more emphasized  
    * “Buttons should be the how”, the action  
* Anything time sensitive should be bumped up  
* Had a lot of bookmarks when I was transitioning, maybe you’re not eligible for something yet  
  * Too far out  
* DoD skillbridge page is missing the how, there’s a brochure but no real path to take

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)? How did it go?  
   - Get a copy of disability letter  
   - Log in with [id.me](http://id.me) – was challenging to navigate to space where the letter was. Wasn’t as intuitive as he hoped for. Wasn’t in his documents in his profile.

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
   - November 2021  
   - Complex departure  
   - Served over 30 years  
   - Back surgery when he was getting ready to retire – was put in for med board, but it was denied.  
   - Caused a mad scramble at the end of his career that was pretty stressful  
   - Personal connections helped him get a letter up the chain to get an extension (ETS was on Sunday, but got approved at 4pm on Friday)  
     * Applied for BDD process and got disability rating at the moment he was retired  
     * Worked with VSO at VFW – Richard Jones (NC)

   

2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   - Went to TAP on base because it’s required  
   - Honor Foundation – interview process, resume writing  
   - Got less out of TAP than Honor Foundation  
     * Lack of consolidation of information  
     * “You have to hear something and then go find information about it”  
     * Used connections with other people

   

3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - Spreadsheet \- 1 year out, do this all the way to ETS date  
     * Went out the window when med board happened  
     * What can I get done in the next 3-4 weeks?  
     * Condensed everything in the timeline

   

4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
   - Honor Foundation  
   - Personal connections – Signal group  
   - VSO

   

5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   - Hasn’t been to the doctor since he’s been out  
   - Home is 30-40 miles from Fort Bragg, 40 min drive to VA  
   - Started the process to get enrolled, but hasn’t been able to complete it in the last 4 years  
   - A step-by-step guide would have been helpful  
     * Wife is seeking out information, but she’s not me so she can’t get everything  
   - Has a medium impact on his life because he knows he needs to get to the doctor. Has tried to stay active and healthy.

   

6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   - Wouldn’t be able to take care of everything he needed to  
   - Has had many injuries throughout his career and knew he didn’t want to wait  
   - Life insurance (VGLI) or something else \- had to settle with what was offered. Was the best option at the time.  
   - Doesn’t feel his family is adequately protected if something happens to him right now.

   

7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   - You have to seek out information – it’s not given to you.  
   - As a Veteran, there are programs out there, but you’re not told about them.  
   - You’re entitled to them and should be told about them.

   

8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - VA should be a resource for Veterans, and not a place where you have to hunt for resources.

## Usability test

First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Complete questionnaire  
- [ ] Interact with results (includes reading results page, filtering results page, printing or screenshotting, redoing questionnaire to understand results, changing answers)

\[\!NOTE\]  
Things to watch for:

1. How does the participant interact with the results page?  
   * Goes straight to benefits list and clicks on state benefits \- likes how that’s laid out  
     * Spent a lot of time on the Discover page  
     * Goes back to results and clicks on VA health – trying to understand the benefit, knows he’s eligible, looking for information on how to apply  
       * Interested in applying by phone to talk to a real person  
       * Has heard getting an appointment is difficult. It won’t be for weeks or months.

   

2. Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
   * None show on his results page

   

3. Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
   * Used the back button to update responses

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

4. What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
   - Purple heart – wants to know what’s actually available  
   - Would like it to be able to take the information from his record and suggest benefits he’s eligible for and who to reach out to

   

5. After using this tool, what would you do next?  
     
6. What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
     
7. Is there anything else you think we should know?  
   - I was spoiled in special ops and there was so much available to me directly. I didn’t carry that into my civilian life, but… I think Veterans are owed more.  
   - They’re owed an easy way to take advantage of the benefits they earned.

Consent to use video clips

8. I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
     
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

   

   Yes

## Gene’s notes

Transition Experience – Participant (July 21, 2pm ET)

Last interaction

* Went to get copy disability status letter  
  * Security issues; navigating to place where the letter was stored was not intuitive

Separation

* Complex separation  
  * Served 30 years  
  * Close to retirement, had significant back surgery  
  * 2 weeks before ETS, got a letter saying med board was denied  
  * Caused a scramble at end of career; got a letter up to chief of air force to get an extension (at e9 with \~30 years needed that level of approval)  
  * Got that letter back at 4pm on a Friday, had to submit it before the Sunday  
  * Got a 4 month extension, then was able to apply for the BDD process (silver lining)  
    * Had a good VSO through VFW that helped through  
    * Got a disability rating the day I got out  
* Most worried about?  
  * Biggest concern; I wouldn’t be able to take care of everything. With all of my injuries, it would be a lot harder to deal with once out  
  * Once the med board got denied, it delayed a lot of things including TAP classes  
* TAP?  
  * Able to go through TAP (1-2 day program)  
  * Did Honor Foundation; personal transition program, interview process, resume writing, hugely beneficial  
  * Got less out of on-base TAP program compared to Honor Foundation  
* VA portion of TAP?  
  * Lack of consolidation of information  
  * Have to hear something about it, then go reach out about it  
  * Feels disjointed in terms of programs available, what happens next  
  * Each person has a different experience; some have VSOs that don’t seem motivated, don’t get packets in on time  
  * Need good information flow or documentation  
    * If you have X here are resources are available to  
    * VA could be a great way to get that info across but it’s not targeted, to what you need  
    * Richard Jones with VFW out of Fort Bragg NC  
* Tools?  
  * Spreadsheets and other documentation  
  * Took a product management approach to deadlines, activities  
* Separated?  
  * Sep 2021  
* Help you need but aren’t getting?  
  * Need dr appointments, but VA clinics aren’t close but started the process to get enrolled; for various reasons haven’t been able to complete it  
* Anything during transition process that could have made it easier?  
  * Any kind of step by step guides  
  * Sometimes you have to seek out  
* Impact without med checkups?  
  * Have been pretty healthy and active, I’m not overly concerned but don’t know where blood pressure and cholesterol levels are  
  * I know I’m not doing what I need to do  
* Other stressors  
  * Had a disability ratings  
  * Felt like I had to settle with life insurance through VA, best option at the time, because of stress of transition, potential cost of policies  
  * Don’t feel adequately protected for family if something happens to me  
  * More about the things that affect family, wanted anything I was entitled to for them  
* Wish you knew before process  
  * You have to seek out a lot more info than you’re given  
  * There are programs there, but it’s not obvious  
  * Want to see it as a “here’s what you need to do”  
  * Information flow is not clear enough  
* What you most want VA to understand about your experience  
  * \[Same as above\]  
  * Resource for Veterans, not as a place you have to go hunt for resources

Switch to Prototype

* State Veteran Benefits  
  * Same bug, page isn’t showing up  
    * Ends up on Discover page  
    * Goes to Combat-Related Special Compensation  
* A lot of folks I know won’t read through these info page, easier if it was more focused “Do you have X, yes” selections  
* \[Goes back to VA.gov tool after many clicks\]  
* \[Goes through tool again with healthcare selected\]  
  * VA Healthcare  
    * Finds information, would probably call the phone number for direct access to someone for next steps  
    * Heard about some concerns about appointment availability, especially for those with higher priority issues  
* Use with MyVA?  
  * If it was able to take the information from my record, based on that some kind of menu these are the Points of Contact, the programs you are eligible for, etc  
    * Massively beneficial, not having to go hunt that down  
* Notes  
  * Had a lot of privilege in my military career in terms of services offered but know that it doesn’t carry over to civilian life  
  * Don’t expect the same level of attention, but I do feel like Veterans are owed more and for benefits to get benefits easier

## Semi-structured interview questions

Warm up question

1. Tell me a little about the last time you interacted with VA.  
   * Last interaction was for education benefits for his son.  
   * Experience was a "pain" because his son is 18 and had to do everything himself.  
   * Challenging trying to verify son's identity with real ID; kept saying "could not verify".  
   * Had to go through the school's VA Office and do everything manually due to time crunch.  
   * Previously worked fine for his oldest son.  
   * Still hasn't gained digital access for his youngest son.  
1. When did you separate from the military?

   * Separated in August 2020\.  
   * Did 25 years active duty in the Air Force.  
   * Coming up on 5 years of separation.  
2. How did the process go for you?

   * Despite hearing "horror stories" about the VA and its system throughout his military career, he "didn't experience any of that".  
   * A VFW Representative submitted all his claims through the VA.  
   * Was able to log in and check the status digitally.  
   * Received notifications as things moved forward and was able to check his disability rating and benefits (including doctor's appointments, medications, prescriptions, and education benefits for children).  
   * Overall, he "had an amazing experience, no issue whatsoever".  
3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)

   * Started working with the VFW rep about 4 months prior to separation. This was tricky because COVID-19 was just starting, so he ended up submitting everything through mail, which was not the standard way. It was still a "fairly easy process".  
   * Completed TAP (Transition Assistance Program) earlier, about 8 months prior to separation.  
   * His unit was "very busy" due to a midterm election and daily flying, making it hard to dedicate time to the transition process.  
   * He had to "stop working and actually focus on myself and the separation".  
   * He tried to schedule appointments "as far as advance" as possible to plan ahead.  
   * His unit (Presidential Airlift Group, assigned to Air Force One) provided "not much support officially". They acknowledged his needs but also stressed mission importance.  
   * He had to "just kind of just say, you know I can't fly this trip" and focused on out-processing.  
   * Knowing that things might shut down due to COVID-19, he "completely walked away from flying piece and just focused on their process side".  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)

   * He received support from a "variety" of sources outside of official Air Force channels.  
   * His network included previous mentors and recently retired colleagues.  
   * He participated in a Corporate Fellowship Program, which advocated for using the VA and VFW and getting ahead of the process. They emphasized the priority of submitting disability claims while still on active duty (within the last 6 months) to get better priority.  
   * At TAP, there was representation from both VFW and the VA. The VA covered benefits, certifications, job placement, and trades, catering to both 4-year separators and career retirees.  
   * The Washington D.C. area VA representatives provided information on local VA hospitals and satellite clinics, making themselves available for questions.  
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?

   * P8 didn't explicitly state current unmet needs but provided feedback on areas that could be improved or were not adequately promoted during his transition. (See responses to question 8 and Post-Task Interview).  
6. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?

   * His primary concern was what would happen with COVID-19, as it was starting and affecting workplaces, remote work, and causing "a lot of uncertainty".  
   * He was also concerned with "focusing on what I would do next. For work work. Wise", though his pension meant he didn't feel rushed.  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)

   * He wished he had personally focused on "starting things a little sooner", ideally a year out, instead of prioritizing the mission.  
   * He wished he had done "maybe networking a little more for potential opportunities outside of the military".  
   * He found LinkedIn to be "very helpful" for networking and job searches, both locally and globally. He promotes it to others.  
   * He did not use VA job placement or resume building services because he had other resources, like the Corporate Fellowship Program, which provided resume tailoring, interview coaching, and headshots. He believes this "set me up for success".  
8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?

   * He wants the VA to know that "outside of taps... you have to go seek the information".  
   * He feels VA resources and eligible benefits aren't sufficiently promoted. He didn't see advertisements on bases or through TAP emails beyond registration. It felt like "you gotta go find it".  
   * He believes "not all of the resources were promoted", with the focus heavily on disability.  
   * He advocates for more focus on "programs that aren't as popular" and "a little less focus on just the medical side and and disability".  
   * Education benefits, while known, also require active seeking.  
   * He learned about entrepreneurship programs for veterans (e.g., small business loans, training) through the Hiring Heroes Fellowship program, not during TAP. He feels these programs, which many veterans could utilize, "should be highlighted" more.  
   * He notes that TAP briefings were predominantly focused on disability (80-85%), with some medical (10%), and very little on vocational opportunities or career counseling (5%).

## Usability test

First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

* Initial impression: The "Discover Your Benefits" tool clearly informs users about available benefits. He found the "goal" selection (e.g., starting a new career, health well-being, understanding benefits) "pretty neat".  
* Questionnaire Process & Observations:  
  * Selected "Starting a career in health" and "understanding my benefits as a whole".  
  * Chose 3+ years of service and initially clicked "currently serving" (though corrected later for current situation).  
  * Noted the options for separation timeframe, discharge type (expecting honorable unless disciplinary action), and disability status (filed/received, in process, denied).  
  * The review page provides a clear overview of selected choices.  
  * Believes most users would skip reading the privacy policy and "just check the box".  
* Results Page Interaction & Feedback:  
  * Found "all these are very good".  
  * State veterans benefits are "huge," and many people don't realize states offer specific benefits.  
  * Education (GI Bill Transfer): Noted the change in GI Bill transfer rules, enabling him to transfer additional months to his youngest son, which will cover almost 100% of tuition. He found this "kind of neat".  
  * Mental Health: Found this "huge," especially for those with security clearances who feared discussing issues during active duty. He sees it as a significant resource.  
  * Overall, he feels the tool "gives you the information right? You don't have to go seek it like I felt like I had to do" during his own transition. He found it "very informative".  
  * He understood the difference between "Learn More" (for additional information) and "Apply" (to start an application).  
  * Healthcare: Uses Tricare Prime primarily but appreciates VA Medical for coverage gaps or specialty clinics. He has had no issues with VA appointments, and providers have been "super helpful," contradicting prior "horror stories".  
  * Disability Housing Grant: Discovered this through the tool after selecting "received a rating." He emphasized that "the more information that is fed to you, I think. The easier it is". He noted many veterans likely haven't heard of such opportunities and that it's valuable for education and sharing.  
  * State Benefits (Property Tax, Vehicle Registration, License Plates): He learned about these from a friend, not the VA, and highlighted the financial savings for veterans. He stressed that many veterans are unaware of both federal and state supports.  
  * Life Insurance (VA Life/VGLI): Considered this "huge" for veterans not pursuing second careers and essential for all separating personnel. He plans to research VA Life further as he wasn't familiar with it.  
  * Veterans Pension/Disability Grants: He hadn't heard of the pension previously and recognized that while these may apply to a small percentage, feeding this information is beneficial.  
  * Veterans Preference (Federal Hiring): This was a "sore spot" for him. Despite having 100% disabled veteran preference and tailoring resumes for 200 applications on USAJOBS, he never received an interview or phone call. He believes the system needs to change and that it's more about "who you know".  
  * TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) Protection: He was familiar with this area due to his wife's work and found it valuable to know that veterans are supported in healing from injuries.  
  * School Veteran Offices: He learned through his sons' experiences that many schools have dedicated veteran offices with staff (some more robust than others) to assist with registration and benefits like Post-9/11 GI Bill or Chapter 35\. This "subject matter expert" assistance is "super helpful". He found the comparison of education programs (e.g., Chapter 33, 35, Yellow Ribbon) very useful, as Chapter 33 is now offsetting almost 100% of his youngest son's tuition.

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

* What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  * Nothing specific came to mind at the moment, but he acknowledged there are likely other programs he's unaware of.  
* After using this tool, what would you do next?  
  * He would research the VA Life Insurance as he was not familiar with it.  
  * He felt comfortable with everything else and didn't have intentions to further explore education benefits personally.  
  * He appreciates that the tool provides the information in "one location", making it much easier than navigating va.gov on his own.  
* What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
  * He believes the tool provides sufficient resources to take action as the information is "right in front of you".  
* Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  * He wants to "applaud the VA" and the research team for making information "much easier to obtain".  
  * He noted that the "horror stories" of the VA likely came from veterans retiring in the mid-90s or earlier.  
  * He believes the process is "becoming easier" for those retiring in the last 5-10 years, indicating that the initiatives being pushed are "certainly working".  
  * He acknowledged that humans often prefer to be "handed the information" rather than doing research themselves, and these updates are making it easier to get information without extensive searching.

Consent to use video clips

* Comfortable with sharing video clips of the session with VA partners.  
* No part of the discussion he would not want shared.

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)? How was your experience?  
   - Checked on a request for re-look of education benefits  
   - Ended up calling because he couldn’t find the info on the website

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
   - October 31, 2025  
   - Planning for the last 3-4 years, submitted request in the last year  
2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   - Completed TAP  
   - Got list of what to do at various times  
   - Went to VA on base and got info  
   - Not working with a VSO – no availability when he needed it, so doing it on his own  
3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - Appointments in my phone as a reminder  
   - Talking to peers who have recently gone through the process, but has found that everyone has a different experience and what they’re focused on  
   - Asked him about unique experiences, but I missed his response 🙁  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
   - Outside groups \- Hiring heroes, wounded warrior  
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   - VA benefit process and timeline – being aware of administrative changes that have happened at the VA  
     * “I’ve been waiting a while and I can’t see if it’s being reviewed or waiting for someone to review it”  
     * Is there anything I can to proactively?  
6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   - BDD claim – next week will be when I’m within 90 days and that changes requirements of how the claim gets processed  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   -   
8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - More visibility into where a claim is in the process  
     * Last time it was reviewed  
     * Reasonable time frame for response

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Complete questionnaire  
      - [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
- [ ] Interact with results (includes reading results page, filtering results page, printing or screenshotting, redoing questionnaire to understand results, changing answers)

\[\!NOTE\]  
Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
  * Filter/sort  
    * Clicks on disability compensation first  
      * Scans pages to learn more, but nothing seems new to them  
    * Disoriented by leaving the form  
      * Probably wouldn’t have gone back to the results  
      * Sometimes going back resets the data, and assumed that’s what would happen here since he’s not signed in  
      * Is prompted, but after scanning the page, doesn’t see a way to save his results (copy link button)  
      * Would want to email it to himself  
    * Would look into additional benefits next… maybe foreign medical program (didn’t know it was available before seeing this page)  
      * Would also look at state benefits  
        * This page is buggy  
        * Gets lost in [discovery.va.gov](http://discovery.va.gov) page  
        * Goes back to start form again  
      * A lot of these benefits were covered in TAP briefing  
      * Wasn’t aware of VA Life Insurance benefit before  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
  * Didn’t see it until prompted  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
  * One of the first things they did was look at the filter/sort option – this seems to be rare in other sessions.

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - A way to talk to someone (on base medical center?)  
  - Sometimes they provide additional info that’s not clear on the website  
  - Authentication – “some people might not want to do that when they’re at the beginning of the process, but with how much you’re in the VA website, it’d be better to have an account and sign in sooner than later”  
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
  - Learn more about the benefits that caught his eye and if he can be proactive with any of them (Foreign medical program, VA life insurance)  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
  - Understanding eligibility and how to apply  
  - Basic overview of benefits  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  - After you learn information and come back and fill out a claim, it’d be possible to get more information on timing and when you can expect to do your appointments, physical, etc.

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


  Yes

## Gene’s notes

Transition Experience – Participant (July 23, 2pm ET)

Last interaction

* Checked on a request to review education benefits  
  * Ended up calling the number because I couldn’t find out the information on the website  
  * Had submitted a claim for the additional 12 months of ed benefits available, got a decision letter that didn’t explain it well. Was told to resubmit, checked on it, but it didn’t show up as an ongoing claim or appeal; was told on the phone it appeared as in review  
* Service  
  * Enlisted prior to 9/11  
    * Made to give up prior benefits, or authorized on both due to Post 9/11 GI Bill  
* Separation  
  * Have a date, Oct 31 of this year  
  * Knew it was coming up in the last 2-3 years, but submitted and got approved in the last 12 months  
  * TAP? Completed the course and VA portion  
* Process  
  * Got approved order, contacted personnel office; did they have a template or outline of the process  
  * Got a generic checklist at 12/9/6 months out  
  * Still a lot that isn’t covered on the VA side for the Disability Claim, went to the on-base VSO to setup an appointment and get more info, they scheduled TAP, the different briefings  
  * \*Transition section of army (maybe not VSO)  
* VA Benefits understanding so far?  
  * Know that there’s certain timeframes such as BDD, be within a certain window. Found the forms that needed be submitted, the process online for the easy form. Just waiting now  
* Tools and support?  
  * Use appointments on my phone  
  * Talk to some peers that have recently gone through the process  
* Experiences that have been unique?  
  * Big change to Skillbridge; a lot of things related to amount of time allotted based on rank  
  * Applied before the change, but not sure if things got grandfathered, so was not able to participate  
* Resources?  
  * They’ll recommend a certain authorized VA reps, specific people and names to reach out to  
* Current support needs?  
  * Being aware of VA admin changes has me concerned, can’t see whether it’s being reviewed (disability claims), what the expectations are after it goes through review; is there anything I can do proactive in terms of med appointments  
* Worried about something being missed?  
  * BDD claim; next week I’ll be within 90 days if BDD is submitted. I did it in the 180-90 day window but it’s hard to know what disability rating will look like once I’m separated

    * Tool helps folks navigate if they’re unable to do it on the website  
    * Probably wouldn’t have returned back if not on the call, sometimes clicking back resets the tool  
      * Would assume it wouldn't save results since I’m not logged in  
      * Didn’t see a way to save results  
        * Would probably email it to myself  
  * Foreign medical program  
    * Want more information on it, just found out about it here  
    * Thinking about relocating to a different country  
  * State Veterans’ Benefits  
    * Lots of issues with this page  
    * %2F bug at end of URL  
    * “back” button on search bar goes back one letter a time  
    * Discover.VA is a different subdomain so it’s confusing  
  * VALife program  
    * Just learned about it now  
  * GI Bill  
    * Wanted to see if there was something more specific / status of where it was from before  
  * Skillbridge

    * Missed my window to do it  
  * Time sensitive  
    * Didn’t notice it much before, didn’t stand out  
  * What would you do next?  
    * Would probably go back to learn more about the programs I wasn’t already aware of, look into it more  
    * VALife, Foreign Medical Program

    * Learning more about it, see how in depth it goes in the information, eligibility, how to apply, basic overview of what the program is  
  * How to get help?  
    * Can always call, askVA, go to an in-person office  
    * Wife and I just did this for survivor benefit program, a lot of the info online wasn’t clear, got a powerpoint to read, searching in forums, were able to get an appointment and learned a lot of detail about it  
    * A way to ask a specific question we couldn’t find elsewher  
  * Would you use this tool?  
    * Yea, would recommend it since you can look at it a year out, gives them an opportunity to see such as the time sensitive stuff  
  * Other things  
    * Maybe want a way to schedule appointments, find someone local  
    * Not everyone wants to setup an account, especially at the beginning of the process  
    * You’re going to be in the VA website a lot so would call it the central hub after separation, would be better to have an account and sign in sooner rather than later  
    * When to accomplish tasks, feedback on the process (appointments, when you should have med appointments done by etc)

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)? How was your experience?

   I went on there to fulfil my prescriptions

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
   Separated in 2021 from the Air force  
2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   Skillbridge changed a lot because of the pandemic.  
3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   \- The other things that she had to do were to transition; she was able to get the info from sources or colleagues. Certain agencies told her about another agency for completing the application for injuries you sustained in the military.. That was helpful to be referred to that program and to do the application process.  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
     \- There was another program that kept calling her every month within the first 6 months of the transition to explain benefits she qualified for in Florida. There was another helpful program through the VA who assigned a social worker to keep in touch with her for the first 6 months They helped with understanding her issues and disability. Social worker was also a nurse and gave feedback on how much she was awarded for her disability.  
     \- Medical issue assistance program was through the VA hospital  
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   \- There were times where her leadership were clueless which was odd. Because they didn't know what the process was  
6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   \- Uncertainty of being in the military. Having to figure something else out was a concern. Gave her anxiety   
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits:   
   What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   \- Not clear what else could have helped. She was grateful with the resources that existed.   
8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
- She felt she was left alone afterward, and it took her some time to understand what was available in terms of opportunities to connect. It felt lonely trying to figure it out  
- The groups she joined don’t run for the entire year, but she joined a Golf group, guitar group, and a center that helped with certain injuries and disabilities.

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Complete questionnaire  
      - [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
      - If they click on state and local benefits, the correct link is [https://discover.va.gov/external-resources/?\_resource\_type=state-veterans-affairs-office](https://discover.va.gov/external-resources/?_resource_type=state-veterans-affairs-office)  
      -   
- [ ] Interact with results (includes reading results page, filtering results page, printing or screenshotting, redoing questionnaire to understand results, changing answers)

- Using Microsoft Edge browser  
- Goals: Go back to school, take care of health  
- Service: 4 years, Air force, active duty, not currently serving  
- Separation: 4 years  
- Discharge: Honorable   
- Disability: Filed and received rating  
- Review page: Viewed results, expanded all the tabs  
- Results page: Scrolled through first page going through results. Clicked state benefits link as she was interested. On the state benefits page, she would have selected her state “Florida” from the filter, and clicked the “Did you find what you were looking for?” button.

  To get back to the results age, she clicked the back arrow. She was expecting to still see her results there, and they were. Sometimes on VA pages it’s tricky because clicking the back button doesn't always work. She had prerogative issues, so it was helpful that everything was still there when she clicked back.

  She clicked the mental health link (stated she struggles with mental health). Proceeded to click on the Veteran training page. She was glad to see courses that address sleep issues. She was curious to see how that was offered. She wishes she could click on the “Sleep issues” bullet point to see what the training would do.

  She clicked the “Path to better sleep” tab in the side menu”. Expected to see some modules. Noticed they have 4 parts on the page. This is something she would use to see for sleep help. She clicked the back arrowed. Stated she doesn’t like to go back, she would prefer to right-click and open a new tab.

  Those were the main points of interest. She said after looking through the list, she would just sign out. 

  She has a hard time remembering, so it would be nice if there was a reminder to pop up to let her know that she enrolled in this course to keep her on track. Because after she signs out, she would not remember she wanted to complete that. A banner next to the “My VA” button in the menu that shows a notification of what she’s working on would be nice (as in enrolled courses e.g. sleep course)

  She struggled to find the “copy link to results button”. She did not notice it.

  She would not copy the link to come back to this page. She typically just clicks and opens new tabs to review benefit information, but she would not copy the link to come back. She doesn’t know where she’d save it to, so it doesn’t make sens for her to save it.

  She would rather get the link as an email or text if the option existed.

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?

  Coming back depends on whether she’s motivated to take action. Times when she wouldn’t tale action is if she came to the site to do something else. But it’s helpful to know that this tool is there, but if she’s not ready to take action, there isn’t anything else we could do to help with this tool.

  Anna asked if there was anything else she’d like to see that’d be helpful with this tool. Answer: Some sites have a popup where you can ask a question when you’re overwhelmed, so that would be helpful. She would prefer if a person was available instead of a chatbot in the help popup, because she thinks chatbots are unreliable. Reaching out to a human who can help via a pop-up would be helpful.

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


  Yes

## Gene’s notes

Transition Experience – Participant (July 23, 4pm ET)

Last interaction

* Went to go check one of my claims, earlier today  
* Pretty easy, logged in to MyVA-\> Manage Your Claims

Service

* 11.5 years  
* June 2010-Jan 2022

Transition process

* Already had a rating  
* Started transition leave in 2021, had that early  
* Did BDD (w/in 180-90 days)  
* Moved to a new state, had DD214 prior to moving to another state

What helped have a good experience

* Did a lot of reading on the Facebook groups  
  * Veteran Claims Assistance  
  * VA Now (?)

TAP

* Not really much helped  
* Felt like a check the box thing, didn’t take much from it

Skillbridge?

* Not enough time to do that, you need 6 months left

Job ahead of time?

* Got the job before I started transition leave  
* Created an account on LinkedIn, was reached out to by recruiters  
* Didn’t even have to translate my documents to civilian resume, that was covered in TAP  
* Provided my military docs to Fiverr and got someone to help with my resume

Getting prepared

* Had a checklist for when everything has to go through  
* Carried the checklist with me every day  
  * You have class almost every day, you’re given a schedule of what’s open and the hours they’re open  
  * If you’re doing what you need to do you can clear most things in 2 days  
  * Except for CIF (Central Issue Facility)

What did you learn during the process?

* Going to medical more for claims  
* Getting more certs while you’re in  
* \[wish you’d done?\]  
  * Product management

* Think transition should be more about  
  * What to expect when you’re getting out  
  * Things are expensive when you get out

Biggest concerns when getting out

* Not that concerned  
* Just wanted to be happy, ready to get out  
* You don’t think of things until you’re in it

What would you like VA to most understand

* A lot of people don’t understand the process of even starting to get benefits, that’s education, a lot of folks don’t know about VRE or Post 911 or how to even qualify for medical benefits, getting VA claims started

How would people solve that problem?

* TAP didn’t help for me  
* Maybe something after you get out

Switch to prototype

* Goals  
  * Financial support for service-connected condition  
  * School  
  * Health  
  * Plan for my family’s future

  * “My spouse passed...”  
* VSOC – interesting  
* Want to see housing grant

Useful tool?

* Would you recommend?   
  * Yes I would and have recommended tools before (survivor benefits)  
* How to share this best?  
  * Don’t really know  
  * Somewhere there’s a missing link and people are not getting the information  
* Do you trust the results would persist?  
  * Probably not

  * Favorite it / bookmark  
  * Maybe copy the link and email it to myself  
* What’s missing?  
  * Can’t think of anything  
* Anything to help you or others take action?  
  * Anything 

VA Solid Start

* They may have called  
* It was just a phone call, seemed almost like telemarketing  
  * What I got was generalized info, pretty much like a TAP phone call  
  * Just information that I already knew  
* Even if it had included things around women’s health that would have been something  
  * These services are available for women Veterans  
  * A lot of people don’t know that people will cover pregnancy, that’s a good thing to know  
  * Asking more about what you need  
* If it doesn’t feel personalized I’ll just brush it off and won’t receive it well  
  * It doesn’t tell you about what’s available in your region

* Another program that called me within 6 months of me separating out  
  * VA Solid Start?  
  * Helpful understanding the benefits I could qualify for in the state of Florida  
  * Had a program through VA that assigned a social worker, really helped me understand disability issues  
  * Social worker was able to help to understand the disability award amounts, helpful to have her talk and refer to other services for benefits  
  * The program was through the VA but don’t remember the name of the program  
* Skillbridge  
  * Was looking forward to a more hands-on experience vs going back to school, it would been more beneficial compared to going back to school  
  * Still was able to use GI Bill to go back to school, I still have the benefit of some training in something, but was hoping it would be less academic and something I could learn in the field

Task tracking / management?

* Don’t know about the name of the program but they have offices \[ed note: VFW? Something like that?\]  
* Were able to give feedback and refer me to other organizations  
* Had a folder with a checklist and follow along with that

Support you wish you had?

* Sometimes leadership didn’t seem to know the answers; “we’ve never transitioned from the military so we don’t really know what the process is”

Biggest concerns?

* The uncertainty of it; in the military I knew the routine and it was predictable  
* Figuring something else out gave me a little anxiety

What do you wish you knew that you know now

* Feel like I had a lot of resources

What do you want VA to know?

* The comraderie and the support and you leave without that community; that transition to having strong supports to having nobody  
  * There were things outside the VA, recreational and opportunities to connect but it can be very lonely to figure out

Support groups

* Joined a group that teaches golf  
* A group that teaches guitar  
* A center that helps with certain injuries and disabilities near my house  
  * Have events for Veterans in the community

## Usability test

* Goals  
  * Go back to school  
  * Take care of my health and well-being  
* 3+ / Air force / active  
* Not in / separated 3+ years  
* Honorable  
* Disability received a rating  
* Review  
  * Double checking  
* Results  
  * Disability  
    * Would have looked into this if I hadn’t had support  
  * State benefits are helpful  
    * \[Bug on page\]  
    * Would have spent some time searching through the states  
    * \[goes back\]  
  * Would expect to see my results  
* Do struggle with cognitive issues  
* Also struggle with mental health, looking to see if there are other programs that can help me  
  * (Training portal in mental health section) this is new  
* Veteran mental health services  
  * Interested in sleep studies section  
    * Go into Veteran training page \-\> sleep section  
  * Don’t like to go back when it doesn’t open in a new tab  
* Have a hard time remembering thing, would be useful to have reminders “hey you’ve already reviewed / enrolled in this course”  
  * Wouldn’t remember if I wanted to complete something

Things that might be helpful?

* Notification, I might put off or ignore it  
* Copy link \-\> didn’t notice it  
  * What I typically do is click and open different tabs and review all of the open tabs  
  * Copy the link, where would I even save it to? Wouldn’t make sense for me to copy it  
  * Email?  
    * Would prefer the option to email it to myself

How can we help we help you take action?

* The motivation has to come from me; you offered the information on the page so it depends on whether I’m motivated to keep clicking and continue  
* Want to go back to this page until I’m ready to deal with it

Anything that might help?

* If I’m struggling maybe the option to ask a quick question \[ed note: link to AskVA?, chatbot?\]  
  * Would prefer a person, chatbots are not 100% reliable and they don’t have all of the answers

Separation and Transition Experience:

* P12's military separation process involved various checklists.  
* They mentioned their squadron had a checklist, and TAP also had its own checklist.  
* P12 used a folder with their checklist to manage their separation.  
* The participant served in the Air Force for 4 years and separated honorably.  
* They filed a disability claim and received a rating.  
* P12 expressed interest in vocational rehabilitation (voc rehab) for a more direct path to training that is "not so academic" but more "in the field".

Tools and Methods for Tracking Progress:

* P12 primarily relied on checklists provided by their squadron and TAP.  
* They maintained a folder with their checklist to keep track of tasks and deadlines.  
* P12 mentioned they would "just have my folder with my my checklist" and "just have a folder" to keep track of their progress.

External Support during Transition:

* The transcript notes that P12 "had a network of people who you were working with and sharing advice with" during their transition.  
* They mentioned contacting people in their network for support and advice, but specific details about *who* or *how* they helped are not explicitly detailed in the same way as their use of official checklists.

Concerns / What P12 Wished They Had Known:

* P12 wished voc rehab was a little clearer on what could and could not be done, expressing a desire for a "more direct path" as a lot got lost in bureaucracy.

Feedback on the Discover Your Benefits Tool (Prototype):

* Initial Impressions: P12 engaged with the tool, understanding it was a questionnaire to determine potential benefits. They quickly navigated the initial questions, including those about service, separation, and disability status.  
* Navigation & Saving Results:  
  * P12 did not notice the "copy link to results" button initially, stating "No" when asked if they saw it. This indicates the button's placement was not intuitive or visible enough.  
  * When asked how they would save the results, P12 stated they would not copy the link. Instead, their typical method is to open different tabs for each benefit they want to review.  
  * P12 explicitly stated they would prefer to have the results emailed to themselves as an option for saving.  
  * They were pleasantly surprised that using the back arrow after clicking on a benefit link *did* return them to their results page without resetting the data. They noted that sometimes clicking the back button on a VA page can be tricky and reset data.  
* Usability & Suggestions:  
  * P12 suggested that a pop-up reminder to "Continue\! Do you already reviewed it, or you completed this part, or whatever" when returning to the tool after some time would be "very helpful". This suggests a need for continuity and guidance if a user leaves and returns to the tool.  
  * The tool was generally viewed as a helpful way to identify benefits.

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)? How was your experience?  
* Message with healthcare team and refill prescriptions  
* Pretty good, worked like it was MS Teams. Respond within the same day.

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
* Separated in November 2023  
* Difficult to get a solid answer or direction on what I needed to do next  
2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   * Newer younger guys seem more lost in the sauce than someone who’s been doing this for years  
   * Really hard adjustment period from military to civilian life – used to going in a certain order and then all of a sudden you’re out and you have to figure it out for yourself  
     * “It took a while to adjust to things and find some footing to reorder my own directions on things”  
   * 6 months out – had a part-time job on the side. Better than most people from what he hears.  
   * Didn’t work with any VSOs at first  
     * Already had a job and was trying to figure out another side hustle to make more money  
     * Got lucky during medboard – got a great VA rep who made it a lot easier  
     * Got involved with VR\&E program  
       * BA in project management by EOY  
       * Took a course on base to get hands-on experience  
       * Bad experience with rep – going to file a complaint once he’s graduated  
     * Was going to be in charge, but then he got hurt. Was too injured and other people hit the button for retirement for him. It was unexpected.  
3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   * Someone told him not to be afraid to ask questions  
   *   
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
   *   
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   *   
6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   *   
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   * There’s nothing you can do to rush things  
   * DoD/Tricare and moving over – it’s just different (processes, people)  
8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   * “I love that freaking app”  
   * Bulletin board of random obscure information that people don’t think they’re going to need  
   * Try harder to push more information and services out there… I know they try, it’s just not always easy.  
   * Some people prefer a real person over a chatbot, but times are changing. He uses AI regularly and so do his kids.

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)? How was your experience?  
   - Checked medical appts coming up next week  
   - Hit or miss \- it tells you you have an appt but doesn’t give you all the info needed. System crashing and updating when going to appt so he brings a print out.

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
   - March 11 2019-Aug 11 2022 Active duty  
     - [ ] When he knew he was leaving first sgt told him to go to transition. Unit doesn't make it easy they keep sending you on missions. Had to advocate for himself. They don’t give a lot of info about the benefits just the highlights. Had to do his own research. The civilians on one of his missions gave him more info than the Army.  
   - Feb 2024-May 2025 Reserves  
     - [ ] No assistance. Even people in reserves didn’t know. Career counselors tried to keep them in. No skill development offered.  
   - Network: other soldiers getting out or already got out, vets on base, retiring sgt  
     - [ ] Mostly 1:1’s and texts. No group chats or anything.  
2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   - Currently in project management education  
   - App \[USO Pathfinder\] has checklist for transition. W/out app you need knowledge of programs beforehand or you’re missing out. Got more out of the app than the Army  
3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - Skillbridge  
   - Used mentorship for schooling and basic things like microsoft \[he might not have said Microsoft but it was something similar\]. They gave him a checklist and were really hands on.  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
   - USO played a huge role \- offering guidance. They are the reason he was able to transition.  
   - TAP could do better promoting transition and resources available  
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - Be more proactive when talking to soldiers about offerings. They don’t talk about vocational rehab. There needs to be more than one information session. Didn’t give a cohesive process of getting healthcare, for example.   
   - Need a better platform. People don’t even want to fight the VA for their benefits.  
   - How could members be informed? Need someone they can check in with. There was not a lot of interaction with transition people, but more with USO and others.   
     - [ ] Could be a checklist on an app. Should have a representative to work with people.

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Complete questionnaire  
      - [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
- [ ] Interact with results (includes reading results page, filtering results page, printing or screenshotting, redoing questionnaire to understand results, changing answers)

* Took the time to read the whole homepage message   
* Discover your benefits questionnaire is very straightforward.   
* Likes the preview and collapsing feature before submitting.  
* Chose disability to look at first.   
* “This is very interactive.” \- looking at benefits list  
* Likes that it breaks down everything entitled to.   
* State vet benefits \- he had no idea what he was entitled to moving to FL  
* Asked if this is pilot. Said this would have given him less doubt in transitioning. “Everything’s in front of me.”   
* What’s useful for now? The Vet success on campus, vocational certs, VGLI, VA backed home loans (knew about this but wasn’t given a lot of info up front)  
* Anna: How could this be made better? Answer: You don’t know what you can and can’t claim when looking at [va.gov](http://va.gov). Possibly something like a “find an organization that can help you with this process”  
  * Anna pointed out that there is something like that already and said it’s good that he mentioned he didn’t notice it, this could be a design flaw  
  * It’s all the way down at option 5 but should be bolder and higher up  
  * Mail should not be first because people are using digital more  
* Would refer back to the discover your benefits page.  
* Did not see the copy link. Should be in the middle. Immediately went to start over. Could also have a “save results”  
* Anna: What would be the easiest to come back and see this info later? Answer: option to email results would be better than copy link for future ref. Maybe send a PDF that can be saved on computer  
* Anna: How would you incorporate this into your org? Answer: take time sensitive stuff to be done sooner. Prioritize time sensitive (put it at the top) and give the timeline and procedure.  
* Would like to see the info when he is logged in so it is specified to him. Then some info about the procedure, what is ready for him. More connected would be more personal. (E.g., you’re not enrolled in healthcare. Click here.)

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
  - Yes  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
  - Used the filters

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)? How was your experience?  
   - I think I logged in to refresh my memory on how to do the benefits …  
   - Separated from the military previously, did a BDD claim a few years ago & have a disability rating a while ago & logged in to check that . I didn’t find out about the termination until 4 years. I submitted a letter of inquiry & about 24 hours later I received a notification that VA had previously   
   - 

Main questions

1. For TSMs: Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military? For Veterans: When did you separate from the military?  
   - Little under 19 years of service   
   - October I’ll be retiring after 20 years   
   - Back in 2019 I separated voluntarily, when on terminal leave i stayed on active duty in the army to meet my 20 years   
   - I haven’t gone through the final BDD yet, I need to do that next year. I’m in the process now of gathering all medical documents and everything I need to submit my BDD next time.   
   - I have gone through TAP already   
   - This go around of DOD TAP vs last time, I’ve done it in person a number of times, virtually once. I felt like the classes I went through a few years ago were more robust & detailed. The DOD TAP classes I went through recently (in the last 4-6 months) were more streamlined, but less focused on preparing for interviews and resume checks. In 2019 it was done by instructors of TAP course, now its department of labor. More generic stuff. I’m okay with that because I’ve been through the process & know what to expect, but others don’t feel prepared to find a civilian job. THat could be a breakdown in what they think the expectations should be. I don’t see that as my golden ticket to finding employment after I get out of the military.   
2. For TSMs: How is the process going for you? For RSVs: How did the process go for you?  
   - Going fine because I have previous experience. The first time I went through it I had to figure it out on my own. It seemed like nobody had a checklist or a roadmap on how to properly navigate the DOD transition. You had TAP classes & optional workshop, VA disability, medical appointments, now I’m much more prepared because I’ve gone through it. I’ve been more deliberate this time getting more prepared for it, taking advantage of the TAP workshops, & already preparing for the supplemental BDD claim.   
   - I will probably end up using some of my VA education benefits, maybe not PMP but maybe the CAPM in the next 6-12 months.   
3. What are you doing right now/what did you do to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - I have a DOD TAP binder with various handouts.   
   - Generally speaking I operate off of a spreadsheet that I put together that I built on my own. Process & requirements  
   - Calendar items & personal cell phone calendar  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping; for RSVs, what could have made the process go better)  
   - Folks that I previously served with, especially my first go around. Mostly people in my age and rank cohort   
   - Relied heavily on a lot of my friends who had done the same thing  
   - This go around, as soon as you open your mouth at work & say they are retiring, they offer all kinds of advice all of the time. Nice but a lot of it is kind of dated.   
   - My local TAP office has some good employees there & I’ve been able to reach out to them about specific questions.   
   - My unit personnel office when it comes to administrative requirements associated with voluntary retirement from the army have also been very helpful   
   - I feel comfortable that I have enough people around me personally & professionally to be supported   
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   - A fast forward button in life, that’s about it. The final 24 months has been slowly dragging on.   
   - The vast majority of things to be done has to be done in their final 180 days so it seems to be going very slowly & when I hit the 180 day mark things will pick up.   
6. For TSMs: What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night? For RSVs: What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   - My overall impatience with the process. Submitting your request for voluntary retirement 2 years out & then you have to wait & wait and having those retirement orders in your hand unlocks just about everything else you can do during that time. That’s the frustrating piece, it takes so long to get approved. A lot of times you don’t get those retirement orders until your final 4 or 5 months.   
   - When I finally get the orders I can put my foot on the gas with a lot of other separation things   
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   - With respect to education benefits, VA has always been good customer service wise when I get someone on the phone who can apply for my education benefits throughout my career.   
   - It wasn’t clear on the website how to access those benefits, reimbursement, how to enroll. As soon as I got someone one the phone they were able to explain it easily.   
   - GI benefits to pay for advanced education was an easy process once I talked to a person who understood the process.   
   - I didn’t understand the VA wouldn’t have access to my military medical records or that I had to fill out a form to authorize it.   
   - I didn’t know it would lead to me getting evaluated by civilian medical professionals & that wasn’t given to the VA. Another form I had to fill out, etc. That part wasn’t clear to me.   
   - You learn through experience, but overall I’ve had favorable positive interactions with the VA. No complaints.  
   - Was the civilian medical exam the CMP exam?   
     - [ ] Yep  
   - The medical records, was that a waiver you had to sign to ask   
     - [ ] No, I had to get a physical copy of my medical records. I had a stack of papers to mail to the VA Evidence Intake Center. This time I saved everything from MHS Genesis & I will put all of that on a disc & send it myself to the VA & upload those files direct to the BDD claim website. From that perspective, the ability to upload as many documents you want to is important for the VA website. That will be my primary method of providing info & secondary is providing a disc.   
     - [ ] Not doing a lot at work right now so I have time to build out these spreadsheets & checklists   
8. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Complete questionnaire  
      - [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
- [ ] Interact with results (includes reading results page, filtering results page, printing or screenshotting, redoing questionnaire to understand results, changing answers)

Notes

- Gonna go to Get Started   
  - I’m a transitioning service member & want to see what kinds of benefits the VA has for me  
- Review  
  - Looking through each section to confirm selection   
- Results page  
  - External resources page   
    - This did & didn’t take me to where I expected to go. Information here about state level benefits in the place I intend to retire to. I was thinking initially on this page there would be some sort of menu of benefits or programs. Going here & having a live link is fairly intuitive.   
  - Opened a new tab for the external link & started the whole process over again   
    - I’d prefer if it was all here, or if you hadn’t sent the link it probably wouldn’t go back   
  - Didn’t see a place to save on this page   
    - What did you expect it to say if you wanted to save your results?   
      - “Save this page” or “Bookmark this page” or “add to my profile” because you’d have a [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) login & you’d be signed in here  
      - Maybe this is titled something else like “Personal Assessment Results” and the button would be “Save my Personal Assessment Results”   
      - I wouldn’t expect anything like that to be saved. I didn’t find it taxing or difficult to go through it, so I wouldn’t have an expectation of everytime I logged on it would be saved for me. I’d expect that every time I logged on I’d be able to go through.   
      - For me personally, it wouldn’t bother me either way. It would be great that it saved, but I wouldn’t have a problem redoing it  
      - If you retitled it   
    - How would you like to get the results?   
      - If it was sent in an email, I would be inclined to save it. Or a hyperlink or PDF so I could print the page. An email with a PDF would be very useful   
      - Every time I logged in see some type of banner   
  - Having been through the transition process a couple times now, where would this tool be useful?   
    - Great for instructors of DoD TAP to show TSMs in VA workshop days because they didn’t do this. Most of the time its in a room of retiring people & they all want to talk about individual time to talk to the VA benefits coordinator about their personal situation.   
    - If there were 

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
  - [ ] Didn’t notice the time sensitive benefits   
        - [ ] Now that you mentioned it, yes but initially I didn’t notice it   
        - [ ] Maybe that’s a simple thing where its just reordered & you put the time sensitive ones at the top   
        - [ ] I see time sensitive & I think I’m behind the curve & missed something   
        - [ ] TAP timeline \- says you should be planning for your military transition 36 months out then when you’re 36 months \- 24 months you should be doing these tasks, 24 \- 12 months, 12 \- 6 months of what you should be doing in that time. Different for everyone, not everyone is going to follow that timeline   
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - I’m familiar with a lot of this stuff  
  - Would there be different outcomes based on what I clicked initially?   
    - [ ] If you want the all encompassing list you need to go back & check all the boxes to see everything.   
    - [ ] I assume its not an all encompassing list since you asked questions to get to this list, but   
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
  - Finding the most applicable things, click “Learn More” & see what type of information is online, review the information. Connecting with folks on social media & more information/resources is super helpful. Get help from an accredited representative is cool too.   
  - I’d go along the website to see what information is here, then ask some people in my network, talk to my VA benefits counselor, & if I still needed help I would call the VA  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  - No, I think we covered a lot of stuff. 

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
- Participant: Yeah, that’s fine. I consent to that.   
    
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

- Participant: No

## Gene’s notes

Transition Experience – Participant (July 24, 4pm ET)

Last interaction

* Logged in to check how to do the BDD process for when I transition in  
* Did a separation a few years ago, got a disability rating  
* Checking original claim; didn’t find out the ultimate outcome until many years later  
  * Reapplied, got a letter saying that I had previously received a rating (some 4 years later)

Service timeline

* \~20 years  
* Active duty  
  * 2019 was separating voluntarily, decided to remain in AD (in Army)

TAP / BDD differences between 2019 and 2025

* Haven’t been through second BDD yet  
* In the process of gathering medical and supporting docs  
* Have gone through DoD TAP in prep for transition  
  * This go around TAP, I’ve gone in person a few times, in person once  
  * The classes I went through in 2019 were more robust and more detailed  
  * The recent round was more streamlined, but a lot less intense focus on resumes, preparing for interviews  
  * In 2019 it was by instructors hired by DoD, in recent years it was taken over by DoL  
    * Many colleagues don’t feel like they’re leaving as prepared in civilian life  
    * Never expected TAP to be the golden ticket; (been through it 3-5 times) \[expectations more set\]

Transition process

* First time through I had to figure it out all on my own  
* Despite working in the NCR (national capitol region) where people separate all the time, it seemed like nobody had a formalized process for separation  
* Now I feel much more prepared since I’ve gone through it  
  * More deliberate on prepping farther out, doing TAP early, taking advantage of the TAP workshops  
  * Already preparing for my supplemental BDD claim  
* Will use some of my VA ed benefits, maybe for a PMP cert or similar or CAPM  
  * Within 6-12 months, will pay for it and then seek reimbursement after that  
  * Transferred GI Bill benefits to kids  
  * Have a few Masters degrees, don’t plan to go back  
  * Curious to see how to apply to those benefits to my children when the time comes


Tracking the process?

* Have a binder from DODTAP  
* I operate off a spreadsheet I built on my own; combo of the 1st transition \+ the changes in the process and requirements and the programs I intend to take advantage of  
* Work calendar for appointments

Support in transition?

* Folks that I previously served with that got around, especially during first go around; folks closer to my age and rank  
* At the time wasn’t eligible for retirement  
* Was planning to leave completely the first time  
* This time around;  
  * Because it’s retirement this time, I get a lot of advice from the retired military folks in the community  
  * Local TAP office has good employees, some specific questions on the military side of things  
  * Reps around that help with the admin process

Any missing needs?

* “A fast foward button?” the end is in sight but it feels like it’s going by slowly  
* A lot of the work needs to be done in the last 180 days, and the time between then and now is going slowly but then it’ll pick up

Worried about

* Nothing that keeps me up at night  
* If anything impatience with the process  
  * Submitting request for voluntary retirement at 20 years, 2 years out, then finally getting the retirement orders that unlocks just about everything you can do in the process  
  * Army does have a process for getting orders up to 2 years in advance but often takes a long time to process (sometimes only 4-5 months out)

What do you want VA to understand about your experience?

* Ed benefits; I have found the VA has been good customer service wise once I get someone on the phone  
  * Have used GI bill to get 2 Masters Degrees (almost) \+ a professional cert. It wasn’t clear on the VA website how to use them at a university that would accept them  
  * Claims for reimbursement were always handled quickly  
  * Never had issues getting GI Bill top off or Bill to pay for ed, once I found the right person  
  * Only frustration; going through the BDD process things that I thought VA would do automatically; VA would have my military medical records but needed to do that manually  
  * Claims processed for medical required civilian medical professionals; the results of those med appointments were not immediately provided to VA, so had to go through some processes to get files over to VA

Civilian Medical Exam (CMP)

* \[Missed this conversation on medical record transmission\]

Switch to prototype

* Goals  
  * Plan for retirement  
  * Start a new career  
  * Health and wellbeing  
  * Understand benefits  
  * Plan for my and my family’s future  
* Served  
  * 3+ years  
  * Army / AD  
* \[All of these are very intuitive\]  
* Serving?  
  * Yes  
  * 1+ year until separation  
* Honorable  
* Disability claim  
  * Have a rating  
* Results  
  * \[Filtered by pension\]  
  * Would filter these results one by one  
  * Would be most interested in would click to learn more  
  * State Veterans’ Benefits  
    * \[got bugfix link\]  
    * Thought is it would have listing or breakdown of special Veteran Benefits that MD offers  
      * \[Clicks into state website\]  
  * Went back to the beginning as opposed to clicking back?  
    * Closed the page, which is why I went through it again  
  * Expect it would still be there?  
    * Would expect my results to still be there?  
  * Way to save results?  
    * Didn’t jump out me  
    * Would it expect it to “save this page” maybe not exact wording, bookmark this page, add to my profile  
      * Be able to access this or add to it from my profile  
      * “You last did a personal assessment X” or a link to the assessment etc  
    * I wouldn’t expect anything like that to be saved, didn’t expect it to be taxing and it didn’t take very long, no expectation it would stay, I found it easy to do I can see that some people would be annoyed having to do it again  
    * I don’t log into VA.gov often enough  
    * May email it to myself; save it to a transition folder  
    * may print off a PDF if there was a button or link to do that  
* What do you think would help others?  
  * Email with a PDF of the assessment (maybe a link?)  
  * A banner on login for doing assessments periodically  
* Where most useful?  
  * Great for instructors of DoDTAP to show initially transitioning service members during DODTAP  
  * It’s a room full of retiring people; they want to use that time as a time to talk to the VA benefits coordinator about their own personal  
    * Have the DoDTAP VA benefits coordinator do a tutorial on this website and go through it and have it be right up front as part of presentation that would be really helpful  
    * Many are interested in disability comp, and there are other benefits that they might be aware of  
* Anything in this tool you see or don’t see?  
  * There’s a lot here, some I’ve done  
    * Transfer GI Bill benefits  
    * TAP  
    * VA backed home loans etc  
  * Would there be different outcomes if I clicked on things?  
    * Would expect it’s a more tailored view based on boxes I checked  
    * It is not an all-encompassing list, you need to go back and check all of the boxes  
* Time sensitive tags  
  * Now that you mention it I do see it  
  * Maybe it’s just re-ordered  
  * “Did I miss something?” useful to indicate which is due before separation; something for a sense of urgency (have to do it while still in uniform)

TAP timeline?

* DOD TAP website  
  * 36-24 months  
  * 24-12  
  * 12-6  
  * 6 or less

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)?   
   - I had to apply for a certificate of eligibility for the 9/11 bill  
2. How was your experience?  
   - It was pretty simple, I didn’t have any issues with it. Its been a while

Main questions  
For TSMs

1. Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military?  
   - Transitioning in the Army right now   
   - Currently on terminal leave. I received a copy of my DD14 right before 4th of July. Right now I’m in that in between period where I’m still active duty but just going through all my leave. Last day of active duty service is september 26th   
   - Started separation process middle of June  
   - Medical evaluation process so I’m medically retired & was able to start the TAP process early on. I was already completed with TAP by the time I started the clearing process. I still take advantage of some of those resources & using one of them right now to earn a credential to earn for project management   
   - Getting set up wherever I might be so I’m fortunate that I’m staying where I’m at   
   - In about a week & a half I have an appointment with a nurse case manager to go over what that process is gonna look like to set me up with some resources. I’m going to be contacted by a VA late liaison whenever my initial appointments get booked. I started paperwork with the VRE program. Going through all the steps to get qualified with that & looking into whatever my next job’s going to be.   
2. How is the process going for you?  
   - For the VR\&E process, its a lot of paperwork and you’re on your own to figure out what the steps are & how to complete them   
   - I met with my VR\&E process once face to face & the rest has been telework type of deal which is kind of interesting.   
   - I’ve been getting through that, everything else has been kind of laid out for me. When I was out processing the installation & because they identified me a medical retiree it was mandated I have my appointment booked with the nurse case manager about my VA healthcare. I was surprised the nurse case manager was super proactive. You don’t usually see people double checking you got this important step taken care of so I appreciated that.  
   - That part has been smooth, but the education piece has been rough.   
3. What are you doing right to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - To do list on my calendar. Amy gave us a wealth of resources of what retirees need to know. Gave a ton of information, on you to prioritize what you need at that time.   
   - At the end of September that’s when I’m really gonna have to take out my notes & select which plan I want to move into.   
   - Once you receive the information its on you to prioritize where you are in the process and what you need to do.   
4. Is anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (if they need prompting, ask about who is in their personal network, social media, VSOs, mentors, friends). Follow up questions about how they are helping.   
   -   
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   - My family & friends  
   - I’ve got a couple close friends who are veterans, one who also medically retired. Their experiences are more frustrating. I’m hoping it’s by state, they weren’t in Washington state so they weren’t   
6. What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night?  
   - Authorizations for their medicine from outside providers. She has to have blood transfusions minimum once a month, doesn’t have the immune system & when she doesn’t have transfusions in a timely manner she gets super sick. VA has to authorize this outside provider for this specialty thing & provider has to send up authorization for her to get her infusion kit from this. She’s always been stuck as the veteran who is responsible for making sure the VA received it & the doctor received it. She has nothing but horrible things to say about the VA. She has a complex disease & its not very straightforward. My disease isn’t on the scale of what hers is but that’s my biggest fear. I’m a type 1 diabetic & I don’t want to go into DKA status because I don’t have my insulin or medical supplies. Whatever can make that process easier.  
   - I haven’t downloaded the app yet, but she was sharing some good aspects about that.   
   - I don’t know what the process is for a retiree. I don’t want to show up to an urgent care & find out I have to pay out of pocket.   
   - I had to be hospitalized once & I’m curious on what rules I’m gonna need to be made aware of with emergency situations & that’s always a risk with diabetes.   
7. What do you wish you had known at the very beginning of the process?  
   - They did a great job of informing us of what the programs are that are available for us when I started the process  
   - Nothing that comes to mind immediately   
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
   - Reaching out to see what benefits you’re most concerned with first, like right now its medical. Right now I want to tap into my education because there’s nothing medical that needs attention. I don’t know what that would look like, maybe an email or something.   
   - For people who just got out they might not be concerned because they already had a job set up that offers medical   
   -   
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - Does the VA have a holistic health program like I did as an active duty soldier, like do they have a pain management clinic, nutritionist, 

   

For Veterans

1. How long ago did you separate from the military?  
2. Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, could you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?   
3. During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping. If they need prompting, ask about people they served with, friends, mentors, family, social media like Facebook and Reddit, VSOs)  
5. Is there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?  
6. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Completing the questionnaire  
      - Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
      - I have dropped a link to the tool we’re working on in the chat in this Zoom. Please open it, any browser is fine, and share your screen.   
      - For this test, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m wasn’t here, but thinking aloud about what you’re thinking and noticing, and some of the choices you’re making. I might stop you for questions along the way.   
      - Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions  
- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask “Did you notice the time sensitive tag?”   
- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask about saving the page and if they would return to it.  
      - Did you see the save the link box?  
      - Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Would you have to start from the beginning?  
      - How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

- Notes  
  - Using mobile browser  
  - I’m gonna click no as if I’m already separated  
  - Review page   
    - Understood what it was for, didn’t read through all of it  
  - Results page  
    - Disability compensation \- I’ve already said that I filled out disability compensation in the earlier question, this is having me apply for disability again?   
      - If I have 100% why would I apply again?   
      - In my case, I would expect a follow up question to the one about whether I filed a disability claim or not asking what your rating is, because if you’re not 100% then this should probably be tailored to “let’s get you linked up with a VSO that can help you refile” or “how to file an intent to file” \- I know I’m gonna need to do this when I’m officially out of the army but I can’t ask any questions until I’m officially retired.   
      - I can’t work with a VSO until I’m retired. I heard that while I was out processing. It wasn’t like I couldn’t ask them questions now, but they can’t help me in my case or start anything until I’m officially retired so I figured I’d wait until I’m officially retired to come & see you all.   
      - Maybe some work on this here  
    - Educational & career counseling   
      - Noticed the time sensitive benefit without prompting  
      - Anything with a time sensitive benefit I’d like to see up top. Human nature would be to scroll past real quick & miss it.   
    - VR\&E  
      - Those time sensitive things should be right at the top   
    - That’s a lot of benefits. Kind of like a shot gun blast of just like a lot of info. Kind of too much.   
      - Shot gun blast of everything in the benefits realm. I could have gone down another rabbit hole.   
      - Maybe a ranking system of everything you need to know about right now   
    - Disability compensation   
    - Where is your concern that you’d have to apply again? Is it because you’ll be a veteran or is it with this questionnaire?   
      - When I saw the “apply again” I wouldn’t want to do anything to confuse the VA again. There’s a little buffer period where I’m waiting for my VA disability to check in. I don’t want to do anything to disrupt getting my disability check.   
      - Maybe change words “apply now” to something else so I don’t think I’d be interrupting something by clicking that button   
    - Do you think you’d be able to come back to these results?   
      - I’d hope so, I wouldn’t want to answer the questions over again. I hope the “Copy link to results” button would do that.   
      - I would probably copy this & put it in my notes. Title it like “My VA benefits” so I could reference it in my notes pad  
      - I love using my email box to have important stuff in, I create little folders & if its a document that I reference all the time that would be super helpful   
  - Is this something that’s useful to you?   
    - Yes, absolutely   
  - Is this something you would come back to reference?   
    - Yes, I saw stuff that I didn’t know about   
  - How could we change it to be more useful?   
    - Without playing around with it I wouldn’t know 

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
- What browser are they using?

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


  Yeah

  I’m good with you sharing all of it

- [x] ~~Was there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?~~

      * Self-starter

      * Other guys struggle because no one’s telling them what to do

- [x] ~~What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?~~

      * Downtowns in the job market

      * Special case in looking forward to getting out

      * Skillbridge helped

      * I mean, not… not really… I mean… I mean, honestly, like, if you go to TAP, they… they give you, you know, in that week.

      * Pretty much everything you need to know. Is there, but you may have to do a little bit of homework on it and whatnot.

      * Um, so, I mean, getting out, I mean, as far as I'm concerned, and I guess my bias is I'm probably a little bit more of a self-starter.

      * Or I'm just used to doing that as opposed to being told what to do.

      * I think that's my personal opinion, is what a lot of guys struggle, is, like, no one's telling them what to do.

      * Um, because, I mean, when I was… going through TAP, a lot of guys, I'm just gonna go home and work for my dad's business. And I'm like, oh, I'm gonna go home, and I'm like, okay, that doesn't really sound like… that may or may not be a plan.

      * Um, so I kind of had a, at least a better phased thing.

      * Um, going into it.

      * 14:21:42

      * Okay. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition?

      * Is there anything that kind of kept you up at night?

      * 14:21:54

      * Not… I mean, just besides the usual anxiety about, like, oh, hey, I mean, everyone.

      * It's like, you kind of know you're gonna find a job, especially because I still live near Fort Stewart, Georgia. I'm working here right now, so there's a lot of… you know, veteran-friendly, you know, it's a veteran-friendly area, but uh, you know, you always worry about downturns. You know, it's during COVID, and you're like, okay, I hope.

      * You know, whatever this is, it's gonna get over at some point.

      * And, you know, the job market will turn to normal, and it more or less has.

      * You know, but at the time, it was kind of like, okay, hey, you know, this project got shut down, sorry, you know, we're not.

      * You know, they were already letting go of junior people, so you were getting a little concerned about that.

      * Um. You know, but uh… yeah, that's about it. I mean… like I said, I was a little bit of a special case in that I was… I wouldn't say, like, totally disgruntled, but I was looking forward to getting out, so the whole losing my military identity thing.

      * Started pretty early, um, especially, you know, when I, you know, the SkillBridge helped with that, because, you know, I was wearing a hard hat, and I looked pretty much like this on the job.

      * Um, no one was checking if I was shaving. So… Um, yeah, not… I mean, just, yeah, besides probably just the normal, you know, hey, making sure I'm gonna… I'm gonna fit back in here, but… I didn't really have too many, you know, concerns about getting along with people, or, you know, not having.

      * I mean, yeah, you do kind of miss being in the military just because you were in it for so long, and there's definitely… less of a bond on the civilian side. It's like, okay, you're there from 9 to 5, and then it's over. You may or may not hang out, but there's no…

      * Nowhere near the shared experience of, like, a deployment. Or anything like that with your coworkers, and… you know, and I don't know if I was perceived, you know, there is that kind of, like, I hope they don't think I'm, like, some crazy vet or whatever, you.

      * Because I'm literally twice as old as the other interns, and, you know, my boss was, like, you know, 15 years younger than me.

      * Um, so you do have a little bit of that, I guess, how am I perceived.

      * Um, you know, because you know you're not in charge anymore. I had no problem, you know, recognizing that. I'm like, okay, I'm not the boss anymore, no one cares what my rank was, I'm in… I'm wearing a… wearing a polo shirt and a pair of khakis and a pair of boots, so…

      * You know, there's nothing to really identify me, except, like, there is a bit of the age thing.

      * “Why is this old dude low on the PM totem pole?”

- [x] ~~What do you wish you had known during the process? *(Follow up if they don't mention benefits: Is there anything you wish you had known about VA benefits?)*~~

      * No gaping holes

      * Might have been little things like those programs I mentioned (education during active duty)

      * I socialized leaving with my chain of command in advance so it wasn’t a surprise

- [x] ~~How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?~~

      * After I got out I couldn’t believe the number of calls I got from the VA

        * Wife: “Is that the VA again? Did you piss them off?”

        * Something like that in reverse might be helpful (ie during active duty)

        * I have nothing bad to say about VA

        * The info about benefits was pretty effective

      * On the left end (active duty) it would be helpful to have communication like after you leave

- [x] ~~What do you most want the VA to understand about your experience?~~

      * You can only do so much for people, it’s all in our face in TAP, there’s resources on the internet  
      * Youtube popped up with a clothing allowance video  
      * It’s a matter of getting the horse to drink the water  
      * The information is out there but every individual is different  
        * Some people are waiting for quiet time to explore information  
      * How to target everybody? I don’t know. Survey? How lazy are you? How much prompting do you need? Some guys might be like “I’m good,” some might be clueless and need carrying

## First Task: Use the tool \- 15 minutes (2:45)

* Thank you for sharing all of that with us\! It’s incredibly helpful for us to understand your experience.

* I have a tool that we’re working on that’s intended to help with the transition process. I’m going to paste the link in the chat, and then if you could open it in any browser, and please share your screen.

  * *Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)*

* For this part of the session, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m not here, but making sure to think aloud about what you’re noticing and thinking, and why you’re making some of the choices you’re making. If you have any questions, I might not answer them, but I may occasionally prompt you along the way. Okay, feel free to get started.

  * *Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions.*

* Zooms through questionnaire, no issues  
* Choosed education and career for results  
* Results? Oh here it is down here  
* OK, GI Bill, VRE, that’s what I expected  
  * I did VRE. I don’t think the VA does a great job articulating what it can do  
* Got feedback popup. Wasn’t sure if he pressed on the survey  
* Interested in education, explored VR\&E pages  
* As scrolling, looking to see, seen advertisements for VRE, can pay for this  
  * As a disabled Veteran not sure if he can do it, to save entitlement, but not really sure  
  * Wish I could use AI to ask questions, use Grok and ChatGPT a lot  
  * Dictate what I want to say, don’t type any more  
  * I like that I can classify what kind of veteran I am  
  * “I don’t want to pay out of pocket for my GA general contractor’s license, what can I do?”  
    * It’s probably in there, I’ve seen it before, but wants to see it here  
    * It kind of takes you to it, it’s not that bad  
    * Major issue with the verbiage  
    * I’m a disabled veteran but unless it’s hard labor I can do most stuff  
    * Employment barrier is subjective  
* I didn’t have trouble finding what I was expecting to find  
* Jessica: what would you do next?  
  * Part of me is tempted to click the green button and see what happens?  
  * Starts reading VRE application  
  * Still not sure what I can get out of this  
  * 

Follow-up questions

- [x] ~~After they have interacted with the results, ask: Did you notice the time sensitive tag?~~

      * Yes, noticed the first time

      * Red flag: How much time do I have?

- [x] ~~After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask:~~  
      ~~Now that you’ve gone through it, do you think you would return to this tool? And if so, how do you think you would do that?~~

      * Would have gone back to the page, using browser back button

      * Did you notice the Copy link button?

        * No

      * Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Or would you have to start from the beginning?

        * “I would just come back here and start over, bookmark it”

      * How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

        * 

Things to watch for

* *How does the participant interact with the results page?*  
* *Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?*  
* *Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?*  
* *What browser are they using?*

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes (2:55)

Final questions

- [x] ~~What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?~~

      * A way to submit questions to a VA person in case you can’t figure it out  
      * Sometimes you just want to talk to somebody  
      * AI chatbots have come a long way  
      * Jessica: start with AI and progress with human?  
        * That’s usually what I do  
        * I hate it when I hear someone paying for stuff when there’s a benefit  
        * Put a prompt in Grok or ChatGPT, GA resident, 100% disability, what resources do I have?  
          * No surprises from VA  
          * Some state benefits were new  
          * Drilled down into some of the benefits like Home Depot  
          * What VA disability status would keep me from working? Behavioral and knee? Which one, or both?  
          * After that is when you need to talk to a human   
      * After using this tool, what would you do next?  
        *   
      * Go through other info  
      * State benefits, that one gets overlooked, GA has better benefits than most  
        * Vet tech, other programs  
        * Glad the VA included state benefits  
- [ ] What would help you take action using the information in this tool?

      * The Apply now button is helpful for taking action  
        * Heard can look up how much GI bill you have left  
        * Starts reading GI bill apply button  
      * No, it’s cut and dry. It’s adequate. I’m ready to go, just need to get into a school  
- [ ] Is there anything else you think we should know?

      * I’m fine with this, I did a lot of new software testing on active duty and know soldiers like apps, the Army uses a lot of linux that is counterintuitive and this is good, I don’t know if the average soldier, you don’t need tio make iut a comic book, some people prefer to walk vs read  
      * VA benefit videos are pretty beneficial on youtube

Consent to use video clips

* That wraps up our questions for today. I wanted to quickly circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
  yes

  * If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?  
    yes

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)?   
   - Doesn't remember but has looked up rates for home loans and some retirement benefits  
2. How was your experience?  
   - Mostly happy that it worked \- experience was fine

Main questions  
For TSMs

1. Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military?  
   - Soldier for life transition assistance. Help w resume, interview help, getting med records settled before leaving service bc it’s easier that way.  
2. How is the process going for you?  
   - Separation date: Unknown. Submission time to actual date is about a year  
3. What are you doing right to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - A notebook \- recording notes when she visits any of the sites like [va.gov](http://va.gov). Puts appts in phone for reminders. Prefers hand written for notes.  
4. Is anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (if they need prompting, ask about who is in their personal network, social media, VSOs, mentors, friends). Follow up questions about how they are helping.   
   - TAP starts at 2 years. Not necessarily education there is interview and resume prep too. Start 18-24 months before separation to get through the process and get appts.  
   - No help outside of TAP keeping track, but sometimes peers give guidance based on their experience  
   - Facebook groups and transition groups. Horror stories, wins, things they wish they’d known   
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   - Program is thorough but the process is driven by the individual. They need to keep up with the support to get things done or not.   
   - Better set up now than generations before. There is a lot of info provided nowadays. Process can be overwhelming bc of amount of content.  
6. What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night?  
   - Records. Army is not good about paperwork and organization. She has gotten copies of records because they can lose it and then ask her for the paperwork as opposed to already having it. Once out it is much harder to obtain these docs.  
7. What do you wish you had known at the very beginning of the process?  
   - TAP sooner. She was an intel analyst \- resume sanitization is harder to process and takes a long time. Shrinking force.   
     - [ ] It isn’t too much of a challenge when submitting to agencies bc they have a network where certain levels of the resume can be routed.  
     - [ ] Intel community is recommended to do contract before government when searching for first job after separation, but it is not a requirement  
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
   - They brief them now during the transition course. Other than that she never got in depth info and knowledge about benefits. No briefing just because.  
   - A lot of rules and regulations are on facebook.   
     - [ ] IPPSA \- HR system that has a facebook page. Clips on how to use system, news letters, videos, regulations page (updated accordingly)  
     - [ ] Tiktok \- Short videos.  
   - A facebook page would be cool. There could be info about the process and steps. Sometimes this changes so someone needs to keep up with that.  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - VA knows this is stressful. Need to make sure everything is turned in, transition is smooth, relocating family when necessary.   
   - Make sure soldiers know the process and steps to take

   

For Veterans

1. How long ago did you separate from the military?  
2. Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, could you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?   
3. During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping. If they need prompting, ask about people they served with, friends, mentors, family, social media like Facebook and Reddit, VSOs)  
5. Is there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?  
6. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Completing the questionnaire  
      - Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
      - I have dropped a link to the tool we’re working on in the chat in this Zoom. Please open it, any browser is fine, and share your screen.   
      - For this test, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m wasn’t here, but thinking aloud about what you’re thinking and noticing, and some of the choices you’re making. I might stop you for questions along the way.   
      - Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions  
- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask “Did you notice the time sensitive tag?”   
- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask about saving the page and if they would return to it.  
      - Did you see the save the link box?  
      - Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Would you have to start from the beginning?  
      - How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

* Doesn’t understand what “take care of health and wellbeing” or “ plan for family future” means so she clicked them anyway.  
* Chose honorable discharge even though she is still serving  
* Didn’t look through all of the review page just checked the box and accepted  
* Understands based on her selections she is being recommended certain things  
* NOTE: Double check Skillbridge requirements. Currently says 180 days but participant mentioned it might be 120  
* She noticed time sensitive and believes that means she should be looking at them first or that they have a timeline for participation of that benefit.  
* Anna: What would you do next now that you’ve scrolled? Answer: look at time sensitive then go back for the others. She would be interested in looking at the learn more as well.  
* Anna: Are there benefits that you didn’t know about? Answer: Vet Success on Campus, vet own small business, state vet benefits  
* Anna: Would you wanna save this page? How would you do that? Answer: Yes she would like to save this info. (after looking around she noticed “copy link to results”). Also mentioned she could just star/bookmark the page on chrome.  
  * Would email it but is worried about not being able to find it later. Would then print it and highlight/color code important things to her (refers back to notebook mentioned earlier)

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
  - Scrolled through  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
  - Yes  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
  - I did not notice any filter usage  
- What browser are they using?  
  - Chrome

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - Not really. Noticed my va and my healthevet and mentioned she is not sure what that is. Assuming the login would give her some more specific info.   
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  - No there is a lot of info.   
  - She thinks mental health is really important

* Man  
* Black or African American  
* 26  
* Some College  
* Army  
* GA/Urban  
* https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89967137199  
* I have separated from the military within the last 5 years  
* Army  
* No National Guard or Reserve service  
* Honorable discharge  
* 1-4 years  
* Did not participate in TAP  
* Does not have a cognitive disability  
* Does not use assistive tech

## Semi-structured interview questions

* Last VA interaction

  * Checked/updated profile information (contact info, subscribed to newsletters).  
  * Looked at more information on VA benefits (education, healthcare).  
  * Experience was "excellent" and "great".  
* Service History  
  * Separated: October 2021\.  
  * Branch: Army.  
* Separation

  * Official prep help/Guidance: His sergeant told him about the transition program and VA benefits, providing a tutorial of the VA website before he attended TAP. His chain of command (1st sergeant, company commander) and the army career counselor also provided resources.  
  * Support System: Friends and family were "very supportive" throughout his transition. He shared VA.gov and veteran-related Google search results with them.  
  * Planning & Tracking Process: He started planning his separation within a year prior to his discharge. He used a "to do app" (Microsoft To Do app) on his phone to track his progress, including financial aspects and resources from the VA website. He would write down tasks and create a schedule based on guidance from his sergeant.  
  * Harder than expected/Concerns: His main concern was that any applications on the VA website, especially for GI Education benefits, might get rejected. He had a "smooth sailing record" and an honorable discharge, so he wasn't worried about other negative outcomes. He did not recall needing any support that he didn't receive.  
  * What he wished he had known: He wished to have known more about "keeping abreast" of what VA has to offer regarding education, health, and other tools available on their app or online.  
  * Recommendations for VA communication: He suggested VA use newsletters on their website, connect with veterans via social media (like YouTube live streams of conferences or professionals sharing experiences), or send out e-newsletters via regular mail. He believes this would better prepare younger veterans.

## Usability test

* Initial Impressions: He expected the "Discovery Your Benefits" tab page to be similar to the actual VA website. He found the list of goals and steps ("Goal, Service, Separation, Discharge, Disability, Review") clear and orderly.  
  * User Behavior/Goals: He clicked through the questions to "understand my identity, basically as a veteran" and ensure all information was correct and error-free.  
  * Interaction with Results Page:  
    * He was particularly interested in "Post-9/11 GI Bill" and chose to click "Apply" directly rather than "Learn More" because he wanted to see what it could offer for his education. He noted the application process was similar to his past real-time experience.  
    * He expected his answers to remain on the results page after navigating away and returning.  
    * He felt that nothing was missing from the filtered results on the page.  
  * Saving/Returning to Results: He would use the "copy link to results" button and then email the link to himself for future reference. He suggested that a direct "send to email" button would be a helpful new feature.  
  * Tool Integration with Workflow: He confirmed he would use the tool alongside his Microsoft To Do app. He would write down requirements for benefits (e.g., health, education applications) found on the tool in his To Do list.  
  * Suggested Enhancements:  
    * A follow-up survey or video about what VA offers.  
    * VA having its own YouTube channel with live streams and videos of VA professionals sharing their experiences using the website.  
    * An "AI chat box" feature for direct questions like "How can I help you?".  
  * Information Relevance: He believes information needs change yearly, and prefers "fresh" new resources over older ones.  
  * Next Steps (if still transitioning): After using the tool, he would copy the link, email it to himself, and then explore other VA website sections like "About VA" or "VA benefits and healthcare" for more research.  
  * Recommendation: He would recommend this tool as a "useful link to help other veterans in need".

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes

Warm up question

1. What’s the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)?   
   - I think I checked my medical appointments, I think that was the last thing. I don’t know if [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) is the same thing as the health thing.   
   - Other than that just looking at benefits and frequently asked questions.   
   - Was that the first time since the change over of my healthe vet?   
     - [ ] No, a few times  
   - Nothing should be more than 2 clicks away. I can’t recall offhand that I was searching for that I couldn’t find with 2 additional clicks. Nothing specific comes to mind. Messaging was clear & concise leading up to My HealtheVet. Last time I utilized the platform to review my own reimbursements & payments was user friendly to me.   
2. How was your experience?

Main questions  
For TSMs

1. Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military?  
   - Retired June 1st 2023, a little over 2 years   
   - I had the transition leave time. About 60 days before I fell off the Army’s books  
   - The 2 years has flown by   
   - Can’t recall any major negative interactions with the VA  
   - Turn over personnel dealing with education benefits. My education counselor has turned over 3 times in 2 years. I don’t know if its work loads or understaffed, but ultimately its been a solid transition it hasn’t caused me a lot of angst. When I did need information it was easy to find it.   
   - Participating in   
   - Chapter 31, veterans rehab, & training program  
   - People who were more junior than I was didn’t have the same luxuries. I was the exception to the rule  
2. How is the process going for you?  
   - Was at 2 years out from my 30 year mark. I consciously made a decision to turn down a position that would have allowed me to extend past the 30 year mark which was high tenure for the Army. I knew it was time for me to go due to limitations physically, cognitively, other things caused by aging. I experienced stages of grief and then got to a place of acceptance of what life would look like post Army.   
   - I knew I had to go through the transition program, education track, employment, or small business owner. At the time I wasn’t interested in any of those, so that part of it was pretty good.   
   - Being a Sr. level of Army I had the opportunity to go to a resident full time executive transition course which I know most people don’t get the opportunity to participate in. It was like TAPS on steroids & dedicated to people with my experience & background.   
   - Talked about whether I was getting medical care &/or prepare for submission for compensation & pension program was a lot of the focus  
   - Not as much focus on what to expect the first time you enter a VA facility. For me it was pleasant because soon after transitioning out walking through the halls it looked and felt like a military hospital. Felt like a new permanent change of station move.   
   - Because I had medical concerns I was pretty proactive with reaching out to my primary care manager who set up a lot of intake and they spent a lot of time with me & caught a cancer diagnosis I didn’t previously know about.   
   - Financial preparation talked about in transition process, but it didn’t hit home at the time. After I got out I talked to my wife that its great we have programs to transition to veteran, but there are few programs that support transition for spouses. She had a harder time transitioning that I did. Family readiness groups and other things for outreach to spouses, I don’t see them at the forefront. An area of improvement would be helping military spouses in that transition.   
   - My wife qualifies for medical dependent program through the VA, but we haven’t explored that yet. She found a primary care provider that she loves here locally & doesn’t require referrals for every single specialty care, she doesn’t have to wait for the referral system to kick into place.   
   - Unless I tell her about a specific program, she’s not actively looking for programs anymore. She has all the contacts and important information as a surviving spouse.   
3. What are you doing right to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   - Mobile app \- when did you get that in your transition?   
     - [ ] I had someone from the VA contacting me every month or every 3 months post transition & one of them talked about the app. It really hit home when I went to my first medical appointment with my primary care manager and she said you can get your medical appointments, medications & stuff on the mobile app. Up until that point there was a lot of information being thrown at me and it was hard to digest it all. I was reluctant to embrace the electronic apps and it was overwhelming until I saw how something was going to help me manage this.   
     - [ ] I didn’t need every regulatory guidance and 5 page document, memo, etc all I needed was simplistic help, information in my area.   
   - What was it called when you did the resident executive tap?   
     - [ ] Nominative leaders transition at Fort Leavenworth Kansas for the Army. For Army senior enlisted, supposed to be the complimentary program. They created a transition course for us  
   - How much of the course had VA content in it?   
     - [ ] I would say it was less than a day   
     - [ ] A lot like TAP.   
     - [ ] I do recall one of the most helpful things was a panel of retired general officers, O6s & E9s that talked to us about transition & that was super helpful. A few of them talked about the transition to the VA itself. Everything else in the army before transition as a leader we’ve experienced and could relay that to someone else in the military. Transition is the one thing that none of us do until we do it.   
4. Is anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (if they need prompting, ask about who is in their personal network, social media, VSOs, mentors, friends). Follow up questions about how they are helping.   
   - The people that I reached out to & friends & other people I served with   
5. Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?  
   - Above point about spouse  
6. What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night?  
   - Thinking about what life after the Army would look like. I wasn’t super concerned financially and we had prepared financially for decades so I wasn’t concerned about that, I was more concerned about what was I gonna do with myself. For the first time in my professional life I could choose, I didn’t have someone pushing me. It wasn’t like a friend of mine who’s retiring this week, he has school age children & he’s talking about having to get a job and providing for them. As soon as the transition started and I started focusing more on myself, my health decline was my biggest concern during transition.   
7. What do you wish you had known at the very beginning of the process?  
   - I wish I would have known more about mental health, behavioral health, cognitive health programs direct through the VA or that the VA liaises with. Outlines that aren’t in the traditional strains of psychiatrists, psychologists. My whole job was to help individuals to transition out of the Army so I had a bit of a pre-read of it.   
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
   - In person finding out what is important to the service members themselves at TAP. Talking them a year ahead of time or 5 days before they transition out & they reach out to you because they’re in a panic is probably not the right time to help. Checklist is helpful, but needs to be fluid. Finding out what is important to the individual is important. People have different experiences.   
   - 1:1 interview asap  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   - There’s probably a bell curve of experiences out there & while I was fortunate to have a good transition experience, I see people who were in the middle of the bell curve & was adequate & I also see people who fell through the cracks.   
   - I see individuals here who would benefit from programs but it was missed based on where they were in life.   
   - Vietnam era vets where there’s still some embarrassment about service & on the other side I see entitlement from people who served x number of months or years and they feel entitled to benefits that are earned & think they deserve more than what the VA offers to them.   
   - Lot of people that don’t understand how benefits are funded.   
   - People thought they would take away benefits from someone else. My friend who retired 15 years ago just signed up for benefits that could have helped the stress he incurred.   
   - People at high levels in the administration right now saying just because you’re a veteran doesn’t mean you need to use all of your VA benefits. That’s an awful message from the top down because those are benefits earned from service. 

   

For Veterans

1. How long ago did you separate from the military?  
2. Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, could you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?   
3. During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping. If they need prompting, ask about people they served with, friends, mentors, family, social media like Facebook and Reddit, VSOs)  
5. Is there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?  
6. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes \- 12:30

- [ ] Completing the questionnaire  
      - Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
      - I have dropped a link to the tool we’re working on in the chat in this Zoom. Please open it, any browser is fine, and share your screen.   
      - For this test, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m wasn’t here, but thinking aloud about what you’re thinking and noticing, and some of the choices you’re making. I might stop you for questions along the way.   
      - Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions  
- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask “Did you notice the time sensitive tag?”   
      - Noticed  
- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask about saving the page and if they would return to it.  
      - Did you see the save the link box?  
      - Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Would you have to start from the beginning?  
      - How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?  
        - [ ] Would only expect if signed in  
        - [ ] Cognitive and memory issues  
        - [ ] Use blue vs purple hyperlink to understand if he’s been there before  
        - [ ] Would prefer to have radio button to choose how to receive result  
              - [ ] Save to My VA, email, text, select as many as you want  
              - [ ] The more places it is the more opportunities to find it again because of memory issues  
              - [ ] 

- Using firefox  
- “Standard cover page as far as I know”   
- I don’t know if I need to sign in or if I’m going to need to sign in somewhere down the line   
- Service  
  - Opportunity to provide clarity for people who transitioned & moved into GS or DoD type of positions. Civilian DoD or Contractor roles since a lot of folks transition into those  
- Results  
  - Earlier I didn’t check a block about school so I don’t think that needs to be way up there, but I get it is alphabetical  
  - State Veterans’ Benefits is a great one   
  - Didn’t answer a question about small businesses so maybe that’s good to have pop up there  
  - Burials & memorials is a good one. May have been glossed over during TAP. Service members who have been serving for a while feel like they’re invincible, good one to highlight  
  - Lot of folks concerned about home loans  
  - Time sensitive stuff   
  - Didn’t think he should have been served Disabiklity because already received  
  - Was expecting to see something for family members because he chose “plan for my family’s future”  
  - 

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
  - Yes  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
  - Saw that results are alphabetical   
  - Skipped copy link  
- What browser are they using?

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - Transition support articulated in the results  
  - Was an opt out program  
  - Then opt in for future contacts  
    - [ ] Particularly for family members, especially for working spouses  
    - [ ] Solid Start  
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
  -   
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
  - Being able to return, having this in account  
  - Wants links to live chat or direct phone line  
  - Being able to actually talk to a person  
  - If it identifies itself as a chatbot it’s ok if there is an option to narrow it down and then offer human   
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  - The tool is only as good as it is for the user, if we’re keeping it simple and concise then it’s probably a good tool, the biggest part is that people are aware of tools. There aare so many sites, apps out there and there is an overwhelming amount of information, sifting through it is hard  
  - Maybe during the TAP process, if you remember nothing else, here is the website that will get you to hte start point  
  - 

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


  yes

## Gene’s notes

Transition Experience – Participant (July 28, 12pm ET)

P21 is an Army Veteran who retired after 20+ years. He lives in Louisiana and did not serve in Guard or Reserves.

Last interaction

* Checked my medical appointments  
* Not sure if VA.gov is part of the eVA platform  
* Before that would have been looking at some Chapter 31 info and some FAQs  
* \[Multiple visits since the MHV changeover\]  
* Digital assistance, phone numbers and mobile app have been really helpful in the process

Improvements?

* Website; seems pretty user friendly for the most part, in military career we focused on digital infra “nothing should be more than 2 clicks away” which tends to be the case on VA.gov  
  * Messaging from MHV to VA was pretty concise  
  * Looking back at reimbursements (comp and pen, Ch31) were pretty easy to understand

Separated

* Retired June 1, 2023  
* Had transition leave time, \~60 days before I left the army’s books  
* The last 2 years have flown by; but haven’t had that many major negative interactions with VA since transition  
* Louisiana has a new med center  
* Turnover of personnel for education benefits has been high (3 people since starting)  
* When I’ve needed to find information, it’s been available

Benefits you’ve used recently

* Voc rehab and \[missed this one\]

Preparing for separation

* Was able to drive my own transition by virtue of timing and the position I was leaving  
* I know not everyone has that luxury  
* Fairly senior at the time I exited the army; spent a lot of time speaking to juniors who didn’t have those luxuries  
* Talking with a friend that’s retiring this week that had to work right up until the end

TAP

* About 2 years out from 30 year mark  
* Turned down a position that would have extended past the 30 years mark for a few reasons  
  * Physical, cognitive changes based on aging  
  * Went through the stages of grief early on to where I was less upset about the prospect of leaving  
  * Had time to plan financially, what life would look like post army  
* TAP was helpful for understanding  
  * Education  / employment / small business  
* Got to participate in an executive TAP class; dedicated to folks with my experience (only open to people with high levels of seniority)  
* VA focus during TAP  
  * Focused on the medical transition from active duty to VA program  
  * Getting medical care for continuity of care; preparing for submission for compensation and pension  
  * Didn’t feel like as much focus on what to expect upon going to a VA facility for the first time  
    * Was pleasant for me (here in New Orleans)  
    * Walking through the halls looked and felt like a military hospital; almost like a change of station move to another hospital  
    * Had some med concerns so was fairly proactive for my primary care manager who setup a lot of time on intake  
    * Fortunately did they catch a diagnosis early which was really helpful  
    * Continued along the transition topic  
  * Something I talk about a lot with folks transition is financial prep  
    * It’s talked about during transition / TAP but it doesn’t feel like it really captures it  
    * It’s great there are programs to transition Veterans, but not that many programs for transitioning for spouses. Wife had a harder time with transition than I did  
      * Area of improvement: military spouses preparing for retirement  
      * Q:  
      * Healthcare was positive and negative  
        * Negative: not under umbrella of military medicine  
        * Positive: moving to tricare select and continuity of care provider  
        * She qualifies for dependent medical care program through the VA but haven’t explored it yet but initially she found a local primary care that works through out tricare network, doesn’t require a lot of referrals  
    * Day to day planning for your spouse, how is she managing?  
      * At this point she’s moved on, it’s 2 years post-transition. Unless there’s something specific I tell her about, I don’t know that she’s actively searching anymore. She’s mentally made that break; we do have that instruction book and list of contacts for has as a surviving spouse.  
      * She said: grateful for all of the services that have provided (you) in this transition, but she still struggles to find her identity post-transition. No longer a military spouse, she’s not going to be a “retiree spouse” or “VA spouse”  
  * Mobile app  
    * Got it when someone was contacting me post transition \[VA Solid Start\], possibly a nurse case manager  
    * One of them talked about the app during a phone conversation  
    * Hit home during my first medical appointment with my care manager; told you can access med appointments and medications on the mobile app and it clicked  
      * Before that it was just a lot of information \[wasn’t connecting\]  
      * Was a little overwhelming  
      * Once it became something that would help me continue to manage  
      * Definitely after transition  
  * Focused content vs “the universe” was helpful?  
    * Absolutely, didn’t need to find every single thing, just the simple help version. Some of the info seemed national vs focused on my area  
    * If I could just type my ZIP or city, not just get phone and location, some way to see programs in my area that would have saved me some clicks  
  * Resident Exec Tap called “Nominative Executive Transition” for army senior enlisted  
    * Flag officer billets; complementary program to the general officer Transition Course  
  * How much was VA content?  
    * Less than a day, I do recall one of the most helpful things; a panel of retired general officers (06s and e9s) who talked to us about transition; several of them talked about transition to VA itself  
    * Everything else in the army we’ve experienced, but transition is the one thing none of us do until we do it and at that point we’re no longer the general or sgt major, we’re the retiree  
* Additional support?  
  * The people I reached out to; friends, people I’d served with. Unfortunately I was pretty resistant to assistance; grew up in the “zero defects” army culture, would take help when offered but would rarely ask directly for help. If I had been proactive I might have gotten more direct assistance  
* What were you most concerned about?  
  * At that point; what would life like army look like (day to day)  
  * Wasn’t super concerned financially, empty nesters, been preparing financially  
  * More concerned what I was going to do with myself  
  * For first time in professional life I could choose, I didn’t have something pushing me  
  * My friend that is retiring has school aged children, different set of concerns  
  * As soon as transition started and focus more on self, health decline became more of a concern (health management)  
* Wish you knew before?  
  * Mental health, behavioral, cognitive health directly through VA or facilitated through VA that aren’t the traditional psychiatry / psychology.  
  * Fortunate that I was assigned in a warrior transition battalion; so had a bit of a pre-read on some of it  
* What could we do to better reach transitioning service members?  
  * In-person, finding out what is important to service members in TAP  
  * Talking to them a year out or 5 days out when in a panic is not the right now  
  * A checklist is fine, but it needs to be a fluid checklist based on their goals  
  * Differences between a 24yo that’s leaving normally, senior officer that can’t reach 20 year term of service, etc  
    * There’s no one-size-fits-all approach  
    * A very pointed focused 1on1 interview with the individual as soon as they know they are going to be transitioning out  
    * You have to treat each service member as an individual  
* What do you want VA to understand?  
  * There’s a bell curve of experience  
    * My experience was positive but  
    * I speak with and see folk that had okay experiences  
    * Others who slipped through the cracks  
  * Generally there have been leaps and bounds; Vietnam Veterans still have some embarrassment about service; vs some people feel some entitlement because of time in service.  
  * Some benefits are earned, but some believe they are entitled to more benefits than the VA provides to them  
    * Enlistment contracts list these out but some folks have erroneous assumptions  
    * Some don’t understand how benefits are funded  
    * Got time to see things as a legislative advisor, had folks not apply for education benefits or Comp and Pen who didn’t take something because they felt it would take something from someone else  
    * Had a friend who just finally went through med assessments and could have saved himself 15 years of financial challenges because he felt others were more worthy and put off the process  
    * Some very poor messaging coming from senior leadership around “maybe you don’t need to use all of your benefits” for anyone to state Veterans are abusing the system, it’s poor messaging

Switch to Prototype

* Standard cover page  
* See sign in at top but don’t know if I need to sign in  
* Goals  
  * Planning for my and family’s future  
  * Understand by benefits  
  * \[have most of the others in good order)  
* Served  
  * 3+, don’t know if this is parameters based on VA reqs; where you are in life would determine different of foci  
    * Friend retired at 38 years  
    * Some people might struggle with the difference between 3+ and how long they served, or their personal identity after  
  * Army, Active  
* Not serving  
  * Some folks that left the army might feel that moving into a gov position (GS, DoD), civilian or contract roles may feel those are a continuation of serving  
* Separated  
  * 2-3 years  
  * Like the link for the upgrade process  
* Disability rating  
  * Claim \+ rating  
* Review page  
  * Just a summary  
  * Below “6 of 6 review” maybe include a sentence “summary of responses” or similar  
  * Privacy policy; don’t read it, but check box and move on  
* Results  
  * Not sure why disability comp is the first; not sure why it still shows up since I have a rating already  
  * Disability housing grant could be good, not everyone knows  
  * Foreign Med that’s a good thing  
  * GI Bill – not saying it’s a bad thing but not sure it needs to be all the way up there, it’s alpha  
  * State Veteran Benefits; that is a good one, every state has different things out there, this will potentially influence Veterans decisions post-retirement  
  * Don’t recall answer about VOSB  
  * Healthcare and mental didn’t recall checking a box around these  
  * Burials and memorials; might have been glossed over during TAP. Nobody needs this until they need, service members don’t typically think about this unless they have a terminal condition  
  * Home loans, a lot of folks concerns  
  * Time sensitive stuff  
  * VA Life  
    * Service connected  
    * Maybe I qualify and didn’t even know  
  * Veterans Preference  
  * VSOC  
* Based on the things I chose, stuff for my family and benefits; what was expecting to see were more articles or something about family member transition, what to expect for military spouse or dependent, what to expect post-transition and what direct services can that family member access

What support would you like that you’re not seeing?

* One that’s not here that I found helpful; telephone check-ins (VASS) once I was in it, there was an opt-in for future contacts  
  * Useful particularly for family members, good to know that that exists  
  * Would have expected that this would have popped up  
* Would be nice to go back to this and see this if signed; 20 min from now won’t remember what I saw or might have clicked; if I come back to it, utilized a link would be beneficial

If you were to save it, how?

* I would prefer to have “send me text” “send me email” “save it to MyVA” and select as many of them as I wanted of them  
* I personally do \[double up on them\], I forget about things unless I see them  
* If I see it in a text message, I might not remember, but see it in in email and then in MyVA; the more places it comes to me, the more opportunities to get back into it

How to take action after using this tool?

* Depending on what it is, if looking into disability housing grant (learn more)  
  * What would hope to see here that I don’t already see; whether it’s a live chat or a phone number (not to a tree) but to a desk where there is a person and that person who I speak or chat with; being able to chat with a person virtual or in-person. Most customer service sites have that option, this may have it somewhere but there should be something that says Chat Now or something.  
* Chatbot?  
  * Don’t have a problem with a chatbot if there’s an option that says it’ll narrow the answer and to direct you, but also some have a link to talk with a live rep right away to bypass the chatbot  
* This tool?  
  * There’s so many sites and tools out there, it’s overwhelming, even the starting point is hard  
  * It might be during the TAP process; “if you remember nothing else” don’t just send them to VA.gov; whatever link you provide is to that first page for what you are concerned about  
* Unrelated  
  * Music has been hugely helpful for community; will give VA great kudos for exposing me to some of those external organization \[playing guitar\]

      * I was going to do a congressional about that doctor  
      * I thought I was going to get treated the same way because doctors talk to each other

- [ ] What do you most want the VA to understand about your experience?

      * Skipped, see above for context

## First Task: Use the tool \- 15 minutes (:45)

* Thank you for sharing all of that with us\! It’s incredibly helpful for us to understand your experience.

* I have a tool that we’re working on that’s intended to help with the transition process. I’m going to paste the link in the chat, and then if you could open it in any browser, and please share your screen.

  * *Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)*

* For this part of the session, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m not here, but making sure to think aloud about what you’re noticing and thinking, and why you’re making some of the choices you’re making. If you have any questions, I might not answer them, but I may occasionally prompt you along the way. Okay, feel free to get started.

  * *Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions.*

Notes

* Taking the questionnaire  
  * Zooms through, no issues  
* On the review answers screen  
  * Confusing \- Why is it asking me for information about disability after I already checked disability?  
  * Jessica prompts through clicking privacy policy  
  * She thought the review was the results  
* On results page  
  * I would never have know that all this would show up by clicking the privacy policy  
  * I would click on TSM benefits  
    * Because of “act quickly to take care of time sensitive benefits”  
  * Disability comp is right here  
  * Housing  
    * I became an adult in need of care a year ago, had to call 211 then hitting 1, when you call and hit one and get the military assistance, I calle dthem and they helped me out, I was almsot homeless and living in an RV  
    * They said they could get me assistance through Catholic Charities, help through one payment a year, VA won’t help me if I live in an RV plain and simple, but that’s not listed anywhere  
    * If you have animals you’re screwed, nobody can help me unless I get rid of all of my animals, but they don’t tell me that  
    * We can find you an apartment, but you’ve gotta get rid of your animals  
    * Why can’t you just help me with the lot rent for my RV?  
    * I only get $1700 a month and my lot rent is $675, the propane won’t get me through the winter, don’t have heat for part of it because I cna’t afford it, I’m in a situation where I don’t have a lot of money to pay the lot rent, but I have an RV, I have4 to borrow from friends $200 for month to get heat in the winter  
    * If I can’t come up with lot rent I’m homeless, and I don’t have a way to pull the RV off the property   
    * No one can help me because I’m in this gray area  
    * There are other Veterans, I know 4 other Veterans who live here on this property but they are at 100% disabled, I cna’t get there so I can afford my lot rent  
    * What makes me different? I cna’ t understand that  
    * Trying to get frmo 70-100, my back should get me there, I can’t sit for more than 30 minutes  
    * They see it as a disability but they don’t want to pay me for it, I don’t know what to do   
* Helpful?  
  * Tool would have been helpful during the transition process if it were more user friendly  
* Would use now?  
  * Would go to it to make suer I’ve done everything I’m supposed to do  
  * I don’t know what I don’t know and I’m doing this all by myself  
  * There’s that guy at the VA, MO Veterans Commission, found him when I applied for my food stamps, he said I can help you get your retirement pay  
  * Should have got that when you got out  
    * Filled out paperwork, sdon’t know how to do the rest of it  
    * 

Follow-up questions

- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask: Did you notice the time sensitive tag?

      * She noticed right away in the blue box

- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask:  
      Now that you’ve gone through it, do you think you would return to this tool? And if so, how do you think you would do that?

      * Did you notice the Copy link button?

        * Skipped \- She was having a hard time with the tool

      * Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Or would you have to start from the beginning?

        * 

      * How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

        * 

Things to watch for

* *How does the participant interact with the results page?*  
* *Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?*  
* *Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?*  
* *What browser are they using?*

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes (:55)

Final questions

- [ ] What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?

      * I don’t know  
      * There’s a phone number on there for 24 hours  
        * Easiest way  
        * Able to reset passwords?  
          * Screwed up two of the ways to log in, it’s not user friendly

- [ ] After using this tool, what would you do next?

      * I wish there was a place I could make a complaint  
      * Vent  
      * It would be nice to say I screwed up my account, I guess I could call and complain  
      * I don’t mean to sound bitchy all the time, I just get so frustrated with the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) website

- [ ] What would help you take action using the information in this tool?

      * 

- [ ] Is there anything else you think we should know?

      * No  
      * Just make sure that everything on the website is perfectly clear. Click this for this. I was confused  
      * I was in IT in the Navy, I always made sure Sharepoint websites or websites I made were clear so the dumbest guy on my team could use it, I made the website as dumb as him  
        * How?  
          * I made it very, very clear. When I labeled stuff I would put everybody’s name, or evaluations, and then ther would be ones that are blank evaluations, you would copy that and save it, rename it under your name, that way you diodnt; use the original, and then you did your own eval. Or when I downloaded a training I saved it under the training file, and all of them would be listed. They would be labeled under their name, print it, sign your name, hand it in. I made it user friendly and for the dumbest guy in the room.   
          * 

Consent to use video clips

* That wraps up our questions for today. I wanted to quickly circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   

For Veterans

1. How long ago did you separate from the military?  
   1. Joined 22 yrs ago. Separated Aug 2024\. Total active duty 3-4 years, the rest was guard.  
2. Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, could you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?   
   1. Started planning based on physical conditions. Ended up in medical multiple times and decided it was time to transfer the knowledge to someone else.  
   2. Very little support.   
   3. Tim Bowden in charge of transition.   
   4. You get a checklist of what retirement will look like, info on entitlements, and how to login.   
   5. Info overload.  
   6. Guard is different than active duty. Active duty is TAPS, guard is going from building to building getting what you need to transition out.  
3. During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   1. They give you a couple months to work through the checklist. This is a paper form not digital. It has to be done in a certain order.   
   2. First \- elect to retire on your own but need approval from commander. They sign off and it goes through a process.  
   3. Turn in equipment, make sure you’re removed from systems where you might have security clearance, etc.  
   4. Lose CAC card get retirement card  
   5. Applied for benefits before separation

   1. No one is officially in charge for this. No one person could help him with the paperwork.  
   2. Had someone who would make sure the paperwork forms were correct and went to the right place. He found this lady at a career event. This is not something that all separating vets are able to find.  
   3. You have to seek out retirement. Tell them you want to retire then they print out the checklist for you. It is orderly though and there might not be a need for a dedicated person to coordinate this. That would be hard since there are thousands of people transitioning.   
   4. Richmond VA treated him really well and he hasn’t heard this about a lot of facilities.   
   5. Not really into social media. Got a lot of info from people who already retired.   
5. Is there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?  
6. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?

   2. Worried about losing benefits.   
   3. He makes sure he sees his drs when he’s supposed to. Keeps track of his health. He is worried getting healthier will make him ineligible for VA benefits.  
   4. He’s worried about doing applications. He already has 100% and doesn’t want it to lower. Knows people personally that this has happened to  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   1. Hiring our heroes. Vets are taught how to speak to civilian employers. Learning interpersonal skills.  
   2. His first years were a little tough being a veteran and also an ethnic minority.  
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
   1. Youtube “did you know” video about applying for benefits and new technology with new friendlier people who want to help.  
      1. There are some issues here like appts falling off the schedule and long wait times, but overall his experience has been positive.  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   1. There should be a trigger if an appt gets cancelled  
   2. Parking is interesting \- always told to get there early

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Completing the questionnaire  
      - Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
      - I have dropped a link to the tool we’re working on in the chat in this Zoom. Please open it, any browser is fine, and share your screen.   
      - For this test, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m wasn’t here, but thinking aloud about what you’re thinking and noticing, and some of the choices you’re making. I might stop you for questions along the way.   
      - Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions  
- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask “Did you notice the time sensitive tag?”   
- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask about saving the page and if they would return to it.  
      - Did you see the save the link box?  
      - Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Would you have to start from the beginning?  
      - How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

* “It’s pretty intuitive” \- about the survey  
* “Drop downs work really fast”  
* Didn’t look through all the drop downs on the review page, just clicked submit  
* He’s looking for training/certifications not so much school.  
* Clicked “learn more” and rated the page but did not submit the rating  
* Asked about certifications. Knows a lot of people who want to learn to fly or become an electrician  
  * Anna: If you were gonna look for that, where would you find it? Answer: search resources at the top.   
  * The sites results were not helpful or specific to this veteran.   
* Anna directed him to edit his selections to include “Start a new career” to see if he would get what he was looking for for certifications.  
* Didn’t really take note of VR\&E. Wants to talk to a person. Wonders if this applies to certifications  
  * Mentions he was turned down for this in the past.  
  * Assumes he should go back and apply again since things have changed. Thinks there are a lot of people who might be in this situation.  
* Did notice time sensitive tag but didn’t know what it meant. Should say ‘within x amount of years of transition’  
* Saving results: expects to have to redo the survey. Anna points out the copy link to results button and he says he noticed but didn’t know what it meant.  
  * Would email this to self or copy and paste the page results  
* Skipped over state benefits because he is already familiar with them. His son is using them

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
  - Search bar, learn more. I didn’t notice him using the drop down at the top of the results.  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?   
  - Yes  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
- What browser are they using?  
  - Edge

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - Info on getting certificates  
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
  - Need an 800 number where he can talk to a person not an AI bot.  
  - There is an 800 number but he thinks it is probably a help desk and not a benefits representative  
  - Would try contacting a VSO   
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  - VA was proactive. Once you’re in one program they tell you about everything else.  
  - Does not seem to like the gray when hovering links. Thinks they should be green because “green means go”

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
    
  - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

For Veterans

1. How long ago did you separate from the military?  
   1. Separated from air national guard after long career  
   2. Separated in 2023 (\~ 2 years? yes)  
   3. Active Duty timeline?   
      1. Active Duty retirement from air guard. Joined in 96, went to college, activated during 9/11. End of 01 went to officer school. Full time basically from 2002 \- 2005\. Then back to part time. Went to milwaukee to fly planes part time, then to fargo and was full time (AGR) until he retired.   
2. Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, could you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?   
   1. Standard active duty retirement.  
   2. Can’t remember name of the program, but he’d put in for a determination prior to separation.  
   3. Didn’t have all records. Something went sideways and was missing information  
   4. TDY (?) retiring and was overseas for a period of the 1 year \+ 120 days.  
   5. Anna: so many people have experience where there’s deployment during their terminal leave period. Threw a wrench there.  
   6. Wanted him to go through TAPS and was mandatory for AGR to go through it (until he retired). But he missed TAPS because of his deployment.  
   7. Without TAPs, how did national guard link you with VA? They had a retirement seminar for guard people. 2-3 day retirement center (spouses joined too), and he worked most of his retirement through the county veterans service (maybe? Missed part of it)  
   8. Agrees it experiences/support is dependent on state and state’s involvement.   
   9. Got connected with county VSO because his dad has disability rating and works with the guy at VSO. His dad “bullied”/pushed him to meet with him and get connected.   
3. During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   1. Had, maybe still has, from retirement seminar: a pamphlet (from a folder full of info) that had deadlines and tasks to accomplish.   
   2. Did you rely on paper? Set up a binder with it? He relied on the paper–didn’t do much outside of that.   
      1. Anna: a lot of people using check list. As digital services people, we need to remember importance of paper. Did you use any digital stuff or do independent research outside of it?  
         1. I don’t think so?   
         2. Should he talk about Medical or Tuition or all benefits? He used digital for GI bill transfer.  
         3. When his insurance transferred over he used another site (DEERS?) and check online.  
         4. He applied for i think an education program for technical certification. He thinks a tech boot camp. Applied for it and they either ran out of money or he realized that he needed to be hired afterwards and didn’t want to look for a job that soon, so he didn’t end up doing the program. But that was also online.  
            1. Through VR\&E? Yeah, maybe, but he can’t remember.  
            2. Different than GI Bill (anna: probably VR\&E then)  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping. If they need prompting, ask about people they served with, friends, mentors, family, social media like Facebook and Reddit, VSOs)  
   1. Anna brought up family member and VSO Again.   
   2. Anyone outside official command structure and unit that was important?   
      1. Nope  
5. Is there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?  
   1. Hmmm… (long pause). He’s heard multiple stories, but for him he thinks it went pretty well.  
   2. Looked up when he got his first VA payment, and it was on his sept. pay stub, so it only took 3-4 months, which he feels is not unrealistic. (said positively)  
6. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   1. No, he’s generally an optimistic person, so he felt like things would find their way.   
   2. There was a small hiccup with health stuff, but it was resolved in less than a week. (he can’t remember the hiccup)  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process?   
   1. Problem air crew has is they hide from docs, because they don’t want to get their flight status revoked. When they get out the transition from don’t complain to do complain (to account for things that are wrong to get rating)...  
   2. Not sure if it’s something that he… he wished he got it on the record sooner. Wished he had gotten it on the record soon. But there will always be a tension between those two feelings (hiding it and getting on the record)  
   3. Do you feel like that slowed down getting a rating? Yes, did for him personally, because he took longer to realize it was two different things–a different reality… Had to get them together.  
   4. (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   5. What surprised him about process? He was surprised by how smoothly it went. He thought there would be more hiccups. Some of the med assessments were…. pretty — initially he was dismayed by it. He talked to the VSO about his right toe, but someone put down left toe, and he got his right toe looked at, and last doctor said “ok lets see left toe.” And he was scared that would mess things up, but the final doctor was able to note that in paper work.  
      1. Had to go through higher level review because of it, but it went through quickly.  
      2. Was surprised by that, but pleasantly surprised.  
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
   1. It’s pretty persistent the way it is… but… With guard experience, he had a VA person at their retirement seminar, so working with guard people (?) at each station to tap into see who’s retiring. Each state works differently, so they’ll be surprised with how each one works and does things differently. His state worked well.  
   2. A lot of emails, a lot of phone calls, a lot of mail. “I think that’s all good.”   
   3. Smooth start phone calls? “No that doesn’t sound right…”  
      1. No that doesn’t ring a bell at all.   
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   1. Ummm… (long pause). I don’t know… I don’t remember how I messed up pre-separation. But I would guess being more aggressive with members over 20 years. I don’t know if they can use their military email to get ahold of them, but if they’re contacting people 3, 6, 9 months after retirement, they should be contacting them 3, 6, 9, 12 months BEFORE retirement.  
      1. Make sure they’re in the system and get them into the system.  
   2. Retirement seminar was 2 days before separation date.   
      1. Anna: TAP is 18 months \- 1 year out. So his experience was very close to separation.  
      2. Anna: learning that national guard/reserves experiences are quite variable. VA could probably do more to help people who aren’t doing TAP.

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Completing the questionnaire  
      - Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
      - I have dropped a link to the tool we’re working on in the chat in this Zoom. Please open it, any browser is fine, and share your screen.   
      - For this test, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m wasn’t here, but thinking aloud about what you’re thinking and noticing, and some of the choices you’re making. I might stop you for questions along the way.   
      - Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions  
- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask “Did you notice the time sensitive tag?”   
      - Yes he noticed it on the second time through.  
- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask about saving the page and if they would return to it.  
      - Did you see the save the link box?  
        - [ ] He did not notice it.   
      - Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Would you have to start from the beginning?  
        - [ ] See below: he’s skeptical of this and prefers tabs. He tried navigating away and it shuffled results and led to potential bug.   
      - How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?  
        - [ ] Would you want to come back? “I think so, yeah”  
        - [ ] How would you want it saved/shared? Probably an email or even a calendar reminder to check every 6 months to a year to make sure he’s not hitting any… Then refers to pension (65+ requirement.) “I won’t remember when I’m 65, but I’d like a reminder. A reminder every year to remind him to check.  
              - [ ] But that doesn’t seem like something other people would do.  
              - [ ] An email to send to wife or something or send to self would be good.  
              - [ ] Or a favorites option. “I use the favorites bar a lot”  
              - [ ] He can use the guide (JN: not sure what he’s referring to), i do that all the time.   
              - [ ] More of a computer user than a lot of people, so he does things differently.  
- [ ] Did he see filters on lefT?  
      - He did, yes.   
      - Anna: why didn’t you interact with filters and scrolled instead? What was your thought process?  
        - [ ] Considered it and thought about stepping through, but he…   
        - [ ] Since it was smaller number, he just went through them. But the filter being able to chunk them through would be useful to break them into smaller pieces and help him make sure he’s not missing them.  
              - [ ] Would prefer tabs or live filtering rather than having to click an update button that has to be clicked before seeing the filtered results.

\[\!NOTE\]

* Walk through  
  * Goes straight o “get started” with pointer.  
  * Asks “what’s my goal?” Anna: goal is to discover your benefits. You can   
  * He clicks get financial support, going back to school, plan for retirement, take care of my health, explore benefits..  
    * Always interested in going back to school, but no immediate plan.  
    * Wants to join a gym, but doesn’t know if there’s a benefit.  
    * Community care  
  * Moves through options very quickly and easily.   
    * No questions about what’s there. Able to quickly find his selections.  
    * Says “yep, those are pretty straightforward” for disability rating part.  
  * Sees the review tabs and clicks through. Quickly browses.  
  * Clicks privacy review, but says he doesn’t usually read those.  
  * Then clicks through.  
  * 15 results, “that’s a lot”  
    * “I know about that…” (disability?)  
    * Scrolls through and says “don’t need that” with things he doesn’t need (disability housing grant, and GI bill (transferred)  
    * State results–clicks out and is worried he won’t get back to where he started from.  
      * Hasn’t looked at/into state resources, so that interests him.  
    * Clicks back and gets to results. Glad he’s able to get back to the results.  
      * But they’ve shuffled them, which is something he doesn’t like.  
      * “Doesn’t even have the same ones”  
    * He mentions “time sensitive” but quickly scrolls by.  
    * Clicks back again, but then it kicks his results out and makes him read privacy policy.   
      * Dropped his cookies for some reason. Shows uBlock origin, which he thinks is dropping the cookies and might be the reason for the bug.  
    * Anna asks him to use the stable version to see if the bug is there again.  
      * Has no problem going through the questions again.   
    * Notices the 13 results instead of 15 from staging link.  
      * “Won’t have the minnesota thing…”

  * He’s using Edge as browser.   
  * Still scrolling through. Clicks on Vets pension.  
    * Doesn’t know what it is, but thinks he didn’t qualify or something.   
    * Reads through requirements.  
      * Highlights 65+ and says “oh yeah, that’s for other people….”  
  * He tests to see if he can open in new tab, and confirms it works.  
    * Says that’s what he would normally do so that it doesn’t lose his place.

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
  -   
- What browser are they using?  
  - Edge

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - Hmm… (long pause). I dunno. I can’t think of anything. This covers all the benefits… I don’t what else. I can’t think of anything else. To me, this is the reality i’m living in now: everything listed here is what i know is available.   
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
  - Look at VR\&E since he talked about it earlier and it’s something he’s still interested in.  
  - He’d be interested in looking into how many months he has left for kids (GI BIll? Jeff missed what he clicked on) because he’s got a 17 year old. This would remind him to go look for that.  
  - Not sure if there’s a community care info in there, but he lives an hour away from VA so he uses community care.  
    - [ ] Finds community care confusing sometimes, so understanding that better wouldn’t hurt.  
- Do you feel confident that this is showing you everything?  
  - No, if i wanted to see everything, i’d click show everything.  
  - But he’s confident in what’s shown there.  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
  - He’d like to see how many total benefits there are and how many he’s being shown. Would want to know what’s not being shown so that he could see what he clicked that’s missing.  
  - Tabs would be useful instead of dropdown filter.  
  - Would be ok with opening a new window after clicking on a benefit rather than staying in same window.  
    - [ ] But that’s a personal thing.  
    - [ ] He doesn’t trust the back button–and refers to the shuffling that happened earlier.  
    - [ ] Sees he’s got 4 tabs open and isn’t sure how that happened, but he said that doesn’t both him. 

Wants to find a start over button, but can’t find one. Thought he saw one, but anna says it’s not there.

Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

## First Task: Use the tool \- 15 minutes (:45)

* Thank you for sharing all of that with us\! It’s incredibly helpful for us to understand your experience.

* I have a tool that we’re working on that’s intended to help with the transition process. I’m going to paste the link in the chat, and then if you could open it in any browser, and please share your screen.

  * *Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)*

* For this part of the session, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m not here, but making sure to think aloud about what you’re noticing and thinking, and why you’re making some of the choices you’re making. If you have any questions, I might not answer them, but I may occasionally prompt you along the way. Okay, feel free to get started.

  * *Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions.*

Notes

* Using Chrome  
* Likes the goal breakdown  
* Likes the review  
* Uses filters  
* Didn’t know about state benefits  
* No [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) account  
  * ? He used education benefits  
* Jessica: what are you looking for?  
  * Looking for benefits I know about, GI bill, housing, TAPs  
  * Making sure they’re all there (I guess to test)  
*  Found the link saver  
* Clicked through to transfer GI bill  
  * Determined right away that he isn’t eligible   
* Clicked through to Veterans preference in federal hiring  
* Overall very fast and confident reading and determining eligibility for benefits  
* Pennsylvania  
  * Clicks through to property tax via financial assistance  
* Wasn’t aware of the majority of benefits  
  * Only knew GI bill, home loans, TAPs  
* Clicks through to SBA  
* Clicks through to burial  
* Jessica: how would you decide what to look into first of the benefits you’ve never seen?  
  * Look at the name   
  * Eligibility rules  
    * The blue square  
  * Go through each one by one  
  * How would you keep track of that?  
    * 

Follow-up questions

- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask:  
      Now that you’ve gone through the results page, I want to see if you noticed a few things…

      * Did you notice the time-sensitive tag?

        * Yes

      * Did you notice a way to “see all benefits”? What do you think this means?

        * Noticed right away and clicked through  
        * Not sure how someone would use it to your benefit because it doesn’t align with what you answered to the questions  
        * Maybe would read through and tell someone else about it so they know if they qualify  
      * Maybe when you click it should still remember your benefits from the questions  
        * Give answers about why they weren’t listed and whether you qualify

      * Did you notice the filters? What would you expect to see here?

        * Yes \- kept it on all  
        * I don’t think you need to filter because it’s such a small number of results  
        * But would filter by time sensitive because you have to do them quickly  
        * Default sort?  
          * Most common benefits first  
          * Or TAPs first, but someone might not be interested  
          * Most common should be the default layer  
        * 

- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask:  
      Now that you’ve gone through this process, do you think you would return to this tool? And if so, how do you think you would do that?

      * Did you notice the Copy link button?

        * Yes  
        * Would want to have it emailed to self, or otherwise would save the link

      * Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Or would you have to start from the beginning?

        * Expects to have to fill out the questions again if he weren’t signed in  
        * If I were logged in I would expect my results to still be there, and for it to fill my information  
        * “If it saved the information you put in why it would make you redo it if you’re in your account:  
        * 

      * How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

        * I would rfeturn onee I’m closer to getting back  
        * Would search [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) discover your benefits  
        * 

Things to watch for

* *How does the participant interact with the results page?*  
* *Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?*  
* *Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?*  
* *What browser are they using?*

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes (:55)

Final questions

- [x] ~~What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?~~

      * Would like a customer support link for talking to a real person someone who knows more about this than I do (doesn’t see the contact info)  
      * As long as they know the basics about benefits and can answer all  of my questions

- [x] ~~After using this tool, what would you do next?~~

      * Would come back to look at the ones I’m interested in a learn more

- [x] ~~What would help you take action using the information in this tool?~~

      * Learn more and apply now are enough to move on to what you want to do

- [x] ~~How do you think the needs of younger Veterans like yourself differ from older Veterans?~~

      * I think we are different in a lot of ways, because they’re entitled to benefits that are only for them, a lot of people got injured so they’re qualified for more things, we’re just getting out of the military and nothing special happened, we’re entitled to less benefits than they are  
      * It is right to defer us to them because they did a lot more than we did

- [ ] Is there anything else you think we should know?

      * No

For Veterans

1. How long ago did you separate from the military?  
   1. Separated 2020  
   2. Reserves 3 years then went to active duty in Army  
2. Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, could you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?   
   1. Started 2 years prior to retirement. Made a decision to retire and started considering next steps. First step was to find training. Talked to a vet service. Someone told him he needed his medical files and other things and this person helped him with necessary steps.  
   2. Also saw career counselors  
3. During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   1. They gave him a checklist that he was following. It had all the information and stuff about the organizations that could help him. This checklist shows a timeline (1 year out, 6 months out, etc)  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping. If they need prompting, ask about people they served with, friends, mentors, family, social media like Facebook and Reddit, VSOs)  
   1. Did TAP \- online training was hard.   
      1. Website was hard to use. Confusing.   
   2. He went to see the person who could tutor and help him.  
   3. VSO helped him put in claims for benefits. This was separate from training and transition.   
   4. Got help from friends who had already retired  
      1. Went to retirement 5 day mandatory training classes and met people there in a similar situation  
      2. Friends also helped him keep track.  
5. Is there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?https://home.army.mil/imcom/customers/career-skills-program  
   1. Tried to find a job that aligns with expertise but the recommendations were too far.   
      1. CSP: https://home.army.mil/imcom/customers/career-skills-program  
      2. Helped build resume, did mock interviews  
6. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   1. Am I good enough? Am I gonna find a job? Can I work with civilians?  
   2. Wished someone else had talked to him about it  
      1. Coaching, mentoring  
   3. Eventually found a job where he works alone a lot  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   1. What to do? Where to go? Do I keep my tricare? Do I need to get my own health insurance? Concerns about life insurance.  
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
   1. He wasn’t sure about a lot of what VA provided. No one came to the meetings and gave that information. It took him awhile to start applying to benefits (VSO helped him put in claims for benefits 6 months out)  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience?  
   1. VA felt like a last resort since he wasn’t retired yet and wasn’t sure if they would be able to help him.   
   2. Once he got out it was more about his family than him

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Completing the questionnaire  
      - Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
      - I have dropped a link to the tool we’re working on in the chat in this Zoom. Please open it, any browser is fine, and share your screen.   
      - For this test, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m wasn’t here, but thinking aloud about what you’re thinking and noticing, and some of the choices you’re making. I might stop you for questions along the way.   
      - Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions  
- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask   
      - “Did you notice the time sensitive tag?”   
      - “Did you see the “see all benefits” link?  
      - Ask them to use the filters  
        - [ ] What filters would they like/expect to see?  
- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask about saving the page and if they would return to it.  
      - Did you see the save the link box?  
      - Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Would you have to start from the beginning?  
      - How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

* Uses VA website a lot for looking up health appointment info  
* Has already applied for the VRE (VA version not Army version)  
* Took a minute to understand how to get started on the discover benefits survey  
* Partially checked the review section then selected the box and hit submit.   
* Chose VALife benefit \- he already has this benefit but is asking about changing from SDVI to VALife and is looking for information on the page  
* Looked at VMLI \- wants to learn more about this benefit  
* FSGLI \- was asking about this benefit and if it covers family \- he is seeing now that it does  
* These insurance benefits are new to him because he has never searched it before  
* Was trying to get back to the survey by clicking the back button. Restarted the questionnaire instead. The benefits recommended were different this time. \[did he choose different answers? I did not notice\]   
* Anna directed attention to the filters up top and when asked if he would use them the participant said he would.  
  * There should be “finding forms” in the drop down  
* Selected the “more support” drop down  
* Didn’t notice “show every benefit” until it was pointed out. He said he would use this function.  
* Would like a way to get back to the recommendations so he doesn't have to redo the survey.  
* Did not notice “copy link to results.” When directed to it he said he doesn’t know what it means.  
* Would check history for the results. Would also expect to be able to find it when logged in.

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
  - No  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
- What browser are they using?  
  - Edge

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - Mentions finding forms again but otherwise thinks everything is covered  
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
  - Spend more time looking at other benefits \- in particular insurance benefits  
  - Share this info with spouse \- she should know how to do this if something happens to him. Daughter already has an account and applied for educational funding  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
  - Thinks the more he uses it the easier it will be to benefit  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?

Consent to use video clips

   1. Separated Oct 2023  
2. Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, could you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?   
   1. Separation was two-fold. Medical and future employment. Medical \- had been told in advance to start this in service. Was doing appts during service. Received disability almost immediately. Employment \- moderately helpful classes. Skillbridge, reaching out to companies about 3 months before separation. Landed a role.   
   2. Felt well warned and prepared  
   3. People coaching her \- another officer in her unit about 6 months ahead of her, chief from a previous assignment that gave her good info

   1. See above  
5. Is there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?

- [ ] Completing the questionnaire  
      - Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)

      - Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions  
- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask   
      - “Did you notice the time sensitive tag?”   
      - “Did you see the “see all benefits” link?  
      - Ask them to use the filters  
        - [ ] What filters would they like/expect to see?  
- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask about saving the page and if they would return to it.  
      - Did you see the save the link box?

      - How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

* Filled out survey from standpoint of someone transitioning  
* TAP didn’t walk her through account creation  
  * Mentions some of these benefits are not mentioned in TAP  
* Recognized the results are alphabetical  
* Didn’t look too much into high disability requirement benefits because she knows she wouldn’t qualify  
* Opened educational and career counseling  
* Noticed time-sensitive tag \- assumed it meant some are more immediate. E.g., skillbridge 6 month timeline  
* If she wants to see results she is expecting to have to take the quiz again especially since she isn’t logged in  
* Would like to flag specific benefits, maybe not the entire results page  
* Did not see the copy link to results URL  
* Anna: How would you save this? Answer: email it to self  
* Saw the top saying it is filtered for All Results but didn’t necessarily notice the side panel  
* Thinks there would be 16 benefits available for what she selected since it says All Results  
* Anna: What do you think about this list of filters? Answer: it is sorted pretty well. Calls out more support  
* Did not notice show every benefit

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
- What browser are they using?  
  - Chrome

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes

- What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?  
  - How to get in touch. Messaging box or something that lists options for getting in touch.   
  - Anna: If there was a chatbot how would that work? Answer: starts with AI then depending on what you need you might get automated responses or a rabbit hole to a real person  
- After using this tool, what would you do next?  
  - Disability compensation and then skillbridge    
    - [ ] Though the skillbridge website was kind of hard to use (looks different to when she used it so maybe it’s better now with less bugs). Some of the companies she reached out to from skillbridge were no longer doing what she reached out for  
- What would help you take action using the information in this tool?  
- Is there anything else you think we should know?  
- Is this tool helping with the personalization aspect?   
  - Yes, but curious how different inputs differ results  
  - Disability comp is easier before separation so this could sort of be time-sensitive  
    - [ ] Easier when you have access to base  
- Is disability a big ticket that should be at the top?  
  - Yes some people write it off thinking they’re healthy

For Veterans

1. How long ago did you separate from the military?  
   1. Army, separated a few years ago also in active service reserves (from anna).  
   2. Separated in Feb 2025\.   
   3. Active duty or reserves?  
      1. Reserves in 2007 then active duty until a year and half ago (I think, I missed part of this–sorry)  
2. Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, could you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?   
   1. Probably started planning earlier than that even. Submitted for retirement two years out from february. Knew even before that he wanted to retire at 20 years. Thinks he was a lot more fortunate than others because his unit and supervisor. Had worked with him previously, and he made it understood that participants last year was the year for him to take care of transition stuff and prepare for retirement  
   2. Feels like it was a lot different for him than for majority of soldiers getting out.  
   3. Had ample time to do appointments. Finished SSL Tap 8-12 months before retirement.  
   4. Knew he would do skilbridge 4 of the last 12 months of his pre-retirement.  
   5. Process was… much easier than he anticipated with his SFL TAP (soldier for life tap)  
      1. People there are really good at helping you schedule everything and get things done.  
   6. Relatively stress free experience.  
   7. How did you find out about skill bridge? What was process.  
      1. Knew about program from other soldiers that got out before him.  
      2. Initially knew he wanted to do it but didn’t know what he wanted to do with it.  
         1. Went through skill bridge website to see pre-approved programs but didn’t see anything interesting to him.  
         2. Talked to lady during SFL tap and found out about individual internships for skill bridge.   
            1. Has buddy who has body shop, participant has classic car and likes that stuff, asked his friend to help him out and take him on. Friend was all about free labor and took him on.  
               1. Started process through soldier support center and skill bridge.  
               2. They told him everything he needed and got packet set up. Got approval within a month or so.  
                  1. Pleasantly surprised by speed.  
      3. Knew he wanted to do it, but just had to figure out what he wanted to.   
      4. Fortunate he got to spend 4 months learning how to do something he wanted to know how to do.   
   8. What else besides skill bridge were you working on during that time (aside from benefits)?  
      1. Started BDD pretty close to 6 months mark (\~165 days out from retirement submitted)  
      2. After BDD submission, he scheduled appointments. Did C\&P (compensation and pension, i think–refers to it later too) exams–maybe 5-6 exams–so he did those. Finalizing everything.  
         1. Doing these exams while doing skill bridge.  
      3. Last month or (1-1.5months) cleared everything that wasn’t pre-cleared.  
      4. Then 3 weeks before official retirement date he cleared everything out.  
   9. 	  
3. During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? (Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)  
   1. He had everything planned out probably \~3 years before retirement that would get him towards a 2, 1.5, 6 months, etc. out. Had it all planned on his own.  
      1. He’s someone who likes to be organized.  
   2. Old battalion commander gave him a breakdown of 3 month periods (36 months back from ETS retirement date)  
      1. Had a list of “at this point you should have this done)  
   3. Used that and a calendar he printed out to help say “this date to this date, you’ll be on leave” “this is skill bridge” “this is when you should do BDD” etc.  
   4. That along with the 36 months out checklist helped guide him along with everything else that he was learning at the time from SFL tap.  
4. Is anyone/did anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? (Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping. If they need prompting, ask about people they served with, friends, mentors, family, social media like Facebook and Reddit, VSOs)  
   1. CO was great.  
   2. But not really anyone in SFL TAP process that helped. Helpful in their own little thing (in their own lane), but not anything extra (maybe missed something here)  
   3. Felt tremendously supported by unit–especially his sgt major.  
5. Is there any support (or organizational info–from anna)) you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?  
   1. No not really. Wishes there was more clarity on certain things, like…  
   2. And clarity and streamlining things  
   3. Up until retirement he thinks he was good.   
   4. Working with people retirement SFL tap, BDD thing.  
   5. Under USASOC (??) does a lot to help prepare soldiers to retire. A lot of support and a lot of pushing info out to support soldiers and give them resources.  
      1. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\_States\_Army\_Special\_Operations\_Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Special_Operations_Command)  
         1. Confirmed by participant.  
   6. Biggest headaches have been since he got out. Frustrated by how slow VA is and how long it takes to be able to get…  
      1. He called \~week after initial retirement date to schedule time with PCM(?) and it was still 5 months out.  
   7. Wishes there was a way to pre-schedule appointment with PCM. Doesn’t like how long it took to have to wait to see a doctor.  
6. What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?  
   1. Initially it was retirement packet. Shortly before he submitted, the military changed the timeline. 6m-1yr before he retired, they extended submission window to 2 years out. This created a big backlog, so his packet went months and months before it received signatures and went up to next level.  
   2. Finally got through signatures and sat at last one (soldier support or personnel management?) and then sat for 6 months before getting final signature.  
   3. After that got approved, he was \~8 months away from retirement before finally approved. Took almost a year before approval.  
   4. Next biggest stressor was BDD and C\&P (yes, probably compensation and pension.) exams. Making sure everything was submitted correctly and on time. Wanted to limit time between last active army check and first VA Compensation check.  
7. What do you wish you had known during the process? (follow up if they don't mention benefits: What do you wish you had known about VA benefits?)  
   1. Things he wishes people had told him?  
   2. Says he’s had no good experience with VA since he got out.   
      1. Took 5 months to get in with PCM, and PCM is older and hard of hearing and can’t hear him well, so he talked about current concerns (see below), but the PCM didn’t end up doing anything with that info.  
         1. Started having knee issues close to retirement.   
         2. Also had back issues (did chiro, PT, acupuncture, radio frequency abrasions–last step but had to go through everything before then).  
            1. Had 2-3(?) of those in final years, talked with VA doc to figure out how to continue to do that, and new doc said the VA has to start process over (PT, then refer pain management, *before* referral to ablation)  
         3. Biggest issue was \~5 months to get him, put in referrals 2-3 weeks ago, got a call from one place this morning. Taking months for chiro, more months for PT, then december appt again with PCM. So \~10(?) months to get here and doesn’t even know when/if he’ll be able to actually get the pain management appt.  
8. How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?  
9. What do you most want VA to understand about your experience (about getting benefits)?  
   1. VA compensation has gone relatively smoothly–but he thinks a lot of that has to do with the personnel that USASOC put together to make sure BDD was done before he got out to make sure there’s not a lapse.  
   2. The couple of times he’s contacted VA to ask Qs about compensation–making sure he understands how those dif amounts of money for kids and spouse…wife is also veteran who gets compensation, they were worried that oldest daughter using ch. 35 under wife AND him was an issue.   
      1. First guy he talked to wasn’t helpful and thought the way they were doubling up on ch. 35 was alright.  
      2. Didn’t want to be in a situation where they were overpaid in error and needed to pay back the government.  
      3. Wasn’t reassuring to have someone be “kind of sure…”  
      4.  (jeff note: I’m not sure if it was or wasn’t right based on his responses–not sure if there as resolution)  
   3. But other than that the other people seemed knowledgeable and if they didn’t know they would talk to someone else to clarify.  
      1. So he’s happy with that part of the experience. 

## First Task: \[Use Discover Your Benefits Tool \- self led\] \- 15 minutes

- [ ] Completing the questionnaire  
      - Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)  
      - I have dropped a link to the tool we’re working on in the chat in this Zoom. Please open it, any browser is fine, and share your screen.   
      - For this test, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m wasn’t here, but thinking aloud about what you’re thinking and noticing, and some of the choices you’re making. I might stop you for questions along the way.   
      - Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions  
- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask   
      - “Did you notice the time sensitive tag?”  
        * (His selection didn’t have any time sensitive tags.)    
      - “Did you see the “see all benefits” link?  
        * Anna: are you curious about the other benefits and did you notice they were there?  
          * Did notice them. Feels like a “unique” vet since his wife got out \~13 years ago. Thinks the system is much more refined since she got out–it was much more confusing and impossible to navigate back then.  
          * Would be interested in edu benefits, but kid uses ch. 35, wife uses GI Bill  
            - [ ] They’ve done a lot of research on those things, so doesn't need to look.  
          * Doesn’t need a job now, so job thing not interesting to him now.  
          * Planning for family and him doesn’t seem as relevant to him, since he has done so much planning already.  
          * Noticed they were there, but he felt like there was more to get out of the health care one.   
      - Ask them to use the filters  
        * What filters would they like/expect to see?  
          * Anna asked him to look at them.  
          * He didn’t notice they were there.  
            - [ ] If there was a more extensive list he’d probably look for them, but with such a short list (only 5 results) he didn’t think it was really necessary  
            - [ ] With a longer list, he’d probably use the filters.  
- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask about saving the page and if they would return to it.  
      - Did you see the save the link box?  
        * Not asked about  
      - Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Would you have to start from the beginning?  
        * Not asked about, but he didn’t have any qualms about going back after looking at state benefits. Very easily went back to look at the benefits again.  
      - How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?  
        * Not asked about  
      - Anna: what would help you take action with these things? Any other support it should offer to help you?  
        * “Within the tool: no I don’t think so.”  
        * He’d much rather go sit down and talk to someone about things (like state benefits).  
          * Feels like he’d have much better results with that in-person convo with a knowledgeable person than with this form.  
        * Wouldn’t have wanted to do the BDD process online with a tool–he worked with VSO to do it and it was much easier that way.  
      - Anna: Have you ever worked with VSO?(based on his preferred method of learning/doing things.  
        * Mentions that BDD help was VSO (virtual appointment–not a huge fan of virtual, but he prefers the virtual synchronous process to async computer part.)  
          * “That guy was amazing.”   
          * Reached out to him about car crash mistake mentioned below, then that guy gave him other VSOs to talk to that would be able to help him fix that mistake. 

\[\!NOTE\]

* Using his iphone for this.  
* Thinks the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) app has been nice to use.   
  * A little bit of a learning curve, but he likes to be able to pull up his payment and info on the app.  
* Seems like he’s reading through info on page (scrolling up and down)  
  * Seems pretty straightforward–likes the big green arrow saying “start here”  
  * Likes that the phone number isn’t too far down the page, so it’s easier to get in contact with somebody.  
* Reads through goals-  
  * Likes the graph on top to show progress.  
  * Military makes you do surveys and trainings–and one of the things they added is a progress bar, and he thinks is “always nice”  
* Wants an option for “old people” who stay in military longer than 3+ years.  
  * Anna asks for him to say more: why do you think it’s written that way?  
    * He doesn’t know… Doesn’t know anyone where it needs to be broken down that specific (on 2 of 6 how long did you serve)  
    * Doesn’t know anyone who served 0-3 months.  
    * Doesn’t think that there would be any different answers for longer than 3+ years, but he thinks it would help to signal a value (jeff’s words) of his service.  
      * 3+ years makes it seem like this tool isn’t for someone like him who’s spent 24 years in the military. (“Maybe that’s just me….”  
  * How would you expect it to be broken down? 3-5 and 5-19?   
    * No. could get rid of 0-6 (couldn’t hack it, got kicked out, worthless (“i know i shouldn’t say that).  
      * Maybe do 0-1 year, 1-5 year (one tour people, people who get injured), 5-12 year (people who do 1 and re-enlist once), 10-12 (when you make up your mind if your gonna be a career soldier/career service members), 12+ (is career)  
      * Feels like it would be nice to see 20+ years as a signal to people who were retired and did the whole time.  
  * Makes it feel like this forms “for kids” with “little to no life experience.” People who aren’t him.  
    * Makes it seem like this tool won’t have anything for him–or people like him.  
  * “Funny to me that space force is a real thing” 😂  
  * Has to sit and think/count out title 10 time.  
  * Has to think about separation time.  
  * Asks about discharge upgrade process (didn’t know it existed)  
  * “Will say this…” about disability status selector  
    * Had multiple, talks about one.  
    * Had a claim that was denied, got a letter.  
    * They said it was denied because he was in a car accident in 2005 and wasn’t in the service, but he wasn’t in one and was in the reserves in 2005–so he was still in the service.  
      * Not sure why that happened.  
  * Scrolls through summary quickly, but clicks on each “plus” sign.   
  * Quickly clicks through privacy button.  
  * Scrolls through results quickly and then goes back to top.  
  * Feels like he doesn’t need info on DisComp, since he indicated he already did his.  
  * Foreign medical program (“no that’s not me”  
  * State benefits would be nice, since each state’s different and he’s thinking about moving to another state “that will be nice to see what’s available there…”  
  * “Might take you 6 months to a year…” as he scrolls past health care  
  * PCM told him he can’t get meds for migraines till he gets labs, so he did afterwards. Figured doc would call him afterwards to say he put in the RX, but he didn’t (fine, e doesn’t like talking to docs anyway…) but the doc just sent it to him at his house. He liked it.  
  * Mental Health services are a joke. Something about talk therapy (but I missed it, sorry)--i think he was doing it while in service, but it wasn’t available to him now from VA  
    * PCM mentioned that he had a behavioral person. Talked to VA person about it early on who said they don’t do talk therapy. VA person said he could do group therapy, but he doesn’t want to do that.   
    * Has been one of the most frustrating things.  
      * Someone at VA pointed him to local clinics. Went to local place (maybe sees a lot of Vets), had to go back for intake appt, but the office said they’re at a \~35 day wait before being seen.  
      * Doesn’t have a problem paying a co-pay if he needs to, but he feels like he shouldn’t have to.  
      * Feels like VA’s mental health services thing doesn’t work.  
  * Anna asks him to click through state benefits to go to next page.  
    * Clicks through to resources and starts to browse through states. Looks at NC (lives there maybe?)  
    * Clicks to NC page and looks through carousel.   
    * Notices car tags and says that he knows in NC it’s very hard to get a tag.  
      * Has to take docs to in-person office to be able to get authorized paper work.  
      * Then have to take that paperwork to the DMV to get the license plate.   
      * But the lady in the office helped him fill out other things while he was there (fishing license, property tax exemption)  
  * Anna: sounds like it’s important to be able to reach a human?  
    * Yes, definitely. He hates that everything is automated now and you have to go through multiple steps to finally get to a human.   
  * Anna: you liked the phone number in that place (on form)?  
    * Yes, liked that the phone number was very next thing after the tool.   
  * Anna: do you feel like you’d be able to go through this and apply for/get benefits?  
    * He feels like he would be able to. Feels like there are probably people (older people) might have difficulty with it. People his age or younger would probably be able to navigate through this stuff.   
  * Feels like the VA is tremendously failing Veterans. They’ve gotten better, but it’s still not GOOD–still below average. Wants someone to see his comments and realize it’s a bigger issue that needs to be worked on.   
    * Anna: is primary reason the medical stuff mentioned?   
      * Yes, that and the wait times.  
      * Understands there’s a lot of Vets and a lot of people that need to be seen. But 5 months to see a PCM? And a lot of Vets are broke…  
      * Doesn’t know if it’s going to be a quick thing after seeing PCM To get to pain management, or will it be a longer process (blocker, to steroid to etc.) and many more months to get to the process he was already doing in VA.  
    * VA compensation side has felt more streamlined than the horror stories he heard leading up to his retirement, but  
      * Biggest issue for wife and other people who knows has been the long wait times.  
      * For wife, had occasions where it’s taken months to get an appointment and get a notification the day before that appt was cancelled by provider, and then has to wait more time for the next appointment.  
      * 3-4-5 months to wait is “asinine” 

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant interact with the results page?  
  - Scrolls through easily, thinks about how it does (or doesn’t) impact/relate to him as he goes.  
    - [ ] Also thinks about positive/negative experiences he’s had with each benefit as he goes.  
- Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?  
  - None shown  
- Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?  
  - Yes–no issues/questions  
- What browser are they using?  
  - Safari on mobile

## Semi-structured interview questions \- 25 minutes (:30)

Warm up questions

- [ ] What was the last thing you did on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)?

* Trying to remember last time he was on… Mobile app: same thing  
* Maybe trying to get initial assessment and benefit stuff started.

- [ ] How was your experience?

* Had no idea what he was looking at just clicking on random things  
* Anna: Sounds like a lot of info, is that your experience?  
  * Yes.  
* What could’ve made it easier?  
  * If someone had told him on zoom/phone “here’s what we’re looking at, click here, click here.”   
  * Or say “new veteran? Click here”

Main questions  
For TSMs

- [ ] Where are you currently in the process of separating from the military?

      * 

- [ ] How is the process going for you?

      * 

- [ ] What are you doing right now to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? *(Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)*

      * 

- [ ] Is anyone outside of TAP helping you keep track of what you need to do for your transition? *(If they need prompting, ask about who is in their personal network, social media, VSOs, mentors, friends. Ask follow up questions about how they are helping.)*

      * 

- [ ] Is there any support you currently need and aren't getting with the transition process?

      * 

- [ ] What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What keeps you up at night?

      * 

- [ ] What do you wish you had known at the very beginning of the process?

      * 

- [ ] How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?

      * 

- [ ] What do you most want the VA to understand about your experience?

      * 

      

For Veterans

- [ ] How long ago did you separate from the military?

      * A little over a month ago.  
      * From national guard  
      * Timeline: enlisted on 6/5/2013 got out on 7/4/25. Multiple Title 32 deployments and Title 10\.  
        1. Just got back from deployment overseas for 9 months.

- [ ] Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, can you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?

      * Went pretty smoothly. People wanted him to re-enlist, he said he wanted promotion, they didn’t promote him, so he got out.  
      * Went to TAP after he got off deployment around 9 months ago.  
        1. Was he able to do TAP because he was deployed?  
           1. Yes.  
        2. Started TAP when he was getting ready to leave the country of deployment.  
           1. He did SFLTAP (soldier for life)

- [ ] During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? *(Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)*

      * Had to go through online courses, he just knocked them all out at once so that he wouldn’t have to worry about it.  
      * Finished 9 months ago?  
        1. Something like that yeah  
      * Working off TAP checklist?  
        1. Pretty much. A coordinator at Ft. Bliss emailed checklist to everyone listing out courses to be done, so he did them all and emailed coordinator to check and they said “you should be good”  
      * Nat Guard doing retention, when you were exiting was the person doing retention and signing off on ETS same person?  
        1. Didn’t speak to anyone from his unit about retention. No one was checking in with him about separation, once they found out he was separating, they left him alone. (I might’ve   
      * Not much official support  
        1. Pretty much thrown to the wolves. Need to rely on people who have been through. Also reached out to friends in the VA  
           1. Former medical readiness NCO was one person. Set up table at yellow ribbon event when they got back stateside. Said he’d call participant when he had more, when they talked, he gave him steps and said “I’ll walk you through whatever’s left.”  
      * Benefit determination at discharge?   
        1. He’s not sure.

- [ ] Did anyone outside of TAP help you keep track of what you needed to do during your transition? *(Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping. If they need prompting, ask about people they served with: friends, mentors, family, social media like Facebook and Reddit, VSOs)*

      * Mostly linking up with mentors and former leaders, asking them for support. Getting info through the grape vine and figuring it out.

- [ ] Was there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?

      * Didn’t need anything. Has a job, has housing, has reliable transportation, so feels like he didn’t anything “per se”

- [ ] What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?

      * Wanted to make sure his guys were taken care and knew what was going on. Wanted to make sure he groomed up the next to make sure that he was able to take the reigns effectively.

- [ ] What do you wish you had known during the process? *(Follow up if they don't mention benefits: Is there anything you wish you had known about VA benefits?)*

      * Just how to start. When you get out, he knows he had VA benefits, but he doesn’t know how to access them. Didn’t want to drive down the VA to ask “what do i do?” and he’s sure they’d be able to help him, but he didn’t want to inconvenience them.  
      * “Don’t want to be a burden, don’t want to be a hindrance” so he wanted to find answers for himself, but he couldn’t and he’s stubborn, so he just didn’t find them (I think that’s what he said”

- [ ] How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?

      * Have a Vet coordinator to tell the vet how to get started on all of the benefit stuff. Feels like a lot of soldiers who get out are lazy and don’t want to be proactive once they get out. They want to relax and enjoy time they finally get back, but they need someone (maybe a month before they get out) to meet with him–that isn’t trying to convince them to stay in–but give them a checklist that makes sure they’re doing what they should be doing. 

- [ ] What do you most want the VA to understand about your experience?

      * When he signed up, you get 6 “bibles worth” of paperwork to review about what you get and what you don’t, but that was way too much for him. They should have a system that takes your DoD ID \# and says “here’s what you’re entitled to” so that he doesn’t have.  
        1. Everything he’s done should already be documented by DoD, so he feels that VA should just be able to use that information.   
        2. Doesn’t want to jump through hoops and establish new profile and backdate and go back through old things to find things like injuries. MedPro should automatically be able to transfer to a VA setting.  
- [ ] Do you work with data in your job or in technology (asking in relation to VA/DoD databases)?   
      * “The problem is they don’t work either way” Any gov site he goes on crashes.  
      * Doesn’t work in tech, he’s a delivery driver. 

## First Task: Use the tool \- 15 minutes (:45)

* Thank you for sharing all of that with us\! It’s incredibly helpful for us to understand your experience.

* I have a tool that we’re working on that’s intended to help with the transition process. I’m going to paste the link in the chat, and then if you could open it in any browser, and please share your screen.

  * *Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)*

* For this part of the session, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m not here, but making sure to think aloud about what you’re noticing and thinking, and why you’re making some of the choices you’re making. If you have any questions, I might not answer them, but I may occasionally prompt you along the way. Okay, feel free to get started.

  * *Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions.*

\[\!Observation\]

* Immediately hovers over “get started”

  * Scrolls a little, but then goes right back to get started

* Clicks financial support, well being, new career, understand benefits. Spends a little time looking through.

* Easily finds service, branch, and component

* Reads through things quickly and doesn’t seem to have trouble at all with questions.

* Hasn’t filed disability claim.

* Goes straight to privacy check box, hovers over the link to read, but then clicks through.

  * Also ignores the expandable goals

* Feels like questions were standard and straightforward, nottihng really to report there.

* Looking at results and feels like there’s so much stuff

  * Needs to figure out what to start looking at,.

  * Wants something to tell him what to start looking at.

* Scrolls back and forth to bottom.

* Vets pension, knows he doesn’t get that.

* VGLI, could get that but feels like it’s expensive. 

* Does the amount feel like a lot or is the way they’re listed that feels like it’s a lot?

  * How it’s listed. Gets what it’s trying to do (give a little blurb about benefit), but for him it just feels like there’s a lot of stuff there.

  * Showing 15 results sorted alphabetically, so he would probably click on “apply now” for disability rating (then he does). 

    * After clikcing, he feels like he’s going to click on that, fill out something somewhere else, send it somewhere else.

      * Wants one-stop shop option.

      * Looking at info to support claim. Talks about evidence issues (no dd214, needing evidence while on deployment.

      * Looking through the application needs, then finds application link, then clicks, then gets to sign on thing. 

        * But he doesn’t have any supporting docs, so he would save for later. 

    * Back to the results. Scrolls and mentions Vet’s Preference, Back to School stuff, VGLI, Home Loan…

      * Looksat Home Loan, mentions CoE and clicks through some of the expandable things about preparing for it. 

        * Notices that he needs DD 214, but he doesn’t have one, so he goes back.

* Seems frustrated by the need for information (like DD214) that he doesn’t have.

  * Doesn’t have an idea of when he’ll be getting it. He’s been out for over a month and still hasn’t heard anything about it.

    * Nat Guard has to mail it, they can’t just print it out. Assuming that it will just show up in the mail when it’s done.

      * No one gave him any info about that process.

    * Once you make choice to not re-enlist and you’re not close to retirement, he feels like they just stop caring about you. 

      * Civ Orgs will help you out (but most of them you have to pay for).

* Anna asks: have you worked with any VSOs to get your claims together?

  * Has a packet from VA for initial checkup/screening, and they handed him a ton of paperwork that he doesn’t want to read through. 

  * Anna tells him that a lot of people work with VSOs to get someone to help talk through things.

    * He mentions wanting the VA to have someone to do that–feels like they might have that, but he hasn’t found it.

    * Feels like there should be an entire branch dedicated to helping people who are transitioning out.

      * Sure they have it, but he’s never heard of it.

  * Anna says “probably more resources from Big Army”. He agrees: NatGaurd just puts a table up and makes you check a box. Most people want to just get through the line as quick as they can.

    * He wants to tell future-separating NatGuardsment to actually talk with the people and njot just click on the box.

* Clicks back through and scrolls through again more thoroughly from Anna’s direction. He seems interested in a lot of the things he’s seeing again.

* Notices a bug for double cemetery burial.

* Using the back button a lot and pretty confidently to get back to his results. 

Follow-up questions

- [ ] After they have interacted with the results, ask:  
      Now that you’ve gone through the results page, I want to see if you noticed a few things…

      * Did you notice the time-sensitive tag?

        * Did see that. Clicks it. Reads through benefits.  
        * Sees VGLI–mentions that he heard about that when he was separating.  
        * Sees the results and says they’re related to helping people get a job, but he doesn’t feel like that’s helpful for nat guard, since they already have a job.

      * Did you notice a way to “see all benefits”? What do you think this means?

        * Noticed

      * Did you notice the filters? What would you expect to see here?

        * He saw it there. Then says “yeah, I see you can do that now. But initial reaction is like… wow\!”  
        * Anna directs him to click on the filter list.  
          * But filter list seems to bug and doesn’t give him any options to filter.  
        * How would he expect them to be sorted?  
          * Have one for “new veteran information” rather than making new vets sort through and try to pre-plan using ALL of the results.  
            * Suggests: Health care, claim status, and find local VA rep or something. For new vets.  
        * Anna explains the filters that *should* be there (“type of benefit”), what type of benefits would he be looking for?  
          * HE feels like what’s there is actually what he’s looking for, but a new e4 (3-4 years of service, not a lot of knowledge and experience) might be different.. (doesn’t elaborate)  
        * He wants a “new vet information” so that it doesn’t feel like he’s being dropped in the deep end.  
          * Wants 3 basic things so that he can get that done.   
            * Wants step by step rather than topic by topic.   
        * Filter seems to be working later to click on time sensitive tag.

- [ ] After they have completed the questionnaire and interacted with the results, ask:  
      Now that you’ve gone through this process, do you think you would return to this tool? And if so, how do you think you would do that?

      * Did you notice the Copy link button?

        * (I missed his answer, sorry)  
        * No  
          * Wouldn’t use it, would save the link in browser

      * Would you expect the results page to still be here if you navigated away from it? Or would you have to start from the beginning?

        * Hard to say, but he hopes it would still be there. But… if he put it off (and he would put it off), but even if he saved the link, he might not use it. (because he would put it off and lose it)

      * How would you save the results to use later? Would you prefer emailing it to yourself, saving the links, printing it, or something else?

        * Save URL is first answer.  
        * He’d probably email it to himself and then send the link to his phone and then send it to his guys to give them a not overwhelming amount of info.  
      * Is it helpful?   
        * Yes it’s helpful to him now.  
          * What is helpful about it?  
            * All on one page. A lot of stuff on one page, but at least it’s all there. 

Things to watch for

* *How does the participant interact with the results page?*  
* *Does the participant notice the time sensitive benefits?*  
* *Do they use filters, the back button, or other methods for understanding and navigating results?*  
  * Using the back button a lot and pretty confidently to get back to his results. 

* *What browser are they using?*  
  * *Chrome (I think)*

## Post-Task Interview \- 10 minutes (:55)

Final questions

- [ ] What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool?

      * Can’t think of any support that he would need off the top of his head.

- [ ] After using this tool, what would you do next?

      * Uses example of GI Bill benefits, clicks “apply now” link, pretty sure he does qualify, so he would go to click on apply, reads through some radio button options, clicks “Applying for new benefit”, clicks through next few options, clicks apply now.  
        * Then scrolls through information and says he wouldn’t look at any of it, and would just click start, then he’d sign in ([id.me](http://id.me)) and try to fill out whatever form there is.

- [ ] What would help you take action using the information in this tool?

      * Feels like info needed to start the form is there now.   
      * Feels like if you’re applying, then you’d already have the information required by the GI bill info (as listed in the pre-application form)  
      * Wants a way to save application status (he’s describing something not related to VTE and is talking through PGIB disclaimer), but maybe something that could be carried over to VTE’s form.  
        * Described a situation where he started filling a form, had to leave, accidentally clicked out and lost his entries. Feels like a lot of people would get frustrated in that situation (as he did)

- [ ] Is there anything else you think we should know?

      * As far as this tool goes, seems like it’s not quite one stop shop, but is a great way to get to that.   
      * Wants to add a “new veteran information” filter that gives them a place to begin the process helps new vets start the process by “developing a flow path.”  
        * For people who really need guidance on what’s highest impact. “Break it down barney style”

- [x] ~~How was your experience?~~

For Veterans

- [x] ~~How long ago did you separate from the military?~~

      * Separated from the guard in 2023  
      * Joined guard July 2003  
      * Mobilized for Katrina (in college at the time – left school to go)  
      * Deployed to Iraq in 2008/2009  
      * Graduated school in 2012 and took full time position with guard  
      * Towards end of career, left for personal reasons. Told his wife he’d do 20 years and then get out. Son was born with a health condition and decided to get out.  
      * Had a big retirement event  
      * Had SGLI for life insurance while he was in… didn’t get any notice that that was ending and had a lapse  
      * Why do people fall through the cracks when separating from guard?  
        1. Depends on unit  
        2. Retired as first sergeant with younger soldiers under him  
        3. Younger people might fall through the cracks because they’re only there 2 days a month, and some people travel quite far.  
        4. We don’t see some soldiers enough. The focus is on “do you want to re-enlist?” and then they have their last drill and they leave. It’s not on purpose.  
      * If you were VA, how would you solve this problem?  
        1. If there are VA liaisons, could they know that this person is ETS.  
        2. Doesn’t remember if we met with retention person since he was retiring  
        3. Tension with retention and transition part of the job  
           1. “You shouldn’t get out because you’re screwing with my numbers”  
        4. Budget cuts in PA in 2012/2015 \- 4 or 5 people down to 3  
        5. PTAE

- [x] ~~Thinking back to a year to a few months before you separated, can you walk me through your experience, and tell me the story of how your separation went?~~

      * It wasn’t until 2021 when he got a call from someone he deployed with, and he said he’s going through the VA process. Asked if he applied for any benefits, but he didn’t know anything about doing that while he was still in.  
        1. Called him back 2 months later and asked if he did anything  
        2. Keeps checking in if he did it…  
      * Eventually called and talked to a VSO  
        1. Filed VA claim while in  
        2. Downside: Someone told him to keep filing, but if you’re really intending to retire, they may try to keep you until you’re “better” – didn’t have that happen to him  
      * Used GI bill, all education benefits that he could

- [x] ~~During your separation, how did you keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? *(Ask follow up questions about tools, actions and people involved in these processes, who recommended them and how they found them.)*~~

      * Already knew what he used for education  
      * Always had private health insurance  
      * After college, was full time in national guard – when he left, got full time job as firefighter with insurance.  
      * Doctor at VA retired. Was re-established and will do yearly checkup with them.

- [ ] Did anyone outside of TAP help you keep track of what you needed to do during your transition? *(Follow up questions about who, and how they are helping. If they need prompting, ask about people they served with: friends, mentors, family, social media like Facebook and Reddit, VSOs)*

      * Friend that called him

- [x] ~~Was there any support you needed during the transition process that you didn’t get?~~

      * Would have benefited more if he could sit down with someone or even a phone call  
      * Has VA home loan

- [x] ~~What were you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition? What kept you up at night?~~

      * Life insurance fell through  
      * Knew he had health insurance and that he could go to VA and receive treatment for anything service-connected  
      * Found out if you’re hospitalized for anything service-connected, VA will pick up any additional costs if you notify them within 24-48 hours. Just learned about that a couple weeks ago.

- [ ] What do you wish you had known during the process? *(Follow up if they don't mention benefits: Is there anything you wish you had known about VA benefits?)*

      * See above

- [ ] How do you think VA should reach transitioning service members to help them get all the benefits they’ve earned sooner and more easily?

      * See above

- [ ] What do you most want the VA to understand about your experience?

      * One person probably has 40-50 people that they’re trying to handle  
      * It sucks that things are taking this long, but he understands. That’s just his personality. Is it annoying that he thought he’d have a decision soon? Yes, but it happens.

## First Task: Use the tool \- 15 minutes (:45)

* Thank you for sharing all of that with us\! It’s incredibly helpful for us to understand your experience.

* I have a tool that we’re working on that’s intended to help with the transition process. I’m going to paste the link in the chat, and then if you could open it in any browser, and please share your screen.

  * *Cut and paste this link into the chat: [https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction)*

* For this part of the session, I would like you to use this tool as if I’m not here, but making sure to think aloud about what you’re noticing and thinking, and why you’re making some of the choices you’re making. If you have any questions, I might not answer them, but I may occasionally prompt you along the way. Okay, feel free to get started.

  * *Let them go through the tool on their own terms, including side paths, but have them return to the results page for the next set of questions.*

* Microsoft Edge  
* Wanted to sign in immediately  
* Clicks all goals except education and career  
* Understood active duty and national guard language in questions. Likes the helper text about what title 10 is (activations, deployments, mobilizations). Thinks this would help younger soldiers who may not be familiar with title 10\.  
* How long title 10 – cumulative over 20 years or one specific? Assumes cumulative.  
  * Would this include active duty special operations? Title 8? Not sure if that would be included.  
  * Some national guard soldiers were brought on for 90 day order to help a unit move… does that count?  
* Results page  
  * Looking at disability compensation, housing grant  
  * Assumes they are sorted by important  
  * National cemetery burial is appearing twice… *(is this a bug with the new benefit that was added for guard/reserves? In theory, I think only one of them should display.)*  
    * Likes that one of them specifics guard/reserves  
  * Still unsure if he qualifies for certain things since he was in the *guard* for 20+ years… as opposed to active duty.  
  * Has never heard of VA Life  
  * VetSuccess doesn’t apply since he already finished school
