## Research Goals

This research supports Veterans and Transitioning Service Members (TSMs) during a critical phase of their journey - the transition from active military service to civilian life. The transition period represents a complex time when service members must navigate numerous benefits, deadlines, and administrative tasks while adapting to civilian life.

**Guiding Questions:**

- How can we support TSMs' organizational needs during transition to reduce stress and improve outcomes?
- What tools and support do TSMs need to effectively discover and apply for benefits they're eligible for?
- How can we improve the current product to better serve TSMs' unmet needs?

**Research Goals:**

- Understand how to support TSMs' need to keep track of their transition progress/deadlines/tasks/to do list to reduce stress, minimize the possibility of missing deadlines, and improve transition outcomes
- Understand how to improve the tool to address TSMs' unmet needs of support to take action and get help
- Usability testing of the product in staging

## Research Questions

* How do TSMs currently organize and track their transition progress and deadlines?
* What are the pain points in the current Discover Your Benefits tool that prevent effective benefit discovery and application?
* How do goals selected in the questionnaire relate to benefits participants actually explore?
* What support do TSMs need to take action on benefits they discover?
* How do TSMs prefer to save and return to their benefit results?

## Methodology

This was a mixed-methods study combining generative research with usability testing to understand both current TSM needs and evaluate the existing product.

- **Generative Research:** In-depth interviews to understand transition organizational strategies and unmet needs
- **Usability Testing:** Task-based testing of the Discover Your Benefits tool in staging environment
- **Mixed Methods Analysis:** Quantitative coding of behaviors and qualitative analysis of feedback

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **TSMs need support organizing transition tasks and processes throughout transition to ensure they can quickly and easily apply for VA benefits as soon as they are eligible for them:** **True**
  - While TSMs use various organizational strategies, most rely on the existing TAP checklist as their source of truth. Having any organized strategy (rather than any specific strategy) correlates with easier transitions. Our product needs to support multiple styles of organization, accessibility needs, and technological fluency. 

- **Usability pain points, especially on the results page, are making the tool less effective supporting TSMs:** **True**
  - We discovered pain points with filters, sorting of results, saving the URL, and an alert banner that makes it hard to read important information underneath it.

- **There is a strong relationship between the goals users choose in the questionnaire and the benefits they explore via the results page:** **Likely False**
  - There was surprisingly little relationship between goals participants selected and benefits they actually explored. 21 of 28 participants chose "Understand my benefits" suggesting they want broad results rather than filtered ones. Participants who chose specific goals often ended up exploring unrelated benefits.

- **Some users need more help discovering and applying for benefits than the tool provides:** **True**
  - Participants consistently requested easier access to human support and clearer pathways for getting help with benefits questions beyond technical support.

## Key Findings

**1.** There is surprisingly little relationship between the goals participants chose and the benefits they explored. Participants are not seeing or using filters in their current form, with only 25% organically interacting with filters.

**2.** Participants want to return to results to apply for benefits, but 68% thought they would have to retake the questionnaire to see results again. The current "save link" option isn't visible, effective, or well understood.

**3.** TSMs use diverse organizational strategies during transition (digital first, hybrid paper/digital, paper first, and no organized strategy), but having any proactive strategy correlates with easier transition experiences.

**4.** The Discover Your Benefits tool fills a critical gap in VA benefits information shared during TAP and is especially valuable to National Guard and Reserves TSMs who receive less transition support.

**5.** Content friction points create barriers: the length of service question topping out at 3 years confused long-serving Veterans, and displaying disability compensation to Veterans who already have ratings undermines personalization.

**6.** Participants want easy access to knowledgeable human support for benefits questions (not just technical support), with strong preferences for phone contact and suggestions for chatbot-to-human escalation.

**7.** All participants found the tool valuable and would recommend it to others, with quotes like "If I would have had this as a transitioning member, I would have had less doubt of transitioning."

**9.** Key transition knowledge gaps exist across all participant groups, with critical information needs around timing of benefit applications, medical documentation requirements, and understanding of available support resources.

## Details of Findings

**Finding 1: Goals and Benefits Disconnect**

Despite careful goal selection, participants explored benefits based on curiosity, page position, or broad information-seeking rather than their selected goals.

- _Supporting data: "21 of 28 participants chose 'Understand my benefits' as a goal, suggesting that they want to see a broad list of results"_
- _Supporting data: "Most participants weren't afraid to click and explore, and often clicked on benefits out of curiosity, or it being listed high on the page, rather than a benefit being what they already knew they wanted"_

**Finding 2: Save Functionality Invisible**

The current method for saving results is not meeting user needs or expectations.

- _Supporting data: "19 participants (68%) thought they would have to retake the questionnaire to see their results again"_
- _Supporting data: "Only 7 participants, about 25%, noticed the link to save results"_
- _Supporting data: "[To save results] I would prefer 'send me text' 'send me email' 'save it to MyVA' and select as many of them as I wanted... The more places it comes to me, the more opportunities to get back into it" (P25)_
- _Supporting data: "A significant and recurring need was the ability to save their results from the questionnaire [P4, P5, P6, P7, P8, P10, P12, P14, P15, P16, P18, P19, P20, P23, P24, P28, P30, P35, P36, P37, P38]"_
- _Supporting data: "Emailing the results (either a link or a PDF) [P2, P4, P10, P12, P14, P15, P18, P19, P20, P23, P24, P28, P35] was a highly preferred method for easy reference and sharing"_

**Finding 3: Diverse Organizational Styles**

TSMs employ various strategies for managing transition, and success correlates with having any organized approach.

- _Supporting data:
- Having a hands on, proactive management style during transition is highly correlated with having an easy to somewhat easy transition experience
- While digital first participants were most likely to have an easier transition, what matters most is that participants had an organizational strategy, whether paper first, digital first, or hybrid
- The majority use the checklist they receive in TAP as the source of truth for transition tasks
- A majority of participants, but not all, get guidance on transition management from trusted friends and mentors in addition to official support
- A little more than half worked with VSOs during transition, which did not correlate with ease or difficulty of transition experience
Many participants get support and information on transition on social media, including LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, and Reddit


**Finding 4: Product Value and Gap-Filling**

The tool addresses unmet needs in current transition support systems.

- _Supporting data: "If I would have had this as a transitioning member, I would have had less doubt of transitioning [instead of] having to ask a bunch of people. It's pretty much, everything's right in front of me." (P14)_
- _Supporting data: "I think something like this would be great for the instructors of DoD TAP to initially show transitioning service members during like the VA Workshop days, because we didn't do this." (P15)_

**Finding 5: Content and Personalization Issues**

Specific form elements and result displays create friction and confusion.

- _Supporting data: "3 participants who served 15-20+ years felt confused and annoyed by seeing length of service options top out at 3 years"_
- _Supporting data: "Several participants were confused that Disability compensation was listed as the first benefit on the results page because they already have it"_

**Finding 6: Support and Help Needs**

Participants need clearer pathways to human assistance for benefits questions.

- _Supporting data: "Participants wanted to have an easy way to get help from someone knowledgeable about benefits (vs tech support)"_
- _Supporting data: "Several looked for a help phone number on the page and were disappointed they didn't find it"_

**Finding 7: Special Value for Guard/Reserves**

National Guard and Reserve members face unique transition challenges that the tool helps address.

- _Supporting data: "Compared to Active Duty only TSMs and Veterans, National Guard and Reserves members are: More likely to have had a somewhat difficult to very difficult transition experience, Less likely to have gone through TAP, Less likely to have received support from their unit during transition"_
- _Supporting data: "Service members from National Guard and Reserve units often receive 'very little support' and feel 'thrown to the wolves' compared to active-duty counterparts, highlighting a significant variability in transition support across branches and units [P4, P12, P22, P24, P37, P38]"_

**Finding 8: Strong Desire for Authenticated Integration**

Participants expressed overwhelming support for integrating the tool with their authenticated VA experience.

- _Supporting data: "Many participants indicated a strong desire for the tool to be linked to their VA account or profile, believing it would significantly enhance personalization and ease of use [P4, P5, P6, P10, P14, P15, P16, P17, P19, P20, P23, P28, P30, P35, P36, P37, P38]"_
- _Supporting data: "Several participants explicitly stated that if they were logged in, they would expect the tool to automatically pull their existing VA data to tailor benefit results [P5, P6, P10, P14, P16, P17, P20, P23, P28, P30, P35, P36, P37, P38]"_
- _Supporting data: "They wanted the tool to screen out benefits that don't apply to them based on their personal disability ratings, service history, or other qualifications already on file [P5, P10, P16, P20, P28, P35]"_
**Finding 9: Critical Transition Knowledge Gaps**

Participants across all groups identified significant knowledge gaps that hindered their transition success, particularly around timing, documentation, and benefit awareness.

- _Supporting data: "Many service members 'don't know what they don't know' and will not seek out benefits if they are unaware of their existence [P5, P6, P22]"_
- _Supporting data: "Wished he had known about the disability claim process and how to document medical issues, as his military records were 'thin vs reality of what issues would crop up later' (P4)"_
- _Supporting data: "Wished he had known how much self-direction was required, as he expected a 'safety net and guided process' that was absent (P5, P19)"_
- _Supporting data: "VA resources and benefits are often 'not sufficiently promoted' and veterans feel they 'have to go seek the information' rather than receiving proactive outreach [P8, P30, P38]"_
- _Supporting data: "Time sensitive benefits need to be explicitly highlighted and prioritized, with clear explanations of application timelines (e.g., 'must do while in uniform') [P4, P15, P16, P20, P28, P35]"_

---

## **Additional Insights**

**Filter Usage Patterns:** Only 7 of 28 participants interacted with the filter section, and many missed the "see all results" link which blends into the filter list.

**Results Page Expectations:** Participants expected benefits to be sorted by personalized relevance or time sensitivity rather than alphabetically, with 15 participants noticing time-sensitive tags but expecting those items at the top of the list.

**MyVA Integration Desire:** Multiple participants expressed wanting to see their results integrated with their MyVA dashboard for a unified experience.

**Authenticated Experience Expectations:** Participants envisioned a dashboard-like experience within their VA account showing relevant information at a glance, such as time left on a benefit (e.g., GI Bill), disability rating with dependents, or even benefits they haven't yet applied for but qualify for [P4, P5, P20]. This would address the feeling that "everything feels so siloed" and requires digging for information [P5].

**Transition Experience Patterns:** Analysis of detailed participant profiles reveals that transition difficulty correlates with organizational preparedness, support system availability, and timing of medical issues. Veterans and TSMs with proactive organizational strategies, strong unit support, and clear timelines consistently rated their transitions as easier (ratings of 1-2) compared to those experiencing disrupted processes, medical complications, or lack of guidance (ratings of 4-5).

**Critical Timing and Documentation Insights:** Participants consistently identified crucial timing-related knowledge gaps that impacted their transition success. Many wished they had known to start medical documentation "very early" [P5], with several participants noting that hiding medical issues during service to maintain job status complicated their disability rating process post-separation [P24]. The need for proactive medical documentation emerged as a critical theme, with participants wishing they had "gone to medical more during service for documentation purposes" [P11].

**Support System Variability:** Participants who helped others transition observed significant variations in support quality, noting that younger service members are particularly "lost in the sauce" and lack life experience to navigate complex processes [P3, P12, P13]. The competence of assigned staff emerged as critically important, with participants preferring to learn from those who had "actually went through the process" rather than those "just reading off slides" [P5].

**Information Overload vs. Personalization:** While participants received extensive information (described as "7 stacks of paperwork" [P37]), they struggled with prioritization and relevance. Multiple participants requested ranking systems or customization based on individual circumstances such as age, injuries, or career goals, rather than "one-size-fits-all" approaches [P3, P15, P16, P17, P20, P28, P35].

**Spouse and Family Support Gaps:** A notable gap emerged around support for military spouses during transition, with participants noting spouses' struggles to find their post-military identity and adapt to civilian life [P20]. This represents an underserved population that could benefit from dedicated resources and support.

## Recommendations

1. **Redesign Goals and Filtering Approach:** Consider moving from having goals in the questionnaire to having enhanced filters on the results page
   - _Supporting evidence: Weak relationship between selected goals and explored benefits; participants want broad results_

2. **Improve Save Functionality:** Short term: Make the "save link" button more visible and add an email option. Long term: Pursue authentication integration with MyVA
   - _Supporting evidence: 68% thought they'd need to retake questionnaire; multiple save method preferences expressed; strong desire for integration with authenticated VA experience_

3. **Support Multiple Organizational Styles:** Provide multiple ways to save and review benefits (email, print, SMS, PDF export) to accommodate different transition management approaches
   - _Supporting evidence: TSMs use diverse organizational strategies; any organized approach correlates with success_

4. **Address Content Friction Points:** Revisit length of service question options and how disability compensation is displayed to Veterans with existing ratings
   - _Supporting evidence: Long-serving Veterans confused by 3-year maximum; existing rating holders confused by disability compensation recommendations_

5. **Enhance Help and Support Access:** Short term: Make existing help resources more visible. Long term: Explore integration with AskVA
   - _Supporting evidence: Strong preference for human support; requests for prominent phone numbers and chat functionality_

6. **Maintain Unauthenticated Access:** Preserve the unauthenticated tool option while developing authenticated features
   - _Supporting evidence: Tool valuable for Veterans without existing VA relationships; concerns about making unwanted account changes_

7. **Develop Authenticated Integration Roadmap:** Long term, prioritize integration with MyVA for personalized data pull, persistent results, and enhanced functionality
   - _Supporting evidence: Overwhelming sentiment for authentication integration; expectations for automated data integration and dashboard-like experience_

8. **Address Critical Knowledge Gaps Through Proactive Outreach:** Develop proactive communication strategies to inform TSMs about time-sensitive benefits, medical documentation requirements, and transition timelines
   - _Supporting evidence: Many participants didn't know what they didn't know; time-sensitive benefits need explicit highlighting; medical documentation should start "very early"_

9. **Create Transition-Stage Specific Resources:** Develop different information pathways for various transition stages and experience levels, including dedicated resources for newer veterans
   - _Supporting evidence: Participants requested "New Veteran Information" tabs; younger service members are "more lost in the sauce"; need for step-by-step processes_

## Product User and Business Outcomes

**Desired User Outcome:** TSMs can effectively discover relevant benefits, track their transition progress, and successfully apply for benefits they're eligible for with appropriate support.

- This research supports our desired user outcome by identifying specific barriers to benefit discovery and application, and providing clear pathways to address organizational and support needs during transition.

**Desired Business Outcome:** Increased benefit discovery rates, reduced support burden through improved self-service capabilities, and better transition outcomes leading to improved long-term Veteran well-being.

- This research supports our desired business outcome by showing the tool's effectiveness in filling TAP information gaps and providing actionable recommendations to improve user success rates while reducing the need for individual support interventions.

## Key Performance Indicators

**Benefit Discovery Rate:** This research supports measurement of this KPI by showing that participants value broad benefit exploration over filtered results, suggesting success metrics should focus on total benefits viewed rather than goal-specific matches.

**Application Completion Rate:** This research supports measurement of this KPI by identifying the critical importance of effective save/return functionality and support access in converting discovery to action.

**User Satisfaction and Recommendation Rate:** This research supports measurement of this KPI by demonstrating high user satisfaction (26 of 28 find it valuable) and strong recommendation intent, providing baseline metrics and improvement opportunities.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate (1-2 months):** Prototype enhanced filter designs for A/B testing; improve save button visibility and possibly add email option, address length of service question
- **Short-term (3-6 months):** Make help resources more prominent; ; begin authenticated integration planning
- **Long-term (6+ months):** Pursue MyVA authentication integration; explore AskVA integration; develop personalized dashboard features

## Further research needed

- **Usability testing with assistive technology users** to ensure accessibility 
- **Testing filter vs. goals approaches** to validate recommended design changes
- **Research with underrepresented groups** including Veterans with less than honorable discharges, shorter service lengths, and younger TSMs
- **Further research needed on transition knowledge delivery methods** to determine most effective ways to provide time-sensitive information and proactive benefit awareness
