## Research Goals
Our intended product will support Veterans at multiple stages of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). Benefits discovery will be helpful for Veterans at the “Getting out” stage as they engage with the VA and apply for first-time benefits. Our product may also help Veterans at the “Taking care of myself” and “Reinventing myself” stages of the journey. Veterans may need additional benefits years or decades after completing their service. We are aiming to help Veterans discover and apply for relevant benefits as their needs evolve.
The VA has offered previous tools to support transition and benefits discovery, including the Benefits Navigator and ExploreVA. However, the previous tools did not meaningfully differentiate benefit recommendations based on the user’s goals, circumstances, and/or service history. Our product will provide individualized, curated benefit recommendations to connect Veterans directly with the resources most applicable to them.
Our research goals were the following:
* Understand how our MVP can provide clear and consistent information about benefit discovery, application requirements, and the application process.
* Understand how benefit discovery fits into the larger universe of topics on a transitioning servicemember or Veteran’s mind.
* Learn more about the role that Commanding Officers (COs) play in a servicemember’s separation process.
 
## Research Questions
Our research questions were the following:
 
* The transition experience can be highly emotional for TSMs and RSVs. What can VA do to support?
* Who is the target audience for our MVP?
* If Veterans didn't receive much help or information from their COs during separation, where did they turn?
* With a multitude of benefits and types of benefits, what resources are Veterans most interested in accessing? And how should benefits be grouped? 

## Methodology 
We conducted semi-structured interviews for this research project. Since we are early in our project cycle, we were conducting generative research to understand pain points and inform MVP design ideas. We do not have an MVP prototype yet, so we did not conduct any sort of product testing during our interview process. Additionally, since we are developing new product features, we did not have participants do a contextual inquiry or task-based prompts on an existing product.
Due to the logistics of recruiting participants and the distributed geographical locations of our team members, we hosted our user interviews remotely over Zoom.
 
## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1.	Our hypothesis is that veterans need a solution that is easy to use, makes benefits clear and understandable, and provides emotional support during the process of connecting with the VA.

**Definitely True:** Our interviews revealed an ongoing need for a clear and human-centered benefit discovery process. Several interviewees described frustration and confusion when applying for benefits. Interviewees mentioned that the process felt impersonal and that they wish they had more support during the separation process. When examining the responses across interviews, our team realized that the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) class experience varies widely from person to person. Some Veterans and transitioning servicemembers received extensive information and support; others received very little information about benefits or resources to support them.

2.	Veterans will need a product that is informative and helpful with the benefit discovery process, accounting for a Veteran’s specific needs.

**Definitely True:** Personalization was one of the most prevalent themes across our interviews. Several participants expressed interest in a product that curates VA benefits based on the user’s service history, needs, and/or goals. Participants also expressed interest in learning more about federal, state, and local benefits that are specifically applicable to them.
 
## Key Findings 
1. Different participants had different preferences for viewing benefit information.
 
2. Many participants had pre-conceived notions about whether the VA will help them, whether they are eligible for benefits, or whether they “deserve” to receive benefits.
 
3. Participants sought benefits for a variety of reasons.
 
4. Most participants wanted the ability to ask for help while exploring or applying for benefits.
 
5. While participants did want information about “big” benefits like disability compensation and healthcare, many participants also wanted to learn about lesser-known benefits.
 
6. Participants wanted a system that helps them take action (e.g., starting a benefit application), not just provide information.
 
7. Participants wanted their existing service records and data to be automatically pulled in; that way, users do not need to enter information that is already on file.
 
 
## Details of Findings   
**Finding 1: Different participants had different preferences for viewing benefit information.**
 
Labels: AUD: Veterans, AUD: Service Members, DSP: Content presentation
 
When asked what outputs would be useful, our interviewees fell into two different categories. On one hand, five Veterans and one transitioning servicemember (6/17) expressed that they want to see all of the benefits available to them at once. From there, they can choose for themselves which benefits to explore. On the other hand, four Veterans and two transitioning servicemembers (6/17) expressed that they want a curated list of benefits based on their service history, eligibility, and/or goals. Since there is no consensus about how to present information, we recognize that allowing the user to choose their layout (seeing all benefits or seeing a curated list) may increase our product’s utility.
 
> _”I think you almost need both [a full list of all available benefits and a filtered list that is tailored to one's eligibility, needs, and goals].”_

> _”I would go with the filtered search first, but there is no filter available that is going to hit every possibility and I would like to see a list to see what is available and check them off myself. [For example,] the different scholarships that are available to service members and their spouses to see what is available.”_

> _”A module or URL or website attached to the VA portal [would be helpful]; it would have a list of different benefits. Have categories and within each, list the individual benefits. Healthcare in bold, education in bold, etc. Provide short description and have option to click into link for more details. Include points of contact, eligibility, explanation of process, what to do, timeline, etc. Start simple and increase as you go deeper into the options.”_ 
 


**Finding 2  : Many participants had pre-conceived notions about whether the VA will help them, whether they are eligible for benefits, or whether they “deserve” to receive benefits.**
 
Labels: AUD: Veterans, AUD: Service Members, DSP: Content presentation
 
Our interviewees discussed several barriers that discouraged them from exploring and applying for benefits. Five Veterans (5/13) mentioned that they had previously applied for benefits, but did not get them because they did not get sufficient VA support to submit a successful application. One Veteran even mentioned that the VA reduced her disability benefits because VA healthcare providers could not provide an adequate diagnosis for her condition. Additionally, three Veterans and one transitioning servicemember (4/17) said they did not think their conditions were dire enough to deserve VA benefits, even though they earned their benefits through honorable service. One Veteran and one transitioning servicemember (2/17) expressed the misconception that if they use their VA benefits, they are taking away from other Veterans’ benefits. We want to correct misconceptions and provide adequate support so Veterans and transitioning servicemembers can successfully apply for and receive their hard-earned benefits.
 
> _”I had a moral dilemma on using VA disability benefits. I’m certain I would rate and be able to take advantage of the disability from the VA. I know I could access those benefits, but it’s more of a ‘do I feel worthy of using those benefits?’ ”_

> _”I didn’t know I could get unemployment for 6 months. Your unemployment starts the day after you get out. It’s [a] benefit that you use or lose. I forgot how I found out.”_ 

 
**Finding 3: Participants sought benefits for a variety of reasons.**
 
Labels: AUD: Veterans, AUD: Service Members, VETJNY: Getting out Military, VETJNY: Starting up civilian life 

Participants cited several reasons for exploring and applying for benefits. Two Veterans (2/13) shared that saving money was a primary factor. Three Veterans (3/13) said that they are self-motivated and always seek new information when they have the chance. One Veteran mentioned that taking care of his family was his primary motivator. A Commanding Officer noted that sometimes transitioning servicemembers are leaving earlier than expected, often due to medical issues; in these cases, transitioning servicemembers are often seeking career-related benefits so they can find employment post-separation.
 
> _”Even in TAP, maybe splitting people up based on what [benefits] they want to focus on [would be helpful]. People had different things they were interested in.”_

> _”I am always looking for discounts. ‘If its free, it's for me’ is one of my models.”_ 



**Finding 4: Most participants wanted the ability to ask for help while exploring or applying for benefits.**
 
Labels: AUD: Veterans, AUD: Service Members, SFTW: Chatbot, SFTW: Live Agent

Several participants indicated the need for some support, whether it is a live agent chatting online, a chatbot, or a referral to an in-person help center. Six Veterans and one transitioning servicemember (7/17) said that they would want someone to help them walk through the benefits discovery and application process. Five Veterans (5/13) expressed the need for personalized support; beyond help with understanding benefits in general, they wanted help finding benefits that support their individual goals. Additionally, five Veterans (5/13) mentioned that they would want personalized suggestions about relevant benefits, since they may not know every option that is available.
 
> _”I wish they would have had someone from the VA to help navigate or someone to advocate and show you how to fill out your profile because guys like me are uneasy about [applying for benefits] because we are afraid they won't believe us. There’s a VA by my house, I wish if you came in for your first time and they said, lets fill this out together and they can help navigate everything, because I feel like my friends had to hire lawyers to help.”_

> _”I wish [the VA] could have someone on standby to help out. Either an employee or fellow Veteran. It would be beneficial for those filing a claim.”_
 


**Finding 5: While participants did want information about “big” benefits like disability compensation and healthcare, many participants also wanted to learn about lesser-known benefits.**
 
Labels: AUD: Veterans, AUD: Service Members, DSP: Content presentation

The VA website organizes resources around a set of large categories (e.g., housing assistance, disability, education, etc.). Some “smaller” benefits also have significant impacts on Veterans and transitioning servicemembers’ lives. Participants mentioned that travel reimbursement, retiree ID cards, burial planning, mental health services, property tax breaks, and national park passes were important benefits. Several participants also mentioned state and local benefits, including state park passes and special license plates/placards for disability parking spaces.
 
> _”I felt like I was out there [trying to figure out benefits by myself], and I just Googled, like, “How do I get a retiree ID card?” I think I still Googled, ‘What are the benefits for 100% disabled Veterans?’ ”_

> _”What I envisioned, like when I deployed, there’s a big building and there was a table, like medical, one office for your ID, room B for travel [benefits], [so you can learn about] all these separate things.” _
 


**Finding 6: Participants wanted a system that helps them take action (e.g., starting a benefit application), not just provide information.**
 
Labels: AUD: Veterans, AUD: Service Members, DSP: Benefit applications

Transition and benefit discovery can be difficult processes, so an effective solution will need to help Veterans and transitioning servicemembers take steps in the right direction. Nine Veterans and two transitioning servicemembers (11/17) expressed that their separation period was stressful. Six Veterans (6/13) spoke specifically about the disability claim process, saying it was daunting and discouraging. Three Veterans and one transitioning servicemember (4/17) noted that because the disability claim process has so many appointments and steps, someone could easily miss a key step and not realize it. We also interviewed three Commanding Officers who are very supportive of their troops. However, not all transitioning servicemembers are so supported; one Veteran and two transitioning servicemembers expressed that their Commanding Officers were not helpful during their separation periods    .
 
> _”There were a few moments I was discouraged to file [my disability claim] because it was so tedious. [The claim process] wasn’t something I was used to and difficult to learn.”_
> _”I was stationed in [redacted] and things were lost in translation there. So many people come and go [from that base], and it was stressful to get out of there. [The separation process] was a lot of things to check off the list.”_

 

**Finding 7: Participants wanted their existing service records and data to be automatically pulled in; that way, users do not need to enter information that is already on file.**
 
Labels: AUD: Veterans, AUD: Service Members, DSP: Signed out vs. signed in

Four Veterans and one transitioning servicemember (5/17) mentioned that they would like to have their existing data connected to their benefits recommendations. One transitioning servicemember said that the need for multiple logins and data sources seems “fragmented. I think it is done on purpose.” While this is not an accurate portrayal of the VA’s motives, the transitioning servicemember’s comments surface the real perception that the VA is purposely making benefits unattainable. Several VA subject matter experts described ongoing efforts to align systems and existing records; while challenging, this is a key priority for VA staff.
 
> _”One thing is that one has so many ways to log in. Why don’t we make a CAC [Common Access Card], where it has one number that has access to everything. You have to remember so many different passwords.”_
> _”I noticed you have multiple areas [of the VA website] to sign in. I should only have one login instead of multiple websites, like, if I wanted to refill my prescriptions.”_ 
 

## Additional Insights
* Reservists and National Guard members may have different transition and benefit discovery experiences than those separating from active duty. Reservists did not necessarily receive comprehensive information about VA benefit eligibility through TAP or other sources. For example, one transitioning servicemember said going into the Reserves was “a tough adjustment and [when I separated,] there was never anyone saying, ‘Hey, there are VA benefits for you, take a look’.” Another transitioning servicemember said “in the Reserves, sometimes I feel like that information [about VA benefits] isn’t there and we are only one weekend a month.”
Because VA benefit information was not consistently shared with our Reservist participants, some participants expressed misconceptions that Reservists do not qualify for benefits or should not use them:

> _”[Learning about benefits] is a little tricky because I was a Reservist. It even changes the type of Veteran status you receive.”_

> _”My whole time is in the Reserves, and I feel guilty taking any [benefits].”_ 

* TAP experiences vary significantly from person to person. Some participants found that TAP classes were helpful and answered their questions. Others felt that TAP was either overwhelming or did not help them prepare for life after military separation. Participants reported varying modes of engagement and content depth.

> _”I think [TAP] was a briefing, but it felt more like a check-off process. I don’t remember a formal class.”_

> _”I think that TAP session wasn’t going to be helpful for what you needed. They mainly focused on the ins and outs of the disability process and had a few people from the DOL. They didn’t do a good job of what you were eligible for and what you could transfer or not.”_ 

> _”[The TAP class was] mostly helpful. The TAP itself was pretty good.”_

> _”[My TAP instructor talked] about VA benefits, VA resumes, skills, things available to Veterans, entrepreneurship, special skills, learning that…and one thing I wished they brought up was that the GI Bill expires.”_

 
## Recommendations 
* Recommendation 1: Our MVP should have multiple ways of viewing information to meet diverse user needs.

* Recommendation 2: Our MVP needs to address misconceptions about the utility of VA benefits, eligibility, and worthiness. Veterans have earned their benefits and our MVP should help them feel deserving and worthy. 

* Recommendation 3: Our MVP needs to account for the various reasons that Veterans seek benefits.

* Recommendation 4: Our MVP should mimic the experience of someone helping the user and/or connect the user to someone who can help (a live agent, chatbot, in-person help, etc.).

* Recommendation 5: Our MVP needs to highlight lesser-known benefits (e.g., travel reimbursement) alongside “more popular” benefits like health care or education.

* Recommendation 6: Our MVP needs to help users take action instead of simply presenting information.

* Recommendation 7: Our MVP should pull in a servicemember’s existing data, as much as possible.

 
 
## Next Steps
We will use the findings to inform the design and development of a user-centered benefit discovery tool. We are currently discussing what features will be included.
 
 
## Further research needed
Once we create a working prototype, we will conduct user testing with a representative sample of Veterans, transitioning servicemembers, and potentially other audiences (e.g., caregivers or family members of Veterans). We will include Assistive Technology users along with members of other marginalized Veteran groups.

## Tools used for Synthesis
We used Mural to synthesize the interview data. We pulled in exact quotes from our interviews, then created affinity groups to identify recurring themes and subthemes. To inform our design and development efforts, we then identified MVP recommendations that aligned with each major theme.
 
 
## Pages and applications used
We did not test any pages or applications for this round of research. Our interviews were exploratory; they were intended to inform the design features for our MVP. We will conduct user testing once we have designed and developed an MVP for our product.
 
 
## Other supporting documents created
Resulting from our research and conversations with VA staff, we created a [user flow with mockups]( https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1713813076932/fb96c908a14fd56320bca984add7b82b6aae8aed?sender=uba527cafb8ded20512886129) to inform our future design and development efforts.
 
 
## Secondary research
Before creating our plan for primary research, we conducted a secondary research review of previous VA efforts. We wanted to understand what lessons have already been learned and where our interviews could add value to the existing body of research.
[This Mural board]( https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1714756206406/cc193fa90af935839b8271661dbdfa1c21f2f69e?sender=u82df846ee309a69c4f0d1792) contains the findings from our secondary research review and the implications for our interviews.
 
 
## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**

We sought participants with specific characteristics to better understand the transition, benefit discovery, and benefit enrollment experiences. To understand the current landscape of transition support, we interviewed current servicemembers who plan to separate from the military within the next year. We also interviewed Veterans to understand the transition and benefits discovery experiences of previous servicemembers.

Before beginning interviews, we conducted a literature review of previous VA research. Our literature review revealed that Commanding Officers play a key role in a servicemember’s transition experience. Because of this impact, we also recruited some Commanding Officers to understand the challenges they face and the support they provide to transitioning servicemembers. We also met with VA stakeholders to understand current and previous initiatives that support benefit discovery.
 
We spoke with **27 participants** in total. 
Seven (7) of our participants were VA staff members that were not recruited by Perigean, so we do not have their demographic information. Except for “Audience segment,” the demographic information below only reflects the 20 participants recruited by Perigean, since those participants have available demographic information.
 
Audience segment:
* 13 Veterans
* 4 Transitioning Servicemembers
* 3 Commanding Officers
* 7 VA staff members who are stakeholders or subject matter experts. These staff members were not recruited by Perigean, so we do not have their demographic information. Some staff members who work on the same team participated in conversations together; there were 4 sessions with VA staff.
 
**Demographic information for the 20 Perigean-recruited participants**
 
Gender:
* Male: 13
* Female: 7
 
 
LGBTQ+:
* Unknown: 20
We were unable to request LGBTQ+ demographic information because we had a limited number of screening questions that Perigean could ask. We needed to ask several other questions to ensure participants met necessary criteria for our specific study (e.g., whether someone is separating from the military in the next year). However, we think it would be beneficial for future research to explore transition and benefit discovery experiences for LGTBQ+ Veterans and transitioning servicemembers.
 

Devices used during study: 
* Unknown: 20
Since our interviews were exploratory and we did not conduct any user testing, we did not collect information about the devices used by participants.
 
 
Age:
* 25-34: 9
* 35-44: 6
* 45-54: 2
* 55-64: 1
* 65+: 2
* Unknown: 0
 
 
Education:
* High school degree or equivalent: 1
* Some college (no degree): 0
* Associate's degree, trade certificate or vocational training: 1
* Bachelor's degree: 10
* Master's degree: 8
* Doctorate degree: 0
* Unknown: 0
 
 
Geographic location:
* Urban: 16
* Rural: 4
* Unknown: 0
 
 
Race:
* White: 12
* Black: 4
* Hispanic: 2
* Biracial: 0
* Asian: 0
* Native: 1
* Prefer not to answer: 1
 
 
Disability and Assistive Technology (AT):
* Unknown: 20
 Since our interviews were exploratory and we did not conduct any user testing, we did not collect information about the assistive technologies used by participants.
 
## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

This research does not include the perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups:
* LGBTQ+ Veterans
* Veterans with cognitive disabilities
* Veterans with an Other than honorable discharge
* Veterans who are also immigrants to the United States
* Expats who are living abroad, although the expected prevalence of expats in our sample is nearly zero. Based on the recruitment checker, current VA statistics estimate that 0.40% of Veterans are expats. In our sample of 20 participants who, the expected number of expats would be 0.08.

This research does include perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups, but they are underrepresented in our sample:
* Veterans who are 55 years old or older
* Veterans who live in rural areas
* Veterans who do not have any college degree

Because we are not testing any technology or websites yet, the prevalence of various Assistive Technology (AT) users is not relevant to this study. Similarly, the prevalence of mobile users is not relevant to the current study. We will conduct user testing once we have created a working prototype. For our future user testing, we will aim to recruit representative samples of AT and mobile users.
