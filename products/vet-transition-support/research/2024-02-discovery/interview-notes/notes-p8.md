Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I joined the military in 1976. I enjoy participating in projects like this because I see the progress. I have used a lot of the applications. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits?
  - What VA benefits have you used and why?

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *It was hard in the beginning and felt awkward. The good thing is that I got a job with the military after. The assistance I received when I retired doesn’t compare to when my son separated 4 years ago. The Air Force took care of him. They did a complete physical with him and mine was here and there and the VA compensation was wild. I don’t have all the medical records because they lost my first nine years. 
Everything was more modern, and people were more helpful. He was given more choices and things available to adapt to the outside compared to when I did it, it was more like, “bye-bye”. He was prepared and he’s getting 80% disability. I have 70% disability. I still have more stuff and I’m getting frustrated, and I don’t know how to get that. I don’t know if what I have is good enough. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? 
    - If so, what type of support?

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits? *When I first got out, I have access to the Vietnam-era VA, we had no internet and I traveled and it was a waste. I couldn’t transfer children or spouses like now. I got my degree, but I had to pay, and they didn’t help me. I have used the guaranteed home loan. That’s about it. 
For school, I didn’t get to use it. I had a counselor that told me I had the GI bill, then the medical but I moved to New Jersey and then they found more stuff. 
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)?
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier? *One stop shop. You send the link and I have all the choices. If I want to go to medical, I click here and so on. Like housing for Veterans, all the medicals in the folder. Different folders for each one but close together. You look for consistency instead of looking everywhere. 
-If the VA could make it easier to see what benefits are to you what would that look like to you? * I always get this email from the VA, it had so many things and then I just delete it because it’s too much. I think it would be beneficial if I could get a pamphlet. Every 6 months to a year and click here to know what you’re looking for. No pictures. Just tell me a link. 
What benefits you get when you travel, like a cruise or a park or leisure benefits, flights, rent a car, stuff like that. So many things to have grouped together. 
I would like to see everything at once so that you can see and choose. 
-Is there anything that keeps you from searching the internet or VA website to learn about benefits? * One thing is that one has so many ways to log in. Why don’t we make a CAC, where it has one number that has access to everything. You have to remember so many different passwords. 
-How did you learn about the military job when you were getting out? *It was a contracted job. Government contract job. They knew how to find me, I don’t know how they knew.
