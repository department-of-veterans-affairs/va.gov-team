Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I’m a Captain, I have 12 and half years now and I’m a company commander and I’m in the National guards, field artillery. From an officer perspective, being in charge of troops and influence training and troops' lives, I see what happens to with good company commanders and bad company commanders. It was a unique challenge being at the division headquarters. Not the ideal role but the people have made it joyful. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits?
  - What VA benefits have you used and why?

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? * I deal with people who are ETSing and retirement. Typically, it involves a letter to the commander, and we process that as a company and pass that information to the soldiers. We are usually at the company level or first point of questions. There is a lot of questions troops aren’t asking and we are telling them a bit. 
I don’t know if it's just the guard but there seems to be a lack of what is available or what the VA offers. I know there is a stigma, there are long lines, takes forever to get an appointment. I have a soldier who just retired after 30-something years and was forced out. He now works as a civilian aspect, and he refuses to go to the VA. I don’t know why. Seems like a lot of people don’t know or they are not familiar with that process. Or, people are about to get out and they are just starting the paperwork and they are so far back. You lose the attention of a soldier after talking to them for that long. 
-TAP? * Some of them do TAP and some of them don’t. I’ve done the sign-off process but some are just not doing it. I had a soldier who medically retired, helps others do the process. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? 
    - If so, what type of support?

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? *We go through a company commander and first Sergeant course, program here at our State. I think there is a gap for those who get the retirement letter as opposed to those who are just getting out. I think for whatever reason, information isn’t getting out to the soldiers, I don’t know why. I think that is sad. 
I wouldn’t say it’s a burden, it doesn’t impact us greatly. It’s more to make sure that a retirement award is put in, it almost feels like a transaction. Make sure the Army doesn’t owe you more or vice versa. We just don’t have the time to let the soldier know everything, we try and I know there are gaps. 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits? *I know a lot of them is more based on why they are getting out. Were they full-time, do they have another job lined up, are they guard, what do I need to do to sign up. For retirement, we usually try to work within a year or two and stack of papers of injuries. At least not, in the guard, not a lot of information there for them. 
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)?
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier? 
-How do you think you will maintain that continuity? *That comes down to funding per say. Maybe having a soldier or a Sharp rep and the go to school and get trained and they help soldiers during their ETS process. Functionally, you’d want to the that a Battalion level. It would come down to whatever level they would have access to soldiers. 
-Do you do anything like an exit interview? * It is. I get more access to those than others. Some of those soldiers that are under my command, they are not going to come down to a company commander to a company level. The ones that I do, I have access to the ones that come during the week. I do it informally not formally in exit interviews. 
-What has been your experience with the date of separation? *What I have seen, my understanding for someone that is retiring, they get a date that is really flexible in the Guard side unless they are coming up on a contract. 
Here is your thank you and we present them with their award and the Soldier for life box. 
-Is the DD214 handed to the soldier on their last day? In the Guard, we don’t get a DD214. I believe they get a 220 form. 
-Do you find it that soldiers that are getting out, have a contract end date? * Yes, they know.  But it depends on the reason they are getting out. 
I think they would, but the challenge would be how to get that information to the soldier. I have soldiers who never open their email.
