Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I served 23 years in the Air Force and retired 3, some years ago. It was smooth and easy because the resources were at the base I was in. It was during Covid, but you can still get in and see someone face to face. That was easy. Because I stayed here, there is a VA medical clinic nearby and that made it easy. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits? *I use Tricare as a retiree, but I do have both. 
  - What VA benefits have you used and why? * I did a little of education but not currently, I used get your burial plot, I have not done a Home loan. 


Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *I was used to change with all the moves of the military. I think it was, I focused on it and embraced it and being the VA as a landing point. That was never my plan. I did lean on the VA a lot more than I ever planned. I think it was helpful that the health and medical side of that was almost spoon-fed to me and it was in our community and went to the mental health services as well. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? * I think it was about Covid. My situation was goofy and I wanted to retire in my overseas location but couldn’t My move was less vulnerable purely for the needs of the Air Force and poorly expedited. 
    - If so, what type of support?

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? * Part of that was through the DOD transition system. I did pull up what are my benefits at a state level. A lot of it was a health aspect and what percentage you are. 
I went to the VA’s website repeatedly and went to the FAQ’s and finding the right tabs. But I also used social media like Reddit. It is very helpful. Those two were my primary. 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits? *My specific life was in the air. Pending divorce, custody thing, I didn’t really know where I wanted to be. This was 2020 and I was overseas for 11 years and I was in a base where I had zero contacts during Covid. I couldn’t do anything anyway. I could only do was, wanted financial trampoline to catch me just in case on what would happen or not happen, financially and then school. 
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)?
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier?
- Did you use any VA sources when getting out? * I went through a few of them. That was a Department of Labor person. From a VA perspective, I didn’t use those because I was not sure where my ex was stepping because I wanted to be near my kids. 
-Digital platform, what you think?  *It can be so overwhelming because there's so much under the VA. I guess the idea of tree of what am I interested in, benefits, employment, medical. I don’t even know what to ask for because I don’t know what is out there. 
-Anything you wished you would have had when transitioning? *I think I was lucky with my individual situation. Even with Covid, not knowing how long things will take. Everyone wants project management, give me something to look at and plan and then look at the next step. Having an understanding, helping on what can I work on now or how can I prepare for that instead of twiddling my thumbs. 
-Anything you wish the VA had? *No, just that we want more, we want the VA to have more people. For two years, I had no primary physician because there was no doctor. So, my prescriptions stopped.
