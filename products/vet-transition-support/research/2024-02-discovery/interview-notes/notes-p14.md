Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I graduated in 2016 and was commissioned as an officer, my military has been 8 years. My civilian job is I’m a Nurse practitioner. My separation date should be May 12. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits?
  - What VA benefits have you used and why?

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *My civilian job, I did get private insurance but I will lose Tricare and I’m saddened by that. My fiancé and I are looking into getting a home and I’m looking into those benefits. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? 
    - If so, what type of support? *I have not gotten any support. I’m learning through the loan through word of mouth. As for my Tricare, I’m not too sure at the moment. 

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? * I’ve been searching on my own. I have not looked much as insurance. I have been looking more in the VA loan on the website and talking to a few real estate agents on how to use the VA loan. I have just used the VA website. 
What are you looking for? *I feel like in the reserves, sometimes I feel like that information isn’t there and we are only one weekend a month but if there was a calculator and click and go with a bulletproof list to see what I’m eligible for. Maybe if there were a hyperlink. 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits?
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)? * I don’t know about anything else. No have not gone through the claims process. My whole time is in the Reserves, and I feel guilty taking any. If I were to initiate that process, I would start, I would go to VA disability claims, or ask friends in my unit. It would depend on the claim. Just talking to someone with more experience to help me with it. 
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier?
Reserves: *Yes, the same people that I report to. I told my Commander I want to ETS and got with the S1 to give me the packet. It is overwhelming and hard because I don’t know when exactly I’m getting out. They say two months, but it could be six months, you just don’t know. I don’t know what I don’t know. 
What do you wish people knew? * I think, I just don’t love how wishy-washy it is. I feel like the information should be readily available instead of one person telling me this information. I wish they could give me a packet but tell me what I’m still eligible for. I probably do other ones as well. I don’t feel like I’m disabled, but I’m interested on other things as well. 
How are you balancing the transitions of getting out? *It was hard because in my unit I was in a leadership role because it’s more than just one weekend a month. I don’t even know what benefits to look at. 
The army paid for my undergrad when I was in ROTC.  Any more money I borrow, I have to add more time. I didn’t use the Army to pay for my grad school, because I didn’t want to add more time. 
Have you explored healthcare through the VA? No.
