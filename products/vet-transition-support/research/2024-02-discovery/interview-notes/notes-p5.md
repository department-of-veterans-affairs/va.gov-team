Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I have served in the Army, reserves, National Reserves and now State Guard. Now I’m an Emergency State manager for the Texas Guard. All in all in for served for 30 years. I age out at 70 for the State guard. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits?
  - What VA benefits have you used and why?
- Transition process? *I did, I went through a full ETS process. I was a bonus going into the Reserves if I transferred my skills and was there for 8-10 years and then transitioned to the National Guard. 
- In 1989, I left the regular Army to be a police officer but stayed as  a Reserves. When I went into the reserves/National Guard, I never got a DD214. I have never used VA services. The only thing I have done is request a VA ID card. But they couldn’t find me. 
- Why don’t you use VA services? *All of the civilian jobs I have had their own insurance. And I would like to keep the VA services for those who need it. Also, seeing my dad use VA services was horrendous. 
-Is there anything convincing to make you use the VA services? * If the VA was more proactive in contacting service members who have separated. Calling to see how they can help us and who see that we are not using their services. 
I take it back, I have used the VA home loan program. Maybe something in their system to see that I have not used other VA benefits. 
-What made the process easy when using your VA home loan? * My realtor and Lender were able to see everything through my DD214.

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *The State guard is a little different and we belong to the Texas military department. The only difference is I don’t get paid by the State Guard. I’m paid by the State as a state employee unless I’m on active duty for at least 3 months, then I’m offered. 
I was coming from Korea back to the States. I was about 6 months before starting the police academy. I joined the army when I was 17 years old. I had done nothing else before civilian life. The police department gave me that structure back and we tend to base our life based on what are job is. That is why I went back to the Reserves, but that was a tough adjustment and there was never anyone saying, “ hey there are VA benefits for you, take a look”. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? * The army didn’t do a good job of understanding PTSD and how to treat those. It was a horrible stigma, but no one ever asked. 
-Where did find support for PTSD? *It was 20 years later after I left the police department and was treated for a while for it. It was a combination of my wife telling me and I had civilian insurance that would pay for it. 
    - If so, what type of support?

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits?
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)?
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier? *When I left active duty, it would of been the VA standing there. It would have been helpful to have a member of the VA standing there to help you and let's check your hearing, are you having pain anywhere, it’s all of those things. Let me help you, and here are our services, even if you don’t have any, here is our services. To now, folks like me, I think you’re doing a much better job, but I can’t talk about what the process is now, but I know my guys know the process better now. The biggest problem I see now with the VA is that you're so underwater to treat the guys that need it and it’ will take 6-8 months to get out for some of these guys because of underfunding and understaffing. 
When you have people like me, I would have never contacted the VA unless I needed something. When you need the support the most and you don’t get it. 
-How would that platform work for you? * It’s hard to quantify that. There are plenty of places for Veterans go but not every Veteran will use the same. There’s a lot that I don’t know about because my experience was difficult in the beginning. But media and news would be a good idea to explore VA benefits. I worked in government for a long time and there is also a lot of lazy people just collecting a paycheck. 
-Easier way for you to access benefits? * Even when I did apply and got denied, there doesn’t seem to be an advocate. I still hear nightmares from them who just left and it should have been automatic for them. The VA should have said here is what is available to you and still a nightmare for them.
