Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I served 8 years, I was a patient admin specialist. I got out in 2006, traveled all over the world, and was all in. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits?
  - What VA benefits have you used and why?

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *It was nerve-breaking because you are leaving a life that you don’t know and it was scary to go into a life that you don’t know. I was nervous.
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military?  *I think it was a briefing, but it felt more like a check-off process. I don’t remember a formal class. 
    - If so, what type of support? *I wished there was an office like  Department of Labor office where you could, get help. Like a special disability office or Vet center. It was a quick sign-out and make sure your stuff cleared. It would have been nice to have a one-stop shop to do these things. It would have been nice to have a workshop. Last summer, I went to a big job fair in a convention center and get different information on what benefits you were eligible for. That was nice, I had already done my leg work, but it was nice to see that. There were two floors of people telling you what you were eligible for. 

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? *It was a combination of online and word of mouth. My first thought was how to sign up for benefits for healthcare. Go here and go there and you can go do that. I didn’t know I could get unemployment for 6 months. Your unemployment starts the day after you get out. It’s benefits that you use or lose. I forgot how I found out. Then I applied for health care and VA hospital, disability. Just heard other Veterans about it then, went to the regional office and signed up for it. There has been a lot of improvement, but unfortunately, I had to learn on my own. 
Even more recently, I just got my 100% after years and years of filing, and even then, I asked, “What do I do now”. I felt like I was out there, and I just googled. Like, how do I get a retiree ID card? I think I still googled, what are the benefits for 100% disabled Veterans. 
I think I found a booklet online that lists the benefits. You still have to piece the papers together or ask friends who are in a similar process. 
Maybe having an office for older Veterans to help navigate different things. Younger Veterans don’t struggle, but what about older Veterans, they need help too. 
What I envisioned, like when I deployed. There’s a big building and there was a table, like medical, one office for your ID, room B for space A travel, just to have a different office for all these separate things. 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits?
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)?
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier?
-What was the process like to get 100% ?* It was a long process. It was from 2006 until now. It was a daunting process. I had to also take a break. I paid out of pocket to get x-rays and physicals. I was already at 60%. Mine was an increase. Once, I started getting help from a Vet center, maybe twice because I didn’t know what or where to file. I went to the Department of Labor and they helped me fill out forms, on how to file for federal jobs, and there was a guy who would go through your record and tell you how to file and what to file. 
If you claim 5 things, they will send you 5 different letters on where to go. It’s a long process. I also worked full-time. I didn’t go back online until COVID, because I worked from home and had more time. Also, doctors had virtual appointments that was also helpful. 
I think that is one of the things you need to do when you’re getting out is to file, “intent to file” especially because almost everyone files for disability. 
-Is there a process to see where you are at in the process?  *Yes, that’s part of the process. I have a VA app where you can see where your claim is. I forgot where I found out about the app. 
-Would it have been helpful to have that auto-filled? Absolutely. It would have been great to have a pre-fill or a template. I free formed that and started writing. 
It took about 4-5 months until I got my final rating. I was watching TV and scrolling. I was sitting there and going through the app and saw that is was at 100% because the letter they send doesn’t get here until a week later. Once they approve it, the back pay is immediately paid. 
People need to think of VA healthcare and disability as two separate things. They are not the same. 
I love the MyhealtheVet app if the VA was something like that, like a checklist, and you could click something on how to do it, well, I guess it’s already there but from the very beginning, if there was something there to do.
