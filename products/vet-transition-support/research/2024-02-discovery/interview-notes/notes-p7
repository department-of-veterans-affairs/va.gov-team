Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? * I currently have about 25 years in the military. After about 2006, I got out and was out for 6 months and I missed being in the military, and then they said I could do a Drill Sergeant in the Reserves in the Army. I went to Civil Army Affairs and working on staff and working with people in Syria. Currently getting ready to deploy again. I’m more of a planner now. I had a few injuries, I was paralyzed for two hours and didn’t know why. 
For a long time, I couldn’t bend my finger all the way. It felt like it was dislocated for like 6 months without me even knowing. I’m afraid to go to the VA because sometimes if I have a friend to go, they will say, its’ not combat-related, or service-related and I’m afraid if it’s not service-related, I may not get treated for it. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits? * I do everything online like the burn pit registry but every time I told anyone, My back hurts, tingling down and it’s been getting worse, I’m afraid I’ll get paralyzed for real and they don’t document it. I’m afraid that the medical system we used, especially for Reserves and I’m afraid I won't get anything. 
  - What VA benefits have you used and why?

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *I drove to Atlanta and I came home. When I was mobilized for three years, it was three days and we were done. In 2020, I was one of the first soldiers deployed during Covid. When we got there, there was caution tape around us and felt like a prison camp, we got swabbed, every couple days we got tested and kept going on and on and then we couldn’t walk anywhere just go to PT and order food. You go through a process if you have a job or not and most of do, you have to go to classes like if you’re active duty. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? 
    - If so, what type of support?

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? * They have traditional readiness. Like the Burn Pit registry and when we went to the hospital, we went through a program like if we had seen dead bodies. I must have been okay because they didn’t flag me. They didn’t have anyone there, like I didn’t see a dentist, they didn’t ask about my back. I wish they would have had someone from the VA to help navigate or someone to advocate and show you how to fill out your profile because guys like me are uneasy about it because we are afraid they won't believe us. There’s a VA by my house, I wish if you came in for your first time and they said, lets fill this out together and they can help navigate everything, because I feel like my friends had to hire lawyers to help. 

- How was your experience with learning about benefits?
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)? *If there was a liaison for first-time users, as long as someone teaches you how to do it. For instance, they greet you at the door, and if it’s your first time, they set you up, even if it’s an appointment. But at least you have a one-on-one person to talk to. 
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier? *Having someone from the VA to coordinate with every Reserve center and if someone is getting out or close to retirement, they can go in there and start the process. Also, if someone can coach someone like me to coach me on how to say things so that someone can understand. 
-Any other sources that you learned about benefits? * I don’t know the first place to go. They sent me the link to fill out. No one has ever gone over it. We are thinking of buying another house, but she doesn’t know the first thing. I don’t remember the process from the first home I bought, 20 years ago. She wants to use the GI bill and I have mine already. She’s trying to figure it out.
