Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I was in the Marine Corps for 30 years. I was a Pilot for most of the time. Enjoyed myself and during that time I got married and had 3 children. I separated in 2009. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits? *Really how to rely on the folks during the transition process and you get steered on the way they want you to go. Which was okay but you don’t really learn about the VA itself. It would have been beneficial if someone from the VA was there in the class to give you a good spin on things. About what the VA was. 
I’ll never forget about the Tinnitus. There were certain things they focused on and then it gets back to one individual giving a presentation as opposed to a group of folks. 

-TAP services? *At the time I was going through, the VA had a horrible presentation. You had to get a physical and you had to do it at multiple locations. Not hard to get to but the first time I was shocked, like parking, it was a challenge. It would have been nice to get a little more information. Like what you did or what you were involved in and what you experienced. Between burn pits and contaminated water, all came out well after I transitioned. I just realized I was exposed to that. If we spent more time talking about injuries, in combat or non-combat.  
I read this in the paper, I registered for all the ones that I happen to be involved with. 

  - What VA benefits have you used and why? Home loan, and disability benefits. Between the home loan and GI was the best. The home loan was well discussed. From fellow members, and word of mouth. It went smoothly. 

-If there was a way the VA could help Veterans like yourself, what would that look like to you? Any website I go to, it’s overwhelming, is frustrating to me. It should be intuitive and should be able to go in there and put your profile in and hit submit so, you don’t have to pick apart each one and have it provided to you. I think you look for what benefits you’re entitled to and have them in a list and keep track. You need to be pushed this information. 

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *It was daunting to a certain degree. It was bittersweet, happy, and sad at the same time and not immediately start a new job. It was okay, not great. I moved 3k miles when I got out. 
-What would like to see during your transition? *I think what would have been helpful was to bring guest speakers to talk about it or have done it, would have been helpful. The experts didn’t relate to the service members in the audience. 
No one talks about when you’re 65. There’s a lot that happens because what the military does is significant. You go from Tricare prime to Tricare for life. I felt unprepared. If you’re getting your care at a military facility, you kind of get kicked out because you’re eligible for Medicare and you have to pay for it. Sometimes they take Medicare and sometimes they don’t. Lots of changes. 
Taking off your uniform, things that you were used to in the military are not going to be replicated in the civilian world. Moving 3k miles, I looked at it as we were going to start new. We tried to look at it as a new adventure and keep it in that kind of mindset. But it didn’t happen as quick as I’d like. It took a while. 
I didn’t utilize the program, the focus was on networking and kept in touch with friends. By moving it made it more difficult. Folks who stay in the area, is easier for them. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? 
    - If so, what type of support?

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits?
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)?
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier?
* At that time, I was not aware of the benefits. I would of taken advantage of anything beneficial had I known. 
-How would you like the VA to be involved? *From the perspective of the VA, being more part of the pact. Start a person-to-person contact and talk to people. I always would believe if the VA had a roadshow team and talk about the transition and benefits, again, that personal experience rather than reading something on a website. 
-Do you think digital resources would be helpful? *I don’t think I would click on the videos, and you can’t ask questions.
