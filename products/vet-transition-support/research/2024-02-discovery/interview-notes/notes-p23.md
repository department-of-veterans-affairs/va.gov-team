Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I joined the Air Force in 2013 went to basic and then I was put into combat control for 2 years to be an Air Force controller for. Did that for 11 years. I just separated in Pope Airfield in North Carolina. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits?
  - What VA benefits have you used and why?

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *Separation date, going back six months: I took advantage of skill-bridge which allows service members to transition out of the military 6 months early and it allows you to get your feet wet, get an internship and I started to transition out about 10 months before my separation date. We are required to do the separation that Army individuals do as well which makes it a little more lengthy, online courses, and took advantage of a few other programs. 
Reached out to a lot of friends and teammates that have already transitioned out. Things that helped me out, I did that on my own through the VA portal without any help. A VSO, that really helps you, but I let that fall through the cracks. I reached out to the same VSO that my friend used and that helped ease my mind when separating. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? *I think the website was straightforward. I was impressed with how quickly it went and how easy it was to upload the papers. Something I was nervous about was how easy the appointments would go. Thinking back to my first appointment, the doctor asked me to move my shoulder this way, and I could do it, but it was painful. As scheduling goes, that was difficult. For me that was VS, they were a little difficult to work with to contact them for appointments. 
I had a sleep study done and I was talking to the person working there and she was sharing with me that it’s not always easy to get the information for scheduling and for a long time the VSO was doing it and when someone cancels, the VS wouldn’t tell them. 
    - If so, what type of support?

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? * I did receive my rating. My separation date was January 5th and I applied for benefits before discharge which helped a lot. I know the VA since the new Bill was passed regarding burn pits and hazardous materials are backed up. I did this in December about a month before my separation date. I received my rating on the last day in February. After waiting a month and a half, I could not complain. 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits?
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)? * No, not at this moment. Property tax is based on disability. Using my GI bill is something I want to continue to take advantage of. No, I’m using the Montgomery GI bill with tuition assistance. I’ve used some of my GI bill and I’m familiar with how that works. 
-Would it be helpful to see a list of benefits to see what you are eligible for? * Yes, for sure. I would say, a personal preference to have all the information available to me. I’m impressed with the VA app and being able to see your letters and claims. Maybe something like that to see your benefits. That would help me learn and retain that information. Going over the TAPS seems like an overload of information and becomes difficult to find it. 
-Any other websites that you use to help you? *The number one resource I have found helpful is Reddit. 
-I like to have all the information to my disposal. 
*Finding a civilian job was the number one priority. Finding movers and getting boxes is easy. Before I was with Booze Allen, I was with Microsoft for 5 months and that was helpful to get my feet wet. I think now, finding a job in civilian life, is difficult. I probably applied to 70 to 90 other positions. For me, it was difficult for me to sleep some nights because I didn’t have a job. Having a job locked down was a priority on my list. 
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier?
-What was your relationship with your Commanding Officer? * My experience, mine is a little different. I was in a spot on my career where I was not required to do certain things based on my medical conditions. For me they were very supportive. They didn’t do anything for me, but they supported me. For me I was very fortunate.
