Questions for Veterans

Background
- Could you tell us about your background and military service? *I was in the Air Force from 2010-2017 and went to the reserves for a year and in 2016 I got my first claim. I was in military intelligence and worked mostly in Army bases. I moved a few times in the VA system. I lived in South Texas, Virginia Beach in Virginia, and during Covid, I lived outside of Portland and I had the hardest time getting services and it was very hard and the year I lived there, I didn’t get seen. Now, I’m in the Minneapolis VA system. 
- What has been your experience with using VA benefits? *It’s hard to separate it and my kids are older now, but at the time when they were younger, it was harder. South Texas was great and they had multiple centers and it was more convenient. I could go to one of their satellite offices. Here in Minneapolis has been amazing and my kids are older and it’s easier. Logistically speaking, this is easier. I have a little resentment in the Portland system because I had better care in the southern area. 
-Community building aspect? * I would say there is a two-part answer. In the case of Portland, they do not. It was hard to find Veterans community-wise. Texas had a lot of groups. In south Texas it was a two-part, where the VA would tell you where to they would tell you where stuff is happening. And other places that would tell you where to apply for services. Virginia was an active set of Veterans. Where there are more active Veterans, the VA care is better. 
  - What VA benefits have you used and why?

Transition Experience    
- What was the hardest part of your transition? *I started my paperwork before I did my exit from service through a mentorship with someone who had gone through it already. Maybe a couple of months at most. It wasn’t terribly long and it got attention. 
- Is there support that you wish you had when you separated from the military? *I do. It’s tailored to my personal experience. The reason I only did one year of the reserves was that I was in inpatient mental healthcare and they said, I couldn’t extend. Even if someone said it actually affects your military career, I wouldn’t feel so alone and ashamed in the process. There were other people that had similar cases and it shouldn’t exclude you from using your benefits. I don’t think there’s a lot of material like that for people with that experience (PTSD and MST). 
    - If so, what type of support?

Learning about VA Benefits
- Where did you learn about VA benefits? *I've taken advantage of the Gi Bill and got extensions for that. Recently I’ve been doing more technical programs, it’s part of the technical retraining. Something about transitional skills. Something like that applies to my industry. 
-Did you go through a Tap class? * Yes, I was in an Army base and it was about 3 weeks long and there were people there and I think a job fair so that we can get exposed to resumes. Mostly helpful. The TAP itself was pretty good. They focus on presenting yourself not to put on your uniform, just more what it would be on the civilian side. 
-Did you learn about the GI Bill? *The Airforce portion we did an outpro briefing, we did talk about it. I felt prepared with the school portion if you wanted to use that. 
- How was your experience with learning about benefits? *They start talking about it pretty early in your service. 
- What would encourage you to learn more about other VA benefits (that you may not be using)? *Yes, at each location that I have engaged had services either one-on-one counseling or medication, and I’ve been treated for each of those. I find it interesting that only one facility had mental health inside of the women's clinic. That was the Virginia Beach, VA. 
 - If you could wave a magic wand, what you do to make the whole benefits process easier? *When I did my packet, I was handed this much stack of papers and I tried to go through all of them, but I don’t what it looks like, but a digital platform transfers of recorders instead. 
-What kind of support would be helpful? *I would say, some kind of drop-in care. Like gyms that offer daycare hours so that I can get care. That would be an interesting thing for young Veterans who enter and have a gender identity. 
*Time Over*
