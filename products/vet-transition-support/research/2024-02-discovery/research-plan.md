# Research Plan for [Veteran Transition Support Initial Research, February 16, 2024]

## Background
Through the Veteran Transition Support (VTS) project, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Booz Allen Hamilton are working to help Veterans learn about available benefits, understand their eligibility, and begin the application process. The VTS teams aims to create a new, accessible, all-in-one prototype for Veteran benefit information that is helpful for current servicemembers approaching separation and all Veterans regardless of the time since their separation   . This prototype would clearly guide Veterans through the benefits discovery and eligibility check processes. The prototype will also provide comprehensive and accurate information about gathering required documentation, applying for benefits, and checking one’s application status.

The VTS team will use a multi-phased approach to develop the MVP. The team began by conducting a research review of previous VA-funded projects that support benefit discovery and servicemember transition. The next phase to conduct original interviews to answer questions that have not been covered by previous VA research. The VTS team plans to interview Veterans, servicemembers, and VA stakeholders to learn about unexplored aspects of the separation process, benefit discovery, and available support for Veterans.

This will be a new Veteran-facing product. It is undecided whether the product will be authenticated or unauthenticated. We may have both authenticated content and unauthenticated content. This is our initial round of generative research. We are very early in our project timeline, so we are not testing a prototype at this stage. Our generative research will inform our development of a prototype, which we will test in a later round of user research.

### OCTO Priorities 

Our research supports the following  [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey
Our product will support Veterans at multiple stages of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). Benefits discovery will be helpful for Veterans at the “Getting out” stage as they engage with the VA and apply for first-time benefits. Our product may also help Veterans at the “Taking care of myself” and “Reinventing myself” stages of the journey. Veterans may need additional benefits years or decades after completing their service. Our product aims to help Veterans discover and apply for relevant benefits as their needs evolve.

## Research Goals	
Our research goals are the following:
- Understand how our MVP can provide clear and consistent information about benefit discovery, application requirements, and the application process.
- Understand how benefit discovery fits into the larger universe of topics on a transitioning servicemember or Veteran’s mind.
- Learn more about the role that Commanding Officers (COs) play in a servicemember’s separation process.

### Outcome
The findings from our research will first inform our MVP recommendations. We will recommend high-level functionality and features to include in the MVP, based on the comments from our interviewees. We will use these recommendations to develop journey maps, which will explain how we envision our MVP will ease the benefit discovery and application process.

We will use our MVP recommendations and journey maps to inform the design and development of our MVP.

### Research questions
Our research questions are the following:
- The transition experience can be highly emotional for TSMs and RSVs. What can VA do to support?
- Who is the target audience for our MVP?
- If Veterans didn't receive much help or information from their COs during separation, where did they turn?
- With a multitude of benefits and types of benefits, what resources are Veterans most interested in accessing? And how should benefits be grouped?


### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that veterans need a solution that is easy to use, makes benefits clear and understandable, and provides emotional support during the process of connecting with the VA. Veterans will need a product that is informative and helpful with the benefit discovery process, accounting for a Veteran’s specific needs.

## Methodology	
We are conducting semi-structured interviews for this research project. Since we are early in our project cycle, we are conducting generative research to understand pain points and inform MVP design ideas. We do not have an MVP prototype yet, so we are not doing any sort of product testing. Additionally, since we are creating a new product, we are not asking participants to do a contextual inquiry or task-based prompts on an existing product.

Since this is a user research project, we do not believe our study is subject to [Paperwork Reduction Act](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/paperwork-reduction-act-pra) compliance requirements. However, we are confirming this with our VA project leadership.


### Location
We will host our user interviews remotely. Since we are working with Perigean to recruit and schedule the interviews, our understanding is that we will use Zoom for the remote interviews.

### Research materials

## Recruitment	
We will work with Perigean to handle the recruitment, scheduling, and compensation of Veterans, transitioning servicemembers, and Commanding Officers.

### Recruitment approach
We are seeking Perigean’s assistance to recruit Veterans, Transitioning Servicemembers, and Commanding Officers for our study. We are also interviewing VA staff; however, we know VA staff recruitment is outside of Perigean’s scope, so we will recruit our VA staff participants through our VA project lead.

To be inclusive of diverse perspectives, we plan to recruit participants from various races/ethnicities, genders, age ranges, and service branches. Approximately 50% of our sample will include people of color and 50% will be women as well. We are recruiting Veterans from 3 age ranges, with Veterans 65 years and older being the largest percentage (40%) of the three age bands.

### Recruitment criteria

### Veterans
How many names are we seeking?
- The VTS team is seeking interviews with 16 veterans.

What criteria should be used to develop the Veteran outreach list?

**Primary criteria (must-haves)** 

For Veterans only - Time since separation:
- 8 veterans -- Veterans who separated within the past 2 years
- 8 veterans -- Veterans who separated more than 2 years ago
  
For Veterans only - Current age:
- 5 veterans -- Veterans who are 35 or younger
- 5 veterans -- Veterans in their 40s or 50s
- 6 veterans -- Veterans who are 65 or older

Please provide participants from a mix of Service Branches across the entire sample. (Service branch is already captured in the Perigean database.)

Please provide a mix of Race and Gender across all participants as close as possible to the following splits:

Race (already captured in Perigean database):
- 50% – Non-white
- 50% -– White
  
Gender (already captured in Perigean database):
- 50% – Male
- 50% – Female

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- The team would also like to have 50% of the Veterans who have previously engaged with the VA and 50% Veterans who have not previously engaged.

### Transitioning Servicemembers (TSMs) and Commanding Officers (COs)
How many names are we seeking?
- The VTS team is seeking interviews with 6 TSMs and COs.

What criteria should be used to develop the TSM and CO outreach list?
- We would like for any listed TSMs to be within one year of their separation date.
- We are seeking TSM and CO participants from a mix of Service Branches.
- As noted above, we are also seeking a percentage mix of Race and Gender across the Veterans, TSMs, and COs on the outreach list.
