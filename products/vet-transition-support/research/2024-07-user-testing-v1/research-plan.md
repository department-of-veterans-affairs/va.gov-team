# Veteran Transition Support Version 1 User Testing and Research
## Research Plan

Created On: July 10, 2024

Edited Last: July 17, 2024

### Background
Through the Veteran Transition Support (VTS) project, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Booz Allen Hamilton are working to help Veterans learn about available benefits, understand their eligibility, and begin the application process. The VTS teams aims to create a new, accessible, all-in-one prototype for Veteran benefit information that is helpful for current service-members approaching separation and all Veterans regardless of the time since their separation. This prototype would clearly guide Veterans through the benefits discovery and eligibility check processes. The prototype will also provide comprehensive and accurate information about gathering required documentation, applying for benefits, and checking one’s application status.

The VTS team will use a multi-phased approach to develop the MVP. The team began by conducting a research review of previous VA-funded projects that support benefit discovery and service-member transition. The next phase to conduct original interviews to answer questions that have not been covered by previous VA research. The VTS team plans to interview Veterans, service-members, and VA stakeholders to learn about unexplored aspects of the separation process, benefit discovery, and available support for Veterans.

This will be a new Veteran-facing product. It is undecided whether the product will be authenticated or unauthenticated. We may have both authenticated content and unauthenticated content. This is our initial round of generative research. We are very early in our project timeline, so we are not testing a prototype at this stage. Our generative research will inform our development of a prototype, which we will test in a later round of user research.

#### OCTO Priorities 
Our research supports the following  OCTO priorities
(https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
-	Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
-	Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

#### Veteran Journey
Our product will support Veterans at multiple stages of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). Benefits discovery will be helpful for Veterans at the “Getting out” stage as they engage with the VA and apply for first-time benefits. Our product may also help Veterans at the “Taking care of myself” and “Reinventing myself” stages of the journey. Veterans may need additional benefits years or decades after completing their service. Our product aims to help Veterans discover and apply for relevant benefits as their needs evolve.

### Research Goals	
Our research goals are the following:
-	Understand how Version 1 of the Veterans Transition Assistant starts to meet the needs of transitioning service-members and current Veterans
-	Test specific features in the Version 1 MVP: Skipping Questions, Review Answers Page, Sorting and Filtering, Etc.
-	Determine expectations of users given the baseline MVP of Version 1
-	Find out additional features & systems that can be added to VTS in future versions that is helpful to users

#### Outcome
The findings from our research will primarily inform any feature or design fixes to include in the Version 2 of the VTS product. We’re looking to validate all design assumptions and choices that we made for Version 1. 

Secondarily, now that we have a MVP version of the VTS, the findings from the research will also help inform future features and design choices for future versions as well as how we should prioritize those future features and design choices.

#### Research questions
Our research questions are the following:
-	What should the VTS be named?
    - Something catchy?
    - Or informative?
    - Or somewhere in between?
-	How do users feel about the Review Answers Page?
    - How often to people just skip it quickly?
    - Do people use it to alter their answers just to see changes on the results page?
-	How quickly do users orient to the Results page?
    - Is the information hierarchy helpful?
-	Are the questions we’re asking able to be answered easily by users?
      - Are the questions valuable to users?
-	How many users use the Skip button?
   - How many questions are skipped?
    - Which questions are skipped most often? Why?
-	How are users interacting with the Filter option on the Results Page?
    - Which of the filters are used most often?
    - Which of the filters are used least often?
    - Are there any filter options that aren’t listed on the prototype, that the user would wish to use?
-	How are users interacting with the Sort Option on the Results Page?
    - Which of the sort options are used most often?
    - Which of the sort options are used least often?
    - Are there any sort options that aren’t listed on the prototype, that the user would wish to use?
-	How do users interact with the “Benefits you may not be eligible for” section?
    - Do people want this section?
    - Did the drop down meet their expectations?
     - What do users expect to see here?
    - What are people HOPING to see here?
    - Is there a way that this section could help more?
-	How visible is the “Time sensitive benefits” alert?
    - Is this section useful to users? Why?

#### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that Version 1 of the Veteran Transition Support questionnaire meets some needs of users and sets up the project to meet future needs of veterans. 

### Methodology	
We are conducting semi-structured interviews for this research project. We will be starting with structured user testing: Sending the user a clickable prototype and asking them to click through the prototype while speaking their thoughts. 

After the user testing, we will be asking follow-up questions of the users about their experience and expectations.

Since this is a user research project, we do not believe our study is subject to [Paperwork Reduction Act](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/paperwork-reduction-act-pra) compliance requirements. However, we are confirming this with our VA project leadership.


#### Location
We will host our user interviews remotely. Since we are working with Perigean to recruit and schedule the interviews, our understanding is that we will use Zoom for the remote interviews.

#### Research materials
-	The conversation guide is in a separate document
### Recruitment	
We will work with Perigean to handle the recruitment, scheduling, and compensation of Veterans, transitioning servicemembers, and Commanding Officers.

#### Recruitment approach
We are seeking Perigean’s assistance to recruit Veterans, Transitioning Servicemembers, and Commanding Officers for our study. We are also interviewing VA staff; however, we know VA staff recruitment is outside of Perigean’s scope, so we will recruit our VA staff participants through our VA project lead.

To be inclusive of diverse perspectives, we plan to recruit participants from various races/ethnicities, genders, age ranges, and service branches. Approximately 50% of our sample will include people of color and 50% will be women as well. We are recruiting Veterans from 3 age ranges, with Veterans 65 years and older being the largest percentage (40%) of the three age bands.

#### Recruitment criteria
Veterans
How many names are we seeking?
-	The VTS team is seeking interviews with 16 veterans
-	Minimum 10 veterans

What criteria should be used to develop the Veteran outreach list?

Primary criteria (must-haves)
For Veterans only - Time since separation:
-	8 veterans -- Veterans who separated within the past 2 years
-	8 veterans -- Veterans who separated more than 2 years ago
  
For Veterans only - Current age:
-	5 veterans -- Veterans who are 35 or younger
-	5 veterans -- Veterans in their 40s or 50s
-	6 veterans -- Veterans who are 65 or older

Please provide participants from a mix of Service Branches across the entire sample. (Service branch is already captured in the Perigean database.)

Please provide a mix of Race and Gender across all participants as close as possible to the following splits:

Race (already captured in Perigean database):
-	50% – Non-white
-	50% -– White
  
Gender (already captured in Perigean database):
-	50% – Male
-	50% – Female

Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
-	The team would also like to have 50% of the Veterans who have previously engaged with the VA and 50% Veterans who have not previously engaged.

#### Transitioning Servicemembers (TSMs) and Commanding Officers (COs)
How many names are we seeking?
-	The VTS team is seeking interviews with 6 TSMs and COs.

What criteria should be used to develop the TSM and CO outreach list?
-	We would like for any listed TSMs to be within one year of their separation date.
-	We are seeking TSM and CO participants from a mix of Service Branches.
-	As noted above, we are also seeking a percentage mix of Race and Gender across the Veterans, TSMs, and COs on the outreach list.
