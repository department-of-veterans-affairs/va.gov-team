## Intro - 6 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who’d like to observe and take notes. But before we get to that, I have a few things that I’d like to go over with you:

- For today’s activity, you’ll be testing a tool that will go on the VA website in the future. The tool is supposed to help Veterans and servicemembers learn about benefits and resources that are useful for their specific needs.
- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes .** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this activity is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate asked if it was alright for a few observers to join, but I want to double-check with you. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers joining our session?**
   - *If no:* Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - *If yes:* Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, your actions during today’s session won’t will affect your VA information or benefits  .
- **Would it be okay if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** I’m going to ask you to do a series of tasks with the prototype. If possible, I’d like to record the session to make sure we accurately capture what you say and do during the tasks. After we analyze all of the user testing data, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, would it be okay if I record my screen and audio?
- We work with other VA teams to support Veterans and servicemembers. One of the ways that we share findings with our VA partners is by showing short video clips of our activity sessions. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image and your name. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans and servicemembers experience when using our products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that if this is still okay with you, so you’ll get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be okay with us using clips of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **Great, I’ve started recording.** I'd like to confirm one more time on the recording: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions. 

1. Could you briefly tell us about your military service?
2. How often do you use the VA.gov website?
3. Why do you use the VA.gov website?

## Instructions for the upcoming tasks - 5 minutes

Now I’m going to ask you to do some tasks using a prototype, which is a demo version of a future tool that will be on VA.gov. As I mentioned before, completing these tasks will not affect your VA information or benefits in any way.

We’d like to see your screen while you do these tasks, if possible. Would it be possible to  share your screen on the Zoom meeting?
- If screensharing won’t work, you can also “hug” your computer and record what you’re doing on your phone.
- If that won’t work either, I can share the prototype on my screen and give you control, so you can move through the prototype.

While you’re completing today’s tasks, please share your thoughts out loud as you do the tasks. We want to understand your reactions to the prototype and the reasoning that informs your actions.

As a reminder, you’ll be working with a demo tool, so some things won’t work. However, you should be able to complete all of today’s tasks with the parts that are interactive.

Finally, you can ask questions at any time.

## First Task: Completing the questionnaire - 15 minutes

Great, now we’re going to start today’s activity. I’m going to share a link in the chat box – it’s the link for our prototype. Please open the prototype and share your screen.
- Send the Figma prototype link, queued up to the “welcome” page.
- Make sure you’re sending the correct desktop or mobile link, depending on what kind of device the participant is using.
What you’re seeing is the welcome page for a questionnaire. This questionnaire will ask a few questions to help you find benefits and resources that might be helpful.
For your first task, please complete the questionnaire. The questions in the questionnaire help us determine what benefits someone might be eligible for. Please answer each question to the best of your ability. We will keep your answers confidential and we will not share or track your answers in any way. We’re only asking you to answer the questions so you can provide feedback on how we’ve designed this questionnaire.
Please stop when you reach the page that says “Review your entries”  at the top.
As a reminder, please share your thoughts out loud while you’re doing the task. You can start the task now by reading this page and then selecting the “Get started” button.

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant feel uncomfortable answering any of the questions?  
- Is the participant confused about any of the questions?
- Is the participant curious about why we’re asking any of the questions?

## Second Task: Finding information on the results page - 10 minutes

Great, you’ve completed the first task. I’m going to ask you to do one more task.
For the next task, I’ll have you navigate to the results page. When our product is finished and on the live website, this page will show a list of recommended benefits and resources, based on how you answered the questionnaire.
Because we’re using a demo version today, the results page may not necessarily reflect what you entered, but it will have some benefits and resources listed.
Let’s go to the results page and then I’ll ask you how you’d complete a few things on that page. Please select the “Continue” button.
- For this task, let’s imagine that you are currently serving, but will complete your service soon. You want to file a pre-discharge disability claim. To do this, you need to file at least 90 days before your separation date. Could you show me how you’d find information about pre-discharge claims ? Like the previous task, please share your thinking out loud. 
- Now let’s imagine that you’re a Veteran who completed your service 3 years ago.   You’re interested in personalized career planning, but you didn’t initially see it when you loaded the page. Could you show me where you’d look to learn more about this benefit? 
- Finally, let’s imagine that you’re happy to have this list of recommended resources. You don’t want to lose this, so you’d like to email a copy to yourself. Could you show me how you’d send yourself a copy? 

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant realize why we are providing specific timeframes in the first and second prompts?
   - (The timeframes affect where the participant should be looking for the mentioned benefits. The first prompt is about a time-sensitive benefit that is called out in a separate section. The second prompt is about a benefit where the eligibility window has already passed, so it’s in the “may not qualify” section.) 
- Does the participant understand the given prompts?
- Does the participant investigate areas of the results page that we didn’t expect them to explore?
	
## Post-Task Interview – 5 minutes

I have a few questions to ask about your experience doing these tasks.

- Were there any tasks that confused you?
- Was there anything in the prototype that confused you?
- What would you want a guided tool to help you with, even if it wasn’t included in the prototype?  
- Would a tool like this be helpful for you? Why or why not?
- What should this tool be named?
   - Something catchy? Or informative? Or somewhere in between?
- Where  would you expect to find a tool like this on the VA.gov website?
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips – 2 minutes

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing – 2 minutes

That concludes our task for today – thank you for participating! We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans and servicemembers.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans or servicemembers you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Why the Questionnaire Includes Each question

* The participant may have concerns or curiosities about specific questions in the questionnaire. Below is more detailed information about why included each question. *
- **Goals:** We ask about goals to help us recommend the most useful benefits and resources, based on what you want to explore.
- **Length of service:** Some benefits require you to serve a certain amount of time to be eligible.
- **Are you currently serving:** We ask if you’re currently serving because there are some applications you can start before separating. If you apply while serving, you may be approved for benefits more quickly than if you apply after completing your service.
- **Expected separation date:** Some benefit applications have a specific time window, so you have to apply within a certain number of days before your separation date.
- **How long ago did you separate:** Some benefit applications have a specific time window, so you have to apply within a certain amount of time after separation.
- **Character of discharge:** We ask about character of discharge because it affects your eligibility for certain benefits. You may still be eligible for benefits even if your character of discharge is other than honorable.
- **Do you have a disability rating:** There are some benefits you can only get after you’ve applied for disability compensation and received a disability rating.
- **Have you been approved for GI Bill benefits:** We ask about GI Bill benefits because we don’t want to recommend the GI Bill if you’ve already completed the GI Bill application process.s

## Emergency Exit

- **Out of questions:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. Perigean will follow up with you. Have a good day.
- **Blame technology:** I am so sorry, but I just learned that the prototype is unexpectedly not working, so we will have to end today’s session. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time. Perigean will follow up with you. Have a good day.
