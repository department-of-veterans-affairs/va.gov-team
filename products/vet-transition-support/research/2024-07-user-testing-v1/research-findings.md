## Research Goals
Through the Veteran Transition Support (VTS) project, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Booz Allen Hamilton are working to help Veterans learn about available benefits, understand their eligibility, and begin the application process. The VTS teams aims to create a new, accessible, all-in-one prototype for Veteran benefit information that is helpful for current service-members approaching separation and all Veterans regardless of the time since their separation. This prototype would clearly guide Veterans through the benefits discovery and eligibility check processes. The prototype will also provide comprehensive and accurate information about gathering required documentation, applying for benefits, and checking one’s application status.

Our product will support Veterans at multiple stages of the Veteran journey. Benefits discovery will be helpful for Veterans at the “Getting out” stage as they engage with the VA and apply for first-time benefits. Our product may also help Veterans at the “Taking care of myself” and “Reinventing myself” stages of the journey. Veterans may need additional benefits years or decades after completing their service. Our product aims to help Veterans discover and apply for relevant benefits as their needs evolve.

Our research supports the following  OCTO priorities (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
-	Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
-	Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

Our research goals were the following:
-	Understand how Version 1 of the Veterans Transition Assistant starts to meet the needs of transitioning service-members and current Veterans
-	Test specific features in the Version 1 MVP: Skipping Questions, Review Answers Page, Sorting and Filtering, Etc.
-	Determine expectations of users given the baseline MVP of Version 1
-	Find out additional features & systems that can be added to VTS in future versions that is helpful to users


## Research Questions

Our research questions were the following:
-	What should the VTS be named?
    - Something catchy?
    - Or informative?
    - Or somewhere in between?

     - What do users expect to see here?
    - What are people HOPING to see here?
    - Is there a way that this section could help more?
-	How visible is the “Time sensitive benefits” alert?
    - Is this section useful to users? Why?
## Methodology 

Our team interviewed 12 users over a two-week period. Each session lasted approximately one hour. Cora Goldston and Ronnie Young swapped off leading the interviews and taking notes. Gene Dreyband and Nicole Kontrabecki observed the sessions.

Each user was asked a series of background questions:
-	About their military service (e.g. how long, what did you do, what was your experience)
-	About how they’ve used Va.gov before (if at all)

After the background questions, we asked users to click on a link to the prototype we were asking them to test. If the user wasn’t able to share their screen on the call (either because of technology restraints or knowledge of how to), the interviewer shared the prototype on our own screen. We used a clickable Figma prototype for user testing since the v1 staging site was still under development.

We asked users to look over and share their thoughts out loud about each page in the experience:
-	Introduction page
-	Individual question pages
-	Review your information page
-	Results page

On the results page, we asked each user to complete three specific tasks. These tasks were designed to see if users were able to find and understand the following elements:
-	“Time sensitive benefits” drop drown box
-	“Benefits I might not qualify for” drop down
-	“Save your results” button

Afterwards, we asked users about their thoughts for the following:
-	Where they would expect to find this tool on the VA website
-	What they would expect this tool would be called

Afterwards, the interviewer opened the floor to everyone on the call for additional questions and clarification. These clarification questions were different for each user test as they mainly focused on gaining more insight about their specific experience.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

Our hypothesis is that Version 1 of the Veteran Transition Support questionnaire meets some needs of users and sets up the project to meet future needs of veterans.
*Definitely True:* Participants generally understood how to use our questionnaire, what the overall purpose of the tool was, and how the tool would be relevant to their goals. Participants identified opportunities to build on the current prototype and improve its utility in future versions. 


## Key Findings

1.	Most participants wanted a name that's straightforward and describes the tool's purpose.

2.	Some participants also valued a name that's catchy and easy to remember.

3.	Participants overwhelmingly said this tool would be useful for Veterans and servicemembers. However, some participants noted the tool might be more helpful for those who are just starting their VA journeys.

4.	One participant mentioned that mental health support would be useful as part of this tool.

5.	Another participant noted that we should be cognizant of senior Veterans' needs.

6.	Several participants felt the Results page was logically organized and easy to use.

7.	However, participants identified opportunities to make certain elements stand out more on the Results page.

8.	Several participants said they would NOT use the "Share my results" button to send themselves a copy of their results. Instead, they would screenshot or download the page, as they have previously done for other webpages.

9.	Some participants did NOT see the "Share my results" button on the screen, which might explain why they would use other methods to email the results to themselves.

10.	Several participants thought they would find pre-discharge disability claim and personalized career guidance info under VR&E and/or the GI Bill, even though these are all separate VA benefits. We will need to consider users' pre-existing knowledge about benefits, so we don't have users looking in the wrong spots for info.

11.	Although the pre-discharge disability claim task prompt mentioned a time window, some participants did NOT indicate they would look under "Time-sensitive benefits" for more information. They may have missed seeing this banner.

12.	Many participants did NOT explore the "Show benefits that I may not qualify for" section to find the personalized career guidance program.



## Details of Findings 

**Introduction Page:**

All participating users understood what this page was saying and asking them to do.
One actionable takeaway gained from testing this page was that we should be more clear that this is just a recommendation tool, not an eligibility determination tool.

**Questionnaire Pages:**

All users easily understood what the questions were asking of them. There were a few pieces of actionable information taken from users:
- The list of goals on the first question is a good way to get users to think about their situation more holistically.
    - We will explore how we can add other goals to continue this practice.
- The question answers for a few of the questions were rather wordy and took users a few extra seconds to read through.
    - E.g. “more than 1 year but less than 2 years” vs. “1-2 years”
- The ‘Years of Service’ question should be a standard stepper of time, rather than being so specific to the requirements for benefits.
- The VA Disability Rating and GI Bill question caused some confusion. In this test, these questions asked the user Yes or No if they have applied for and received these benefits. 
    - Several users had started the process or submitted their applications but haven’t received a rating yet – so they didn’t know how to answer.

**Review Your Information Page:**

All users easily understood this page. Users quickly scanned through their answers and clicked the button at the bottom of the page to move to the results page.

**Results Page:**

Users generally understood how the page was laid out and how to navigate it. Most users skipped past the explanation text at the top of the page and jumped directly to where they expected their results to be located. 

_Task 1:_
Users were first asked where they might find information on a “Pre-discharge disability claim.” The correct answer to this task was to click on the “Time sensitive benefits” drop down to see the information listed there. 

Very few users actually recognized that this drop down was, in fact, a drop down. Most users assumed that this was a header that was describing the cards underneath the  alert, rather than a separate drop-down box that they could open for new information.

_Task 2:_
Users were then asked to describe where they might find information on “Personalized Career Planning.” The correct answer to this task was to find “Educational and career counseling (Chapter 36) in the time-sensitive drop-down list and click on “Learn more.”

Users’ success with this task depended on how well they read through the page and how much attention they were paying to the task (since the phrase “educational and career planning” was listed in the description verbatim of the Chapter 36 description.) 

_Task 3:_
Users were finally asked where they might look or what they might do if they wanted to save a copy or share a copy of their results. 

Users had a multitude of different answers to this task:
- Printing a physical copy of the page by using the print function in the browser
- Saving a PDF of the page by using the print function in the browser
- Saving the webpage itself to their computer (as a .webp)
- Clicking on the “save your results” button on the page


Many users didn’t seem to see the “Save your results” button at first. Some users scrolled past it too quickly at the top of the page and didn’t look around when the question was asked. Some users scrolled around the page seemingly looking for something like the button, but they were unclear about the purpose of the button. 

Additionally, some users questioned why they would need to save or share a copy of their results.

> _“Who would I share this with?”_

Others mentioned that they would save or share this with their loved ones or caretakers who may need this information to help the veteran.

**Additional Questions:**

After the tasks, we polled the participants on the following two questions:
1. Where would you expect to find a tool like this on VA.gov?
    - The purpose of this question was to determine the first few spots that users would look for this tool on the current VA.gov.
2. What would you call a tool like this?
    - As a follow-up, we asked whether they’d like it to be called something straightforward or something catchy (e.g. a longer name that was more descriptive, a branded experience, or an acronym).

From these two questions we received the results shown on [this image]( https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vet-transition-support/research/2024-07-user-testing-v1/v1-user-testing-findings-graphic.png).


## Additional Insights

From our participants’ responses, we gained some additional insight about the Welcome page and question pages:

1.	Most participants thought the welcome page provided helpful information about what to expect from the tool.

2.	However, one participant noted that more specific information on the Welcome page might be useful.

3.	Some participants were pleasantly surprised to see the options on the Goals page.
4.	"Understand my benefits" was the most commonly selected goal among the participants.

5.	There needs to be some sort of stepper or better differentiation for date ranges (e.g., "how long have you served?" or "how long ago did you separate?")

6.	Our participants felt comfortable selecting their character of discharge. However, one participant indicated that this question might make others uncomfortable.

7.	We encountered a unique situation with one participant. The participant had not separated yet, so the questionnaire skipped the "character of discharge" question. However, because the participant is separating soon, they know what their character of discharge will be.

8.	The "character of discharge" question might be jarring for participants because it currently uses a dropdown instead of radio buttons.

9.	Some participants were unsure how to answer the disability rating question if they are currently applying for their rating.

10.	Similarly, some participants were unsure about how to answer the GI Bill question if they are currently applying for education benefits.



## Recommendations

* **Recommendation 1:** Address mental health in a non-confrontational way.
* **Recommendation 2:** Find another way to display the “Time sensitive benefits.”
    * The time sensitive benefits drop down isn't working; more than half the users didn't see it and missed the task that asked them to find it.
* **Recommendation 3:** Find ways to emphasize the "Share your results" button.
    * The current button wasn’t found by many users, due to a combination of the location and wording.
* **Recommendation 4:** Make the "Years of service" question a standard stepping of time, not specific to the benefits.
    * Users took time to figure out this question and relate it to how long they served.
* **Recommendation 5:** Add response options for "I've submitted but haven't gotten a rating" and "I've started the process but haven't submitted" to the disability rating question to cover all aspects of the process.
* **Recommendation 6:** Add response options for "I've submitted but haven't gotten a rating" and "I've started the process but haven't submitted" to cover all aspects of the process.
* **Recommendation 7:** Consider how to collect character of discharge information without making users uncomfortable.
    * We need the question to appropriately recommend benefits, but we could potentially add some helper text to let people know that they may still be able to get some benefits, regardless of their answer.
* **Recommendation 8:** Review the mocks for accessibility with some of our smaller helper text/subdued text.
    * One user had a little bit of an issue reading the helper text. If we identify a broader accessibility issue, we will discuss with the VA Design System team because the helper text’s formatting is determined by the design system.



## Next Steps

We are using the findings to refine our benefit discovery prototype. We are conducting a second round of user testing in October and November on our revised prototype.


## Further research needed

Due to limitations with our Figma prototype, we still need to conduct research with Assistive technology users and mobile users. We may request OCTO’s support with planning this additional research.

## Tools used for Synthesis

We used Mural to synthesize the user testing data. We pulled in quotes and feedback from our sessions, then created affinity groups to identify recurring themes and subthemes. To inform our iterative design efforts, we then identified MVP recommendations that aligned with each major theme.


## Pages and applications used

We tested our [v1 Figma prototype]( https://www.figma.com/proto/DNy6D8ELfTQW1g3EK7yJu5/Mid-Fidelity-Prototype-for-v1?node-id=2546-7537&node-type=frame&t=wLhsDMgy6dKayOrt-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1).


## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**

We sought  Perigean’s assistance to recruit Veterans and Transitioning Servicemembers for our study.
To be inclusive of diverse perspectives, we aimed to recruit participants from various races/ethnicities, genders, age ranges, and service branches. We aimed to have approximately 50% of our sample be people of color and 50% of the sample be women. Recruiting women participants proved challenging. We had a few participants who canceled their sessions or did not show, which may have affect the gender balance.
We recruited Veterans from different age ranges, with Veterans 65 years and older being the largest target percentage (40%) of the three age bands. However, recruiting senior Veterans was a challenge, potentially due to limited technology use and Perigean’s access to senior Veterans.

We talked to **12 participants.**

Audience segment:
* Veterans: 6
* Transitioning service members: 6


Gender:
* Male: 10
* Female: 2


LGBTQ+:
* Unknown: 12 
We were unable to request LGBTQ+ demographic information because we had a limited number of screening questions that Perigean could ask. We needed to ask several other questions to ensure participants met necessary criteria for our specific study (e.g., whether someone is separating from the military in the next year). However, we think it would be beneficial for future research to explore transition and benefit discovery experiences for LGTBQ+ Veterans and transitioning servicemembers.


Age:
* 25-34: 6
* 35-44: 2
* 45-54: 0
* 55-64: 0
* 65+: 1
* Unknown: 2


Education:
* High school degree or equivalent: 0
* Some college (no degree): 2
* Associate's degree, trade certificate or vocational training: 5
* Bachelor's degree: 3
* Master's degree: 1
* Doctorate degree: 0
* Unknown: 1


Geographic location:
* Unknown: 12

We were unable to request urban/rural demographic information because we had a limited number of screening questions that Perigean could ask. We needed to ask several other questions to ensure participants met necessary criteria for our specific study (e.g., whether someone is separating from the military in the next year). However, we think it would be beneficial for future research to explore transition and benefit discovery experiences for Veterans and transitioning servicemembers in both urban and rural areas.


Race:
* White: 5
* Black: 5
* Hispanic: 2
* Biracial: 0
* Asian: 0
* Native: 0


Disability and Assistive Technology (AT):
* Unknown: 12

Due to limitations with our Figma prototype, we were unable to recruit for participants that use specific assistive technology. We plan to include assistive technology users in future rounds of user testing.


## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

This research does not include the perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups:
* Veterans with cognitive disabilities
* Veterans on mobile devices
* Veterans who live in rural areas
* Veterans with Other than Honorable discharges
* Veterans of immigrant origin

Additionally, we did recruit one Veteran over the age of 55 years old, but we were unable to meet the recruitment target of 50% for this marginalized Veteran group.
