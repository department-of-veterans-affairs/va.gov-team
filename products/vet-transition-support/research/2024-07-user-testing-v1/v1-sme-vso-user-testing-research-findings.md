# Benefits Discovery Tool – V1 SME User Testing
**October 2024**
## Overview
We tested our version 1 product with VA subject matter experts (SMEs) and Veteran Service Organization (VSO) representatives. For the SMEs, we were particularly curious about how our tool would impact or display information from their domain. For the VSO participants, we were curious how they would work with Veterans in using this tool.

We met with SMEs from three different VA benefit domains: Education, Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E), and Loan Guaranty. Additionally, we hosted two VSO focus group sessions, with a total of four VSO participants.Cora Goldston and Ronnie Young swapped off leading the interviews and taking notes. Gene Dreyband and Nicole Kontrabecki observed the sessions.

We asked users to visit our v1 product on staging.va.gov and share their screen.

We then asked users to look over and speak their thoughts out loud about each of the pages in the experience:
-	Introduction page
-	Each question page
-	Review your information page
-	Results page

On the results page, we asked users to complete three specific tasks. These tasks were designed to see if users were able to find and understand the following elements:
-	Time sensitive benefits drop drown box
-	Benefits I might not qualify for drop down
-	Save your results button

Afterwards, we asked users for their thoughts on the following:
-	Where they would expect to find this tool on the VA website
-	What they would expect this tool would be called

Afterwards, the interviewer opened the floor to everyone on the call for additional questions and clarification. These clarification questions were different for each user as they mainly focused on gaining participant-specific insights. 

## Results
### Introduction Page
All users tested were able to read and understand what this page was saying and asking them to do.
### Questionnaire Pages
Overall, users found the questionnaire very straightforward. Users asked no clarifying questions as they were moving through the questionnaire.

#### Goals question
One user group pointed out that we are missing some additional context within the goals question, though realistically this feedback can be incorporated across the questionnaire, around service members who are leaving active duty but are going to continue their service in either the National Guard or Reserves. This is incredibly valuable feedback for moving into a future version where we can capture more specifics around an individual more clearly.
> “Maybe you can add something [a goal] for people who are leaving active-duty service but are staying in the reserve or National Guard. There are a lot of people that go into the National Guard [after active-duty service]. Not having it on here is a disadvantage.”

Overall, users appreciated this page for providing an easy entry point for users and to help users get into the mindset of transitioning or thinking about their benefits. 
>	“When I retired, I knew exactly what I was going to do, but that was in 2013…. Now there are people who don’t have that kind of forethought.”

Users that we tested tended to spend more time on this question, choosing different goals to see if that affected the outcome on the Results page.

#### Length of service question
The users we interviewed for this were all from varying sections of the VA and different Veteran Service offices. Users were focused on this question with regards to making sure that their specific benefit or service was represented correctly. 

Users were able to easily understand and pick the answer they were looking for. Several users also continued to go back to this question to change answers to see how it impacted the outcomes on the Results page. 

Some users spent more time trying to understand this question. A suggestion was made to the team to shift the question to “Have you served longer than 2 years” to simplify it for users. 
-	This is an interesting point that the team can take forward to a future version for consideration.

#### “Are you currently serving?” question
One user needed clarification on this question with regards to differentiating from Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard. 
-	We mentioned in the interview that differentiation by type of service is something we’re planning to add in future versions.

#### Time since separation question
Users easily understood this question and had no additional feedback.

#### Character of discharge Question
Overall, users easily understood this question and agreed with the need to have it in the questionnaire. Users mentioned that the addition of “I don’t know” as one of the options was helpful because “you’d be surprised how many people don’t know what type of discharge they’re getting.” Users stated that “people generally know if they’re getting a Bad Conduct or Dishonorable discharge.” However, it was implied that because there are so many varying situations, it can be sometimes hard for the person to know. 

#### GI Bill Question
Overall, users easily understood this question. One user group asked the team if the question needed to be earlier on in the questionnaire. The users were concerned with eligibility of different GI bills for people serving at different times. 

Currently, the GI Bill website has a tool to determine which GI Bill a user is eligible for, or multiple GI bills. The discussion continued with whether or not it was helpful to have our tool drill down to specifics for each person, especially since there is already another tool on VA.gov that is accomplishing this goal. 
>	“If the end result is going to be the same for any GI Bill I don’t see the need to drill down more. …Things change so often. If you drill down more, you’d constantly have to be making changes.”

#### Disability Rating Question
Users easily understood this question and had no additional feedback.

### Review your information Page
All users easily understood this page. Users quickly scanned through the answers they chose and clicked the button at the bottom of the page to move to the results page.

One user noticed that it was a little difficult to see what answer they selected for each question because there is some inconsistency in bolding of different choices. Our team is reviewing this feedback but may need to take it back to the VA Design team to review the component.

One user had trouble with the review answers when updating their answers. The component requires you to click “update results” for each question you edit. If you have multiple questions opened and change multiple answers, you need to hit the button for each question. This is another piece of feedback that can be provided to the VA Design team for a review of this component.

### Results Page
Users generally understood how the page was laid out and how to navigate it. Most users skipped past the explanation text at the top of the page and jumped directly to where they expected their results to be located. 

A few users were slightly confused about the Filter and sort. One user pointed out that “Employment” and “Careers & Employment” as filter options were confusing and redundant. They recommended that we remove one of those for clarity. Additionally, there was confusion when users selected a filter option or sort option and “nothing changed” because of the limited number of results that are on the page. The team needs to add back the “Apply Filters” and “Apply sort” button for ease of use. This is also a recommendation by the VA Design team for accessibility.

Users in this group were just as confused by the Time Sensitive benefits section as the external users were. Most users missed this box and some missed it multiple times even after being told where it was. For some reason the location of this box plus the color of it makes it fade into the background for users. We are changing the functionality of this box for Version 2. Once users found or saw the Time Sensitive benefits box, they liked how it pulled out and highlighted specific benefits that had time constraints on them. 

Many users were a little confused as to the results that populated in this section. This was usually due to a few reasons:
-	They answered a question that filtered out a particular benefit or resource.
-	They indicated that they had used a benefit or resource already and were confused when that benefit or resource ended up in the “Show benefits I may not qualify for” section.
-	There are a limited number of resources that could potentially appear.

From this, one of the users gave us this quote:

> “We would rather have someone apply and be denied for a GI bill than never apply.”

Moving forward, the team wants to take this philosophy in how the Discover your Benefits tool is used and developed. 

Users overall liked or were neutral on the Save your Results modal. Some users echoed the external user’s feedback by saying “I don’t know why I would want to save the results.”

Users from the various Veteran Service Organizations wanted a Print button instead of a save button so they could do this questionnaire with the Veteran while they were in the office, and then give a physical copy to the Veteran. Especially since a lot of Veterans that they see don’t have a computer and/or smart phone. 

Several users mentioned that they wanted the “This is not an eligibility tool” to be larger or more visible. All users stated its importance because to avoid confusing Veterans.
