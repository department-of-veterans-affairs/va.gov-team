# Veteran Transition Experience Team Charter

## Purpose
The purpose of this Team Charter is to create a shared understanding and agreement amongst our team regarding our teamâ€™s goals, roles, and expectations of working together. This is a living document that will be updated throughout the course of the project. 

## Background 
![VA logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/752336a2-690a-4572-8568-6df0d836c1f7)

Transitioning Servicemembers (TSMs) and Recently Separated Veterans (RSVs) are particularly overwhelmed by the transition process. The entire process, from planning, to separation, to adjustment to civilian life can occur over the course of several years. The change to routines and circumstances are a major change and during that time there is an increased risk of creating vulnerable populations. In addition to juggling personal challenges, TSMs and RSVs have no easy way to find the range of benefits which they are eligible for. 

Our goal is to serve as a hub that helps veterans with the discovery of benefits, understanding their eligibility, and simplifying the enrollment process so benefits are utilized more and we create earlier engagement so Veterans actually have benefits when they need them. 

## Key Outcome
![Image with target that says Key Outomes below target](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49e3d7ac-d58a-4107-97dd-31f6363d8484)

The primary goal of Veteran Transition Support is to serve as a hub that can help the discovery of benefits, understand eligibility, and ideally simplify the enrollment process. The main goals are; increasing the utilization of benefits, better awareness of benefits beyond the most well-known (healthcare, disability, home loan) as well as other non-VA benefits (SBA, DoL, etc), creating earlier engagement with active VA from active servicemembers and increasing the proportion of Veterans that engage with VA post-service.
While the initial value proposition is aimed at TSMs and RSVs, the Veteran Transition Support product is meant to be useful for anyone engaging with the VA including family members and caregivers, as well as Veterans re-engaging with VA regardless of their time since service.

- Thread conversations
- Use slack status in OCTO Slack to communicate when you are OOO

## Escalation Protocol 
![Image of a staircase](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9a03fd-3e75-49fc-96b8-d2365293f4c9)

In the event an issue arises on the project, the team will reach out to the designated points of contacts for escalation: 
- For any personnel or delivery issues, escalate to the Delivery Lead (Heather Widmont) 
- For any customer issues or issues with other departments at the VA, escalate to the Product Manager (Anastasia Jakabcin) 
- If you donâ€™t feel comfortable escalating to the above points of contact or want to escalate it further, escalations can be made to the Project Sponsor (Dan Miller) or the Ad Hoc Program Manager (Kaci Bowen) 


## Conflict Resolution
![Image of puzzle pieces that say conflict resolution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe984b76-d89c-4df8-83c4-6136e158245d)

Conflicts are bound to arise on any project. In the event that a conflict should arise on our project, we have brainstormed some strategies on how weâ€™d like to handle them: 

- Preventative: build relationships with everyone & establish regular communication / feedback 
  - Jump on a call (tone can be missed on Slack) 
- Give people a heads up about whatâ€™s to be discussed on the call so they can mentally prepare 
- Assume best intentions 
- Active listening 
- Consider what my assumptions are & what their assumptions are (identify root problem) 
- Discuss things quickly so they donâ€™t fester
- Not being afraid to talk about failure & things that go wrong 
- Avoid accusatory language
- Offer extra grace & kindness for each other 
- Take stock of your own circumstances & how youâ€™re showing up (example: is someone else really annoying you, or are you coming in with the wrong mindset?) 
- Donâ€™t take eye contact (or lack thereof) & body language personal 
- Be open to compromising
