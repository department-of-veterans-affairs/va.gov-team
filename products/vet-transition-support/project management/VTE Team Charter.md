## Background 


Transitioning Servicemembers (TSMs) and Recently Separated Veterans (RSVs) are particularly overwhelmed by the transition process. The entire process, from planning, to separation, to adjustment to civilian life can occur over the course of several years. The change to routines and circumstances are a major change and during that time there is an increased risk of creating vulnerable populations. In addition to juggling personal challenges, TSMs and RSVs have no easy way to find the range of benefits which they are eligible for. 

Our goal is to serve as a hub that helps veterans with the discovery of benefits, understanding their eligibility, and simplifying the enrollment process so benefits are utilized more and we create earlier engagement so Veterans actually have benefits when they need them. 

Key Outcome


The primary goal of Veteran Transition Support is to serve as a hub that can help the discovery of benefits, understand eligibility, and ideally simplify the enrollment process. The main goals are; increasing the utilization of benefits, better awareness of benefits beyond the most well-known (healthcare, disability, home loan) as well as other non-VA benefits (SBA, DoL, etc), creating earlier engagement with active VA from active servicemembers and increasing the proportion of Veterans that engage with VA post-service.
While the initial value proposition is aimed at TSMs and RSVs, the Veteran Transition Support product is meant to be useful for anyone engaging with the VA including family members and caregivers, as well as Veterans re-engaging with VA regardless of their time since service.

Ways of Working

ðŸ“ƒ Documentation Norms ðŸ“ƒ
Use VA tools & spaces including Sharepoint, GitHub, Jira, Mural, EnjoyHQ, etc.
Limit the use of Google docs as much as possible, unless its for internal processes
When creating documents:
Add a clear purpose to the top of the document explaining what the document is for
Use templates wherever possible for consistency & efficiency
Try to save documents in logical folders rather than having a bunch of floating documents
ðŸ“±Slack Norms ðŸ“±
Non DM culture - communicate in the public channels 
Use @channel or @team tags sparingly (ie. please donâ€™t use them a dozen times every day) 
Avoid sending non-urgent messages outside of working hours (non-urgent messages can be scheduled for working hours)
Use OCTO slack for most of our communication 
Thread conversations
Use slack status in OCTO Slack to communicate when you are OOO 
Pay attention to the length of threads, if they get unwieldy then schedule a meeting 
Close the loop on Slack threads if you do jump on a call. Add a message with the resolution, action items, etc
Fill out the OCTO Slack profiles (Name, role, team, email) 

ðŸ“· Meeting Norms ðŸ“·
Use Teams Meetings when scheduling meetings with anyone from the VA 
Go on mute in large meetings when you arenâ€™t speaking 
Camera on wherever possible (itâ€™s okay to be camera off if youâ€™re eating, traveling, or have zoom fatigue - please just let us know in the chat why your camera is off)
When possible, use the raise hand functionality to facilitate discussions 
RSVP to meeting invitations
When scheduling meetings: 
Include a description / agenda
Add company email & VA email addresses so it shows up on both calendars
Schedule all meetings with the VA for 5 minutes after (ex: instead of scheduling a meeting for 9:30, schedule it to start at 9:35)

Avoid bare links in Slack 
Use alt text on images in Slack and slide decks
Use structured documents and slide decks
Avoid flashing videos and emojis 
Use plain language when possible 

Escalation Protocol 


In the event an issue arises on the project, the team will reach out to the designated points of contacts for escalation: 
For any personnel or delivery issues, escalate to the Delivery Lead (Heather Widmont) 
For any customer issues or issues with other departments at the VA, escalate to the Product Manager (Anastasia Jakabcin) 
If you donâ€™t feel comfortable escalating to the above points of contact or want to escalate it further, escalations can be made to the Project Sponsor (Dan Miller) or the Ad Hoc Program Manager (Kaci Bowen) 

Conflict Resolution


Conflicts are bound to arise on any project. In the event that a conflict should arise on our project, we have brainstormed some strategies on how weâ€™d like to handle them: 

Preventative: build relationships with everyone & establish regular communication / feedback 
Jump on a call (tone can be missed on Slack) 
Give people a heads up about whatâ€™s to be discussed on the call so they can mentally prepare 
Assume best intentions 
Active listening 
Consider what my assumptions are & what their assumptions are (identify root problem) 
Discuss things quickly so they donâ€™t fester
Not being afraid to talk about failure & things that go wrong 
Avoid accusatory language
Offer extra grace & kindness for each other 
Take stock of your own circumstances & how youâ€™re showing up (example: is someone else really annoying you, or are you coming in with the wrong mindset?) 
Donâ€™t take eye contact (or lack thereof) & body language personal 
Be open to compromising 

Team Values

The following core values were agreed upon by the team during our Ways of Working session and are the guiding principles that we live by as we work towards our team goals.
