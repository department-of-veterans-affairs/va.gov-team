Remember to check your eligibility for each program or benefit before you apply. Some are available to both you and your dependents. And some are only available for certain amounts of time.

**Benefits for transitioning service members**

We can help guide you as you transition from active-duty service or from service in the National Guard or Reserves. Some benefits are only available while you're still serving. And some benefits are only available for a certain amount of time after you separate.
