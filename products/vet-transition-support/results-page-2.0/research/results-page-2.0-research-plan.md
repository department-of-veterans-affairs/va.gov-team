# 📝 Research Plan for Veteran Transition Experience

## Research Plan for Veteran Transition Experience, Discover Your Benefits tool, November 2025

---

## Background 🏗️

### What problem is your product trying to solve?

Transitioning Servicemembers (**TSMs**) and Recently Separated Veterans (**RSVs**) are particularly **overwhelmed by the transition process**. The entire process, from planning, to separation, to adjustment to civilian life can occur over the course of several years. The change to routines and circumstances are a major challenge, and during that time there is an increased risk of creating vulnerable populations. In addition to juggling personal challenges, TSMs and RSVs have **no easy way to find the range of benefits** for which they are eligible.

### Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)

The current product is an [unauthenticated questionnaire](https://www.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction) hosted on VA.gov and is publicly accessible.

### What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

Existing

## OCTO-DE Priorities

### Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

* **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
* **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
* **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

### Objective 2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.

* **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
* **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.
* **Key Result 3:** 100% of VA employees have access to a valuable Generative AI tool to help with their work.
* **Key Result 4:** Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)

## Research Goals 🥅

1.  Test usability of the redesigned results page.
2.  Test usability of the rewritten length of service question.
3.  Test the product with adaptive technology users.

### Outcome

We will use insights from this study to make **data-informed decisions** about the design of the results page and questionnaire for the next phase of development.

---

### Research Questions

1.  Do the design changes we’ve made to the results page make users better able to accomplish their goals of discovering, exploring, and understanding benefits that are most relevant to them?
2.  Are the redesigned filters usable and accessible?
3.  Are the redesigned benefit cards usable and accessible?
4.  Are time sensitivity, recommendation, and potential eligibility clear?
5.  Is the redesigned sorting function usable and accessible?
6.  Is the rewritten length of service question easy to understand, and does it align with Veterans’ mental models around length of service?
7.  What effect, if any, does the new results page interface have on the benefits users explore?

### Hypotheses

Our hypothesis is that the redesigned Results page will make it **easier for users to discover, explore, and understand the benefits** that are most relevant to them.

## Recruitment 🎯

### Recruitment Approach

We are focused on **TSMs and recently separated Veterans**, especially those who are not currently interacting with VA. We will use a **lean maximum variation strategy** to ensure participants are representative of Veteran demographics, with the exception of age; the overwhelming majority of TSMs and RSVs are under the age of 46. We need to include different characteristics of discharge, disability status (self-identified, not VA rating), branch of service, participation in TAP, and service in Guard or Reserve. We need to include users of **assistive technology**.

### Recruitment Criteria

Perigean will recruit and schedule **12 qualified participants** for each group outlined below.

* **Veterans:** **18** total recruits
* **Ideal completed sessions:** **12**

### Primary Criteria (Must-Haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?*

* Younger Veterans (As many in their **20s** as we can find - last study skewed older).
* 4 users of **assistive technology**.
* Veterans with shorter lengths of service who served 1-2 enlistment periods - our last study skewed towards longer lengths of service

### Secondary Criteria (Nice-to-Haves)

* **Gender:** At least **3 women**.
* **Inclusion:** At least **3 people of color**.
* **Geographic distribution:**
    * 7 participants from the east coast
    * 2 participants from the mid-west
    * 3 participants from the west coast
* **Age:** At least **4 people under the age of 30**.

I fixed the inconsistent list markers, converted the non-standard `[OCTO-DE Priorities]` and `[Veteran Journey]` into proper level-two headings, removed the unclosed `<details>` tags, and cleaned up the table formatting in the Team Roles section.

Is there anything else I can help you format or refine?
