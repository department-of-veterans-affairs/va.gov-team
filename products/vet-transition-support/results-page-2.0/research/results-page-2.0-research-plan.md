# 📝 Research Plan for Veteran Transition Experience

## Research Plan for Veteran Transition Experience, Discover Your Benefits tool, November 2025

---

## Background 🏗️

### What problem is your product trying to solve?

Transitioning Servicemembers (**TSMs**) and Recently Separated Veterans (**RSVs**) are particularly **overwhelmed by the transition process**. The entire process, from planning, to separation, to adjustment to civilian life can occur over the course of several years. The change to routines and circumstances are a major challenge, and during that time there is an increased risk of creating vulnerable populations. In addition to juggling personal challenges, TSMs and RSVs have **no easy way to find the range of benefits** for which they are eligible.

### Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)

The current product is an [unauthenticated questionnaire](https://www.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction) hosted on VA.gov and is publicly accessible.

### What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

## OCTO-DE Priorities

### Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

* **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
* **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
* **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

### Objective 2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.

* **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
* **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.
* **Key Result 3:** 100% of VA employees have access to a valuable Generative AI tool to help with their work.
* **Key Result 4:** Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)

## Research Goals 🥅

1.  Test usability of the redesigned results page.
2.  Test usability of the rewritten length of service question.
3.  Test the product with adaptive technology users.

### Outcome

We will use insights from this study to make **data-informed decisions** about the design of the results page and questionnaire for the next phase of development.

---

### Research Questions

1.  Do the design changes we’ve made to the results page make users better able to accomplish their goals of discovering, exploring, and understanding benefits that are most relevant to them?
2.  Are the redesigned filters usable and accessible? Criteria: 70% of users independently find filters. 70% of users who interact with filters are able to use them successfully. 
3.  Are the redesigned benefit cards usable and accessible? Criteria: No more than 2 assistive technology errors while exploring results page. For non-AT users, usability will be evaluated by comparing to questions asked and negative feedback from July 2025 study. 
4.  Are time sensitivity, recommendation vs non-recommendation of benefits, and potential eligibility clear? Criteria: Usability will be evaluated by comparing to questions asked and negative feedback from July 2025 study. This study identified user challenges with the framing of "recommended" vs "all", and the prototype we're testing is designed to address this confusion.
5.  Is the redesigned sorting function usable and accessible? Criteria: 70% of users correctly identify that the default sort is by time sensitivity/expiration date. 
6.  Which prototype has better filtering usability for seeing recommended benefits vs all benefits - radio buttons or checkbox? Criteria: Comparing observational insights of overall ease of interaction with the results page. 
7.  Is the rewritten length of service question easy to understand, and does it align with Veterans’ mental models around length of service? Criteria: No feedback spontaneously given about feeling left out or confused by the question.
9.  Have design changes to fix the accessibility bugs identified in the heuristic evaluation made the product accessible to users of adaptive technology, especially screen reader and magnification users? Criteria: No more than 2 AT errors.
10.  Does redesigned content for Reserves and National Guard members improve usability and confidence that users are in the right place? Criteria: Improvement over July 2025 study.
11.  Does improved usability of the results page impact users' desire for human help? Criteria: Improvement over July 2025 study.
12.  What effect, if any, does the new results page interface have on the benefits users explore? Does the product still enable the broad exploration of benefits that users appreciated in the July 2025 study? Criteria: Compare to quantitative data from July 2025 study.

Note: This current study is strictly about version 3 of the unauthenticated product. While we may generate insights relevant to the logged-in product that we are in the early stages of designing the MVP, it is not a goal of this study. We are not including questions about saving or returning to results because insights from the previous study showed that a logged-in product would be preferred by many users over saving a URL. 

### Hypotheses

Our hypothesis is that the redesigned Results page will make it **easier for users to discover, explore, and understand the benefits** that are most relevant to them by making it more clear why benefits are recommended or not recommended, making potential deadlines more clear, and making filters easier to interact with to enable the open-ended, broad exploration of benefits that users value in the Discover Your Benefits tool. We will measure ease of discovery, exploration, and understanding through comparison with results of the July 2025 study as well as the metrics listed in the research questions. 

We hypothesize that the radio button prototype will enable better product usability than the checkbox prototype because the binary of "recommended" and "not recommended" makes the full range of options more explicit.

We hypothesize that the rewritten length of service question will reduce confusion and negative emotional responses to the question by better aligning with users' mental models around service.

We hypothesize that changes made to the product after recent heuristic evaluation for accessibility will create an improvement in accessible experience for AT users, but that we will discover new issues not uncovered by the heuristic testing. 

If the redesigned Results Page does not improve ease of use or satisfaction, we will re-evaluate the design approach.

## Recruitment 🎯

### Recruitment Approach

We are focused on **TSMs and recently separated Veterans**, especially those who are not currently interacting with VA. We will use a **lean maximum variation strategy** to ensure participants are representative of Veteran demographics, with the exception of age; the overwhelming majority of TSMs and RSVs are under the age of 46. We need to include different characteristics of discharge, disability status (self-identified, not VA rating), branch of service, participation in TAP, and service in Guard or Reserve. We need to include users of **assistive technology**.

### Recruitment Criteria

Perigean will recruit and schedule **12 qualified participants** for each group outlined below.

* **Veterans:** **18** total recruits
* **Ideal completed sessions:** **12**

### Primary Criteria (Must-Haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?*

* Younger Veterans (As many in their **20s** as we can find - last study skewed older).
* 4 users of **assistive technology**.
* Veterans with shorter lengths of service who served 1-2 enlistment periods - our last study skewed towards longer lengths of service

### Secondary Criteria (Nice-to-Haves)

* **Gender:** At least **3 women**.
* **Inclusion:** At least **3 people of color**.
* **Geographic distribution:**
    * 7 participants from the east coast
    * 2 participants from the mid-west
    * 3 participants from the west coast
* **Age:** At least **4 people under the age of 30**.
