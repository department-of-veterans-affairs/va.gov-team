# Veteran Transition Support
## Product Outline

### Problem to Solve
Transitioning Servicemembers (TSMs) and Recently Separated Veterans (RSVs) are overwhelmed by the transition process. The transition process itself is a major risk for creating vulnerable populations. In addition to juggling many personal life challenges as they move into civilian life, TSMs and RSVs have no easy way to find the range of benefits and which they are eligible for. 

### Opportunity
In partnership with VEO and OTED, VA has an opportunity to specifically address TSMs and RSVs by creating a centralized resource to both navigate benefits for awareness, and make recommendations based on information provided by DoD and VA. Veteran Transition Support is a program that bridges the gap between DoD and VA for incoming Veterans around core VA benefits (healthcare, disability, education, career planning, housing) and extended benefits from cross agency partners (SBA, DOL, HUD, etc). It can be enriched by connections to various systems and services such as VA.gov personalization, Benefit Discovery Service (BDS) and VA Solid Start, as well as any other programs around Transition. 

### Key Outcome
The primary goal of the Veteran Transition Support program is to serve as a hub that can help the discovery of benefits, and ideally simplify the enrollment process for benefits with similar eligibility requirements. The goal is increasing the utilization of benefits, and increasing the proportion of Veterans that engage with VA post-service. 

While the core value proposition is for TSMs and RSVs, the Veteran Transition Support project will also be useful for any Veteran re-engaging with VA, regardless of their time since service. 

### Discovery

The VES research is conducting discovery research which consists of: 
1. A desk research review of any existing research and prototypes from VES, VEO, OTED and any other relevant studies around Transition (including those done by BDS and Personalization teams) 
2. A series of interviews with a wide range of participants to determine pain points and an ideal starting place for an MVP launch planned for September 2024, including the following groups: 
+ Internal VA subject matter experts
+ Veterans
+ Transitioning Servicemembers
+ Commanding Officers 
3. A phase of concept testing with a similar group of participants to phase 2 once an initial concept has been generated.
