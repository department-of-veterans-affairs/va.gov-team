# Veteran Transition Support
## Product Outline

### Problem to Solve
Transitioning Servicemembers (TSMs) and Recently Separated Veterans (RSVs) are particularly overwhelmed by the transition process. Transition is a major adjustment and carries the risk of creating vulnerable populations. In addition to juggling personal challenges as they move into civilian life, TSMs and RSVs have no easy way to find the range of benefits and which they are eligible for. 

### Opportunity
As part of the President's Management Agenda (PMA) and in partnership with VEO and OTED; VA has an opportunity to address the specific needs of TSMs and RSVs. By creating a centralized resource and "front door", we can help navigate benefits for awareness, and make personalized recommendations based the information we receive. Veteran Transition Support is a program that bridges the gap between DoD and VA for incoming Veterans around core VA benefits (healthcare, disability, education, career planning, housing) and extended benefits from cross agency partners (SBA, DOL, HUD, etc). It can be enriched by connections to various systems and services such as VA.gov personalization, Benefit Discovery Service (BDS) and VA Solid Start, as well as any other onboarding programs around Transition.

### Key Outcome
The primary goal of the Veteran Transition Support program is to serve as a hub that can help the discovery of benefits, and ideally simplify the enrollment process for benefits with similar eligibility requirements. The main goals are; increasing the utilization of benefits, awareness of benefits beyond the core (healthcare, disability, home loan) as well as other non-VA benefits (SBA, DoL, etc), and increasing the proportion of Veterans that engage with VA post-service.

While the initial value proposition is aimed at TSMs and RSVs, the Veteran Transition Support project is meant to be useful for anyone engaging with the VA including family members and caregivers, as well as Veterans re-engaging with VA regardless of their time since service.

### Additional Context
The project is a merger of two separate initiatives; Transition Assistant from VEO and Extended Statement of Benefits from OTED.

#### Transition Assistant
The VEO team conducted research around the challenges in Transition and created the concept for the Transition Assistant (TA). It was designed as a more structured approach to transition with clear steps and guidance for a transitioning servicemember, from creating civilian resumes, to finding employment, housing, etc. It is meant to cover the gaps between the explanation of benefits that TSMs receive from various sources such as the Transition Assistance Program (TAP) courses and the actual process of getting out of the service.

#### Extended Statement of Benefits
Outreach, Transition and Economic Development (OTED) simultaneously conducted research around the challenges with benefit discovery. The original Statement of Benefits exists is a static PDF or document that while detailed, is not an easy reference resource when going through the many activities of transition. The goal of the Exteneded Statement of Benefits (ESOB) was to provide a more dynamically navigable list of resources and benefits that change based on the person's eligibility. A secondary goal was to include a more comprehensive list of benefits and resources beyond VA; as an example OPM and DOL have a number of programs that offer preferential hiring for Veterans but those resources can be difficult to find.

### Discovery

The VES research is conducting discovery research which consists of: 
1. A desk research review of any existing research and prototypes from VES, VEO, OTED and any other relevant studies around Transition (including those done by BDS and Personalization teams) 
2. A series of interviews with a wide range of participants to determine pain points and an ideal starting place for an MVP launch planned for September 2024, including the following groups: 
+ Internal VA subject matter experts
+ Veterans
+ Transitioning Servicemembers
+ Commanding Officers
+ + [Interview Research Findings]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/vet-transition-support/research/2024-02-discovery/research-findings.md))
3. A phase of concept testing with a similar group of participants to phase 2 once an initial concept has been generated.

### Roadmap
The longer roadmap of Veteran Transition Support is still being defined, however it is likely that the project will take roughly 3-5 years to see to completion. We plan to deliver value incrementally through periodic releases, but realizing the full goal of the original ESOB and TA may be beyond the scope of a single product. Both TA and ESOB combined represent a fairly long span of time within a servicemember's life experience (from separation to living life as a civilian). Since individual needs change over time, our initial MVP will be focused around providing value quickly. As we learn from the product we will determine the level of demand and effort required to build for example the more detailed "transition assistant" experience that covers the 12-18 month period of transition to early separation.

### MVP Strategy
Our MVP strategy is as follows:
+ Jun 2024: An interim "v0" release with a sticky footer on the homepage that links to Resources and Support contact pages that contain several information hubs (currently; A) servicemember benefits B) caregivers and family members, C) Veterans (currently in the Resources and Support page but slated for its own hub)
+ Sep 2024: An initial v1 guided experience that allows the person to self-identify and provide some basic information, at that point they are shown a list of likely eligible resources. This release is unauthenticated, and relies on manually entered data.
+ Dec 2024: An extension of v1 that will hopefully incorporate BDS for eligibility calculations for a select few benefits. Authentication support remains TBD as of May 2024.
