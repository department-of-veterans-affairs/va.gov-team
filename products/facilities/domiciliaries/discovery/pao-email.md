***[Subject:] VA.gov Design Team Informational Discussion***

Hello [PAO/SME NAME],

I work on the VA.gov Facilities product team, and we are preparing to make some updates to the VA health system webpages of domiciliary facilities. To make sure that we focus on the right improvements, we would like to talk with individuals who manage and work at the domiciliaries themselves.

So we can better represent these locations on the VA.gov site, we want to gain a more accurate understanding of the various aspects of a person's experience while staying at domiciliary locations, including information about the facility itself, any potential services provided, demographics, and anything else the administrators on site would like us to be aware of.

A few of the questions we would like to ask are:

- Is the facility free-standing, or located inside another building (like a floor, or wing)?
- Who is this facility most likely to serve, in terms of demographics?
- Is there healthcare provided on site?
- Is there a referral process?

Are you available any day next week, from 10am - 11am eastern time, for an informal chat for us to learn more? My schedule is flexible, so if those hours don't work we can find some time that does.

Thank you for your help!

How is [date/time & time zone]? Our conversation shouldn't take longer than a half hour, if that works for you.

I'm looking for information about the domiciliary facilities in your region, as well as administrators or managers working on site that I might be able to speak to. If you have any more questions for me about this project, please don't hesitate to ask, but otherwise, I'll speak to you next week.

Thanks again
