# Domiciliary SME Discovery Interview

### Background

[VA Homeless Programs information](https://www.va.gov/homeless/dchv.asp)

## Calling domiciliaries directly (scheduling SME interview)

- Ask if this location is a domiciliary/has shelter services for homeless Veterans

Hello, my name is Nick Osmanski, and I'm a designer working on the VA.gov website, specifically on the pages with information about domiciliary locations. I'm trying to get a better sense of Veteran's experience at this location, so I was wondering if there is anyone I could schedule a brief interview with, sometime this week, to learn more about this facility?

I have about 20 questions, and I imagine it wouldn't take longer than a half an hour.

I will be asking for name and title, but no additional personal information, and I'm also not selling anything.

- Ask if the best format for interview: Microsoft Teams, Zoom, phone, etc.


## PAO Introduction

Thanks for speaking with me today. The purpose of this meeting is to ask some general questions about domiciliary facilities in your region, and also, to get pointed in the direction of any managers etc. on site, who I could speak to for a brief interview to gain some high-level information about the site itself.

- How many domiciliaries are there in your region?
- Examples of what we're trying to find out:
    - What range of services are provided, and at what times.
    - What the referral process is like.
    - Is the facility free-standing or a floor or wing of a building?
- Who could I speak to on-site that could answer questions like these?
- Is it alright to contact them [the SME] directly?

- We're also looking into Community Living Centers to update their site as well.

## Domiciliary SME Interview

### Intro

Hello, thank you for speaking with me today.

My name is Nick Osmanski, and I work on the VA.gov Facilities product team. We are preparing to make some updates to the VA health system webpages of domiciliary facilities. To make sure that we focus on the right improvements, we would like to talk with individuals who manage and work at the domiciliaries themselves - and that's why we are requesting your help.

We want to gain a more accurate understanding of the various aspects of a person's experience while staying at a domiciliary locations, including a description of the facility, information about potential services provided, and anything else that you would like us to be aware of, that people should know.

We are not asking for any personal information beyond your name and title, and we are not selling you anything.

If you're comfortable, I would also like to record our call for note-taking purposes. The file will not be uploaded to any location, and will be deleted soon after our call.

Is it alright if I record? [Yes/no? - Confirm yes response on recording]
