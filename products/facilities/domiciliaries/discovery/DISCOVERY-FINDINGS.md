## Domiciliary Discovery Findings

### Background

[Domiciliaries](https://www.va.gov/homeless/dchv.asp) are residential shelters that provide services to homeless Veterans (or to returning service members who may not have a home in the area to which they have returned). They can provide shelter to rehab patients, victims of domestic violence, Veterans with disabilities,  and any qualifying Veteran requiring offered services.

Domiciliaries fall onto the VA continuum of mental health care, as a next step for Veterans for whom outpatient care has not been successful, or simply isn't available (see Dr. Rabenhorst-bell [interview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/domiciliaries/discovery/eastern-co-sme-interview.md)):

</details>

Domiciliaries fall under the [Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Program (MHRRTP)](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/DCHV_Definitions_of_MHRRTPs.pdf) category of VA programs. Programs are basically packages of services (as explained by Lisa Trombley), and may themselves contain other programs/services.

Domiciliary facilities are mainly distinguished by the type of services they provide. Larger facilities may serve multiple populations at the same location. The official service categories are:
- Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (DRRTP or RRTP)
- Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV)
- Domiciliary PTSD (Dom PTSD)
- Domiciliary SA (Dom SA) [substance use issues]
- Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)
- Transitional Residence (TR)

### Domiciliary site pages

Information about domiciliary locations is present on newer VA system pages, as well as legacy site pages, but the information available about facilities and services themselves is not consistent. Pages have different levels of information availability:
- No information about services

### Domiciliary facilities and services

  #### The facilities
  - What are they?
      - Domiciliaries provide short-term to long-term residential services to Veterans experiencing a range of issues related to mental and medical heath care, homelessness, vocational, and social skills. Different domiciliary programs may focus on specific mental and medical health needs, but every facilitiy has some level of care provided on site, and is associated with a main VAMC location.
      - Domiciliaries differ from community living centers or other assisted living centers in that they do not provide "bedside" care: residents are expected to be able to meet their activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, including physical mobility and taking medications (this does not exlcude wheelchairs or Veterans with disabilities who are still able to be independent). Domiciliaries rooms can have multiple beds, ie., Veterans may have roommates depending on the program they are in.
  - Where are they located?
    - Domiciliaries can be free-standing facilities located offsite from a VAMC campus ([Valor Point VA Domiciliary](https://www.denver.va.gov/locations/Valor_Point_VA_Domiciliary.asp)), seperate free-standing facilities located on a VAMC campus ([Butler DRRTP](https://www.butler.va.gov/services/Domiciliary_Residential_Rehabilitation_Treatment.asp)), or distinct floors/wings of a building on a VAMC campus ([Coatesville VA Domiciliary](https://www.coatesville.va.gov/images/Facility_Maps/Coatesville_VAMC_Map_3-10-09.pdf)).
  - How do people refer to them?
    - "Domiciliaries", "Doms", "RRTPs", or "RTPs" are all terms used to describe these facilities, but exactly who uses what terms commonly may vary from location to location. While not everyone on site may refer to them with official names, these should be fine for Veteran-facing language on site pages.
  #### The services
  - Healthcare provided
    - Domiciliaries vary in terms of services, but the common thread is short to long-term stable housing and on site medical care. The Valor Point VA Domiciliary and [Tampa VA Domiciliary](https://www.tampa.va.gov/locations/Tampa_VA_Domiciliary.asp) are both examples of DRRTPs, offering a wider range of services to multiple populations. DTTRP facilities have onsite health care staff (ex: a full-time Nurse Practioner, Registered Nurses, and full-time psychiatrist at Valor Point)  and shuttle service to VAMC facilities for regular appointments. 
    - These facilities may also offer walk-in clinics on site, although the residential portion of the services are not walk-in. The [Denver VA Domiciliary](https://www.va.gov/eastern-colorado-health-care/locations/denver-va-domiciliary/) is an example of a Domiciliary PTSD (Dom PTSD) that offers higher-level mental healthcare services and specific treatment/therapy that may not be available at general DRRTP locations. (See the definitions in the [MHRRTP document](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/DCHV_Definitions_of_MHRRTPs.pdf)).
    - Regardless of the health services offered, domiciliaries are not intended to be permanent residences for Veterans. In most cases, programs offered in domiciliary facilities are designed to encourage Veterans to be more and more independent as they come to the conclusion of their stay (ex: [Tampa](https://www.tampa.va.gov/locations/Tampa_VA_Domiciliary.asp), [Detroit](https://www.detroit.va.gov/services/MH_DRRTP.asp))
  #### The referral process
  - How are Veterans referred?
    - Veterans can be referred to domiciliary programs via their VA primary health care providers, social case managers, VA Community Resource and Referral Centers ([CRRCs](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/CRRC.asp)), Care Coordinators associated with a VAMC system (ex: [Minneapolis care coordinator](https://www.va.gov/minneapolis-health-care/health-services/homeless-veteran-care/)), and in the case of self-referral, Veterans can call domiciliary facilities directly to begin the admissions process.
    - Word of mouth is also an important referral source
      > Word of mouth is one of our best referral sources. Veterans are more likely to believe other Veterans than non-Veterans, or [what] the government puts out on their web pages. ([Eastern Co SME Interview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/domiciliaries/discovery/eastern-co-sme-interview.md))
  - Who can Veterans contact directly?
    - Veterans can contact domiciliary Admissions Coordinators ("intake coordinators" at [some locations](https://www.portland.va.gov/services/Rehabilitation_Veterans_Recovery_House_A_Residential_Rehabilitation_Treatment_Program_RRTP.asp)) at domiciliaries themselves, Care Coordinators associated with VAMC systems, or a representative from a VA CRRC. Veterans can contact these representatives throughout the process of admisions (ie. these are not one-time points of contact).
    - If a direct number to the domiciliary is available, Veterans can call during business hours. If a general VAMC number is available, Veterans can call during business hours and be transferred to the domiciliary facility, however it may be more difficult to reach the domiciliary via the VAMC number, depending on whether the VAMC desk/unit that answers knows where to transfer the call.
  - What are the admissions requirements?
    - Admissions requirements vary based on the primary purpose of the domiciliary program (ex: DRRTP or PTSD), but they generally include:
      - If third party referral is required, a primary care provider, case worker, or other healthcare representative with relevent documentation
      - Relevant medical or financial documents that indicate a need for domiciliary services
      - Being able to independently perform activites of daily living (ADLs), including physical mobility (wheelchairs are also independent)
  - Any special elegibility requirements?
    - Special requirements may vary slighty from location to location but they can include:
      - Service animals may be considered on a case by case basis at cerain facilities
      - No outstanding felony warrants
