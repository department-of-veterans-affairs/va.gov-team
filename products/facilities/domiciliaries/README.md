## Domiciliaries

Domiciliaries are "shelters" providing services to homeless Veterans (or to returning service members who may not have a home in the area to which they have returned). They can also provide shelter to rehab patients or victims of domestic violence.

Before we can reimagine detail pages or validate potential designs with Veterans, we need to better understand these facilities.
