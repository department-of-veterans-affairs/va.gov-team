## Domiciliaries

Domiciliaries are "shelters" providing services to homeless Veterans (or to returning service members who may not have a home in the area to which they have returned). They can also provide shelter to rehab patients or victims of domestic violence.

There are currently 5 locations in dual-state status:
- [Philadelphia, PA](https://www.va.gov/philadelphia-health-care/locations/)
  - [Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VAMC](https://www.philadelphia.va.gov/services/homeless/index.asp)
- Eastern Colorado (2 locations)

Before we can reimagine detail pages or validate potential designs with Veterans, we need to better understand these facilities.
