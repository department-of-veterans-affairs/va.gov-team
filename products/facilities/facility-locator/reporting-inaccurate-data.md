## Facilities & CMS Team workflows

### Facilities team
If a discrepancy about a facility or service is reported, confirm whether the location is a VA health facility or community provider. 
- If it is related to a VA health facility, report to VHA DM. 
- If it is a community provider, follow the steps specified in 

Facility type	| Service |	Notes & Process
---	|	--- | ---
VHA Medical Centers | <ul><li> Audiology </li><li> Cardiology </li><li> Dermatology </li><li> Gastroenterology </li><li> Gynecology </li><li> Mental Health Care </li><li> Ophthalmology </li><li> Optometry </li><li> Orthopedics </li><li> Primary Care </li><li> Urology </li><li> Womens Health </li></ul> | <ul><li> A facility can indicate the availability of any of these services by adding or removing the service from the facility in Drupal. </li><li> If the service is not associated with the facility in Drupal, then the association exists with Access to Care (ATC)<sup>[1]</sup>. The ATC association between a service and facility will automatically dissolve if the billing code has not been used in the last 30 days. </li></ul>
VHA Medical Centers| <ul><li> Urgent care (UC) </li><li> Emergency care (ED)  </li></ul> | <ul><li>  A facility can indicate the availability of either service by adding or removing the service from the facility in Drupal.  </li><li> If the service is not associated with the facility in Drupal, then the association exists with ATC and LH must reach out to ATC to request a manual change to remove the service from the facility if the relationship is not valid. Unlike the above services, they are **not** auto-removed. <sup>[2]</sup> </li></ul>
VHA Medical Centers| <ul><li> Dental Services </li><li> Nutrition </li><li> Podiatry </li></ul> | T<ul><li>  A facility can indicate the availability of any of these services by adding or removing the service from the facility in Drupal.  </li><li> If the service is not associated with the facility in Drupal, then the association exists the DST table in CDW. </li><li> These should be auto-updating but discrepancies in these services  should be reported to LH. [TBD]. 
VHA Medical Centers| Caregiver Services | <ul><li> A facility can indicate the availability of caregiver servicces by adding or removing the service from the facility in Drupal. </li><li> The LH API source of truth for Caregiver services is an internal service and ultimately Caregiver Records Management Application (CARMA)<sup>[3]</sup>.Contact LH to resolve discrepancies outside of Drupal </li></ul> 

<sup>[1]</sup> Access to Care associates facilities with services through billing codes. 

<sup>[2]</sup> [LH Slack explainer thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02BTJTDFTN/p1718720223648529).

<sup>[3]</sup> Because of downstream dependencies, Drupal cannot be the source of truth for Caregiver services. Changing the process could result in depays in processing for caregiver program applications. 


### Helpdesk (CMS Team)
If a discrepancy about a facility or service is reported, confirm whether the location is a VA health facility or community provider. 
- If it is a community provider, see the Services process for [Community care providers and pharmacies](#services) 
- If Helpdesk (CMS team) learns about any incorrect Facility data in context of Editor contact, follow the steps as above.

If Editors havenâ€™t taken action after CMS Team suggests next steps, CMS team should contact Facilities team to escalate to VHA DM team. Create a post in DSVA Slack, #facilities-support, and include the following:
 * Identify which facility needs Editor action (provide a link)
 * Ask for escalation to VHA DM
 * Tag Facilities DM & PM, and cc: CMS Team DM & PM
