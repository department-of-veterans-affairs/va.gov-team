## Facilities & CMS Team workflows

### Facilities team
If Facilities team learns about any incorrect VHA Facility data, contact VHA DM for follow up with the relevant Editor.

Facility type	| Service |	Notes & Process
---	|	--- | ---
VHA Medical Centers| Urgent care (UC) / Emergency care (ED) | [LH Slack explainer thread](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02BTJTDFTN/p1718720223648529). UC/ED services can come either from Drupal or from Access to Care (ATC). Unlike other services, they are **not** auto-removed from a facility if the billing code has not been used in the last 30 days. We must ask LH to manually reach out to ATC to update the data.


### Helpdesk (CMS Team)
If Helpdesk (CMS team) learns about any incorrect Facility data in context of Editor contact, flag with Editors to follow the runbook above.

If Editors havenâ€™t taken action after CMS Team suggests next steps, CMS team should contact Facilities team to escalate to VHA DM team. Create a post in DSVA Slack, #facilities-support, and include the following:
 * Identify which facility needs Editor action (provide a link)
 * Ask for escalation to VHA DM
 * Tag Facilities DM & PM, and cc: CMS Team DM & PM
