# Facility Locator Engineering README 

The Facility Locator is a vets-website front-end product in VA.gov, that sits on a vets-api backend. The Locator uses Mapbox via API key for mapping functionality.

The vets-api implementation is integrated with the Lighthouse Facilities API, and a growing list of other data sources.

To run the Facility Locator locally, you can run the front-end only, or you will need to run vets-api locally to modify the API itself. 

Technical documentation is broken up, then, into 3 sections: 
1. Working with the Facility Locator
  * Vets-api / backend
  * Front-end
2. Data sources / API integrations
3. Supporting the Facility Locator
  * [Incident response](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/engineering/README.md#incident-response)
  * [Facility Locator technical diagrams](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/engineering/README.md#technical-diagrams)

# Data sources & API integrations
`/engineering/data-and-api-integrations` contains information about each data integration in the Facility Locator. 

Each subfolder contains an implementation .md file with details specific to that integration.
