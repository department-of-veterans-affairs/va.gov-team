*Documenting consistency issues with VBA facility data. Accurate as of 10/24/2016. Will attempt to update as issues are resolved but the source of truth should always be the data itself.*

### Issues
1. Spurious leading/trailing **?** characters in the "Comments" field, e.g. `?Appointment recommended`. This is observed frequently enough that it looks like a data conversion issue, or possibly there was a "?" character in whatever form the offices filled out that was not erased before data entry.

1. Varying formats for hours: `7:30 am - 4:00 pm` vs. `730AM - 4PM` vs. `8 a.m. - 4 p.m.` vs. `8 am to 4:30 pm`. All variations of uppercase/lowercase, periods/no-periods, to/-, spaces/no-spaces are seen across different records. VHA data in contrast is well standardized with a single format `730AM-400PM`. Even if that's not what we want to display we can at least convert it easily since it's uniform.

1. Varying formats to indicate "closed" hours: `Closed` vs. `NA` vs. `none` vs. `not open` vs. `0`. VHA data in contrast uniformly uses `-` to indicate closed. VBA may need one or more additional values such as "Appointment only" but allowed values should be decided at the top level. For things like "Open every other thursday", the comments field should be used. Also should suggest consistent verbiage for "Closed on all federal holidays" 

1. "Other Services" is a free-form field with a length limit - a number of entries are cut off. The length limit will be difficult/impossible to avoid in a GIS shapefile but the corresponding data entry mechanism should have the same limit so people don't enter data that gets cut off.

1. Phone/fax number consistency is overall better than hours information, but it would be nice to standardize on a format e.g. `XXX-XXX-XXX` or with extension `XXX-XXX-XXX x YYYY`. A couple facilities included multiple phone numbers for individuals or departments in the single phone field which will make for awkward display.

1. Typos/grammatical errors: `Assist beneficiaryâ€™s in the fiduciary program`, `Glemdora CA`, `7:30am-40:O0pm`, `Fort Belvoir Wariror Pavilion Bldg` etc. We can't catch 100% of these but somebody could sit for a couple hours and scan through and catch most of them.
