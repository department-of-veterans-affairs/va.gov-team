## Knowledge sharing session between Ryan Koch and Napoleon Kernessant

**January 6, 2022**
Recording of and notes from a knowledge share regarding recent work to top tasks/non-clinical services.  
The discussion includes useful information about both back-end data structures and front-end templates for anybody looking for context around this work.

Some key points:
- Moving top-task pages (Billing and Insurance, Medical Records Office, Register for Care) from a catch-all content type (VAMC Detail Page) to their own specific content type (ex. VAMC System Billing and Insurance)
- A GraphQL query to fetch non-clinical services in a VAMC system.  The query is shared between all of these new content types.
- Overlap between non-clinical services and health (clinical) services.  This overlap is manifested in the sharing of a template used to render the service locations.
