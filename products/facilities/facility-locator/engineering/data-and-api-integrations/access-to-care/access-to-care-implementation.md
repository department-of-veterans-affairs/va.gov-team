# Access to Care implementation README
Last updated: 2024-01-02

Access to Care provides information about wait times and satisfaction scores for various services offered by VHA facilities. These scores are also used to understand which services VHA facilities provide. This source is not used to determine Dental services.
* Accessible via the public internet
* Satisfaction: https://www.accesstopwt.va.gov/
* Wait times: https://www.accesstocare.va.gov/

## Usage in the Facility Locator
Is specific to Facility Locator Detail pages. 

Most facility pages on VA.gov are generated by the CMS. Access to Care data for wait times / satisfaction will appear on the CMS-generated facility page, and will _not_ appear in that facility's Facility Locator record.

Some facility types do **not** yet have CMS-generated pages (e.g. a new facility opens and doesn't yet have a published CMS page). If a Facility doesn't have a CMS-generated Facility page, and _does_ offer Services, the Facility Locator record will point to a Facility Locator Detail page (e.g. https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vha_691GD). These pages included Access to Care data (wait times, satisfaction scores). 


Access to Care may no longer be relevant to the Facility Locator when all Facility types have CMS-generated facility pages, and Facility Locator detail pages are no longer necessary.
