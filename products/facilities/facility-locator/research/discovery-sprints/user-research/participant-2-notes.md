# Facility Locator Usability Session Notes (DRAFT)
# Participant 2	
## 10/28/2019	1pm – 2pm	


## Introduction - 5 min

**Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities. Before we start, a few things I want to mention: This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. You won't hurt my feelings. We want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
*yes*

## Background - 5 min

**Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly?** 
*Response: What that situation was? I guess it was about 2 mos ago. I've been out of state..(audio) That was probably....just VA facility, one of the places I regularly go. I use the choice program, where I can go some place local. It went fine. It was in...(audio/PII) Pennsylvania. It was a rheumatologist recommended by the VA. Everything went fine. I just got back yesterday. Well, except that I just got a letter that they (audio)....I only went to this place because the VA sent me there. It's a place I was assigned to go by the VA...(audio) not within 200 miles so they sent me 1.5 hours...(audio) bill had this problem before...(audio)*

**Have you ever looked up a facility on VA.gov?** *Response: I go to My HealtheVet, which is probably like the same. No, normally I go to (audio)...*

**I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?** *Response: I see that, alright. Am I doing anything else?*

**Maybe just pull up that Va.gov address. I'm looking at that zoom screen. Type in va.gov in that. It might be easier that way.**

## Usability Test - 15 min
**I'm going to ask yu a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing.**

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
**Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?** *Response: Let's see. I guess I would go into 'send a secure message to my health care team'. Should I click there?*

**Sure. Then visiting a location, what would you expect? How would you find the location from here?**
*Response: Um, well, I think that if I understand, through the VA, I have to go through my primary care. I'd have to tell them, I'm having this problem, can you give me a referral? But maybe I'm not doing this right. For some place I am already active, I go to secure messaging. Normally I go through my primary care and if my next appointment is two months away and I'm having this problem or whatever, I ask what can I do?*

**Let's say then that you do need to research but you don't know which one to go to. How would you find locations near you, their services, hours, things like that?** *Response: Let's see. I pretty much know the ones near me, but you're saying if I need to research from this screen...I don't know...hmmm. Schedule and view....I haven't really used this screen. And if I was on this screen...how can I talk to someone now?*

**How would you go about finding a location?** *Response: Um, veteran crisis...I'm not in crisis. There...um...again...I'm not sure, not that familiar to this screen, I'd usually go straight to my provider. For right now, this looks more like a crisis situation, but I'm not in a crisis. I've had a few emergency situations in the last year...(audio). If it's a real emergenecy, then I call 911 and the VA takes care of it. If I'm about to do something, crisis (audio)....*

**So at the top, there are a few options there at the top....VA Benefits, about VA..** *Response:Ok..there's a find a location, ok.*

**I notice that you didn't see that before. Can you explain why you didn't see that?** *Response: I didn't look there because My HealtheVet, there is a bunch of things up there. Now that I'm here (...)*

**Awesome, so then what would you expect?** *Response: no, I'd think it would be there. I would put my zip code, then what (...)
Oh! Cemetery and service type. My zip code Oh, there it is (...) Oh, community care might be interesting, might be my local, pop-in there anytime kind of place. VA health is strictly through the VA, you know, VA hospital, VA doctor's office. Community care would be like the rheumatology, it's through community care, non-VA health, only go there with paperwork from the VA so should I click on it?*

**Choose VA Health** *Response: Do I want to search all faciities? But there are so many.*

**If you were to use this tool, would you want to search (...)?** *Response: yeah (...) this guy (gastro)...*

**What if you were using the map to choose? How would you do that?** *Response: um, let's see. What about this bottom thing, use my location? Oh, what did I do? (...) showing me the two places are (...) wait. Where am I right now? I'm about here. Elmira, should I click on it and see what (...). Ok, so it's a clinic.*

**Any other information you would need to see on the map to make it helpful?** *Response: Hard one to answer, I am map (...) hard for me. This map wouldn't help me. My wife (...) I'm bad with directions. It would be alright for my wife. I could use the plus, minus.
What is that? What did I do now?*

**This is a bug. Use the back button, refresh the screen and that should take us back.** *Response: *Oh! We found a bug. Now it looks different. What happened there?*

**This might be part of the bug. Hit search again. It looks like you found me another bug.** *Response: Now I'm looking at gastroenterology. I've been to (PII)...maybe it zoomed out. If you zoom in (...) plus (...) nope, still. Given that this list has expanded quite a bit. let me change from gastro to audiology. I know that is right in (PII) and ...it's strange, I don't see my place. I see the plus but I don't know that that means. I know there's one in (PII) which should be right about here. (PII) is the closest one. Oh yeah, that's right I do go to (PII) for Audology. I think what I am seeing until I look where I am and look for the closest one. They might be the closest one. (PII) is closer. I though I clicked on one that said (PII). um....hmmmm....maybe it didn't say (PII).*

**I saw it as well.** *Response: Well, where did it go? The arrows are so big. (PII). So I don't see the (PII) one.*

**Since you can't find it on the map, how else would you find (...)?** *Response: hmmm...you know why, I went back to gastroenterology, 
Let me go back to audiology, now it should come up. There it is. It was my fault. Somehow it went back to gastroenterology. (...)
ok so that part (...). Dental should also say (PII). That's audiology. Why is it doing that again? I'm finished with that. Ok. so it should still say (...) Got it. Let me try urology. Oh see...I'm right about here. This is one that I can go to a local guy in town (...) 
A lot of the specialty stuff they con't do at the facility. An hour away or something with a referral ...) within 20 miles or something
(...) nothing really close to me here (...)that other one Mental health care, that (...) Wellsboro*

......

**For the sake of this conversation, let's say you are looking for gastrology...I can never say that.** *Response: you can only say it right if you're looking at it. Now I search (...)*

**Using the list on the left, (...)** *Response (...) 76 results....I would go down here and see which one is the closest. The closest is 60 miles. I would just go there and look for the closest one.*

**Click on it from this screen, scroll through the presented info to learn (...)** *Response: I see the hours.....urgent care, primary care, ok, appointment wait time. That's pretty good, it tells you for gastro, why would I go there, it would take me 3 months to be seen. That's why they send me to the VA hospital. There aren't too many of these guys. Derm (..). Mental health, they don't like to have us wait for that. Existing patient wait times. So people already in the system still have 49 days to go. That's why they came out with this community care. More than (...)days, more than (...) miles (...) more local place, typically a Va Hospital. They give me the paperwork to take to them. It usually works out pretty good. (...)veterans satisfaction (...)this would be interesting. (...) Everyone is pretty happy with that. Specialty care, 93% they have to wait (...) seems to give me more information than (...) So this, this is good. This here. This VA.gov gives me a whole lot of things other than health care, I see benefits (...)*

**In regard to this location, what would you want to know about the physical location, ramps, accessibility criteria, the way it looks, 
when you actually go?** *Response: Directions would (...)and I say(...) ramp available, wheelchairs, stuff, oh that's interesting because )...)just had cataracts done. VA paid for me to go to the regular doctor. (...) But he was a Vietnam veteran too so he said he would see what he can do (...). I don't know, I don't see here, (...) I need a wheelechair, ramp, I don't see it (...) health care services. So if I (...)for me rightnow, that doens't really (...) Never know what it's in the future. That community care (...)
Mission care act (...) I don't really see. How do I know if there is a ramp, if my wife is taking me, how will she get me into this place? If I find the Buffalo (...)*

**You'll have to go back to the previous tool.** 
(...)
**That might have been on the tab that is to the left.** *Response: oh, so I now could go back again. Now I can go back and VA Health
Look at (PII)....hmmm...oh. where did (PII) go? I lost it. Can you hear me muttering? That's the one I want to see but it's not...sigh...how do I...I'm on gastoenterology, maybe Buffalo doesn't have that. I don't know why (PII) is not (...)I don't know how I got here. I want to go to find a VA location. Oh, you know what happened? It's only showing me the ones in Pennsylvania. (...)postal code, VA health, maybe I do the plus thing? It says show all facilities but it was on here a couple of minutes ago.*

**You're looking for the Buffalo location on the map. What would you expect? What would you (...)** *Response: Well, I wanted to check about parking, ramps and things like that. Glad I'm not in wheelchair...park, someone (...)Anyway I already know that...
that's  (..)I'm here. (...)That's not too far. Ok, well, I guess I am a little confused on the map sometimes. Search. I just went to orthopedics, search. It seems like sometimes you have to do it twice. Again, if I go here...hmmm. Now it's showing me (...)Emergency care, that's why they usually let me call 911. I'm 170 miles away. This is probably this (...)but that's becuase VA has really cut down on emergency because they let you go to local hospitals. Urgent care, let's try that.*

**What do you thnk the differences are between emergency and urgent care?** *Response: Emergency...like heart attack or something. Urgent care, I broke my toe or got a cut that's bleeding. Something like right away vs (...) Is that what you would think?*
**(...)I just want to make sure(...)**
*Response: Urgent care, right now lots (...)...even Walgreen's and all (...) right now where I am , really isn't anything to go to
I'd to call my local (..)*

**For the sake of time, w'll need to move to the next question. I appreciate your throughness (...) There are not many more questions. 
I'd love to know generally, how would you rate your experience from 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?** *Response: So the whole tool?*

**Specifically finding a location**
*Response: Ok, well, I would probably say like (...)talking or I'm unhappy with the map (...)ok...4.* 

**A 4? You're locking it in?**

**You mentioned (PII) for example, what other information for planning would be helpful?**
*Response(...)yes. because I have been to (...) walk in since it is such a gigantic place. They have an info desk but sometimes no one is there an you just have to wander. Follow this arrow, follow that arrow. So maybe a pmap for go to this floor, that wing, that would be helpful to navigate your way once you get in.*

**that makes a lot of sense. Do you have any questions?**
*Response: so this survey that we just did, this is through the VA? To find out who knows how to do thee different things?*

**Yes, so we can make sure it works appropriately. So we can make the right tool.**
*Response: This is the whole or just the find the location? I'm on a few Vietnam vet specific sites, (...)don't even know eligiblity
(...) prostrate cancer(...) automatically get benfits (...)if a veteran (...) My father is 96, just died a year ago. VA will pay for burial, widow gets cash. I didn't know until my father died. (...) wouldn't know (...) visit my father. VA is so big. (...) but your Americam legion, VFW, so there you go...*

**I appreciate you telling me that.**
*Response: Did some other guys/ladies sign up for this? Was I the only one?*
**It's one person at a time**
