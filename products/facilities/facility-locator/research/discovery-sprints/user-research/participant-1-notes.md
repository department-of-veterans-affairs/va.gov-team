## Introduction - 5 min

**Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. It will just be you and I talking today. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes or so.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. You won't hurt my feelings, we just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.**
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.**

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** *Response: I have no problem with that* 

**I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.** *Response: by all means, please.* **Thank you**

## Background - 5 min

**Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly?** *Response: Um, the last time I was there, and you asked me to be honest. The last time I was there was to request a different doctor. Since I have been going to the outpatient clinic, I have had four doctors in three years. The last guy when I was there put inaccurate information in my record and didn't even seem to care that I lost 12 pounds. So I was there to find a different doctor.*

**You mentioned it was an outpatient clinic Excuse my naviete but (something like can you explain...)...** *Response: The primary care doctors are there. There are specialists there as they have room. Like they have a podiatrist there and I think they can do x-rays there now.*
  
**How did you find out about...** *Response: It was the closest one to where I was living at the time.*

**Have you ever used VA.gov to find a location?** *Response: Oh yeah.*

**What were you looking for? Did you find what you needed?** *Response: Eventually, yeah.*
  
**Can you expand on your experience? Can you tell me where you went? What type of facility was it (urgent care, emergency, community care, etc)?** *Response: If I remember right, it was the time that they issued my electric scooter. I didn't know there was a location in the area so I think I went in to search. I think I typed it into the search. It took a little bit of looking, little bit of clicking around. I am used to how the military works. (...) There's usually a hyperlink that you need to click on.*

**I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?** *Response: I'm sorry where is the website? I clicked on the wrong thing. Now I need to share.* 

**Just the website is fine** *Do I need to click the sound?*

**You can just hit continue to the new VA** *Response: Ok.*

## Usability Test - 15 min
**I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. Be as vocal as you can.**

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
**Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?** *Response: So, I had a flu or needed to go to the doctor quickly. Is that the scenario?*

**yes** *Response: So from here, I would choose "schedule and view".* 

**Ok What would you expect if you click that?** *Response: I'd want to know I am in the right place with the title and brief description. And this tells me. It's appropriately placed and the yellow gets my attention. And that's what I would click right there if I really needed the doctor.*

**From here what would you click?** *Response: From here, I wouldn't click anything, I would just call. But now I see that number is for the crisis line and I wouldn't call that. Since you asked me to be honest, an employee told me not to call this number unless you plan to "off yourself". Because as soon as you dial that number, it starts the process. They begin to send police (....) I've heard great success about that number so I'm not sure why they are telling people that. So I wouldn't call that crisis line, I'd use confidential chat.*

**Now, let's take a look at the list of facilities. Which location would you select to visit and why?**  *Response: Ok*

**Scroll to map** *Response: Ok.*

**You have two options here. You can either "Allow" or enter your search using the search bar.** *Response: Generally I will punch in my zip code. I find I get better results that way.*

### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning

**Ok, if you look at the map on the right, how would you select the location?** *Response: First I would look at the list on the left. I don't think the map is zoomed in enough based on my entering the zip code... instead of the big zoomed out...I mean, it's nice to know there are so many locations. But since I.... But since there's nothing to the north... As a veteran knowing you're looking for help, when they're looking for help, since they usually don't ask for help, when they do, it's because they don't think they can handle it and we can handle a lot. So since they are reaching out, they need help relatively quickly....This many results showing up on the map, it's reassuring that there are so many places we can go.*

**Go ahead and select the location you would visit. Scroll through this screen and talk me through what information would be helpful for your upcoming visit. What would make you choose it from the list?** *Response: When I first started...just glancing at the list, I saw (PII) and I know this one. Ooops (...)*

**You can just click the back button** *Response: This is what happens when you ask infantry man to play with computers. This is what I could see. I know (PII) isn't very far away. Maybe location then.*

**Is there anything else that would help you make the decision to visit?** *Response: Um, if there was a place to put in your address. I don't know that many poeple would use that, if you could see your location compared to where the places are. The distance thing is huge. I have mobility issues, two small children and my wife and we only have one vehicle. So if I could see visually on the map, like, that's where that clinic is or that treatment facility, I could plan out my day, plan out my vehicle. It would be a visual reference instead of the distance numbers.*

**So if you choose from the list, (...) awesome What infomation would you need to prep for your visit?** *Response:*uh...That's actually more info that I would have expected but it's good to know new patient wait times because unless you live with your head in the sand, if you play attention to the news, the wait times to see a doctor are long, like outstandingly long. I know they've gotten better but to see it on the page right there. If I've never been to this clinic, it's going to take me nine days.*
- *Um, This is what I was describing (...) It isn't only (...)*
- *Mental health is another facility down the street, they don't advertise (...)*
- *Didn't know about cardio; Derm, yes; Gastro, speciality care, that's kinda vague.*
- *Obviously the first thing I would go for is the main number.*

**You mentioned mobility issues. What other info (...)** *oops (...)*
**It's Monday, it's allowed. Still finishing my coffee while we speak.**

**Anything else you need to know about the location?** *Response: I do like the google street view, probably if I have never been to this place before. You know, back in the day, we had to do personal recon the day before - Like where is this place? How long will it take to get there. What does the building look like, how's the parking? (...) What the parking lot looks like. If they were to add anything, maybe something like 'view on map' somewhere close to the map....ok that's what it looks like. and maybe full screen, so I can pan, tilt, look around the place.*

(...)

**Anything missing that would be helpful?** *Response: Like I said, if I had the flu, if I was really feeling like crap like I was yesterday. I have two little kids and they are like biological weapons. If I needed to see the doctor, first thing I would do is to call that number right there. (...)*

**Feel free to stop sharing anytime you want. First off (...) From a Scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate ease of use?** *Response: To find the nearest faciity and everything? It was pretty easy. I do feel like I need to share something. Before the military, I spent 12 years in information technology. Yeah, I know, I'm statistical outlier. If I wwere my dad's age, I might not be as tech savvy. Um, I don't know how, I am familiar with how the website works. Also the military websites in the VA are set up (...) military minded  (...) Someone from a different generation of the military wouldn't be as used to how it is. We had to do a lot of online training. Ridiculous amount. Hours and hour of online internet training (...) Online makes sense for affordability but there are certain things you can't do on a website. (...) older vets by any means; they might not be as familiar with the layout or functionality of the pages.*

**Since you're still sharing the screen (...) use the dropdown... VA health (...) There are a couple different options. Can you give your opinion on the difference? What do those mean to you?** *Response: VA health is like I said, if I had the flu and wanted to see my doctor, this is where I would go. I didn't even think to click on the dropdown. Community care, I assume is like urgent care kind of place. Benefits, in this scenario I wouldn't have needed. But if I needed to talk to some if something got screwed up. Cemetery...it as just the flu... not that bad off. Vet center... I have a personal thing wih the vet center, some people tell me I can use it. Some people say I can't. I can't get a straight answer so I wouldn't click on that. (...) I hope it was helpful (...)*

**Thank you for your honesty (...) You should be hearing back from Shannon or Brian about the gift that you should get for (...)** *Response: Very very welcome, glad that I could help.*
