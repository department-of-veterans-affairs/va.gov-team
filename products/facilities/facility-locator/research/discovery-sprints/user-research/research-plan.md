# (WIP) Research Plan for Facility Locator, October 2019

## Goals
This research plan is for the Facility Locator Tool on VA.gov - VSA Facility Locator team.

The Facility Locator is VA's single source of truth for customers to find VA facilities and location details about all VA facilities, across VHA, VBA, and NCA.

Our objective for this research is to learn the current user behavior on the tool and to identify areas of improvement, including the following areas:
- Facility/Service/Provider information & hierarchy
- Language and classification of facilities 
- Overall usability of the tool
- Overlap with other tools on VA.gov
- Error treatment and language

#### Research questions:
- How easy/difficult is it for a user to find a facility?
- What ways do users navigate to the facility locator?
- What criteria are Veterans looking for when searching for facilities?
- Do Veterans understand what the different facility classifications mean?
- What other tools/sites do vets use to find facilities or services?

#### Hypothesis:

## Method
Remoted Moderated Usability Testing will help us gain a first-hand view of how veterans and caretakers use the facility locator tool. We will watch for trends in behavior, workflow, and interactions with content. 

We will be testing the current [VA.gov Facility Locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations) through Zoom.
