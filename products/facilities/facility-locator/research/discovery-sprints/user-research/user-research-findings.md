# Facility Locator Discovery Research Findings WIP
November 2019

## Methodology
We conducted moderated user testing sessions with 7 participants, all Veterans, during the week of October 28 – November 1, 2019. The participants were recruited through the DSVA's recruitment contract with Perigean. Sessions were conducted and recorded via Zoom.

Transcripts and notes can all be found in the [Facility Locator Discovery Research folder.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/new/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/discovery-sprints/user-research)

## Summary
We found six high-level trends regarding Veteran objective when using the tool and overall usability of the tool.

1. **Veterans search by a specific service and by distance when choosing a location to visit.** The Facility Locator proved most helpful when Veterans understood what services they could receive from locations nearest to them. Rural Veterans in particular know that they will have to travel to larger towns in their area and or in another state to recieve specialized care. They depend on the Facility Locator to provide them with business hours, service, and sometimes directions that their caretaker can print.

2. **Veterans need consistent information between online and physical locations** and are skeptical of information presented on VA.gov. Veterans receive information from multiple sources and it is confusing when that information is conflicting. VA locations may be named differently on Google Maps or on a search engine than they are on the Facility detail page on the VA.gov site. This leads to a lack of confidence and trust in the information provided to them on VA.gov. In this study, some Veterans mentioned that the hours listed on the website were not consistent with what they have experienced.

3. **The map is useful when it is interactive** and when it shows landmarks relative to VA locations. Veterans also want to know their location in relation to all of the VA locations shown on the map. When scrolling in the map, Veterans tended to get lost as there was no anchor that listed their current location. Rural Veterans mentioned the landmarks near the location they wanted to visit were helpful to understand the area. There is an opportunity to provide information like parking or on-site directions for caregivers and Veterans.

4. **There is a need for multiple entry points to the Facility Locator tool.** Each person in this study either mentioned or clicked on the health care section of the VA.gov homepage when trying to find a VA location. When prompted to find a location due to a medical situation, participants expected to schedule an appointment or find a location based on a specific medical service. When prompted to find a general facility, most participants located the tool in the header after some hesitation. There is an opportunity to plant the Facility Locator tool in multiple areas on the VA site. The Online Scheduler was the main area Veterans tried to locate a facility as they expected the action to include a location choice.

5. **There is a need to see some location information at a higher level.** Though the location specific pages proved helpful when preparing for a visit, Veterans call a location when they have questions or need help. For that reason, partipants mentioned that showing the service(s) they chose and facility phone numbers on the search results list would prove beneficial. 

6. **Separate workflows and acccess to location information creates confusion when trying to find a VA location.** Veterans have a general understanding of the difference between Urgent and Emergency care, but could not differentiate which facilities provided those services. Participants were able to identify VA health facilities and cemeteries because of the iconography on the map, but could not differenciate any other location types based on the iconography. One participant mentioned that a "key" would be helpful so they could more clearly recognize the icons and what they meant.

## Recommendations
The following are recommendations to consider during the redesign of the Facility Locator Tool:

- Include a link to the facility locator tool on high traffic areas of the VA.gov website
- Paginate the search results or show a scroll bar 
- Attach a number to locations on map
- Show one most relevant location followed by list to browse
- Provide option to select multiple services
- Surface relevant location information on the search results
  - Phone number
  - Today's hours
  - Directions
- Include a "preparing for your visit" section on the facility detail pages that include:
  - Physical information like parking, on-site directions, wheelchair availability information
  - Services and doctors
  - Helpful information for caregivers
- Move New and Exisisting Patient Wait Times up on the detail page


## Additional Research

### Urgent Care Research
There was a usability study conducted in June 2019 that included finding urgent care locations. It can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Health%20care/UrgentCare/Research/June-2019/findings.md)

#### Findings from the Urgent Care research matched findings from this study including:
- Bugs with the interactive map
- Users assuming VA Hospitals were urgent care facilities
- No user used the "Find a VA Location" link in the site header for the urgent care use case. Home page pathways that users followed (from most used to least used) include:
  - Search - More than half of users
  - Health Care (clickable heading near the bottom of the page) - Some users
  - Contact Us (which does lead to the VA.gov location finder) - Few users
  - Find a VA health facility, benefit office, or cemetery (blue box in the lower left corner of the home page) - One user

#### The following findings from the Urgent Care study are helpful to the Facility Locator Discovery research:
- User expressed confusion at the "Service type" field changing from optional to required
- Users looked for "Urgent Care" in the drop down menu under "Search for"

#### Recommendations from the Urgent Care study that are relevant to Facility Locator:
- Moving “Find a VA Location” closer to “Search” and/or “Contact Us”
- Removing the location finder link from the navigation, and integrating it into the existing “Search” drop down similarly to how it has been integrated into the “Contact Us” drop down.

### Community Care Research
There was a research study conducted around Community Care in May 2019. It can be found [here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/tree/ead0fe129bfee6b8e7eaae59d7f4f681a37dec15/Products/Global/Facilities_Locator/community_care/1_discovery)

#### The following findings from the Community Care study are helpful to the Facility Locator Discovery research:
- Veterans anticipate entering city or zip code and provider specialty criteria to establish a suitable set of results.
- 5 of 5 participants expect and would use a tool that utilizes geolocation (location tracking) to provide results.
- 5 of 5 expect to choose a provider specialty up front to make the results more relevant.
- Although location is the main factor driving decisions, Veterans also want to see:
  - Number of years in practice
  - Education
  - Services offered by the provider
  - Services offered by the facility
  - Average wait time for an appointment
  - If new patients are accepted
  - Ratings and reviews from a reliable source
  - Additional biographical information
- 5 of 5 participants expect to find the provider’s phone number listed along with the name and address.

### Teams/Products Impacted
This is a living document of features that overlap with the facility locator: TBD.

- Homepage (four white boxes) 
- Schedule Appointment Tool
- Logged-in experience


## Additional Research
There were topics we could not cover during this intial discovery session. The following are topics that still need to be  investigated.

- Mission Act knowledge
- Urgent Care eligibility 
- Map usage
- Caregiver usages of Facility Locator Tool
