# Facility Locator Usability Session Notes (DRAFT)
# Participant 6
## 10/30/2019	11am – 12pm
## Introduction - 5 min

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

**Moderator:** Awesome I’ll get started. Are you still there?

**Participant:** Yeah I’m here

**Moderator:** My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities

**Participant:** Okey Dokey

**Moderator:** Before we start a few things I want to mention. The entire session should take about 30 to 35 minutes. Please be as honest... I will not be offended by any opinions And please give as much feedback as you can give me.

**Participant:** Oh I’m honest to a fault so I’m good with that. 

**Moderator:** If at any time I’m happy to do that. Are you comfortable recording?

**Participant:** That’s fine. The government has my DNA I don’t think there is much more you can take from me. Yeah that’s fine


## Background - 5 min

Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly? 
- Can you tell me where you went?
- What type of facility was it (urgent care, emergency, community care, etc)?

**Moderator:** First things first I’d love to get a recent time you visited

**Participant:** Let’s see I went once very two weeks since July. And they are quite often recently. It was for a broken hand and my neurology. Plastics was the worst experience of my life. But it’s been the only … Location kinda sucks but it’s understandable. No it was the staff there. It’s really nothing you’re concerned with …

**Moderator:** Sorry

**Participant:** Not your fault. It’s in *location redacted and I’m almost in *Location redacted*. It’s just fighting *highway redacted* all the way down. It’s understandable—it’s centrally located

**Moderator:** Is that the closest one that provided that service?

**Participant:** Yes I’ve got a former emergency room turned VA. 30 minutes. Specialists there are few and far between

**Moderator:** The location you visited?

**Participant:** Min *Location Redacted* VA so it’s everything


- Do you remember how you learned about that facility and what made you choose to go to it?

**Moderator:** How did you learn about the facility. How did you choose it?

**Participant:** I think  I went there for voc rehab about 6 years ago the first time. I was medically discharged from the VA. So I was processed through the *location redacted* VA

**Participant:** My Primary is a VA that is at the *redacted location* community base outreach center


- Is there anything you wish you would have known about the location before your visit?

**Moderator:** You mentioned the location in *redacted* that was far from you. Is there something you could have found out online?

**Participant:** No, but I’m unsure. My wife was medically retired. Her dad is also medically retires do we’ve got a long line. I’m a cop by trade.


Have you ever looked up a facility on VA.gov? 
[If yes] What were you looking for? Did you find what you needed?
[If no] How could a facility locator be helpful to you on VA.gov?

**Moderator:** Have you ever used the VA Website to look up a location

**Participant:** I probably used it to pull the address the first time. I was on there a few weeks ago a about other web locations other CBOCS (Community-Based Outreach Center) not just to use to see just out of curiosity

**Moderator:** You were looking for address did you get what you were looking for?

**Participant:** Well I got there a few times so I think I did. The most un-user friendly website in the world.

**Moderator:** I’m glad I’m talking with you

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

## Usability Test - 15 min
I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing.

**Participant:** Yes It’s a bunch of text. This is the first time I’ve used. I’ll just share the full screen.  you got it?

**Moderator:** Yes. I’m going to walk you through a scenario move slowly. Think out loud. You won’t hurt my feelings. 

**Participant:** Gonna hide this mission act thing because I don’t’ care.


### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?

(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)

**Moderator:** Lets’ suppose you have a medical

**Participant:** Look and read through hey look it’s right there in the center. There’s a lot of screen. 

**Moderator:** Why did you pick that?

**Participant:** Because you told me ….

**Moderator:** You clicked “don’t allow” 

**Participant:** I’m used to using 10000 I don’t let it save things passwords ... location for that search and then used search *(user typed in zip code)*

**Participant:** This one is my *(users uses mouse pointer to indicate locations on map screen)* this is where I went to the … Over here this one. *location redacted* nope. Zoom in. Somewhere over here is somewhere I need to go for my pension that’s the only facility I’m not sure of around there that I use.

**Moderator:** Can you walk me through icons

**Participant:** That’s probably a medical facility… No idea what little people are I think CBOK. Hey vet center didn’t know that existed. And then this is well I already clicked it so that’s not really fair.. Out base benefit office that sorts of things. Whoopsies where’d it go.

**Moderator:**  You found our bug.

**Participant:** You mean the VA website has a bug? Nah It’s a government resource I’m not jaded at all


### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning
[If they landed on the VA Locations search results]

Using the map, how would you choose the facility you want to visit?

**Moderator:** Which location would you visit through the map.

**Participant:** If I go to somewhere I don’t do very much I got to *location redacted*. If I need the ER I’d use the choice program. I’m not even positive which one it is I’m not even sure. Oops found it again. If you click twice it glitches out

**Participant:** Google. So much better than anything else. Mapquest sucks and I’ve never heard of this program … Yup 820 that’s it what’s where I go for my…Took longer than I expected.

**Moderator:** When you typed in your address there were a few location that you 

**Participant:** Let me go had to reset everything

**???:** If were to look at everything on the left how would you find what you needed

**Participant:** Use deductive reasoning. 

**Participant:** That *(user references location on map)* I know is the old hospital It doesn’t say that it’s the VA state home may be lumped under the same facility. I guess they got away from using the term CBOC Community Based Outreach Center (old term for the clinics) not a VA hospital. Not even VA employees. *location redacted* vets center didn’t know existed. Mobile clinic didn’t know that existed

**Participant:** There’s he main *location redacted* VA which interesting on google is not called *location redacted* VA medical Center. *user goes to google maps inputs location*. Change to “dallas va  helps if I type a *User demonstrates how name is different on google, location redacted*

**Participant:** Is fine for me because I don’t get really threatened by weird things but for someone looking but most people aren’t that observant. Little lack of faith in humanity. Voc Rehab they’re a useless office yeah if that wasn’t there I would (cemetery) I would have no idea what that was. Cool yeah I think I’ve comment4ed on every single one. 


Now, let's take a look at the list of facilities. Which location would you select to visit and why?  
(Note path in detail. Make sure they voice why they might have selected something before allowing them to continue.)




### Task 3 - Prepping to Visit
[If still on search results]

Go ahead and select the location you would visit. Scroll through this screen and talk me through what information would be helpful for your upcoming visit.

**Moderator:** Choose which ever one that you would probably most likely visit (*shows on map*) Scroll up and down

**Participant:** For as much as the VA put a focus on mental health the number is small. X-ray there and is there.  Mental health care he looks like Gene wilder. He’s a weirdo. New Patient wait times. I haven’t been a new patient for a while. Existing patient wait times ….that might be right. I usually just go to sick call what it doesn’t have anfpo on it’s enrolled in my healthy ver secure messaging which I use all the time. 

**Moderator:** What do you use that for?

**Participant:** Secure messaging?

**Participant:** When I was tearing down a house I stepped on a nail. Come in in the morning and we’ll get you a tetanus shot. One of the medicines she gave me I refuse to take. I’ve used it a few times not enough to go to sick call but … Usually respond within a day or two. Maybe something that non-urgent and don’t need to go in able to use my-healthy vet. Pushing on us signs in every office. Another way to push it.

**Participant:** Hey *name redacted (off audio comments about women’s health)*

**Participant:** That’s not true – birth control – had to get a  referral. 

**Participant:** Specialty care. Knowing half the people that work there I don’t think that’s true as well.

**Moderator:** Talk me through your opinion of that.

**Participant:** It’s not right at all. You see this little tan building. Annotate. *(user is drawing on the screen)* They are right there. That’s not right at all. I take the exit that‘s right there that you can’t see. Cowboy chicken

**Moderator:** Would there be anything else you’d need to see regarding physical

**Participant:** No but that *(user indicating pin)* is a visual location you’re not getting to any where near here this is a….The names of the stores is helpful but have never been to clinic. The map is OK. Yeah hours of operations seems right even thought they open the doors open than that. They do have select Saturdays because my father in law. This is probably template and what every CBOC page and nobody from the local made updates.

**Moderator:** That’s’ good to know of

**Participant:** Current as of today. I did get to the bottom right? I have no idea where this came from *(user refers to satisfaction scores)* I’ve never been asked to give a survey. We already have preconceived notions and we don’t need the VA telling us how they’re doing just being honest. Every person in the country knows about the VA whether they like it or not which is a PR nightmare.

**Moderator:** Luckily I’m not working int PR. Any questions for me.

**Participant:** Here’s that little mental health thing



[Follow up if they didn't choose "Find VA Locations" in header] Will you return to the homepage? Let's say you don't have a medical situation, but need to visit a VA facility for another reason, how would you do that from this page?


## Post-test Questions - 10 min
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
- From a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?

**Moderator:** Stop sharing screen. Follow up screens 

**Participant:** Okey dokey I bet all your observers are laughing

**Moderator:** 1-5 rating:

**Participant:** It was easy to find a location so 5 I guess

**Moderator:** Icons on map

**Participant:** Those get a 2.

**Moderator:** Why?

**Participant:** I didn’t know what half of them were. I shouldn’t have to click on them to find out what they mean by looking at names. 

**Participant:** I’m sure you already know this as a trainer you know this visual learners and people who are just gonna look at the picture word those pictures need to communicate message without needing. A key would be helpful this picture means this. One of the first things you learn in elementary school.



- What would you say the difference is between urgent care, community care, and emergency facilities?

**Moderator:** Difference between community care and urgent

**Participant:** You mean like an ER and a regular doctor. I didn’t know that. Urgent care means Tricare doesn’t cover it routine care means they might cover it. Tricare and VA are he same when they get the billing. I don’t know if that answers your question.


- What information do you need to see online in order to visit a facility? i.e. phone number, address, services, etc.

**Moderator:** What information would you need to see online to be prepared

**Participant:** You know what I didn’t see there? Now I’m going to look again. Oh look there it is there is a directions link. So that might be smart to put it under the address. Not that it’s all about me

**Moderator:** It’s all about you right now

**Participant:** Not really, but anyway directions are on there because in all honestly I’m going to all them and say do I need anything. Because they are supposed to send that you to you with out. Most you’re not going to go with you

**Participant:** That was a really dark joke

**???:** You gotta laugh when I can

**Participant:** I suppose phone number is right under the address then address directions Hours of operation here. So I mean. Some one minor improvement really trivial some people click on maps and whatever service you settle on and that’s just personal preference nothing mind-blowing.
Last comments

**Participant:** I have comments on everything. The only thing that seems absolutely unnecessary are the veteran-reported satisfaction scores because honestly they’re not gonna be used.

**Participant:** I’m just gonna do this for shits and grins I’m gonna go to *location redacted* and see if it’s any different

**Participant:** Mobile VA medical center.

**Participant:** Their hours of operation are not on there at all . that’s fine that’s fine that’s fine it’s templated and that is how you get there. *Location redacted* VA does *location redacted* doesn’t have I could have sworn it had one unless it’s a page within the *location redacted* VA page either direction because I would have sworn *Name Redacted*. *Name Redacted* is my doctor I could have sworn.

**Participant:** For new patients anytime we go to new doctor I do copious amount of research… I do hours of research on the doctor of for son He is. but yea that might be helpful who the doctors are there if they’re allowed to and if turnover isn’t crazy. I’ve had 23 different doctor first one was not asked to come back after medical leave aka fired that would be helpful if its’ itf its’ what s the word I’m looking for if it’s feasible
