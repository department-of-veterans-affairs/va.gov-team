# Facility Locator Usability Session Notes (DRAFT)
# Participant 5
## 10/30/2019	10am – 11am
## Introduction - 5 min

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session**, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

**Once you are recording:** I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.

## Background - 5 min

Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly? 
- Can you tell me where you went?
- What type of facility was it (urgent care, emergency, community care, etc)?
- Do you remember how you learned about that facility and what made you choose to go to it?
- Is there anything you wish you would have known about the location before your visit?

Yeah lets see i mean its been a while but i'd say that we visited... i guess theres two ways to think about it
I was on a booze allen contract working for the VA that ended in 2014
I imagine you're talkinga bout being a vet and seeking services?

Yes

It was more about helping my father I guess. I'd say that overall it was fine. It wasn't close to where we were living -- tht was hard it was a 30 to 45 min drive. Once we got there, the VA isf airly well laid out. He needed a brace for his leg -- i'm talking about most recent I have health car through work but I have helped my father. We went and got fitted and came back a couple weeks later to get the brace. Didn't take a long time nad it's a big VA

Do you remember anythinga bout the physical locaiton? Anything difficult or easy about maybe when you arrived??

It's big so we had to park far away. I waould drop him off and have him sit in the front. I'd park and then pick him back up. We would bring wheelchair depending on how he was feeling. Obeiously it's expected that you will be walking a bit. It's not urban so the advantage is that it's a large campus and there's plenty of parking. Nothing that would deter us from going or make it a pain.

How you learned about location?

Its funny because I think it was through the actual Vet service org that helped my dad they may have even driven ther ewith my mom. They don't drive very often and mom and dad are older. Don't want to deal with a lot of traffic. they are not very good at nav on fone they don't have smart phone. They printed out a map and shoed my mom how to get there. When I'm around I would drive him for anything he needed. It really isn't hard to find, ti's a failry easly location. There's a gigantic VA building.

Anything you wish you knew before visit?

Um, don't think so. very straight forward. I think it was designed for folks who have mobilitity limitation. What I hate is that some hostpitals or vlinics not va you can't stop and it's annoying bc i have to get wheelchair and get in it. I have to do it further down and it's high traffic -- some of the smaller clinics really annoyed me. What I like about VA is you can fit 3 o4 cars in the front. LIke a hotel check in you don't want a pile up right there. they take some time to get people in chairs and get them going. Plenty of room.

Have you ever looked up a facility on VA.gov? 
[If yes] What were you looking for? Did you find what you needed?
[If no] How could a facility locator be helpful to you on VA.gov?

I don't think I have because the VSO helped my parents get that one and I have not had to do it myself I mean or if I did I would just do it in Google Maps and see what shoed up. I understand you're probably designinf ro a dif demographic that would go to the site for that resource.

**(share link)** I'm going to share a link with you. Once it loads, will you share your screen with me?

## Usability Test - 15 min
I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing.

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation
Let's imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?

Well if I have a medical issue, I would go to the health care bucket which I really like. You are mapping out very quicily. I work at schwab and we have the problem where we have a lot of dorpdowns in the top where you get lost. Having this landing page would be helpful so I think that's good design. 

What would you click on to find a locaiton?

If I wanted to find a location - participant reading list of info in white boxes - oh okay so i guess i understand why it would not be here. evne tho health care draws my eye, i would clikc in the top here. if i need a location i have to search back up to top.

### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning
[If they landed on the VA Locations search results]

Using the map, how would you choose the facility you want to visit?

I'll just do _city_ and then i'll search. I guess what i would do is i know what general area i'm in so um yeah i guess to make it more accureate i should have put the postal code so i can see exactly... i don't know what mileage means if it's just  city limits. I guess I would zoom in if i'm in south city what is easeist to get to? it looks like based on traffic maybe going - great that's awesome when I click i see the exact facility. There are some locators  that don't do that and its super annoying. its a good connection to say i clicked and i can call and get directions. that is great. miles seems fine so I guess it is uing my lcation even tho i didn't say block or allow my location. The only other thing I would be looking at if i was planning a visit is i would love to see clinic hours. That might be theclosest but maybe they close in 39 min. would loe to know what are the hours of that clinc. it's only a little bit firuther away but I could still do that. 

You foujnd our bug. You can go back and refresh the screen.

That's the only thing is I would be looking for clinic hours.

there are a few icons. What do you think those mean?

This seemsl ike a major medical type location or clinic so that makes sense to me with the hospital sign. these other signs maybe it's admintstrative. i don't know it looks like paperwork. This maybe seems idk maybe a resources doesn't seem medical related. Oh it is maybe a smaller clinic that's how I would look at the symboliy maybe this is major medical and smaller ones. Oh okay that's a cemetery That seems a little... that makese sense. If you ar elooking at 1, if i'm looking for health care I don't want to see a tombstone. Idk tat could be weird. If I am llooking to pay respects I guess that's fine too Mixing medi with cemetery could be a little bit insensitive. I did that that is a tombstone just seems out of place. 

If you could locate the faiclity you would visit and go a head anc lick on it.

Let's just do this one. 
Great okay. Go ahead and select the location you would visit. Scroll through this screen and talk me through what information would be helpful for your upcoming visit.

so this is where you have the hours. thinking back maybe it's a lot to put in the other screen unless it was a dropdown or something. It would make the other screen really busy. Great address I can call -0- it would launch google maps that s great. Servicies lets see I can see what things I can access there. This is interesting, appointments. Would that show me my appts?

How would you interpretate that?

I guess if i clicked and you track my IP or lgoin that would be awesome if it were showing all of my appts coming up at that facility. I know that is a I guess peoplare more accustomed to that if they are looking to get directions to the airport or what time your flight is. Existing patient wait times, that's good to know. What you all have on the landing page seems to make sense what woule I be loking for? The only other thing is outside of the democgtraphc is you can send the directions to you rphone. Idk how many people would make use of that. i would look tos ee what else is here and browse that. I don't think anything is missing.

Good to know thatnks. There's a view on map section. What is your feedback on that? What would you like tos ee there?

It's a little hard to read, I don't know if it gives me any ref points. Hard to read the actual street. The other map I had a sense of wehre it is inr elation to me. Not useful unless I could hover over it and it blew up a little and maybe it showed where I was or... I could see another again this is maybe we are accustomed to advacned things. Show what traffic is like, a live traffic feed. May bee to far. First of all I ahd a sene of where it was in relation to me. The map I can'se ee a lot. If you hage a map here it may be useful to have it be a popu por something so you don't take up real estate or something like taht. So I could see landmarks near and things like that. "m sure you have done studies on who is using these. If I"m thinking of my father, my mom would go to the website and look my dad wouldnt the VSO help was importnat there. My mom would literally print out a mapquest map. I think that... there's everal things you think about the vets the caregives and demographics and how they would interact.

Will you return to the homepage? Let's say you don't have a medical situation, but need to visit a VA facility for another reason, how would you do that from this page?

I guess now that I knwo it's in the banner, I would do Find VA location up there. IDk again i'm sure ppl have concerns at my work we map the IP and show the nearest branch to you. And we just serve that up. You don't it's hard because that's all we have. There aren't different kinds of resources. ARe they llokginf or admin or healthcare? idk if you could do that?

I want to ask about hesitancy with clicking at the top. You mentioned HC grabgec you attention. Would you rather find a location by a specific service or another way?

I almost feel like there oculd be some utitliy in having the locator embedded in each subject area with afilter. if i clicked on the locator in Health i wouldn't see resource or cemeteray i would only see clinic. that would be a way of filtering the map upfront. if im a caregiver i have to figier out waht symposl mean and waht i'm looking for. maybe it is organic to eachof te boxes. Look for healthcare or look for disability. Taht way is is very focused waht is presented o the perosn. I could see if yo're in an urban are like NYC maybe the map looks really crowded. If I could see that being really helpful so all I'm seeing is health care. 

## Post-test Questions - 10 min
I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
- From a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?
- What would you say the difference is between urgent care, community care, and emergency facilities?
- What information do you need to see online in order to visit a facility? i.e. phone number, address, services, etc.
