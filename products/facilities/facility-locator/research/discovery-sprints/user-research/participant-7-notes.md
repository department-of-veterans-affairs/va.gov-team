# Facility Locator Usability Session Notes (DRAFT)
# Participant 7
## 10/30/2019	1pm â€“ 2pm
## Introduction - 5 min

*From the Zoom chat: I am on a company asset, and am not authorized to let an external entity view my computer (there is no guarantee that my files are protected) is this a problem for the study?*
 - As a result, the decision was made to not screen share but to conduct the interview verbally only. The Participant gave consent to record the audio. 

## Background - 5 min

**Have you ever looked up a facility on VA.gov?**
*Response: Only infrequently for information as I do not use the VA for healthcare. Probably looking for info on finding facilities before.* 

**Can you remember the last time you did that? Actually, let me back up. I apologize for jumping right in...(...)
Since we're not doing the full session, this won't be the usual 30 minutes. We want to hear your honest opinions. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today? It will be deleted after the notes are completed.**
*Response: yes*

**And just to verify on record, are you ok with me recording the audio?**
*Response: I am ok recording.*

**When did you use VA.gov?**
*Response: I'm on the web page right now. I'm using the location finder.On the map I'm seeing different icons which I guess correspond to different services at the facilities.There are many facilities in my area. At first glance it's clear that some are medical centers.
Cemeteries are clear too. I have to guess at what the other icons are, I don't see a key or anything.* 

## Usability Test - 15 min
**How did you get to the location finder?**
*Response: well, at the header of the website, there are two drop down menus and 'find a VA location'. I clicked on the header.*

**When you clicked on that, did you allow your location from the browser?**
*Response: no, I typed it in. Looking at the map first and the icons there, immediately I typed in the zip code for reference and searched all facilities, as the default and then search. (....) Now I see that if I had gone to the drop down, there is a key for the symbols in the map. That's the only place that I am seeing that information. So, if I do just what I did, it's the fastest, and then zoom to narrow down the choices (...)*

**I want to step back and ask about that last time you visited a physical location and what that experience was like.**
*Response: I cannot recall.*

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation

**That's fine. So using this website, are you more incluined to use the map or list and why?**
*Response:I think ordinarily I would use the map since I am in an urban environment so transportation is my first concern, like convenience and proximity. Second if I was looking for a specific service I would search by (...) I thought is would be by service I would pull that out (...)*

### Task 2 - Choosing & Learning

**For the sake of this conversation, imagine that you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, how would you choose one?**
*Response: Sure if I needed a medical facility, I would just either look at proximity and then on the map I would click on... I tried to click...*

**You found the bug.**
*Response: It backed me all the way out. The map is gone.*

**Refresh the page.**
*Response: Gotcha. That's ordinarily what I'd try to do, drag and drop. Since that didn't work (...) use the drop down: VA Health, Search, I get the other options. It provides the phone numbers. I assume calling the hotline would allow me to learn which ones will serve my needs.*

**Which page are you on?**
*Response: The VA find location page. I would prefer to use the dropdown for everything...dental services...narrow it down.*

**Choose one of the locations** 
*Response: ok* 

**Where on the screen did you click?**
*Response: The map...it actually pulled it up.*

**Are you on the page for that now?**
*Response: It just gave me the bubble to what it is linked to it,  defined it as (PII), gave the address, number (...)
Right before that...(...)

**What else would you need to see to have enough info to visit?**
*Response: Um...since I went to the granular level of dental services..maybe if dental services had a direct nmumber or hours. Like if I had an urgent dental need, like I chipped a tooth or got into a street brawl and had my four front teeth knocked out. (...)
process of eleiminations to get more information...(...)not ideal with my front teeth knocked out. Like maybe (...)
yes/no urgent dental...hour (...)*
(...)

### Task 3 - Prepping to Visit

**Ok, click into that. Are you are on the page with more details about that clinic?** 
*Response: Yes, it gives approximate wait times.*

**Can you scroll down the page and talk me through your feedback on what would be helpful to see or if anything is missing about details?**
*Response: well, for some reason in the dropdown menu on the find a location page, I specified dental services and this location popped up but when I chose this location, there is no mention of dental services. That's a little bit less helpful. As for, let's see, the wait times are pretty helpful. Maybe putting those (...), extract that data on the find the location page. I feel that would be a big determining factor, if they have choices, in an urban environemnt. Is there a way to put wait times in a little bubble, if I'm looking in a certain zip code, cardiology, it shows me three options for medical centers, if that could pop up in each location, pulled out for that specialty. If I could see that on the bird's eyeview so I know which one to call first, prioritizing those  (...)*

**Are you still on that detail page for the location? At the top right, there's "view on map"...opinion (...)**
*Ok. That's helpful. It just shows the route but for the particular interface I'm using (ms edge), there is no hyperlink. The view is zoomed in and shows the intersection. I would probably use iphone or google to type in the address. I don't think it's necessary to invest in that, I can't use it to navigate.*

**Ok, that's all the questions I had for you on those few screens. Is there anything else that would be helpful to you if you were  
planning a trip to this location?**
*Response: Not that I can think of. I'm not your best candidate since I don't use VA health care. I have plenty of friends with lots of opinions, though. (...)

**I appreciate you chatting with me (...)**

## Post-test Questions - 10 min

**I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.From a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?**
*Response: Finding a location on this website, I'd say a four.*

**Why a four?**
*Response: Based on the fact that I had to spend a few minutes getting familiar with the webpage before I knew what information to give it. My initial confusion was not knowing what the icons meant, since the default is search for facilities. But searching for all facilities doesn't show all icons. (...) You need to use that drop down. Maybe a banner in the header at that eye line to showcase the icons you are about to see , not literally titling it that but find Va locations and next to it and the bubble icons in the line, in a row then people are familiar, like I don't know what those mean, let me find out. I didn't know what I was going to get into.*

**What would you say the difference is between urgent care, community care, and emergency facilities?**
*Response: Urgent care could be um, for nonemergency situations without an appointment. Emergency care, hopefully people are using only in emergencies and not to jump the line for regular care. I don't know what family care is.*

**Oh, it's community care**
*Response, I still don't know what that means.(...) no problem I'm glad that I was able to help.*

**Of course. That's all I've got. I appreciate your feedback. (...)**
*Response: (...)I know there are plenty of people who use(...)One testifies on the hill against the VA, 
another one is out of the country on assignments (...)
