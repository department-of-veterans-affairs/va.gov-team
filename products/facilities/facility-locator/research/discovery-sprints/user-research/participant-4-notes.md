# Participant 4
## 10/29/2019	1pm – 2pm	

## Introduction - 5 min

**Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. It will just be you and I talking today. Today we're going to talk about how the VA.gov website can help you find VA facilities. Before we start, a few things I want to mention:**
- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes or so.**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. You won't hurt my feelings, we just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.**
- **If for any reason, you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.**

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
*Response:  Sure, no problem. I don't have anything to hide.*

## Background - 5 min
**Think back to a recent time when you visited a VA facility. If you're comfortable, will you describe that situation briefly?**
*Response: I visited a specialty lab. They've recently remodeled the (PII) facility. It was beautiful, nice. In the last few years, the wait times have gone way down for the most part. Seems more efficient, people are very nice, I'm really happy with that.*

**Do you remember how you chose that facility or how you decided to go to that location?**
*Response: I already had my disability rating while I was in (PII). When I moved 12 years ago, I looked up the closest location.*

**Was that using VA.gov? Or vet.govs, then?**
*Response: Yes.*

**Is there anything specific that was helpful? Or that you wish you would have known?**
*Response: If I remember right, I clicked on it, it described the facility, how to get there; it wasn't very complicated That was 12 years ago...don't remember more than that.*

**I assume you found what you were looking for since you visited that facility.That's good.**
*Response: For sure.*

## Usability Test - 15 min
**I'm going to ask you a few questions about the site. While we look at the website, I’m going to ask you to think out loud, working a little more slowly than you might work normally while looking at the web. Talk me through what you are doing. Be as vocal as you can.**
*Response: ok.*

### Task 1 - Search & Navigation

**Ok. I'm going to give you a make believe scenario and ask you how you would find a facility to visit. Let's say you have a medical situation that requires you to visit a local VA facility. If you used the website, what would you do?**
*Response: Well, let's see here...looing at health care first of all. uh....I would schedule and view appointments.*

**You seem a bit hesitant, can you tell me why?**
*Response: You seemed very specific for something I needed right now. In that scenario, I would be thinking about urgent care, Mission act situation. But if it was one of my specialty labs that I use 3-4 times/yr. I would use this schedule and view.*

**Go ahead and click that if that is where you would go. From here. is there any info on this page that would help you find a VA location?**
*Response: More resources, highlighted area, nothing here that I can see, going on down reading....find a location for the Va facility for your appointment*

**Where on the screen would you click?**
*Response: My cursor is on that...but...trying with my cursor ..let me try to click on it....let me keep going down. Nothing to click, not there. Usually anything you can click on is highlighted. Let me see. Non-VA providers is highlighted. I do not...let me go back up, I guess. Are you asking me to click on something to find a location?*

**Yes**
*Response: I don't see anything to click on! I don't see anything to click on to do that!*

**Ok. Can you scroll back oup to the top, please?**
*Response: ok*

**If you are to look at the top or how to talk to someone...is there anything  there that would help you find a location?**
*Response: there's a link to that. Should I click on it?*

**Is there anything here that can help you find a location?**
*Response: There's a 800 number but that's crisis number. Oh...here at the very bottom, there is a "find your nearest". That seems to be a weird way to get to that.*

**Why do you think that?**
*Response: I'd expect that to be on the first page and not have to go through the section to talk to somebody. If we weren't talking about this, I wouldn't have found that. *

**Go ahead and click on 'find a nearest medical center'. Great. From here, scroll down just a little bit and look at that map
How would you choose the VA location that you would would want to visit?**
*Response: Ok... well, how would I do it? I would use the location because of these satellite clinics. I was assigned a location several years ago/10 years ago...others too far, I've always gone there. Like (PII), it goes by my daughter's house. And we're not near a big place/shopping center so we'd go when we were by there. (...)*

**So are you looking at things surrounding that location?**
*Response: Because of everything around the location, yes.

**Look at the list on the left of the locations near you. How would you use this list?**
*Response: Looking at it...first one is (PII)...that's pretty easy.*

**Is there any info to help you choose?**
*Response: Mileage, distance. There's one thing about VA websites. They're not giving you road distance. It's crow flight distance. To the VA from my house...I remember....it's 53 miles...here it lists 37 miles. I tried to argue with them before, due to travel pay and things...You just can't go through that lake to get there. The (PII) location isn't that much father but it a takes a lot longer on the smaller road.*

**Would it be helpful for you to see some sort of variation on your trip on here? You mentioned you can't go through the lake**
*Response: Something like Mapquest...travel time, not mileage. That would be a whole lot better. Or best route, fastest route, like on my phone.*

**You can use the list or the map, choose the one you would visit. How would you view the page detail?** 
*Response: Click on the little box like that.*

**Scroll through this screen, talk me though this page...what you see, what is helpful, what is missing, what you might not understand**
*Response: ok (PII) location...where I want to be. The website is nice...directions, nice. What kind of directions? Not the same mileage you know. List of all the services, which is excellent. Looks like it upgraded since I used it. Appointments, really good. New patient wait times, meant for other folks but that's really good. Existing patient wait times could really help if I had a situation medically that wasn't super urgent that I could use my speciality location or make a determination about going to urgent care. Ok, it does have urgent care appointment here. Ok, this is all VA facilities, not just  VA facilities, that could actually be helpful.That's about what I see, Aricka.*

**There's a map up here on the top right, is it helpful?**
*Response: That little map, right here? That's absolutely wasted space.*

**Is there anything we could use that space for or add info that would be helpful?**
*Response: If I were new, had no idea, it doesn't even show the main road to get there. It should show Sam's Club. It's east of Sam's Club, you can see it from the interstate. I could see it from there. It would give you a point that most people know about, landmark or recognized. It's getting really developed. Drew Brees sports bar cost 1.3 million dollars for 7 acres. It's up and coming everything there. The one acre for Denny's was $700K. That's bizarre, someone has a racket. It will be an all new (PII) down there in the next 10 years.*

**That's good to know...a landmark would be helpful to signal.** 
*Response: Right. It doesn't even show the double roundabout near Sam's Club. The first time you go through those roundabouts, it freaks you out.*

**Anything else that would be helpful?**
*Response: I like the hours of operations, there's the phone number, mental healthe number. The wesbite on a whole is quite nice, quite usable, except for that tiny little map. I want to see the website.*

**Sure, I'm interested to see what you think about it.**
*Response: (PII)...ok...directions...driving directions...ok...starting address, driving directions as provided as a convenience
ok, let's do that again. ok. Google maps and it does give us 1 hr 8 minutes, 52 miles and the VA website is 37 miles....pretty big discrepancy when it comes to travel pay and I tried to argue with them about that and didn't get anywhere.Aricka, it's not worth the effort. You're talking about the interworkings of theVA. I wouldn't know who to talk to to get there. Like the Misssion act. The urgent care visit went fine but I went to get my presecription and the pharmacy wasn't participating. The Pharmacy didn't know aything about it. I sent it in 3  times, got it back 3 times. Now they want the leaflet that went with it, of course the first one I threw away. I went around and around and around...passing me to different people, no one knew what to do about it. Frustrating. It can be crazy.*

## Post-test Questions - 10 min

**Go back to that first tab on the top left.**I have just a few more questions to ask you before we finish up today.
- From a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being extremely dificult, 5 being extremely easy), how would rate the ease of finding the VA facility you needed?**
*Response: I'd say it's a 4.*

**Why a 4?**
*Response: it's laid out quite clearly. All except for that one click we had to do...talk to somebody. I thought, Where in the world am I going, clicking all over the website. This page is quite good.*

**One more question. Click the the VA in the blue part of the screen. I'm interested to know how you would find a location if it wasn't related to any medical situation. What would you click?**
*Response: A location? um...oh for crying out loud. I don't see anything immediately that jumps out at me at all. I've been concentrating on the four boxes. Oh...above them...find a VA location.*

**Why do you think it was difficult?**
*Response: the four boxes grab my attention.*

**What would you say the difference is between urgent care, community care, and emergency facilities? We talked about urgent care a little bit already. What do you think is the difference?**
*Response: Urgent care is more minor scale but not desperate. I just went the other day. I was broke out like crazy. I have Shingles.
I thought shingles was for old people. Weirdest part it's supposed to (...) 1 hr 8 min to get to (...) still not anything close to me
on the VA website.  2 urgent care, 21 pharmacies. I told you about the experience of having to pay out of pocket and trying to get reimbursement. I called the five first pharmacies. All five had not heard of the Mission act and filling prescriptions for Veterans. I called  a Walmart...(bay) across th  lake, Cornerstone, another in a grocery store, (PII) pharmacy. No one had ever heard of it.  All listed online and then no one. You'd think maybe one or two but all five? The disbursement of information into the community is lacking greatly. They didn't know what to do. I accidentally came across 800 number about 10 days later. It's to handle any issue related to the Mission act. Why isn't that available on any website? You need access to that phone number.*

**That would be helpful?**
*Response: Very much so!*
