  - "I was trying to find a flu shot location in the community  it does not show any locations after the 1st one which is 40 miles away for a flu shot it says 1 of 15 showing, but i can only see 1 I cannot believe there is nothing in 77042 or close by"
  - "According to both the map and all the searchbox searches there are NO VA healthcare facilities in Nebraska!?"

## Actionable feedback

| Feedback | Action | 
| --- | --- | 
| Several respondents reported the Facility Locator was down or not working. The number of responses reporting this is concerning and the team will be digging into this | Github # TBD |
| Dental services were reported as difficult to find or unavailable | Dental services are available when facility type = VA health | Github # TBD |
| Several respondents indicated the "Visit our website" link on a facility detail page did not navigate the user to another page. | | Github # TBD |
| A dozen or more responses were related to difficulty making or changing appointments | The Facility Locator does not have a connection to the online scheduling service. Has been in backlog but not yet prioritized: [[CONSIDER] Link to VR&E scheduling tool #17119](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/17119) | 
| Several responses indicate a desire to download/print a list of wallet card containing the search results. Some of these are VA employees who are referring Veterans and families | Added to backlog: [[CONSIDER] Downloadable search result list #21740](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/21740) |
| Multiple users express confusion/frustration with duplicate listings for community care providers | This is a function of the community care database as both TPAs can report the provider as in network. Practice and providers appear as individual search results |
| Users have trouble finding matching community care service type (i.e. "ENT", "acupuncture", "primary care") | This is a function of the backend system for community care data |
| User expressed a desire to search by provider name | Added to backlog: [[CONSIDER] Allow Provider search by name #21742](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/21742) |
