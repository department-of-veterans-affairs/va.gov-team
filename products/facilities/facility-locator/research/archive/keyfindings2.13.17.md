# Week of 2/13/17

Our goal for this research was to test the new additions that were placed on the facility locator including new design of SHEP data, and new data around wait times and appointments.

We spoke to 6 different Veterans to test if the new information is clear, helpful and easy to understand for Veterans.  We also wanted to know if their understanding of the data matches our intent.

The conversation guide can be found here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-research/blob/master/Projects/FacilityLocator-BlueButton_2-16-2017/ConversationGuide-2-16-2017.md

## Research Brief- https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-research/issues/94

## Key Takeaways
+ Wait times were the most important 
+ Would use google to find the information 
+ Confusion around Community Partners 
+ Was not clear that Satisfaction Data came from Veterans 

## What worked
+ How we laid out wait times was clear and easy to understand. 
+ People generally liked layout. 

## What didn't work
+ Veterans wanted more information around who they could see at a given facility 
+ National Average was not comprehensible 
+ "In the VA" was not clear we meant this facility 
+ It wasn't clear how old or new the data wasâ€“they seemed to think it was out of date unless explicitly told otherwise. 
+ Edge case observations
+ Wait time for mental health was quickest for this Veteran if she used tele-health.
