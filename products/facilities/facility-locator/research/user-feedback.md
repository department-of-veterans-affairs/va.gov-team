| _Your community care provider lookup is impossible to use. For example you can't enter just "radiology" and find a local imaging center. You have to enter "radiology" and a specific sub group. If there is no subgroup or you don't know all these different medical terms you can't use it._ | Contact Center Report | October 2019 |
