## Actionable feedback for Facility Locator tasks and functionality

| Feedback | Action |
| --- | ---| 
| Google maps does not pick up the location and cannot provide drive time | This is a known issue related to Google map link formats. Some changes have been pushed to improve this experience. Others are still in the backlog |
| Requests for facility maps in search results | Maps are required to be available in the facility webpages (results may vary) but we could consider linking to them, if they were consistently available and helpful. |
| Multiple reports for missing VA locations that are known to be nearby. | This appears to be related to the default radius and can be adjusted |
| Data inaccuracies for community care providers | I reported nearly 3 dozen to the PPMS data team for remediation as a result of this analysis. |
