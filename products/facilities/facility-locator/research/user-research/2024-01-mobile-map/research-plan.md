*** Important: research plan currently in draft form ***

This research plan is on pause while the Facilities team prioritizes another product launch. Some sections have not been updated from the boilerplate content, and others will need to be updated when the project resumes. These are a few key considerations for when work resumes on the plan:
- Complete the sections after the recruitment section

# Research Plan for Facility locator mobile map

## Background

[Facility locator product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/product/facility-locator-product-outline.md)

Veterans use the Facility Locator as the single source of truth on VA.gov to find physical locations where they can receive benefits and services. Veterans using the FL feature on mobile expect relevant and meaningful search results presented in a clear and actionable format. Veterans using assistive technology (AT) expect FL to deliver results in a format that they can navigate with ease.

Where is your product situated on VA.gov? 

Unauthenticated

What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

- Iteration on existing product. 
- Heavily used by Veterans, caregivers, general public

### OCTO Priorities 
Which OCTO priorities does this research support? 

- Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

**Increase**
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

**Decrease**
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the Veteran Journey?

The Facility locator tool assists Veterans at every step of their journey, from Starting up to Aging and Dying. 

## Research Goals	

### Outcome
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on design and accessibility enhancements to the facility locator map feature, specifically on mobile. Additionally, we are testing the USWDS segmented button group component.

### Research questions

**From existing search page**

1. What do Veterans and others expect from the location mapping tool?
- Do they interact with the map before trying to search?
- Are instructions for improving search results clear?
- How do they navigate search results if they want to learn about multiple locations?
- Do they know what to do when expected results are not returned or when no there are no results?

**From the map prototype in staging**

2. Do Veterans and others understand the distinction between map and list view?  
- Do they understand how to toggle between the two views?
- Is the numbering of search results clear?
- Do they understand what will happen if they select a numbered result on the map?
- Do they understand that interacting with the map directly will alter the list of results in list view?

3. Do Veterans and others understand how to refine and alter map view?  Do they use the zoom functionality? 
- Do they use "Use my location" feature?
- Do they notice and/or select numbered results on the map? 
- What do they expect will happen when they do?

4. Do Veterans and others find the location-specific information relevant and actionable?  
- Can they identify which facilities are closest to their desired location?
- Do they know which phone number to call for general information?
- Do they understand the purpose of each phone number listed?
- Is there any relevant information they expect to see that isn't there? (URL, site hours, etc)

### Hypothesis
Veterans and others will understand:
- How the list of results are organized and what options they have to refine or broaden their results
- How to interact with the map and how their interactions change the search results
- The difference between map view and list view, and how to move from one to the other
- Which fields are required or optional for conducting a search
- How to take the next action after picking their desired location (click on website, call, get directions etc)

## Methodology	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability testing** to observe research participants using a coded protoype on mobile devices. 
- All users must be on **mobile devices**
- Half of participants should be **screen reader users**
- Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like Zoom transcripts

### Research materials
Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

### Location
Remote, via Zoom
  
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

The target audience for our research is Veterans and others. 

### Recruitment criteria
Our research participants will be veterans and others, and we will use Perigean to recruit for this moderated study. We’d like to **recruit 12 participants** for a total of **10 completed sessions**:

**Required criteria (in decreasing order of priority)**
- All must be Veterans, spouses, or caregivers
- All must have a mobile phone and be willing to complete their sessions on this device
- All must be willing to share their screen on the Zoom call
- All must have a working microphone
- All must have Zoom downloaded to their mobile phone prior to the session and know how to share their screen
- 5 should be **people who use screen readers**
- **At least 8** should be Veterans

  
**Secondary criteria**
- At least 2 people are age 55 or older 
- At least 2 people 35 or under 
- At least 2 people don't have any degree or vocational training after high school 
- At least 2 people live in a rural or remote area 
- At least 2 people have a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI) 
- At least 3 people of color 
- At least 2 women 
- At least 2 people are LGBTQ+ 

### Screening Questions

1. For this meeting, you'll need a mobile device with Zoom installed that can screen share and has a working microphone. What kind of device will you be using? *(RECORD)*
    a. Smartphone  
    b. Tablet

2. Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions? We ask this question because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with experiences like these.
     a. No
     b. Yes *(RECRUIT 2 and RECORD as having a cognitive disability)*

3. Do you identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community? We ask this question because we want to make sure the feedback we get from these sessions represents all the people we serve. 
     a. No  
     b. Yes *(RECRUIT 2 and RECORD as LGBTQ+)*

4. Do you use a screen reader while using your mobile device? We ask this question because we want to make sure that our website works for people who use this type of technology.
    a. No *(RECRUIT 5)
    b. Yes *(ask next question)*

5. Are you willing to join the Zoom session using your screen reader? 
    a. No *(DISQUALIFY)* 
    b. Yes *(RECRUIT 5)*  


## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 90 minutes for AT users, 60 minutes for non-AT users
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
