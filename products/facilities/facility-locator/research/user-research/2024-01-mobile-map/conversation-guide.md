## Intro 
Thank you for joining us today! My name is Alexis. How are you doing today?

I work on making technology easier for Veterans to use in order to get information and benefits from the VA. 

What I *hope to do today* is to get your feedback on something new that we're working on. 

What *I don't want to do* is add to any frustration you may have had with getting services from the VA. We may talk about things that have caused you frustration, and I want you to know up front that I can't make that better for you right now. I do not have access to your records, and I don't have any contact with claims reviewers. But I'd like to understand your frustrations because they can help me advocate for improvements to the process in the future.

I have a coworker with us in this session who will be taking notes. 
[If screen reader user] *[CAIA person]* is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology during this session. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
>*(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker [and CAIA if screen reader user].

>*(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

>*(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks using a website that I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- Today we’re going to talk about the location finding tool on VA.gov. We'll be mostly focused on search results on the
map. 
- This **entire session should take about [non-SR users: 60] [SR users: 90] minutes**. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may
occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing
your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you
express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don’t want to.
- Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefts with the VA in any way. If you would like to
stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that’s no problem. Please let me
know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe
this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of
additional observers joining this session?

>If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

>If yes: Admit observers.

>*Ask the notetaker and observers to briefy turn their camera on and introduce them by name. Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session*

For part of this session, you’ll be interacting with a prototype. That means that even though it will seem like a regular website, some areas of the screen may not work as you expect them to. 

I'd like to record my screen and audio today to make sure we capture your thoughts and experiences
accurately. After we're done analyzing your insights about our prototype, the recordings will be destroyed, and
nothing you say here will be directly linked to you. If we want to quote something you say directly, we will refer to
you only by a participant number. We'll also remove any part of your comments that could be used to directly identify you. 

Knowing all of this, **are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today**?

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of this session to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing
short video clips of sessions with Veterans. 

In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly
be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips
will not be shared outside of the VA. 

At the end of the interview, I’ll also confrm this with you at the end, so you will have the opportunity to change
your mind.

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our
partners understand Veteran’s experiences?

[If yes to both]: **Once I start recording, I'm going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

*[If participant asks you to NOT record]* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

*In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save. (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

**I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: 
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners, as long as we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your device, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click **More...**)* or Share Screen *(on computer, button is green).*
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says **Share**. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the (red) "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and there should be more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## Protocol for Recognizing & Handling Trauma-Triggering
*Remember*: Getting to all the questions on your script isn’t as important as the Veteran feeling heard. Prioritize the participant over the research.
### OBSERVE the participant
*Be PRESENT with the participant. Notice their body language, tone of voice, and the environment* 

*SENSE discomfort, anxiety, nervousness, anger, teary/crying, shakiness, nervousness. Some signs may include:*
- *Prolonged silences*
- *Shifts in tone or attitude or interactivity*
- *New background noises*
- *Staring into space* 

### If notice a change, SAY one of these:
  - Sometimes talking about these types of experiences can be difficult. Do you think you would be comfortable telling me if it starts to affect you negatively?
  - This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?
  - Would you like me to stop recording?
  - I sense that this may be upsetting. We value what you’re sharing with us, but we don’t have to go there if you don't want to.
  - Do you want to just sit here quietly for a few minutes?
  - Would you like to pause, or are you OK with continuing?
  - Is this not a good time for this session?

### If resume after a break
I'm interested to hear more about...Are you up for continuing with that, or would you prefer to move on to the next topic?

### Handling other specific situations
- *If p isn't feeling well in the moment*
  - I'm sorry to hear that you're (not feeling well--repeat their words). Do you feel up for continuing? You will be compensated even if we stop early. 
    - *(If they want to keep going)* Please let me know if you change your mind.
- *If p describes something that seems unfair*
  - I hear you saying that this is unfair. It sounds incredibly frustrating. I'm sorry to hear that you've been going through this.
- *If MST (military sexual trauma) comes up*
  - I am so sorry that happened to you. I hear you, and I'm grateful you felt safe sharing this with me.

### If you notice something and want to make sure they know how to get mental health help
I want to remind you that VA can help connect you to mental health services--even if you're not enrolled in VA health care. To access services right away, call or go to any VA medical center at any time 24/7 or any Vet Center during clinic hours. You can also call 877-222-8387, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. That's 877-222-8387.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you're worried about their situation...
I realize I'm worried for you being in this situation. I don't have concrete help I can offer, but I do have a hotline number. Before we continue, would you like me to give you the number?
- If you need to talk to someone right away, you can contact the Veterans Crisis Line via phone, text, or chat anytime day or night. You can call 988 or text 838255. It's confidential and available 24 by 7.
- You could also call the Benefits Hotline at 800-827-1000.

### If I feel teary or emotional
*Turn off my camera and/or say,* I need to step away for a moment.

### When participant is fine to continue, but you're not sure you can
I hear that you're good to continue. Before we do, I realize that I need a minute--I'm going to go off video, mute myself, and get a glass of water. Is that OK with you? I'll be back in X minutes.

*(If I'm still not OK to continue)* After taking a breather, I realize I'm not able to continue. You didn't do anything wrong, and you will get paid for the full time. I appreciate your time and your willingness to share your experience.

### When a participant decides to stop the session
I don't know if you'd want to call, but the Veterans Crisis Line number is 988. It's confidential and available 24 by 7.

Thank you for your time in having this call. I honor your decision to stop and wish you well. *[Try to maintain a CALM tone]*
