# Benefits Taxonomy Conversation Guide

[Not Reviewed by Lauren Alexanderson, Subject Matter expert research not subject to review]

## For note takers

Complete verbatim transcripts may not be necessary for this study. The SME Participants will be sharing a variety of unstructured information during the conversations that may be useful. This includes:

- Missing services or context around the listed benefits
- Attitudes that veterans and caregivers have when interacting with the services
- Follow-up resources or contacts for the team

This information can be captured in short-form during the interviews, expanded upon via check-ins, and detailed from recordings during synthesis.

## Intro [5 minutes]

Hello, my name is Dave Sukharan and I'm a researcher with the VSA. Right now, we're working on evaluating the way that Benefits services are categorized and named. We're hoping to make it easier for veterans and caregivers to find what they need and better understand the universe of services offered to them.  

I have a list of questions to walk-through with you today while recording the session. But, you should feel free to treat this more as a conversation and take things "off the rails" if you think something is relevant.

We're especially interested in understanding the context around some of these service categories before we begin interviews with users themselves.

- **This entire session is scheduled for 1 hour, but it may not take that long**.
- **There is no need to turn on your camera - if you perfer, audio only is fine**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. 
  - We are not testing you, or your ability, instead, we are finding out if the website meets your needs. 
  - You cannot do anything wrong. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  - We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - [If yes]: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  - [If no]: Alright, I will be writing or typing notes as we go.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

** **START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD** **

* **I have started recording.** 
  - I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

# Interview

## Warm-Up

1. Tell me a little bit about your role.
  1. In particular, how do you interact with veterans or caregivers looking for services?

## Main Interview

### Category Labels

1. What are the common services that veterans and caregivers ask you about?
2. In your opinion, which service categories are the largest or most confounding?
3. Are all of these service categories equal "sizes"? In particular, do any of the categories contain significantly more or less sub-services than others?
4. What are some of the lesser known benefits available to users?
5. Compare and contrast the benefits listed to those available in reality.

### Context Around Services

* Do users primarily access their services via in-person, phone, or web interactions?
* Do the services that users need assistance with differ by any patterns: age, time out of service, gender, caregiver vs veteran status, etc.
  * In particular, do veterans experience with services have demographic patterns?
* Are there any changes or trends on the horizon (or recently) in the benefits that are being offered or how they are being offered?

### Pain Points for Users

1. What are common pain points for users in the benefits process?
2. When users are most upset about benefits interactions, what is the cause?  

# Closing

Thank you so much for your time and for your help today! We're excited to take this information into developing research with veterans themselves.  

* Did you have any resources or other contacts that you believe we should talk with?

STOP Recording

* Was there anything you wanted to tell us about Benefits and services that we didn't get to cover today?
