**Background**


The Facility Locator currently allows veterans and caregivers to search for many types of healthcare locations, cemeteries, and benefits locations. Each benefit location administers different services that can allow veterans access to vital services. In addition, Veteran Benefit Administration (VBA) representatives may have satellite offices or pop-up locations at non-Benefits facilities such as healthcare facilities.

We need to evaluate the naming conventions of the current services to see how they match the mental models of veterans and caregivers (users) themselves. This study is a generative research endeavor with Benefits Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) to better understand the context of each of the services before doing direct research with users.


###
**OCTO Objectives**

Objective 1: Increase the usage and throughput of VA services


### 
**Veteran Journey**

The Benefits interactions should follow a Veteran during many instances of their Journey beginning from “Starting Up” through “Retirement” and into “Dying”. The different benefits may become relevant to Veterans or caretakers during different chapters.

Arguably, the most important moment will be the Veterans first “Applying for Benefits” interaction occurring during the “Starting Up” chapter. Successfully completing that step during that chapter will have knock-on effects through the rest of the journey.


# 
**Research Goals**



1. Evaluate the current VBA taxonomy against the mental models of users: names, scope, and categorization of services
2. Evaluate the list of benefits obtained from our survey of groups against the list of services offered in reality.
3. Detect missing services or context that will allow for better follow-up questions with users.
4. Understand the major pain points around accessing benefits to better be able to prepare for users’ stories.

###
**Outcome**

The findings from this research with SME’s will feed into the Research Plan for another study directed at users themselves. The overall findings about the benefits landscape will change the way the Facilities Locator lists and classifies benefits on both the map and individual facility pages.


####
**Research questions**

Evaluate the current VBA taxonomy against the mental models of users: names, scope, and categorization of services

* What are the most common benefits that Veterans and caregivers (users) ask for assistance with?
* Are there services that you believe should be rephrased or renamed?
* Are there any service categories that encompass many different/disparate services?

Evaluate the list of benefits obtained from our survey of groups against the list of services offered in reality.

* What are some of the lesser known benefits available to users?
* Compare and contrast the benefits listed to those available in reality.

Detect missing services or context that will allow for better follow-up questions with users.

* Do users primarily access their services via in-person, phone, or other interactions?
* Do the services that users need assistance with differ by any patterns: age, time out of service, gender, caregiver vs veteran status, etc.
* Are there any changes or trends on the horizon (or recently) in the benefits that are being offered or how they are being offered?

Understand the major pain points around accessing benefits to better be able to prepare for users’ stories.

* What are common pain points for users in the benefits process?
* When users are most upset about benefits interactions, what is the cause?

###
**Hypothesis**

1. I hypothesize that some service categories sound specific but actually encompass many different types of services that users will not expect (e.g. Disability_Claim_assistance)
2. I hypothesize that some service labels sound too vague for users to imply what is contained (e.g. Transition_assistance)
3. I hypothesize that some labels utilize VBA jargon that is unfamiliar to users (e.g. IDEA and eBenefits_Registration).

# 
**Methods**

* Semi-structured interviews with SME’s

    This research is exploratory, generative and an initial run of a future research plan. The method should be flexible and broad in order to follow new threads that the SME’s might bring up.


### 
**Location**


Remote research - Zoom

Between December 7th and 17th


### 
**Research materials**

_Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan – prior to submitting a recruitment request._

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

For moderated interviews:

If recruiting outside of Perigean’s participant database:

# 
**Recruitment**

3-4 Subject Matter Experts from the Veterans Benefits Administration

Recruiting of SME’s will be done outside of Perigean. The Facility Locator VA Lead will supply the team with 2-3 SME contacts. From there, the team will snowball recruit outwards if necessary to similar job titles or contacts.


### 
**Recruitment approach**

SME’s from the Veterans Benefits Administration.

No inclusive strategies will be directly requested for this research due to the small sample size, short time frame, and narrow target population of SME’s serving users in the Benefits Administration.


### 
**Recruitment criteria**

3-4 SME’s working for the VBA to help connect veterans with services

* Do you work to help connect veterans with services?
* What is your job title and position responsibilities?

###
**Recruitment language**

Hello!
Are you available for a 1-hour interview with the VSA research team to assist veterans in better finding services?


**What is the purpose of the study?**
The VSA is conducting research on how to best list and categorize the services presented on the Facilities Locator and individual facility web pages. We would like your help as a subject matter expert on connecting veterans with services to understand the context and common experiences around this task.

**What do I need to do?**

The team will be conducting research from December 7th to December 18th. Please schedule a 1-hour time block with the team to be interviewed. We truly appreciate your help with this study!
