# Facility Locator Filter Card Sorting
May 2020

## Methodology
We launched an unmoderated self-guided card sort exercise and sent it via link to Veterans using our Perigean contract. 70 Veterans responded.

## Summary
Of the participants, these are the high level numbers:
- 44 participants completed the study
- 26 participants abandoned
- 98% located in the United States
- Median of 5 categories created (277 total categories created)
- Average time to complete was 16 minutes 33 seconds 

## Themes
**Cemetery and burial cards were most often grouped together** and usually had the most category names. The most popular category names contained the terms "after-life" "burial" or "death" 

**Veterans grouped all medical services together and often created a "medical specialty" or similar category.** Participants  usually included primary, urgent, emergency, and women's health care together 

**Cards were often grouped together by similar name, terms, or context.**
- Surgery
- Education, Employment
- Counseling

**Participants had dificulty classifying some services** and created new categories for them or listed them as "other". This could be due to the name of the service being ambiguous. For example, Infectious Disease.

**Participants sorted cards by services that are classified under separate facility types in our current taxonomy.**

## Detailed Findings
The participants created a total of 277 unique categories. Below is a summarized version, created by grouping like categories together:

| Category      | Contents                   | 
| :------------- |:------------------------- |
| Admin and Benefits | Most cards sorted into these categories pertain to benefits assistance, including education and employment help. |
| Burial, cemetery, end of life | All cemeteries or lots were sorted into these categories. 3 participants also include bereavement counseling |
| Clinics | Primary care, women's care, and most speacial medical services were sorted into these categories by 3-5 participants|
| Community-based | Community urgent care, community outreach and education, and homeless assistance were sorted by 3-4 participants, |
| Counseling | These categories differ from mental health in that participants sorted these by name. Every card including the term "counseling" was sorted into these categories. |
| Education or Employement | 3 to 6 Veterans sorted cards containing the terms "education" or "employment" into these categories |
| Emergency/Immediate | VA urgent care, urgent care, emergency care, and community urgent care were sorted into these categories by 7 participants. 3 participants also included Critical Care specialty cards |
| Family | These categories contained cards that pertain to family or group counseling. Other forms of counseling were included by 1 to 2 Veterans. |
| General | 4 to 5 participants included all primary, emergency, and urgent care types in these categories. 2 participants included Women's health services |
| Medical/Physical | All types of care (general and specialty) were included in these categories. Primary care was the top sorted card by 13 participants and community urgent care was the lowest with 8 participants. |
| Mental health | 8 to 10 participants included mental health and counseling services into these categories. 5 participants included chaplain services. |
| Specialty | All special medical services were sorted into these categories. Oncology was sorted by 18 participants and the top cards from the Medical/Physical category were sorted into the bottom of this category by 2 to 5 Veterans.|
| Surgery | 11 to 12 Veterans sorted the four cards including the term "surgery" into this category |
| Women | The cards Gynecology, women's care, women's health were all included in these categories by 11 to 12 Veterans |

### Notable categories 
- VA or Veteran specific
  - There were multiple categories that included VA/Veteran specific descriptions (e.g. VA Care, Va Personal, VA Counseling, Veteran Servicies)
- Other
  - Some cards were difficult for participants to comprehend, resulting in multiple "other" or "i don't know" or "unimportant" categories
  - These categories contained lengthy benefits related cards and services that could not be placed (e.g. chaplain, referral of other VA services)

## Comments from Veterans

> I have no idea what some of the items are. For example, I don't know if "soldiers lot" refers to a burial lot, a parking lot, or something else. Ditto for "government lot". Consideration should be given to clarifying some of the terms.

Regarding the instructions from Optimal Sort

> instructions were not very clear. Hope I did what you asked,

> How do we switch to a new category after creating the first category and list? It says to add to empty spaces the new category but there doesn't seem to be any. I will keep trying to figure this out.

> What?

Accessibility 

> As a blind person using a screen reader to access the computer the only part of your site I see is the instructions. I was able to print the screen to an OCR program to read the contents but would find it very difficult to arrange the items as instructed. Also, there are several graphics that are not recognized.

> This was difficult to navigate, I had to go at it on 3 separate occasions in order to complete and I am no stranger to a computer!
