# Facility Locator Filter Card Sorting WIP
May 2020

## Methodology
We launched an unmoderated self-guided card sort exercise and sent it via link to Veterans using our Perigean contract.

## Summary
Of the participants, these are the high level numbers:
- 44 participants completed the study
- 28 participants abandoned
- 98% located in the United States
- Median of 5 categories created (277 total categories created)
- Average time to complete was 16 minutes 33 seconds 

## Themes
**Cemetery and burial cards were most often grouped together** and usually had the most category names. The most popular category names contained the terms "after-life" "burial" or "death" 

**Veterans grouped all medical services together and often created a "medical specialty" or similar category.**

**Cards were often grouped together by similar name, terms, or context.**
- Surgery
- Education, Employment
- Counseling

**Participants had dificulty classifying some services** and created new categories for them or listed them as "other". This could be due to the name of the service being ambiguous. For example, Infectious Disease.

## Detailed Findings
The participants created a total of 277 unique categories. Below is a summarized version, created by grouping like categories together:

| Category      | Contents                   | 
| :------------- |:------------------------- |
| Admin and Benefits | Most cards sorted into these categories pertain to benefits assistance, including education and employment help. |
| Burial, cemetery, end of life | All cemeteries or lots were sorted into these categories. 3 participants also include bereavement counseling |
| Clinics | Primary care, women's care, and most speacial medical services were sorted into these categories by 3-5 participants|
| Community-based | Community urgent care, community outreach and education, and homeless assistance were sorted by 3-4 participants, |
| Counseling | These categories differ from mental health in that participants sorted these by name. Every card including the term "counseling" was sorted into these categories. |
| Disability | card |
| Education or Employement | 3 to 6 Veterans sorted cards containing the terms "education" or "employment" into these categories |
| Emergency/Immediate | VA urgent care, urgent care, emergency care, and community urgent care were sorted into these categories by 7 participants. 3 participants also included Critical Care specialty cards |
| Family | These categories contained cards that pertain to family or group counseling. Other forms of counseling were included by 1 to 2 Veterans. |
| General | 4 to 5 participants included all primary, emergency, and urgent care types in these categories. 2 participants included Women's health services |
| Medical/Physical | All types of care (general and specialty) were included in these categories. Primary care was the top sorted card by 13 participants and community urgent care was the lowest with 8 participants. |
| Mental health | 8 to 10 participants included mental health and counseling services into these categories. 5 participants included chaplain services. |
| Specialty | All special medical services were sorted into these categories. Oncology was sorted by 18 participants and the top cards from the Medical/Physical category were sorted into the bottom of this category by 2 to 5 Veterans.|
| Surgery | 11 to 12 Veterans sorted the four cards including the term "surgery" into this category |
| Women | The cards Gynecology, women's care, women's health were all included in these categories by 11 to 12 Veterans |

### Notable categories 
- VA or Veteran specific
  - There were multiple categories that included VA/Veteran specific descriptions (e.g. VA Care, Va Personal, VA Counseling, Veteran Servicies)
- Other
  - Some cards were difficult for participants to comprehend, resulting in multiple "other" or "i don't know" or "unimportant" categories
  - These categories contained lengthy benefits related cards and services that could not be placed (e.g. chaplain, referral of other VA services)
