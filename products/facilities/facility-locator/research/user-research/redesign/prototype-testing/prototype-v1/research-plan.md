# Research Plan for Facility Locator Redesign - June 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the Facility Locator Tool on VA.gov - VSA Facility Locator team.

The Facility Locator is VA's single source of truth for customers to find VA facilities and location details about all VA facilities, across VHA, VBA, and NCA.

#### Research questions:
- Is it more intuitive to have two search fields instead of three?
- How are people filtering services for each facility type?
- Is there a need for a Google-like open search?

#### Hypothesis: 
Our hypothesis is that 

## Method
Remote Moderated Usability Testing will help us gain feedback on the first iteration of the redesign prototype. We will watch for pain points in the user flow and areas to improve the next iteration of the prototype.

We will be testing a prototype [Link Will Go Here] through Zoom.
