# Research Findings: Urgent Care Mashup Study
**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Facility Locator**<br>

Leyda Hughes (leyda.hughes@adhocteam.us), 07/20/2020

## Research Goals 

Today, when a Veteran uses VA.gov's Facility Locator to find urgent care locations, they must choose between "VA urgent care" or "Community urgent care providers (in VA’s network)" individually to see all of the options available to them. When users choose "Community urgent care providers (in VA’s network)", the page displays an alert banner notifying them about VA's community urgent care benefit. 

The tool will be adding an 'All urgent care' default option to the 'Choose a service type' menu so that users can see all options available to them in one list simultaneously. In making this change, the page will need to find a new way to alert users of VA's community urgent care benefit.

The goal of this study was to: 
- Understand how an 'All urgent care' option might influence the way a user searches for urgent care
- Determine whether or not the new design support users in understanding all of the urgent care options available to them

Prior to the study, we hypothesized that:
- Veterans will understand how to find an urgent care location.
- Veterans will want to filter urgent care locations by facility type, VA or Community providers to inform their decision.
- Veterans will understand how to prepare for a visit to an urgent care facility.

## Research Methodology 

Remote, moderated sessions were conducted via Zoom and included a combination of usability testing and generative questioning.

### Who we talked to

8 Participants:
* 6 Veterans, 2 Caretakers, 1 Veteran/Caretaker 
* Ages ranges; 1-(45-64), 5-(55-64), 1-(65-74), 1(undisclosed)
* 4 Rural, 3 Urban, 1 undisclosed
* 3 participants with cognitive disabilities
* Educational backgrounds ranged from high school diploma to master's degree

### Research Questions

* What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking urgent care?
* What information do Veterans need/want for community urgent care (in VA network) locations?
* Do Veterans need/want to distinguish between these location types in a single list?
* Do veterans want to filter by facility type, VA or Community providers?
* Would veterans click to learn more about community urgent care benefits?
* Do veterans find labels such as those indicating urgent care service/facility type helpful when finding/selecting an urgent care location?
* What information does a veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a urgent care facility?


## Findings

### Findings by Hypothesis

* Veterans will understand how to find an urgent care location.
  * Finding: Partially false. Only two participants intentionally chose to see "All urgent care".  Most participants filtered their choices by “VA health” or “VA urgent care”, excluding Community care options from their list of results. These same users lacked awareness of the Community urgent care benefit. It is unclear if having knowledge of this benefit would have changed their filtering patterns. (see findings 1 and 2)
* Veterans will want to filter urgent care locations by facility type, va/non-va to inform their decision.
   * Finding: Partially true. Half of participants intentionally filtered their urgent care options by “VA health” or “VA urgent care”. However, this study revealed that one of the reasons a Veteran might intentionally choose VA urgent care is because they believe that it is not their choice to decide when to go to a community care provider (see finding 6). Veteran weigh other factors when deciding to choose VA or choose not to go to a VA facility. (see findings 9 and 10)
* Veterans will understand how to prepare for a visit to an urgent care facility.
  * Finding: True. Most understood that they should click “Urgent care benefit information” to obtain benefit information relating to that location. All participants would call locations to clarify any uncertainty about benefits, services, hours and wait times. 


### Key Findings

1. 7 out of 8 Participants did not know about the Community urgent care benefit.
2. ½ of all participants filtered urgent care options by “VA health” or "VA urgent care". 
3. Participants understood “Urgent care benefit information” is something they should click. 
4. Facilities with statuses stating "Limited services and hours” were interpreted as being less available or having fewer services than those with “Call for services and hours”.
5. Veterans use “in network”, “outside” and “civilian” to describe VA and community providers.
6. Veterans don’t believe it's up to them to decide where to go for urgent care. 
7. Close proximity is a crucial factor when choosing urgent care.
8. Lack of visual affordances impacts how users perceive page data and functionality. 
9. Service type is one of many factors that drives the urgent care selection process. 
10. Two Veterans specifically asked for wait times to be surfaced in search results.

### Details of Findings

#### 1.  7 out of 8 Participants did not know about the Community urgent care benefit.
3 participants expressed strong emotions in just learning that this benefit was available to them, all adding that they wished that they had received an email about it. One suggested using "marketing schemes" to educate veterans about the benefit. Many were also surprised to learn of the Facility Locator tool, and specifically that it could surface additional urgent care options and benefits. By the end of each session, all would consider going to Community urgent care if it made sense in their situation.

>  "Community Care is pretty new, right? I didn't even know because he [Caretaker's Veteran father] got contracted out for PT... When I asked, nobody gave me a list of where to go when I spoke to VA. Nobody gave information about the website or about Community Care that I could look it up myself." 

This Caretaker went on to explain that if she had known about the Facility Locator she would have chosen Community providers as her facility type and typed in physical therapy as her service type. She added:

> "Nobody told me to go on the site and do it. So, it's not being shared with us. So, I didn't know I had the tool to do it myself. I could have Googled Community care but if I don't even know the website has availability [community providers], I wouldn't even know to look. And when I did speak to Community care VA, they didn't even share this [Facility Locator] with us."

When another Caretaker was asked if the information about Community urgent care benefits was helpful, she responded: 

>  "It is. Cause I didn't even know it was there. I have learned alot from the groups I'm in about the benefits and where I can go to get help. [but] I would hope someone at the VA would have said something to me, like his primary doctor or something. Giving me the information that I didn't have to drive almost an hour to get him medical treatment"

A couple Veterans had very positive first impressions upon learning about the benefits. 

> OK, I think that this is pretty decent, for the VA to contract out into the community to assist vets, basically it's saying to treat minor injuries and illnesses, nothing major, and that they do the same thing at the VA, you have to pay a copay if you're eligible, so I think this is a perfect idea. How long has this been going on, cause I don't know nothing about it? 

Later, when asked how he would have expected to find out he suggested: 

> "I mean this is all new to me... Notifications would be good. Individuals like myself that have emails. Alot of websites have notifications about whatever marketing scheme they're running so why wouldn't it be good for the VA to notify Veterans about this website and how it can assist me and others?"


####  2. ½ of all participants filtered urgent care options by “VA health” or "VA urgent care".
3 users left the default menu selection of "VA health" unopened and unchanged, choosing "Urgent care" under the service type menu. One participant changed the default facility type menu to "Urgent care" and service type to "VA urgent care." Both paths resulted in participants not seeing any of the community provider options. These same users lacked awareness of the Community urgent care benefit so they would not have known to look for them otherwise. After the second task, which made users change the default menu to "Urgent care"/"All urgent care" and read about the Community urgent care benefit, these participants felt that the new understanding of the additional options could impact their ultimate choice. Most said that they would still call to verify.

#### 3. Participants generally understood "Urgent care benefit information" is something they should click. 
However, some participants had strong reactions to having to read more and make sense of VA information pages, assuming the page wouldn't answer their questions anyway so they would just call which would be quicker for an urgent care matter.  

> "When I see something like that, I would like to click on it to see if it's something I need to know before even thinking about going there". 

Some Veterans apply previous understanding of benefits to new programs and sometimes make assumptions. Most confused the Community urgent care benefit with other programs. When asked what she might find after clicking the link, one Caretaker responded:

>To me 'urgent care benefit information' is just another thing I gotta click into and read, to click out of, to me it'd be a waste of time. [adds that calling is easier] Yeah, it's quicker to get an answer than to read and read and read with someone screaming that their foot hurts. To me it'd be a time waster.

Even after clicking through the link, this user remained skeptical. When asked "What do you think this page is trying to communicate?", she responded:

> "before you go, you have to call this number and we have to authorize that you're even allowed to go in for your sprained ankle." 

This particular user was on the Community urgent care information page for **two full minutes not wanting to read the information** while adding, 

>"To me, it's another one of those VA blah, blah, blah screens that's all words that's not going to get me any answers and it's going to steer me rrrright back to the home page. To me, there's a lot of these pages that are just fluff and get me no place." 

#### 4. Facilities with statuses stating "Limited services and hours” were interpreted as being less available or having fewer services than those with “Call for services and hours”
All facilities carried a yellow warning style status. The VA location's status read "Limited services and hours". All community care locations carried a "Call for services and hours" status. When users compared the two, "Call for services and hours", was interpreted as less limiting and more of an invitation to call. **NOTE:** The interpretation of status messaging is being heavily influenced by COVID 19, as was shown in a previous, related study. This is an area that will need to be retested as operating circumstances change.

> "I would trust the VA knowing it's a bigger place. The hardest part when you click to the VA is it says "Limited services and hours". That might deter me from going there because maybe they are an 8-5.. The one up above "Call for services and hours" with COVID makes perfect sense".

#### 5. Veterans use “in network”, “outside” and “civilian” to describe VA and community providers.
Throughout the studies 5 participants used the term "in-network" to describe facility options that would be covered by their VA healthcare benefits. Three participants used the word "outside" and two used the word "civilian" to describe community facilities or providers.

> "Means that you can go to a civilian provider that the VA would pay for"

#### 6. Veterans don't believe it's up to them to decide where to go for urgent care.
Veterans understand that they occasionally get "sent" to Community providers in certain circumstances but it is not something that they think they can choose on their own.

> "I didn't realize, I thought you had to get sent to these, most of the outside providers. I hadn't heard of these urgent providers in-network, like you just walk in. That's something new to me. Usually I call the VA. Normally, they'd send me somewhere if they couldn't see me in a reasonable amount of time. They would send an authorization. They have an office and they would call me and tell me which doctor to go to and it would all be taken care of... I wouldn't just choose something on my own because I'm not familiar with that at all within the VA healthcare system."


#### 7. Close proximity is a crucial factor when choosing urgent care.
Long travel and wait times compound existing factors that Veterans face such economic hardships and managing symptoms of cognitive disabilities under stressful situations.

> "I'm probably going to start using option A [community urgent care] regardless, because I don't drive. I use public transportation. It saves money. And I catch the bus probably 10 miles across town to get to my VA when there's a doctor's office, a 1/4 of a mile away. That's better for me."



#### 8. Lack of visual affordances impact how users perceive page data and functionality.
Half of users only noticed the first two listings and most didn't scroll to see more. Those that did try scrolling, would try to scroll the page level scrollbars to see more which don't affect the list of results. These users were on modern browsers where system scrollbars were comprised of very thin graphics that only appeared on hover.  Those with browsers that displayed thicker looking scrollbars, that stayed on screen, scrolled the list on their own without being prompted. 
> "Oh, ok, I see you gotta drag the little line between the map and the other thing"..."If this is a prototype, there should be some arrows or something" "I tried to move [scroll] the entire screen..."

Another user didn't see the search functionality until being prompted to scroll down the page because it was below the paragraphs of text and looked like the end of the page.

#### 9. Service type is one of many factors that drives the urgent care selection process. 
Currently, facilities carry labels that designate if a facility is a "RETAIL/WALK-IN CARE", "VA URGENT CARE", etc. In this prototype, labels were removed to see if participants looked for this type of information. Participants did not seek out these labels or designations and seemed sufficiently able to discern the type of facility from a facility's name, their filtering options, and the "Urgent care benefits information" link. Facility/service type _is_ important in determining the best option but which type is best can vary widely from day to day for many Veterans and Caretakers. Additional information that could be helpful to know when choosing a Community provider over a VA facility is if the provider has a basic understanding for some of Veteran's specific healthcare needs, which for one Caretaker meant, 

> "providers that have training and understanding of Veteran's mental health needs, i.e. how a patient with PTSD's needs under a stressful sprained ankle situation".  

Another Caretaker echoed similar factors she weighs when choosing the type of facility, 

> "If they have an outburt, where the VA will understand that they happen. The VA handles it a lot easier. They [community provider] would want to tie him up and stuff so he doesn't hurt himself. The VA doesn't do that stuff."

A third Caretaker explained a past experience with her Veteran husband that would compel her to avoid a VA facility,

> "if he's having a bad day because fireworks go off the night before, he's agitated and his anxiety is high, taking him to the VA knowing he'll sit there for 6 hours, like issues we've had in the past, it's better to skip that anxiety and escalation, and pay out of pocket"

#### 10. Two Veterans specifically asked for wait times to be surfaced in search results.

> "What would be nice is if you had current wait times, is it 15 min, 30 min, an hour... Our hospital here posts their wait times on their FaceBook page. If I have two places and one has a 15 min wait and one has an hour wait, I'm going to the one with the 15 min wait. I don't want to wait an hour to see a doctor."

> "Yeah, because I know with some VAs you can call and try to get an appt. It might take you a month to get one. Whereas with this other urgent care, it might not take that long, so it's possible that you could get an appt that same day."

## Additional Insights

1.  Calling is the easiest way for Veterans to navigate their healthcare. By the end of each session, most participants expressed that they would still likely call the VA to clarify benefit uncertainty or to verify hours and services. 

2.  Veterans like clicking links that directly take them to directions or to make a call, especially when on a mobile device.

3.  Some Veterans did not distinguish between urgent and emergency care. When asked about past or theoretical urgent care experiences and situations, participants would often describe emergency room visits or emergency situations as they thought through what they did in the past or what they might do in the future.

4.  Veterans have favorable opinions of "The Nurseline".

5.  One Veteran asked if there was a place to submit feedback to the VA on the website. When directed to the feedback button on the Facility Locator page, the participant was disappointed in seeing a star rating as his only option. He expected a freeform field where he would be able to type in his feedback.

6. 4 of 8 participants had never used Facility Locator. When asked how they found facility location information, 3 answered Google and one answered search engine.

## Recommendations

* Don't preselect "VA health" under "Choose a VA facility type" which appears to influence the more common path of "VA health" / "Urgent care" which in turn limits the total choices available to them. By forcing Veteran's to open the menu, it may allow them to see "Urgent care" first. Proceed with "All urgent care" as the defaulted service type option when "Urgent care" is selected, to increase the likelihood of exposure to all available options.

* Do not style "Call for services and hours" as a status - use a more subtle treatment. 

* Proceed with the linkable info status styling to communicate Community urgent care benefits information.

* Use language that mirrors how Veterans understand and communicate benefit and facility terminology and highlight "what's in it for them".

  * On Community care listings, use words that Veterans use like 'in-network' to communicate that a location will be covered by VA health benefits.

  * On the Community Care urgent care information page, lead with the benefit that is new or differentiate how it differs from other programs with a similar name. Eg, "Urgent Care Closer to Home" or "More Urgent Care Options". Add a timestamp or explanation, "As of...you can now..." to make clear that this is different from previous programs. Be concise when writing and chunk information to be more scannable to reduce cognitive load.

* Add more visual affordances to page functionality. 

  * Be more efficient with the use of space and words wherever possible. For example, reduce the amount of copy that precedes search functionality on the "Find VA Locations" to allow the gray box to appear "above the fold" at high zoom levels. 

  * Add the number of listings to the search results line of text that appears above the listings and map. Move "Can't find what you're looking for?.." to a less prominent location and to give the results copy line the proper hierarchy.

  * Use consistent typographic styling for results between VA and Community location listings so that important differences appear more salient. 

  * Look for ways to improve scrolling functionality. Since the results list relies on system scrollbars, consider forcing wider or persistent scrollbars or a secondary way of moving results listing up and down, e.g. arrows. 

## Next Steps

* A/B test the recommended change to defaulted facility and service type menus.
* Implement design recommendations.
* Conduct baseline usability tests on live Facility Locator to gather more data on user's actual experience with browsers, load times and search experiences.
  * include a subset of usability tests on mobile or create a separate study with a mobile first focus.
* Share relevant findings with other teams and stakeholders.
* Continue research on usability issues such as scrolling.
