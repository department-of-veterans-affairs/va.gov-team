This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers

**What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?**

- Most participants expressed a desire for clear benefits information and procedures to be associated with search results.
- Most participants emphasized the importance of finding the closest location.
- A few participants expressed desire for an explicit list of available services per location in search results.
- Some participant wanted search results to include all available (out-of-network) facilities,  and emphasized proximity as the main factor in choosing a location.

**What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?**

- Nearly all participants wanted clearer and more easily accessible information about their benefits at community partners to be present in search results.

**Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?**

- Most participants noticed the blue info alert associated with community partners, but it was unclear if they knew it was *only* associated with community partners.
- Some participants quickly distinguished between location types by noticing the blue info alert associated with community partner results, and the presence of "VA" in the title of VA facilities.

**Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?**

- Most participants understood that "in-network" meant VA and VA partner facilities, and that the search results reflected this.
- As a result of personal experience, most participants expressed awareness that they could visit any emergency facility.
- One participant expressed a desire for a more explicit "out-of-network" search option, to include non VA facilities.

**Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?**

- Only two participants out of eight clicked on the blue info alert.
- Most participants noticed the alert, but either did not intuitively recognize it as access to additional information about their benefits, or were simply unwilling to click it during the demo.

**What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?**

- Participants had a range of responses, including:
     - A clear understanding of services offered at the location
     - Clear and easily accessible benefits information
     - Clear and easily accessible information on the procedure for applying for benefits
     - Reviews of the facility

## Hypotheses & Answers

**Veterans want to search for a single list, containing both VA and community emergency care options**
- Likely
- Most participants seemed to choose "All in-network" before other options, but some appreciated the specific VA and VA community partners distinction
> [P10] "I see in network stuff...then you get to the centers with limited services and hours like clinics. It puts all the information right here, that is good."


**Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list**
- Likely
- From personal experience, most participants seemed to be aware of this, and not necessarily because of anything on the facility locator page.
> [P2] "Going to the ER is still covered 100% from VA, even if I'm not able to get to the VA itself."


**Veterans understand that the Facility Locator list contains "in-network" VA and community care facilities, and is not comprehensive: it may not represent all emergency options available to them**
- True
- Nearly all participants recognized "in-network" as meaning only connected to the VA, including explicity VA facilities.
> [P4] "If I'm on a VA website, I would want everything to be in-network unless I choose otherwise"

**The facility type label "In-network emergency care" does not introduce confusion about other facility types**
- False
- While nearly all participants expressed understanding of the phrase "in-network", it's presence in the Facility type dropdown did introduce confusion.
> [P5] "In-network emergency care, to me that is a stumbling block...I would wnat to hit 'Emergency care', then have the explanation."

**Veterans understand how to learn more about community care emergency benefit [explained elsewhere](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/Emergency_Care.asp)**
- Unlikely
- While most participants noticed the blue info alert associated with community partners, only two out of eight clicked on the link. Some participants stated that they would call the facility or a patient advocate to learn more, and most did not seem to recognize access to more information present in the search results.
> [P11] "The blue info notice means I can go there [the physical location]...they will accept Veteran's insurance."

**Participants will understand what to do in case of emergency**
- True
- From personal experience, and not necessarily information in the search results, most participants knew to immediately find medical attention.
> [P6] "Common sense if you have an emergency call 911."

## Other Findings

**Participants' first choice under the Facility type dropdown**
- Most participants' first choice was the "Urgent care" option, based on the scenario prompt ("immediate care"), or from personal association with the kinds of services offered at urgent care facilities.
- The next most popular choice was the "VA health" option, where participants seemed to like its all-inclusiveness, and then selected specifics under the "Service type" dropdown.
