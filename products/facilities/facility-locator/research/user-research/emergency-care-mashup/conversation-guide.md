## Intro - 5 minutes

[Speak slowly and clearly]

Thanks for joining us today! 
My name is Nick, I'm a designer working on the VA.gov site, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 
Today we're going to talk about finding healthcare on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* **This entire session should take about 45 minutes [if that]**.
* **There is no need to turn on your camera - audio only is fine**

* **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started**.
* **Then, I'll be sharing a link to a prototype and ask you to share your screen. We'll look at a protoype together and I will ask you questions about it**
  * This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect
  * Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. 
  * Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. 
  * We are not testing you, or your ability, instead, we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. 
  * You cannot do anything wrong. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

### START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD

* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

* Can you tell me a little about your service history?
* Have you ever experienced something that required an immediate visit to any health facility?
    * If yes: can you tell me about your experience at that location? [Looking for the facility itself, not necessarily procedures they went through]
    * If yes: what kind of facility was it (VA/non-VA)?
    * If yes: can you tell me why you decided on that particular location?
    * If yes: How did you find out about that specific location?
    * Can you tell me about how your VA benefit coverge works, in the event of an emergency?

## Usability Test - 30 minutes

I'm going to share a link to a prototype here in the zoom chat window for you to click on. 
Then I'll want you to share your screen so that I can follow along and see what you see.
Are you already familiar with the process of sharing your screen?

 * [If no: ask if they're on a laptop/desktop/mobile - then share Kristen's slides]

Please make sure to close any email, or other personal information you may have open in any tabs, before sharing your screen.

### MODERATOR SHARES LINK TO PROTOTYPE
[Desktop Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/8767aa9028468a26be090fd044d9ff26e40a8f95#/pages/138402705/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)

[Mobile Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/8767aa9028468a26be090fd044d9ff26e40a8f95#/pages/138234260/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)

Since this is only a prototype some links and features will work but most won't.
I ask that you think out loud as much as possible, as we go through the prototype.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them at any time.

### PROTOTYPE: Facility Locator
#### Questions:

- Are you familiar with, or have you ever used VA.gov's location finder?
    - If yes: how long ago, what were you doing? What was that experience like?
    - If no: how do you go about finding information about VA locations?
    - Yes/no: Why might, or why might not, you use this tool in the future?

### Scenario
#### Directions:

I'm going to walk us through a scenario and have you perform some tasks. 
Again, this is only a prototype so some things might not work as expected. 
As you work through the tasks I'd like you to think out loud and narrate what you see and what goes through your mind.

[Questions?]

In this scenario, let's imagine that you live near Denver, CO, and that in the past, you experienced a situation where you needed immediate care. You are coming to this site because you would like to learn more about the locations closest to you, should you experience something similar in the future.

### Task 1

#### PROTOTYPE: Open-ended search results
#### Questions:

I would like you to perform a search for locations that would be relevant to you.
  - (Can you walk me through that process?)
  - Tell me about what you see in this results list.
  - (Do they notice 'urgent' vs 'emergency'? Why did they chose one over the other?)

Based on the results of your search, what is important to you when choosing a location from this list?

Let's say you want to search for [All / VA / Community locations] in your area.
  - (Can you walk me through the process?)
  - Tell me about what you see in this results list.
  - Does the distinction between this results list, and the previous results list, matter to you?
  - (Do they notice 'urgent' vs 'emergency'? Why did they chose one over the other?)

### Task 2

#### PROTOTYPE: User understands the specific search options
#### Questions:

When you see the search heading, 'Facilty type', what does this mean to you?

For this task, under the 'Facility type' menu, I'd like you to choose 'In-network emergency care'.
  - When you see the phrase 'In-network', what does that mean to you?
  - When you see "emergency care", what kinds of facilities might you expect to see in the search results?
  - [Open 'Facility type' menu] When you see "urgent care" what kinds of facilities might you expect to see in the search results?
  - What the distinction between 'emergency care' and 'urgent care' mean to you?

When you see the search heading, 'Service type', what does this mean to you?

[Set the 'Facility type' to 'In-network emergency care']

Open the 'Service type' menu, talk me through what the different options mean to you.
   - Does the distinction between 'Service type' options matter to you?
   - What matters about the distinction?

[Click search button]

Tell me what you see

Based on your search results, if you wanted to learn more about your benefits at a particular location, how might you do that?

[Point out things they don't notice]

(Tell me what you see)
(Do you notice anything else?)
(I'd like to point out something specific)

- Emergency alert
- Blue info notice in results
- Map markers
- [Do they have suggestions for search options in the dropdown?]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

I have just a couple more questions before we finish up:

- If you could change one thing on this site to make searching for locations easier, what would that be? (If anything):
- Is there anything that I haven't asked you that you think that I should know?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 
Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
