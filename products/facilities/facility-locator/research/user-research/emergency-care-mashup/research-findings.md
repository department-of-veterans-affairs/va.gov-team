## Research Goals 

The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of the new facility locator emergency care search options and results:
 - Participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them
 - Validate that the design sufficiently informs participants about community care emergency benefits
 - Participants to understand what "in-network" means in terms of VA and non-VA community partners

## Methodology 

A remote, via Zoom, moderated task-based usability study was conducted between May 17th - May 25th, 2021. Participants were asked to describe their thought processes during an open-ended facility locator search task. Participatants were also asked specific questions about individual search options and elements on the facility locator page. Note-takers and observers were also in attendance.

## Research Findings

### Research Questions

a) What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?

  - Participants fell into three main categories: 
    - A desire for information about the specific services provided at each location
    - A desire to see the closest facility whether in-network or out-of-network
    - A desire for more information about the benefits procedure at specific locations.

b) What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?

  - Most participants wanted clearer and more easily accessible information about their benefits at community partners to be accessible via search results.

c) Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?

  - It was unclear if most participants were able to quickly distinguish between VA locations and community partners in the results list. 

d) Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?

  - Most participants recognized that search results only inlcluded in-network locations. 

e) Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?

  - Most participants did not click to learn more about community care benefits.

f) What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

  - Participants had a range of responses, including: 
    - A clear understanding of available services at the facility
    - Clear and easily accessible benefits information
    - Distance to the closest location

### Hypotheses

i) Veterans want to search for a single list, containing both VA and community emergency care options.

  -  **True:** participants wanted to see as many options as possible (8/9 participants)

ii) Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list.

  - **False:** this was not gleaned from search results, however participants knew this from personal experience (2/9 participants pointed out emergency alert)

iii) Veterans understand that the Facility Locator list contains "in-network" VA and community care facilities, and is not comprehensive: it may not represent all emergency options available to them.

  - **True:** most participants knew search results were in-network only (7/9 participants)

iv) The facility type label "In-network emergency care" does not introduce confusion about other facility types.

  - **False:** this label did introduce confusion (3/9 participants expressed confusion about facility types)

v) Veterans understand how to learn more about [community care emergency benefit](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/Emergency_Care.asp)

  - **False:** most participants did not see a way to learn more about their benefits (2/9 clicked on benefits link)

vi) Participants will understand what to do in case of emergency

  - **Mostly false:** this was not gleaned from search results, however participants knew this from personal experience (5/9 participants referenced previous experience)

## Details & Quotes

### Research Questions Details

a) What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?

- When seeking emergency care, participants wanted information about services offered, to see the closest available facilities, and clearer information about their benefits.

  - Most participants fell into these three main categories of need. Some participants expressed desire for a direct link to services offered to be present in the search results.
 
    > [P1] "There should be an option that says, 'learn more about what the facility offers'...click on that to learn more"
    
    > [P6] "It would be nice to have something to each with the services offered to be hyper linked to each one."

  - Rural participants were particularly conscious of distance, and participants seemed more willing to visit whichever locations was closest, even if it was not in VA’s network.

    > [P4] "If I need emergency care then I may be willing to go somewhere that is out of network."

    > [P10] "I live further away from the facilities...I need to figure out which is the closest."

    > [P11] "If someone is in an emergency then they may want to go to the closest place regardless of [it being] in VA's network"
    
    > [P14] "I would look more at distance if it were an emergency."

b) What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?

- When seeking emergency care at community partners, participants wanted clearer and more easily accessible benefits information.

  - Nearly all participants expressed frustration with the process of validating their benefits at community partners. 

    > [P2] "Sometimes I don't know what to tell non-VA centers except to bill it through Tricare."
    
    > [P5] "I did not know what was expected me, and I don't think the website [in general] addresses that."

  - Some participants also expressed a desire for direct link to benefits information to be present in search results.

    > [P6] "I would like a link here, 'in-network emergency care benefits'
    
    > [P1] "How would I learn more about my benefits...I don't see a way to do that."

c) Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?

- It was unclear if most participants were able to quickly distinguish between VA locations and community partners in the results list.

  - Some participants did note the distinction, and based it on the presence of the blue info alert for community partners, and the presence of "VA" in the title of VA facilities.

    > [P4] "I don't know why two of the results have [blue info alert] and the other two don't...I just realized the bottom two are VA."
    
    > [P11] "It also says that the top two are in-network...if I were too far from a VA hospital then I could go to one of [these]."

d) Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?

- Most participants understood that search results only included in-network locations.

  - Most participants seemed to realize that there were more locations available, and most understood “in-network” to mean only VA and VA partners.

    > [P2] "If I am on a VA website, it is anything that is covered by the government...not including third party facilities"

  - One participant expressed an explicit desire to have out-of-network results in the search list.

    > [P4] "It's weird there is only an in-network emergency care and not also out-of-network emergency care"

e) Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?

- Most participants did not click to learn more about community care benefits.

  - Most participants noticed the alert, but either did not intuitively recognize it as access to additional information, or were simply unwilling to click it during the demo. Only two participants clicked on the blue info alert present in search results.

    > [P1] "How would I learn more about my benefits and the types of care that a facility offers...I don't see a way to do that"
    
    > [P2] "...[referencing info alert] seems more like an information section...seem[s] like somewhere you can go to get more info."
    
    > [P6] "I would assume if I clicked here...any of those would [point] me towards the facility...looks easy to click the benefit link"
    
    > [P10] "I just thought it was information, nothing that would give me [more] information"

f) What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

- When preparing to go to an emergency facility, participants wanted a clear understanding of services offered, clearer information about benefits, and distance to the closest location.

  - Participants expressed similar desires to the question, “What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?” 

  - Two participants  expressed the desire to see the review of a facility before going there, noting that they had had better experiences at local community partners.

    > [P4] "I would do a quick search for review...I would rather go to a civilian hospital...normally better care."
    
    > [P5] "I would suggest having reviews of the facilities...maybe pros and cons. VA emergency care is an oxymoron, give me a break."

### Hypotheses Details

i) Veterans want to search for a single list, containing both VA and community emergency care options.

- **True:** most (8/9) participants seemed to choose "All in-network" before other options, and prefered a list that was inclusive of as many results as possible. Some noted the usefulness of the VA and VA community partners distinction. 

  > [P10] "[looking at results] That's pretty good. I see in network stuff...then you get to the centers with limited services and hours like clinics here. It puts all the information right here, that is good."

- Two participants felt that "Service type" options were redundant

  > [P6] "I don't know why I would exclude a VA facility...I don't know if I would go to the last one, because to get this info I would just click all in-network."
  
  > [P2] "It seems like it's redundant, but for a specific purpose - you may not get many results if you chose third [in-network community care] option."

ii) Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list.

- **False:** most participants either didn’t notice, or did not feel the need to point the yellow emergency alert that appears with emergency care search results, which is currently the only thing that indicates that Veterans should go to any available emergency room. Only two participants pointed out the alert.

  > [P6] "[Pointing out alert] Common sense if you have an emergency, call 911."
  
  > [P5] "[referencing yellow alert]...it's fine, but the blue [benefits alert] caught my eye faster."

iii) Veterans understand that the Facility Locator list contains "in-network" VA and community care facilities, and is not comprehensive: it may not represent all emergency options available to them.

- **True:** Most participants recognized "in-network" as meaning VA and VA community partners, and did not necessarily expect out-of-network locations in the search results.

  > [P2]"If I am on a VA website, it is anything that is covered by the government...not including third party facilities."
 
  > [P4] "I would assume that all results...would be in-network." & "If I'm on a VA website, I would want everything to be in-network unless I choose otherwise."

- Two participants expressed confusion about the specific phrase “in-network”

  > [P5]"Does in-network mean Medicare and how does the VA dovetail?"
  
  > [P14] "I would probably be a little confused...Is it any VA facility choice program that will work with the VA?”

iv) The facility type label "In-network emergency care" does not introduce confusion about other facility types.

- **False:** this label did introduce confusion. When juxtaposed with the other ‘Facility type’ dropdown options, which do not have the “in-network” label, some participants felt it was out of place, and suggested changing it to be similar to other options.

  > [P4] "I would change in-network [emergency care] to ER."
 
  > [P5] "...in-network emergency care, to me that is a stumbling block...I would want to hit emergency care, then have the explanation.”

- The presence of “in-network” next to only one option under ‘Facility type’, gave one participant the impression that the options that did not have this label, were not necessarily VA or VA partners.

  > [P11] "[The ‘Urgent care’ option] would be any hospital, but they may or may not be VA affiliated."

v) Veterans understand how to learn more about [community care emergency benefit](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/Emergency_Care.asp)

- **False:** most participants did not intuitively recognize the blue info alert as access to additional information, or were simply unwilling to click it during the demo.

  > [P1] "How would I learn more about my benefits and the types of care that a facility offers...I don't see a way to do that."

- One participant thought the alert was simply a notice associated with community partner search results.

  > [P11] "The blue info notice means I can go there...they will accept Veteran's insurance."

- One of the two participants who clicked on the blue info alert, did not recognize it as clickable at first. After clicking, she did feel that the information on the benefits page was useful, and noted the “Notify VA Immediately” option as important.

  > [P10] "I just thought it was information, nothing that would give me [more] information…[and after clicking] ...It does have Vet information...that is perfect.”
  
  > [P10] "Some veterans don't know how fast the VA needs to know so it will be covered."

vi) Participants will understand what to do in case of emergency

- **Mostly false:** participants seemed to know this from previous experience, but not from anything in the search results that explicitly indicates this. Only two participants pointed out the emergency alert, but most expressed previous experience with emergency procedures.

  > [P4] "But if I go to a non-VA center then I'm supposed to call ahead to get approval...unless it's life or death."
  
  > [P2] "...ER is still covered 100%...even if I'm not able to get to the VA."
  
  > [P11] "I have a high disability rating so almost everything is covered."
  
  > [P5] "There are serious issues getting healthcare from the VAs under emergency circumstances [as a result of visiting any location]"
  
  > [P14] "I can always take him to the hospital, but there are issues..."

## Additional Insights

- Most participant's first choice during the open-ended search task was "Urgent Care" under the "Facility type" dropdown (5/9 participants)

  - "VA Health" under the "Facility type" dropdown was the second most picked first-choice option (3/9 participants)

- For most participants, the main distinction between "urgent" and "emergency" seemed to be non-life threatening out-patient emergencies, vs potentially life-threatening in-patient emergencies.

  > [P1] "Urgent care means you need care in that moment, but it's not a matter of life or death. Emergency care is a matter of life or death."
  
  > [P2] "I think the fine line difference is whether it's life or death."

- Of the participants that pointed out the yellow emergency alert, one stated that the blue info alert in the search results caught her attention first.

  > [P5] "...it's fine, but the blue caught my eye faster."

## Recommendations

[Initial recommendations - may change]

- Change "In-network emergency care" under Facility type, to "Emergency care"

  - Veterans can still choose explicitly in-network options under the ‘Service type’ dropdown, so this should remove any confusion about the difference between this and other ‘Facility type’ options.

- Consider revising the language of the benefits info alert

  - Most participants did not recognize the link as access to additional information, so using more explicit language may make it more recognizable as a call to action (Ex: "View emergency benefit information")

- Consider changing the color & style of the emergency alert

  - Very few participants seemed to notice the yellow emergency alert. Changing its color, and/or updating the style of the alert component used in this instance, may increase engagement.

## Next Steps

- Collaborate with Content team

  - Work with the Content team to determine best language for benefits alert

- UX update 

  - Change “In-network emergency care” to “Emergency care” in dropdown menu
  
  - Update content of benefits alert for both Emergency and Urgent care search results
  
  - Use Design System to choose more effective emergency alert component style
  
  - Initiate collab cycle and Platform Team review for any changes that will be reflected at component level	

- Engineering

  - Back-end integration w/PPMS
  
  - Front-end implementation of design

- Business

  - Finalize key success metrics
