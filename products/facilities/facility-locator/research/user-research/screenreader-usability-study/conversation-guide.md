## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with there being a few of my teammates assisting me on this call including a note taker and an accessibility specialist, [name], should we need any help with technology during our session. I can tell you a little more about who we are and what we’re doing before we go any further.

I'm a website designer and researcher and as a team we work on making improvements to VA's websites. We reach out to Veterans from time to time to get their input to make sure we're on the right track with the web pages that we're building. Today, we want to learn how we can improve VA.gov for blind Veterans and Veterans with low vision.

- **Are you comfortable proceeding with this session?**

If no:

- **Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable?**

#### [Get verbal confirmation or end session]

If yes:

Thank you, we’re excited to talk with you today.

I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- The entire session should take between an hour and a half and two hours.  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. Feel free to let me know if you need a break at any time.
- We'll start the session with some technical set-up, then we'll go over a couple warm up questions.
- And finally, we'll be visiting parts of the VA.gov website together.
- Throughout the session, I may ask you about your thoughts and opinions about the pages or features but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the website to see how we can make it better for all Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question.
- In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and we'll help you through that.
- We may send you links to go to during the session. Do you have a communication preference? 
    - if desktop, email/zoom chat
    - if mobile, email/text 
- Finally, this session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. I personally destroy this recording after I analyze it, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

## Recording permission

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    - If yes:
     - Once I start recording, I will ask you once again so that the confirmation is captured in the recording.

[Start recording to the Cloud]

- I have started recording. So, I'd like to confirm:
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"

## Tech set-up

Next, I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Shannon may have gone over a list of technical questions when you registered.
- I'm going to quickly run through those again just to make sure I have the right information.

Checklist:
- Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today? 
- Mac or Windows? 
- iOS or Android?
   - If not joined by Zoom already:
   - Do you have Zoom installed? 
- Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.
- What browser are you using today?
- Do you have a screen reader on this device?
- What kind of screen reader do you use?
- How long have you been using it?
- Are you using a screen magnifier today?
- Are there any other assistive technologies that you use?
  - [if low vision, the participant may require captions which need to be turned on in advanced settings]
- Do you know your screen reader's speaking rate (verbosity setting)? High, medium, low? 
  - [If high, be prepared to have them repeat anything that can't be heard or understood]
   - I may need to pause you at times an ask you what you're hearing if I can't make out what's being read.


**For those joined by iPhone and Zoom already:**
- SKIP TO [Screen sharing](#screen-sharing) SET UP

## Joining Zoom

### Help participant join with device

- I'm going to send you a zoom link [by format specified] for you to open on your phone so you can join this meeting.  
- [Send through Veteran's preferred communication channel]
- When you open the link, you should be taken to the Zoom application automatically. Zoom will ask for access to your microphone and video. We only need your audio for this session, so please tap "Allow" for the microphone prompt. Feel free to tap "Don't Allow" for video permissions if you are not comfortable having your face on camera.
- Upon joining the room, Zoom will have you turn on audio by asking “To hear others, please join audio.” Please swipe to and double tap "Wifi or Cellular Data." [This button will be at the center of their screen.]
- Once you're in the call...

## Screen sharing

At this point [I'd like you to go back to Zoom] I'm going to have you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along with you. 

### Desktop
- We want to confirm your internet speed before we set up the screen share. Have you received any alerts from Zoom on having a low internet bandwidth or connection speed?
- Tab to the “Screen share” button and activate it with your space key.
- Tab or navigate past the “basic, advanced, and files” tab menu items and find “Share entire screen.” It should be the first item in the list of windows or - applications to share. Use your space key to select it.
  - [If the user gets lost in the list or mentions arrow keys aren’t working]
   - If your arrow keys aren’t working as expected, it’s because this list has two rows. You’ll need to use your up _and_ left arrow keys to return to the beginning of the list back where you should have access to share the entire screen
- Tab to “Share sound” and use your space key to select it. This will let us hear your screen reader.
- With those settings in place, tab to the "Share" option and use your space key to select it to start the screen share.
  - [If you don’t hear the screen reader]: We can’t hear your screen reader. Are you using headphones, hearing aids, or other technology? If so, would you be able to comfortably use your computer without that device so we can hear your screen reader? If not, that’s perfectly OK.
   - [If no, switch to think out loud facilitation]
 
- [If you can’t see the window you need, like a google chrome window] You’ve started your share, but we can’t see the window you’re on right now. 
  - [Windows might be minimized]
   - [Windows computer]: Use Windows Key + Shift + M to maximize all your windows or use Command + Tab to select the window you want to maximize and then use Windows Key + Up Arrow to maximize it.


[If successful:]

OK, great, I can see your screen. Sometimes Zoom can be finicky and I will lose the screen share connection and I may have to ask you share screen again the way we just did. Also, if you need to stop sharing during this session you can tab over to “Stop Share.” It’s located where the “Screen Share” button originally was at the bottom center of your screen.

 - Within Zoom, I'd like you to find the "Share content" button and double tap it. You may have to swipe a number of times.
 - A menu should appear. Select the "Screen” option and double tap it. 
   - If you haven’t given Zoom permission to record yet on your device, you’ll be prompted to give access to allow it”
 - Next you'll want to swipe to the "Start Broadcast" button and double tap that. You'll hear a counter "3, 2, 1" and the screen share should begin.
 - Please swipe right until you hear the option to share your audio.
 - [If the screen is black]: We see a black screen right now. If you have screen curtain or other screen hiding tech running, please toggle it off if possible.
 - [If you don’t hear the screen reader]: We can’t hear your screen reader. Are you using headphones, hearing aids, or other technology? If so, would you be able to comfortably use your phone/desktop without that device so we can hear your screen reader? If not, that’s perfectly OK.
 - Return to your home screen and the screen share should begin.

## Warm-up Questions 

Thank you for working through that with us.

We can get started with some questions. As I mentioned, I'm a website designer and researcher my goal is to learn how best to improve our webpages when used with screen readers but I'll be honest, this is new territory for me. So, I may ask some dumb questions at times. Please feel free to stop and correct me at any time. I'm here to learn how to do a better job for you. So, that's a little about me.

- Can you tell me briefly about yourself? Anything you’d like me to know is fine.
- Can you describe to me how you use your screen reader?
    -  multiple devices?

Thank you for sharing that.

## Discovery 

### Internet searching for a location

In this session, we'll mostly be focused on finding locations of places online. 

- Can you tell me of a recent time when you used the internet to find the location of a place that you needed to visit?
   - What devices or technology did you use? 
   - [probe if needed, specific app or website?]

- Could you tell me about the last time you searched for a VA location?
   - If yes, how did you go about finding it?
   - How was that experience?
   - What could have been better?

- Have you ever used the VA.gov website?
   - If yes, can you tell me briefly about the last time you used VA.gov?
   - What could have been better?


## TASKS

### Task 1

#### Getting to ‘Find a VA location’

Next, I'm going to ask you to complete a task. 

1. Could you please find your nearest VA?

- If they use, Google, ask them: 
   - Why?
   - Can you show me how you do that?
- Follow up with: “How about on VA.gov, how might you find your nearest VA?”
   - Can you show me how you do that?

- _If user needs help:_
   - Send them a link: via preferred method (maybe email)
   - Type in a URL: [va.gov/find-locations](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)
   - Direct them to “main menu”. Button reads: "menu collapsed"/"closed collapsed", (failure likely)
   - What do you hear when you enter the menu, as you swipe right?


2. Let’s stop here for a moment. 
   - How was finding that link for you?
   - Was that different from what you expected?

_Things to look for:_
- What screen reader shortcuts did they use? 
   - E.g. elements list, rotor, navigating by heading vs. navigating by tab
   - Can Veterans successfully "Find a VA Location"?
    - If not, what path did they try? 
   - When activating the main menu [double tap "menu collapsed", then it will say ]

### Task 2
#### Using ‘Find a VA location’ near current location

[SEARCH]

Next, I'm going to walk us through a scenario. I’d like you to imagine that you’ve just moved to where you live today and you’re looking for a dermatologist at your nearest VA. You can pretend that you don’t know where that is.	

3. How might you do that on this page?	
   - Can you try that now?
   - How does this search experience work for you?
   - What could be improved?

_Things to look for:_
- Does the participant enable their location [if available at time of study]?
- Can the participant easily manipulate the inputs and dropdown menus
- Does the participant encounter a type-ahead
   - If so, what, if any, problems do they encounter?


[RESULTS]

4. Can you talk me through the location options? 
   - How does this listing work for you?
   - What could be improved?

_Things to look for:_
- Does the participant use the list or map
- Can the participant navigate backward and forward easily, no keyboard traps?
- Is navigation order logical to the participant?

### Task 3
#### Using ‘Find a VA location’ to plan ahead

Next, I'm going to walk us through a different scenario. Imagine you are planning a trip and you’d like to know what the closest VA hospital would be from where you’ll be staying. It can be somewhere you’ve visited in the past, if that’s easier.

5. How might you do that on this page?	
   - Can you try that now?
   - How did this search experience work for you?
   - What could be improved in this scenario?

_Things to look for:_
- Did the participant notice the 'clear input' button? 
- Did the participant use the 'clear input' button? 

[If participant did NOT interact with the map/list]

6. I’d like to point out the map/list feature to you	
   - Did you notice this feature?
   - Is there a reason that you didn’t use this feature?
   - What could be improved to make this more useful?


## Post-Task Interview

7. Are there any features or functionality missing for you on this page?
   - Why? Why here?
8. Are there any websites or apps that work well for you that do a better job of finding locations or searching?
9. If you had a magic wand and could fix one thing about the features you interacted with today, what would it be?

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members. Shannon/Brian/Matthew will be following up with you directly.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## Troubleshooting

### Screen goes black
We see a black screen right now. If you have screen curtain or other screen hiding tech running, please toggle it off if possible.

### Audio can't be heard
We can’t hear your screen reader. Are you using headphones, hearing aids, or other technology? If so, would you be able to comfortably use your phone/desktop without that device so we can hear your screen reader? If not, that’s perfectly OK.
   - [If no, switch to think out loud facilitation]

### Screen reader too fast
I'd like to pause here for a moment. I didn't quite make out what happened there. Do you mind repeating what you heard for me?
