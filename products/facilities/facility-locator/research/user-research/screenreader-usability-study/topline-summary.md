This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research is to establish foundational knowledge of Veterans' Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile devices. Understanding how Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, try to complete facility search tasks will help us plan future product improvements so that all Veterans can easily perform a search and consume results.

In this research study, participants were asked to describe how they use their assistive technology to search for location information online. They were also asked to perform three facility search tasks to gauge high level usability of the tools while using assistive technology.

 - Find your nearest VA
 - Find a dermatologist at your nearest VA
 - Find the closest VA hospital to where you'll be staying in preparation for an upcoming trip


## Participants
We talked to **7 Veterans**, of differing levels of vision, each of whom used a unique combination of devices and assistive technology and displayed varying degrees of experience using their assistive technologies. 

P# | LEVEL OF VISION | DEVICE | ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY | EXPERIENCE LEVEL
---|---------------------|--------------|------------------|------------
P1 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader | Advanced |
P2 | Completely blind |  Desktop | JAWS screen reader §† | Advanced |
P4 | Cognitive & Dyslexia | mobile iPhone | iOS dictation §† | Beginner |
P6 | Low vision | mobile iPhone | magic keyboard § | Beginner on iOS |
P7 | Completely blind |  Desktop | JAWS screen reader | Advanced |
P9 | Low vision |  Desktop | ZoomText screen reader ¶ | Intermediate |
P10 | Low vision |  Desktop | Fusion (JAWS + ZoomText) ¶ | Beginner |

Due to technical issues, not all participants were able to share their typical or preferred combination of AT in its entirety via Zoom. Therefore, some aspects were not able to be observed by researchers during testing. Technologies not observed during testing are noted as follows:

 - § Audio not shared during testing
 - † Video not shared during testing
 - ¶ Other assistive tech not observable during testing

## Initial Findings

### User context and behavior while using assistive tech

- Veterans with low to no vision use many different types of assistive technologies for navigating websites and the information that they encounter on them. What they choose to use and how they use it can vary widely and spontaneously depending on their context and/or immediate situation.

  - P1: Navigates quickly through pages with JAWS and may miss key content that isn't optimized for screen readers, e.g. 'skip to content' on VA.gov. 
  - P4: Post retirement diagnosis of Dyslexia means college graduation and endless bookists that can be tackled audibly on iPhone/iPad. Heavy reliance on dictation (spelling is challenging) with mic feature on iOS. Easier than Dragon. Now Siri.  _"I finally started using Siri, my grandson taught me this."_
   - P6: Dictating to Siri on iPhone while out and about > JAWS at home on desktop 
   - P7: JAWS on desktop at home. Navigates for wife who's driving by memorizing directions or playing back dictation from his Victor Reader Stream. Likes VoiceOver on mobile but hands don't work well with "all of the small taps".
   - P9: ZoomText to magnify content on websites can't locate items on a page when laid out far apart. Uses a high contrast keyboard to type.
   - P10: Starts with mobile, will transition to desktop for more involved tasks. Uses ZoomText with familiar websites and JAWS when unfamiliar. _"When I’m looking up a location a phone is more convenient and easier...The search feature, I don’t have to wait for it to boot up. Siri is there. Then I looked at it on my desktop computer to Google events." "JAWS can go through everything and it’s easier to find stuff if I’m unfamiliar with the website or the content. It helps me find things quicker."_

- Assistive technology users may be advanced users of one device and novice users of another where their knowledge limits them to a small handful of features and functionality. Manipulating the 'Service type' combo box on Facility locator using an iPhone was difficult and unfamiliar to one user who was more skilled at using JAWS on desktop. 
- Orienting oneself on a website can be unpredictable, cumbersome and very time consuming for users with low to no vision. Participants used various methods to figure out what page they were on, what a page is about and what they can do on it. The JAWS users we observed often used a handful of keyboard commands to either pull up a menu with a list of page elements of a particular type or to navigate by that type of item individually. Some examples we observed:
  - Listing all the headings on the page (Insert + F6) or (H) for navigating headings one by one
  - Find feature to search the page by keyword (F), _typing "Locations" to find facilities_
  - Listing all the links on a page (Insert + F7), _52 links on the VA.gov homepage_
  - Navigating via Landmarks and Regions
  - Navigating through the edit boxes on a page, i.e. input fields _JAWS did not identify global search as an edit box_
  - Navigating through the buttons on a page, _once one participant was informed the page had one_
  - Using placemarkers (K), _one participant uses them as bookmarks during a browsing session_

 > P1:"I click H for heading and that’s how most people use JAWS on a web page. Reading from top to bottom is very tedious." [Later the participant uses H on VA.gov homepage] I first went to va.gov and the first heading that came up is 'Service member benefits'."  
 
 > P2: "You know... when I go to a new page... it takes me maybe 10 or 15 minutes to get familiar with the page and what's on it ok? I like to experience all the elements on the page... you know... how many checkboxes there are... how many headings, how many radio buttons... I like to go through that. So I just get an idea on what that page is about."



### Searching for location information online and on VA.gov

- Veterans are more likely to rely on VA location information provided by search engine results than seek out this type of information on VA.gov. (Participants use Google, Siri/safari, Bing, DuckDuckGo). Participants felt no need to explore VA.gov for this information or were unaware that Facility Locator existed. _"if I need information, I use google to get me where I go, so I typically don't go to a government website. I use my search engine to do that."_  However, participants do care that the source is credible: _“Google is great at times, but you really need to listen to the link to know if it’s an authentic website or reliable source.”_
- 4 Veterans had a hard time finding Facility Locator.
- 4 participants were able to complete a search on Facility Locator with relative ease. However, even those who were able to complete a search successfully expressed dissatisfaction with the experience. Some were unsure of what the different facility types meant and others struggled with the usability of the 'Service type' combo box on desktop and mobile. 
   - [P2 - after doing a facility search task with no results] _"It asked for 3 different types of requirements but when I checked it out, it said there were none in my location because I put the wrong requirements in for it.. Although there is a clinic here. I put the wrong definition in for the medical center because it's only a clinic... yea... I don't know the definition of what those boxes mean... I don't know what I checked on. I thought I checked the right ones. Obviously, I had the wrong definition of whatever those words were."_ 
   - [P2 - post task magic wand question] _“If something simple like 'What are you looking for?' To me it would be like 'Dermatologist!' umm…. What else… 'pharmacy!!'. 'What are you looking for?' Very straight, right to the point, you know? Search is a term that’s used for programmers and people like that. The search could be very vast but help you narrow down. The reason why I’m saying, I’m trying to make it plain is if I’m a 90 year old Veteran, I may not be familiar with all these things. But I know the term, 'What are you looking for?' That’s very direct."_
   - [P4] _"What If I’m in a crisis? Will I scroll through all this nonsense!? Call 911.  In fact, [city name] came up on Google first before VA.gov "_
   - [P7 trying to use 'Service type'] _"there seems to be only chiropractor and optometrist and I have a community care provider I see here in town.  It say’s there’s supposed to be a list."_
   - [P10] _"you know the facility type thing is a little confusing for me. It would be nice to have that broken down a little bit for options. The VA health thing… So… I mean I guess instead of saying “VA HEALTH”... all of those things underneath are va health pieces… so maybe “VA hospital, CBOC, VA urgent care clinic, or whatever…”_

- 3 Veterans used the 'use my location' but some Veterans were hesitant, one mentioning "big brother".
- When a search produces no results, the H2 search results text is disabled and instead focuses on a paragraph with search suggestions. However, in at least one session the screen reader did not announce this text which left one participant wondering if they did something wrong or if the search didn't produce results. 
- 4 Veterans used global search to find a location or dermatologist. Some participants didn't think to look for healthcare in a location finder.
- "Get directions" was not audible or decipherable for (3) JAWS screenreader users. 
- Phone numbers that lack labels can confuse screenreader users. One participant interpreted a phone number as GPS coordinates becasue it was read directly following "Get directions".
- Results listing letter and mileage combination was confusing for one user. User hears "A1.5 heading level 3 Memphis Vah Medical Center" not understanding that it was the first listing and is 1.5 miles away from the searched location.  
- Map view was hidden for most users and not tested with screen readers.
