## About the research

### Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to establish foundational knowledge of Veterans' Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile devices. Understanding how Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, to try to complete facility search tasks will help us plan future product improvements so that all Veterans can easily perform a search and consume results.

### Methodology
We conducted two hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on June 8-17, 2021. Participants were asked about their assistive technology usage, how they perform location search tasks online, and were given some common Veteran location search tasks to accomplish using their preferred method, VA.gov homepage and Facility Locator. 

### Research Questions
- What assistive technologies are Veterans using?
- How does a Veteran, using assistive technology:
  - find location information online, for a place that they need to visit physically?
  - find location information using VA.gov?
  - find location information using Facility Locator?
- For Veterans using assistive technology:
  - How do mobile vs desktop experiences differ?
  - What features are useful or not useful?
  - What are the pain points?
- Does Facility Locator need to change or evolve in order to offer an equitable experience to Veterans using assistive technology?

### Who we talked to

We talked to **7 Veterans:** 

Participant demographics:
- Education: Some college (3), Associate's degree (1), Bachelor's degree (1), Master's degree (1), Doctorate degree (1)
- Geographic location: Urban (4), Rural (3)
- People of color: Black (3)
- Ages: 55+ (6), 35-44 (1)
- Female: 2 
- Cognitive disability: (1)
 
#### Underserved groups in research
![screengrab of this study in the MVS-checker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4960080/125621453-2dd373d2-d126-4f50-bd21-5d6d44f7bf1a.png)

This research may not meet the needs of the following underserved Veteran communities, as the focus was primarily on recruiting Veterans with assistive technologies: Veterans with cognitive disabilities (only 1 Veteran disclosed having a learning disability, Veterans with other than honorable discharge, Veterans with immigrant origins, Latinx, Biracial, Asian, and Native Veterans, LGBTQ+ Veterans.

### Level of vision and assistive technology used:
Participants in this study had differing levels of vision, unique combinations of devices and assistive technology and displayed varying degrees of experience using their assistive technologies.

### Table - Level of vision and assistive technology used

P# | LEVEL OF VISION | DEVICE | ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY |EXPERIENCE LEVEL
---|-----------------|--------|------------------------|--------------
P1 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader  | Advanced
P2 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader §† | Advanced
P4 | Cognitive Disability,  Dyslexia | mobile iPhone | iOS dictation §† | Beginner
P6 | Low vision | mobile iPhone | magic keyboard § | Beginner on iOS
P7 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader | Advanced
P9 | Low vision | Desktop | ZoomText screen reader ¶ | Intermediate
P10 | Low vision | Desktop | Fusion (JAWS + ZoomText) ¶ | Beginner


### Technical limitations

Due to various technical issues, not all participants were able to share their typical or preferred combination of assistive technologies in their entirety via Zoom. Therefore, some aspects were not able to be observed by the researchers during testing. Technologies not observed during testing are noted in the table above as follows:

- § Audio not shared during testing
- † Video not shared during testing
- ¶ Other assistive tech not observable during testing

Magnification software was not able to be observed during testing. More research is required to understand this type of assistive technology.

Technical limitations also prevented testing with Veterans who use switch devices and braille readers as captured in the recruitment checker.

## Hypotheses

### Using Facility Locator and assistive technology:
#### Veterans can easily perform a search.

**LIKELY UNTRUE:** Even when participants were able to successfully complete a search, it was not easy. Most expressed dissatisfaction with the experience, confusion with terms used and usability issues with some of the interactions encountered. 
 
#### Veterans can easily consume results.

**LIKELY UNTRUE:** Results listings are perceived inconsistently across users of different assistive technologies. Many key features and information were missed by screen readers, making the experience confusing for many.

## Key Insights

### Findings section 1 - Navigating websites with Assistive Technology
As a Veteran who uses assistive technology, orienting myself on websites is often unpredictable, cumbersome and time-consuming

- 1.1 - I need to have multiple ways to accomplish online tasks but have my preferences
- 1.2 - I keep my desktop clean to not confuse my screen reader
- 1.3 - I make my viewport small so I may get a mobile experience on desktop
- 1.4 - I am new at using Siri but want to keep learning new ways of dictating my needs
- 1.5 - It’s easy for me to make spelling mistakes

### Findings section 2 - Online search behavior
When I look for location information for a place that I need to visit physically, I use my search engine either by dictating or typing in my search parameters…

- 2.1 - I already know my VA so I would likely only do this for unfamiliar locations
- 2.2 - I prefer to dictate location searches on my phone because it’s quicker and easier
- 2.3 - I use JAWS on my desktop for more complex searches or tasks
- 2.4 - Search engine results info is usually all I need, next I call or get directions
- 2.5 - I trust a search engine result when I hear VA.gov is the source
- 2.6 - I wish I could see hours and services of VA facilities on Google search results
- 2.7 - Sometimes I do see hours but they don’t make sense to me

### Findings section 3 - Using VA.gov
When I search for things on VA.gov, I have trouble finding what I am looking for... 
- 3.1 - The homepage is difficult to navigate and I can’t orient myself easily [[homepage findings]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/screenreader-usability-study/research-findings-add-01.md)
- 3.2 - Global searches don’t produce relevant results
- 3.3 - I get routed to too many different pages
- 3.4 - If I find something useful, I don’t know how to retrace my steps later
- 3.5 - I encounter too much information and I get overwhelmed
- 3.6 - Location searches [teamsite] result in a list that I have to Google individually

### Findings section 4 - Facility Locator searches
I didn’t know Facility Locator existed, but now that I do, I encounter some obstacles that would deter me from wanting to use this tool for searching…
- 4.1 - There are too many things to listen to before I can start my search
- 4.2 - There are too many requirements to fill in
- 4.3 - I don’t know what the requirements mean
- 4.4 - I didn’t put in the right requirements, so it tells me there’s an error
- 4.5 - I want to choose by something that I’m familiar with, like clinics or hospitals
- 4.6 - The service type combo box doesn’t work
- 4.7 - If I’m in a crisis, I won’t want to struggle with this page
- 4.8 - I prefer to just enter searches into one simple search box

### Findings section 5 - Facility Locator results
Consuming Facility Locator search results was also tricky…

- 5.1 - I did a search but the screen reader didn’t tell me that there weren’t results
- 5.2 - I got results but I don’t know what the letter and number combination means
- 5.3 - I don’t hear a way to get directions to these locations
- 5.4 - It's not clear to me what is a phone number or other piece of information
- 5.5 - I don’t know what ‘limited services and hours means’
- 5.6 - I didn’t realize that I was being taken to Google Maps, I like to know this
- 5.7 - If I leave VA.gov I expect to go to a different tab, otherwise don’t open a new tab
- 5.8 - I didn’t see a map but I usually don’t use them because they aren’t accessible

---

## Additional Insights

1. Using spacebar or enter on buttons: when navigating by keyboard, users sometimes hit the space bar instead of pressing enter on a button. Either should work. This was a problem on Global search - pressing space bar after entry didn’t work for P10 on JAWS.

2. Participants in this study were familiar with MyHealtheVet and overall have favorable opinions of it. How does this health mental model affect how they approach other parts of VA.gov? Some participants didn’t think to look for a dermatologist within a facility locator tool. Is this a common mindset? Should more effort be put into routing Veterans throughout VA.gov and the different products?

3. [P9] Travel reimbursement and MyHealtheVet: This low vision participant complained about the difficulty in multi-step processes and pointed out how cumbersome it is to complete travel reimbursement online when you have to go out of VA’s healthcare network, which was not by choice. This participant is an avid user of MyHealtheVet and didn’t understand why you couldn’t just integrate the travel reimbursement process into it. 
“Cuz they’ve got prescriptions and appointments and you can talk to your doctor, your records. So, to have travel reimbursement right there.”

4. Participants often took issue with the mileage that Facility Locator listed in the results listing, even when using ‘use my location’. P1, on desktop, explained that the first result was not the VA that was closest to him. Others didn't realize that the distance was being calculated from the center of the location entered and not their actual location.

5. Hypothesis: Participants seem to use different search patterns when dictating vs typing, using longer phrases that sound logical when spoken vs a smaller number of keywords when typing. How does this affect search results? This is an area that should be analyzed to build a larger bank of search terms and to understand if products need to be evolved in different ways to respond to different user behavior.

6. [P9] One ZoomText user mentioned liking the VA.gov layouts that were contained within a defined content area but conversely struggles with layouts and transitions that are spread out, because it is difficult to locate the next item you will need when using magnification software. He would prefer:
“On the va.gov have all login stuff on the same side so it’s right down in a row [column] so you’re not going from one side to the other side. That would be the main thing. Just have it right in the row. You can have the login button and then it brings you right down below, and there it is. Rather than going from one side to the other.  On the VA site, the login is in the far right hand corner. When it comes up the screen is on the left side of the page halfway down. When you have it big enough to read it [with the screen magnifier], you can’t see both of them at the same time.”

## Key Insights with Supporting Findings


### Findings section 1 - Navigating websites with Assistive Technology

#### As a Veteran who uses assistive technology, orienting myself on websites is often unpredictable, cumbersome and time-consuming [[refer to detailed homepage findings here]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/screenreader-usability-study/research-findings-add-01.md)

- 1.1 - I need to have multiple ways to accomplish online tasks but have my preferences
  - According to a recent [Webaim survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/#finding) (see table below), when trying to find information on a lengthy web page, screen reader users navigate via headings most often. We observed many combinations of navigation methods in our study, including the use of ‘skip to content’ which most screen readers use sometimes (>28%), often (>14%) or always(>16%).

#### Table - screen reader navigation methods

Response | % of respondents
---------------------------------------------------|------------------
Navigate through the headings on the page | 67.7%
Read through the page | 8.1%
Use the Find feature | 13.9%
Navigate through the links of the page | 7.1%
Navigate through the landmarks/regions of the page | 3.2%

  - P1. used, ‘Skip to content’ on VA.gov homepage, on his first of three failed attempts to complete task number two. The participant is taken to the ‘Service member benefits’ H2. From this point, the user was mentally stuck on trying to complete the task within a ‘benefits’ category that would apply to him. Notice the user’s scanning behavior, as he listens to elements on the page multiple times to understand where he is, what the page is about and where he should go next. This attempt took two minutes and fifteen seconds. On his third attempt, the participant tries to navigate by listening to the headings on the page from the top. Since he did not use ‘skip to content’, this time the homepage appeared to have completely different content than on his first visit. 
     - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4960080/125654657-ca5d7d0b-378f-4183-9093-7ff4977aefb1.png" alt="visual diagram of P1's attempts 1 and 3, highlighting where user listens and interacts" width="80%" height="80%">

> [P1] “Do you understand one thing I said? I typed in VA.gov a while ago and this is not the page that it took me to. So, I went back a page. I don’t know what you see but according to my screen reader, I haven’t been to this page before. I didn’t hear any of this stuff previously” [reflecting on his ‘skip to content’ attempt] “Why in heaven's name did it take me to the middle of the page?”

- 1.2 - I keep my desktop clean to not confuse my screen reader
- 1.3 - I make my viewport small so I may get a mobile experience on desktop
  - Two JAWS users, whose tech we were able to see and hear, shared a similar behavior of minimizing windows not in use and scaling down the size of their browser viewports. This can create a hybrid mobile/desktop experience for some users. For example, P1 experienced the mobile version of the global nav menu even though he was on a desktop.

- 1.4 - I am new at using Siri but want to keep learning new ways of dictating my needs
- 1.5 - It’s easy for me to make spelling mistakes
  - P6: “Barooklyn new york”
  - P9: “va dermatalgist”, “va hospitals soudth ca”
  - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4960080/125657249-98bbca76-7437-4416-b618-0df2382d6488.png" alt="screengrabs of users spelling mistakes when typing into google search and va.gov">
  - P4, who was diagnosed with Dyslexia after retiring from a successful military career, explains why dictation assistive technology helps her: 
     > “And you said ‘Dermatology’? I can’t spell that so I’m hoping I can use the mic... Normally, I talk into it with a mic [mic icon button on iOS apps that triggers dictation mode]. Because my spelling is atrocious, I tend to do it orally and it recognizes my voice. Most of the time if I type it, I fight with it, with the spelling.”


### Findings section 2 - Online search behavior
#### When I look for location information for a place that I need to visit physically, I use my search engine either by dictating or typing in my search parameters…

- 2.1 - I already know my VA so I would likely only do this for unfamiliar locations
- 2.2 - I prefer to dictate location searches on my phone because it’s quicker and easier

     - P6 wasn’t able to demonstrate but explained that he would likely dictate to Siri in the following manner: 

     > "where is the closest Veteran's hospital?"

- 2.3 - I use JAWS on my desktop for more complex searches or tasks

     > [P10]“For [a recent location search] started out with my phone, opened the app, got the city put in [dictates to Siri] “VA facility near fairfield texas” and then I went to the computer um… cuz I wanted to look at the biggest town next to the city they were looking at and then I looked at it on my desktop computer to Google events. When I’m looking up a location a phone is more convenient and easier. [Moderator: how so?] The search feature, I don’t have to wait for it to boot up. Siri is there.” 
- 2.4 - Search engine results info is usually all I need, next I call or get directions
     - P1: After showing how he’d find his nearest VA online
     > “it pulled the address off of the VA website. [has SR repeat the source “Department of Veteran Affairs”] See, I wouldn’t really go there now because I already found what I wanted. But this is also one that I happen to know because it’s 8/10’s of a mile [away].”
     - P4 reflecting on using Facility Locator post task
     > “Anyway, I just wouldn’t search like that. Say if I’d do Google, I’d “find VA clinic, find VA hospital” I wouldn’t ask for a location.”
- 2.5 - I trust a search engine result when I hear VA.gov is the source
- 2.6 - I wish I could see hours and services of VA facilities on Google search results
- 2.7 - Sometimes I do see hours but they don’t make sense to me
     - P9: Low-vision Veteran and wife, who is nearby to help, explain a recent VA facility search using Bing.com to look for VAs close to where they were considering moving. They explained how in their travels they’ve visited different VA facilities that vary widely in terms of the services and want to know if a listing is for a “little clinic” or more comprehensive like their own VA medical center. 
     - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4960080/125660483-b13235ff-77a9-41c9-8319-8b5e5016df15.png" alt="screengrab of google search results screen that user sees after typing in va hospitals south carolina" width="60%" height="60%">
     - The couple demonstrate their search and point out that second search result listing was for a “VA Medical Center” that lists ‘Hospital’ as a service but the closing time of 6:30pm was confusing to them. They didn't mention clicking for more information. In fact, although they described being frequent users of MyHealtheVet (bookmarked in their browser) they were unfamiliar with the VA.gov homepage when prompted to go there for their first task .
     > [Later, while on a facility page, this couple circles back to the importance of understanding ER services, with a personal anecdote] 
     > “It has the hours as 24/7 but that might be because they have the ER and pharmacy. One thing it doesn’t say, that I have seen and heard before, is that if you are feeling you have a heart attack go to the ER. Even though it says cardiology, you don’t go there for heart attacks. If you look at this it says cardiology but doesn’t tell you not to go there. It would be nice if they say, ‘if having a heart attack call 911 and go to the ER’. We had a Vet in our group and they said don’t go to the VA ER because they can’t help so I think that should be on there. When having a heart attack seconds can make a difference.”


### Findings section 3 - Using VA.gov
#### When I search for things on VA.gov, I have trouble finding what I am looking for... 

- 3.1 - The homepage is difficult to navigate and I can’t orient myself easily [Link to homepage findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/screenreader-usability-study/research-findings-add-01.md)
- 3.2 - Global searches don’t produce relevant results
     - Some Veterans didn’t think to look for a location finder so 4 Veterans used global search to find a location or dermatologist, some did this even after already having used the Facility Locator search in a previous task. Other participants didn't think to look for healthcare in a location finder. These searches turned out to be dead ends for users as they didn’t surface Facility Locator.
     - [P1: didn’t understand why he was being asked to find a dermatologist on Facility Locator - thinks this would be found under healthcare] 
     > ”Can I ask you a question. You asked me to find a dermatologist but can I do that on this page? I’m confused. You took me to find a location but you are actually asking me to find something specific. It’s confusing because it is about finding a VA location.”
     - [P6 ‘reads’ VA.gov homepage from the top and encounters global search] 
     > “So there’s the search field, so in the search field, I would go there. I would use that search field to find out whatever information I want...the nearest hospital, nearest clinic. Yea, that would be my first go-to spot. Search field comes right up and that will help me navigate where I probably want to go. Uh… let’s do this.. [types Mental clinic].  I went to do the mental health care and it brought me right here.”  [end of task. 1st result: Research.va.gov/topics/mental_health.cfm]
- 3.3 - I get routed to too many different pages
- 3.4 - If I find something useful, I don’t know how to retrace my steps later
     - P4 on retracing steps back on homepage, where she found Facility Locator in footer:
     > “It’s not obvious to find a VA location from the homepage. I had to scroll down to find it. I think it’s fairly important so I’d have it on top! So like under healthcare [4 main boxes]”
     - P10 remembers using a location finder in the past but doesn’t remember where:
     > “I know there’s a location finder… but I don’t know where that is. I don’t even know what that would be called. You’re hoping somebody labeled it right.”
- 3.5 - I encounter too much information and I get overwhelmed
     > [P4] “let’s go back there… how did I do that… oh all the way to the bottom [in footer]. Oh, so this isn’t very… I’m scrolling through pages and pages… it would probably be 10-15 pages on hard copy… finally at the bottom it says ‘Find a VA Location’, cemetery…”
- 3.6 - Location searches [teamsite] result in a list that I have to Google individually
     - [P10 recounting a recent VA search for burial information where she encounters many of the issues above] 
 
     > “I think the problem is there’s SO much information that it’s hard to get to the exact spot I need to be. So… it’s not just like I can ask a question of 'Texas Vietnam Vet eligibility for burial sites in Texas through the government.' Instead I get, if he dies at a VA facility you get you get “X” # of dollars, if he has a service connection you get “X” # of dollars. There's this list of 100 cemeteries they can be buried at. It’s a lot to sort through.  Visually it would probably be faster? Hence, I had to get off my computer for a little bit. 
     
     > "The other problem is… *sigh* how it was listed out, it didn’t say where exactly the different cemeteries were… I mean it did, but you had to look up in google maps every time to know where this is. You know. They could say “it’s in a holed up suburb in Austin,  Texas,” instead they just list this town name… for a lot of us, out of state, or unfamiliar with our current state, it’s really a challenge." 
     
     > "You know, I think that’s the main problem. It’s a lot of information. It’s overwhelming and if you’re not working with JAWS everyday, your skills go down. If you don’t use a computer every day, your skills go down. The VA tries to put too much information it just becomes overwhelming."


### Findings section 4 - Facility Locator searches
#### I didn’t know Facility Locator existed, but now that I do, I encounter some obstacles that would deter me from wanting to use this tool for searching…

- 4.1 - There are too many things to listen to before I can start my search
     > [P2]”The top of that page should be the information for that page. So when it goes to find locations. You know what you are getting into. So, bringing up the form first rather than a lot of other stuff to read would be nice.”
     > [P4] “I see something else here that drives me nuts. Even before you can find your location it comes up with a covid update. Do you want to know about your mask covering? You're inundated with it! All I want to know is the location of a VA thank you very much.”

- 4.2 - There are too many requirements to fill in
     - Participants expressed wanting an easier way to search
     - [P4 - while using Service Type combo box / Community Providers (in VA's network)] 
     > “it asks for service type and I’m going to use the mic and say. “Dermatology” and it literally types “Say Dermatology” [laughs]. Under Dermatology, it gives me a laundry list… and here we go: microsurgery… its like 10 things. Procedures… pediatrics… clinics… labs… pathology… and something called micrographic… well, anyway. So, I’d be at a loss… maybe clinic or lab? Honest to God, it doesn’t give a regular…”
     >"What If I’m in a crisis? Will I scroll through all this nonsense!? Call 911. In fact, [city name] came up on Google first before VA.gov "

- 4.3 - I don’t know what the requirements mean
     - [P2 - after doing a facility search task with no results] 
     > "It asked for 3 different types of requirements but when I checked it out, it said there were none in my location because I put the wrong requirements in for it.. Although there is a clinic here. I put the wrong definition in for the medical center because it's only a clinic... yea... I don't know the definition of what those boxes mean... I don't know what I checked on. I thought I checked the right ones. Obviously, I had the wrong definition of whatever those words were."
     - Some users had trouble with location input
     > [P1] “See, I think that label is more of a place marker in the field, so when I pressed enter into it is when I got to the place where you can type. You’re seeing it one way but JAWS is reading it in a different way. JAWS works best on form fields that use a label tag, like ‘label: city, state and then the form field would be right under’.  The way we do websites is when there's a link it says link but now it is done through code and the fields aren’t how they use to be. If it were my website it would be HTML with last name and then the field. Now you need to click enter on everything because you don’t really know. It's confusing to users new to computers and screen readers.”
     - Others had trouble with Facility Type
     > [P10] "you know the facility type thing is a little confusing for me. It would be nice to have that broken down a little bit for options. The VA health thing… So… I mean I guess instead of saying “VA HEALTH”... all of those things underneath are va health pieces… so maybe “VA hospital, CBOC, VA urgent care clinic, or whatever…”

- 4.4 - I didn’t put in the right requirements, so it tells me there’s an error
- 4.5 - I want to choose by something that I’m familiar with, like clinics or hospitals
     > [P10] “You know. The question is. Is it a VA clinic or a VA hospital? That’s the main thing.”
- 4.6 - The service type combo box doesn’t work
     - When a user enters the Service Type combo box / Community Providers (in VA's network), the screen reader tells them to choose a service type but there are no choices until a user types and this interaction tripped up multiple users.
     > [P2] “Seems to be stuck on listbox for service type. It's not letting me check... dermatology... Used 'enter', but not selecting."
     
     > [P7] "there seems to be only chiropractor and optometrist and I have a community care provider I see here in town. It says there’s supposed to be a list."
- 4.7 - If I’m in a crisis, I won’t want to struggle with this page
- 4.8 - I prefer to just enter searches into one simple search box
     > [P2 - post task magic wand question] “If something simple like 'What are you looking for?' To me it would be like 'Dermatologist!' umm…. What else… 'pharmacy!!'. 'What are you looking for?' Very straight, right to the point, you know? Search is a term that’s used for programmers and people like that. The search could be very vast but help you narrow down. The reason why I’m saying, I’m trying to make it plain is if I’m a 90 year old Veteran, I may not be familiar with all these things. But I know the term, 'What are you looking for?' That’s very direct."
     
     > [P4 - post task] “Truthfully, I think it’s a pain in the neck. It gave me too many options!! It says urgent care, VA doesn’t have urgent care as far as I know. Community provider network only.. Pharmacy.. Va benefits.. Cemeteries. I mean there’s big differences in what you’re looking for here. And then it says service type… and what are the options? Or you have to fill it in. One good thing that came out of it, I had no idea that you could find cemetery information on VA.gov. It comes in handy. [what would be better?] If it had just popped up with Straton. If it had just gone. Instead, it gave me these options. It didn’t give me what's in Albany, NY until you gave it this extra criteria. It wouldn’t go anywhere. What If I’m in a crisis will I scroll through all this nonsense!? Call 911.  In fact, Straton came up first before VA.gov came up on Google.” 
     - [User is pointing out that when she demonstrated her Google search earlier, her VA came up immediately]



### Findings section 5 - Facility Locator results
#### Consuming Facility Locator search results was also tricky…

- 5.1 - I did a search but the screen reader didn’t tell me that there weren’t results
     - When a search produces no results, the H2 search results text is disabled and instead focuses on a paragraph with search suggestions. However, in at least one session the screen reader did not announce this text which left one participant wondering if they did something wrong or if the search didn't produce results.
     - [P10 did not hear the screen reader announce results]
     > “It didn’t tell me if my search loaded up. Oh so Palestine has a dermatologist… that’s interesting.”

- 5.2 - I got results but I don’t know what the letter and number combination means
- 5.3 - I don’t hear a way to get directions to these locations
     - "Get directions" was not audible or decipherable for (3) JAWS screen reader users.
     - P2 'Reads' the search results and stops when he can’t understand what sounds like  “geDEERayshons” and has JAWS spell it: 
     > “What’s that say?” [switches from male to female screen reader voice] G-E-T D-I-R-E-C-T-I-O-N-S-T-O, [SR re-pronounces the words]. “‘Get DEER rations file.’ I have no idea what that is... Oh! it says ‘directions’. [uses military spelling reader] There’s no space between N and the T so when I read it... What I had to do was use the JAWS cursor and that lets me navigate that differently than the PC cursor.”

- 5.4 - It's not clear to me what is a phone number or other piece of information
     - Phone numbers that lack labels can confuse screenreader users. One participant interpreted a phone number as GPS coordinates because it was read directly following "Get directions''.
     > [P10] “Is it giving me GPS coordinates? [laughing] It didn’t say phone number! *chuckling* It goes from get directions, then it goes to 903-723-9006- it gave me numbers so my brain went to GPS directions. It should have said “phone number” or “clinic number” or something to call them!”

- 5.5 - I don’t know what ‘limited services and hours' means
- 5.6 - I didn’t realize that I was being taken to Google Maps, I like to know this
     > [P2]“Yea, I had no idea it was going to go to google maps, but once I was on google maps it was OK. It said "get directions" but not "get directions on google maps." If there was a little more description underneath the link saying that it goes to Google Maps. "Some people don't like to use google.”

- 5.7 - If I leave VA.gov I expect to go to a different tab, otherwise don’t open a new tab
- 5.8 - I didn’t see a map but I usually don’t use them because they aren’t accessible

## Recommendations

### Recommendations overall
As a Veteran who uses assistive technology, some things that would improve my experience would be to…

1. Establish a page hierarchy for pages and ensure that top navigation methods follow it
   - For example, a user who ‘skips to content’ and then navigates by headings should be able to form the same general understanding for what the page is about and what they can do there.  
2. Tell me what a page is about with a clear heading 1 level when navigating between pages
   - When P2 clicked on a facility detail page link from facility locator search results, the screen reader didn’t drop him onto the H1 because focus is not being managed. 
   > “I clicked El Paso central and it really didn't get me to the start of the page...I refresh JAWS and then I refresh the screen. Typically with JAWS I'll lose the focus when I go to a new page, so I need to refresh to be able to find the headings again. What I'd like to see when I go to a new webpage is go to the heading 1 level. Heading 1, I feel should be the main reason why I'm on the page. Ok? Sometimes it'll be a heading 2 or 3…”
3. Group links and content with logically ordered  heading levels to create an understandable hierarchy of the page
   - Links relating to COVID that are organized under a heading that is about finding a facility confuses and slows down assistive technology users who must already spend extra time understanding and orienting themselves on a page. Group this content under sub headings that can be scanned more easily.
4. Create regions on every page so that I can navigate quickly between areas
   - For example, footer links should be grouped into a footer region. Currently, users can’t distinguish between footer links and those that are part of the page content so they are forced to listen to 46 extra links each time they read a new page from top to bottom to orient themselves. 
5. Make sure ‘skip to content’ takes me to the main content on the page
   - Skip to content on GOV.Uk takes a user to the H1 to announce the page and then following tab takes a user into the search edit box
   - <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4960080/125671954-62d5e689-c0cf-42d5-a1fa-8b2b9c093582.png"  alt="[gov.uk 'skip to content' homepage example]" width="60%" height="60%">
6. Give me an edit box that is easy to find because I like an easy way to search
7. Provide the purpose and destination in link text  so that I know what to expect when I click on a link
8. Name buttons and links with the keywords that I’m likely to search for like ‘menu’, ‘locations’.
9. Name states of components with descriptions like ‘menu open’ so I don’t waste time listening for clues of what just happened
10. Don’t make me know how to spell things
   - Choosing from a predefined list of options alleviates the need to know how to spell difficult words and is easier than guessing what may or may not be an available option.

### Recommendations for Facilities Team

#### On Facility Locator - Short term

1. Establish a page hierarchy for Facility Locator, its detail pages as well as new facility product pages and test for consistency between different navigation methods (e.g. by heading level, skip to content, etc)
    1. Ensure these pages manage focus so that when a screen reader navigates by heading level, H1 is the first item announced.
2. Make ‘Skip to content’ link go to the page H1	
    1. On Facility Locator, Skip to content goes to the page breadcrumb which causes a screen reader user to have to manually skip over less important content before starting their search.
3. Move the COVID content and links into an alert region that can be announced as such. This will allow a screen reader to read the page more efficiently. 
4. Work with accessibility specialists to assess the location input to ensure the label and edit box combination make sense on a screen reader. For example, is the ‘Use my location’ input interrupting the expected flow for users? 
    1. Consider a new placement for ‘Use my location’
5. Service type combo box / Community Providers (in VA's network):
    1. Update the hint text to accurately describe the action a user must need to take
    2. Consider consolidating or grouping service type options so that selections are easier to make
    3. Work with accessibility specialist to assess how improvements will work with assistive technology
6. Restore results text when no results are found after a search
    1. Work with accessibility specialists to assess the appropriate type of announcement so that users are more likely to hear this information.
7. Fix “Get directions” and ‘phone’ links
    1. Work with accessibility specialists to assess the current problems with ‘Get directions’ and ‘phone’ links and propose new text, labels, and link text
8. Make listing letter and mileage improvements
    1. Work with accessibility specialists to assess the current problems with the letter and mileage combination and suggest improvements.
     - Would numbered listings be more natural to hear when announced by a screen reader?
     - Mileage could be better labeled and described by screen readers 
     - Is the placement of these elements optimal? 
9. Assess and incorporate keywords. Veterans don’t think to look for a facility locator and are likely to use global search when looking for a facility. Work with other teams to:
    1. Assess keyword searches for top facility types on VA.gov and incorporate those terms into global search best bets
    2. Experiment with patterns that exist within popular search tools like ‘hospitals near me’, ‘urgent care near me’ that could appear in type ahead global searches to connect users from the homepage to Facility Locator.


#### On Facility Locator - Medium term

10. Add ‘Google as the front door for Facility Locator and facility product pages’ as a use case to solve for and create an action plan.
    1. Assess keyword searches for top facility types on VA.gov and incorporate those terms into the product
     - E.g. Multiple users mentioned searching for burial and cemetery information and urgent care. Top terms could be surfaced in the page description.
    2. Start experimenting with structured content for location addresses and hours to see how changes could positively affect search engine search results
    3. Investigate how structured health data reconciles with current health taxonomy


#### On Facility Locator - Long term (Hypotheses to test)

11. Reassess what is the most important information to deliver on Facility locator. Veterans in this study, who use assistive technology, expressed similar information preferences as those who don’t use assistive technology as observed in past studies. In fact, this study just highlighted the need to deliver the most important information as efficiently as possible as problems experienced by sighted users are felt even more acutely by those using assistive tech. Consider improvements that would help all users.
    1. Is a map delivering value to Veterans? Veterans use other means to map directions later in their decision-making journey and it is unlikely that they would come to Facility Locator to do that. Could the mileage data point and ‘Get directions’ be enough without displaying a map or perhaps reducing its screen allocation (e.g. ⅓  vertical strip like Yelp or AirBnb)? If so, part or all of this real estate could be better allocated to information that would be more useful to Veterans when comparing between facilities.
    2. List hours over facility status alerts. An alert like ‘Limited hours and services’ does not provide enough information to help a Veteran choose a facility and instead compels a Veteran to call. Knowing a facility's operating hours would. 
    3. Does it have an ER with 24/7 care? This should be a data point that gets surfaced when available.
    4. Services; how might we display just enough service information to give Veterans a quick understanding of the type of facility to answer, “is this just a little clinic?”
    5. Assess repeated links that don’t provide facility specific information. We learned how important it is to reduce the number of elements that a user has to hear.  
     - Consider a different way to provide access to general benefit information

12. Redesign search. Veterans want an easier way to search. In this study, participants didn’t want to mess with all the “requirements” and their expectations were heavily influenced by their search engine searches. 
    1. Consider a set of exposed filters in a left rail with default selections in place so that users only have to enter in their location 
    2. Reassess the language used on Facility Locator. ‘Facility type’ and ‘Service type’ were not easily understood and it annoyed users to have to parse their meaning.
13. Give Veterans a way to quickly assess facilities at a glance. When Veterans search for VAs for long term planning like for travel or moving they are cognizant of the stark variations between size and scope of facilities across the country but they have no way of distinguishing them easily. For example, they want to know when a facility is a small clinic with limited services, if they can use it for their common primary care needs, or if there is 24/7 ER availability which is crucial in an emergency situation.
    1. Consider creating meaningful tags, or categories to assign to facilities. 
    2. Consider creating a key with explanations for terms that may be confusing or link to another page for more information.
14. Improve discoverability of facility information available to them. Veterans are unaware of the different facility types that they can find using Facility Locator. Consider a more discoverable way of browsing. 
    1. For example, a set of exposed filters in a left rail could surface facility types, like cemeteries, that might be unknown but useful to more Veterans. Two Veterans in this study described recent searches for burial and cemetery information.


### Further Research Needed

We determined that Veterans are provided with many of the dictation and magnification software (e.g. ZoomText, Fusion) technologies that we observed. However, we were not able to test the tasks with dictation nor magnification software. More research is needed to understand how these top tasks would fare using those technologies.


## Next Steps

- Assess recommendations with Accessibility Specialists
- Review recommendations with Facilities team
