- iOS or Android?
   - If not joined by Zoom already:
   - Do you have Zoom installed? 
- Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.

- Do you have a screen reader on this device?
- What kind of screen reader do you use?
- How long have you been using it?
- Are you using a screen magnifier today?

  - [if low vision, the participant may require captions which need to be turned on in advanced settings]
- Do you know your screen reader's speaking rate (verbosity setting)? High, medium, low? 
  - [If high, be prepared to have them repeat anything that can't be heard or understood]
   - I may need to pause you at times an ask you what you're hearing if I can't make out what's being read.


## Discovery 

### Internet searching for a location

During our time together, we'll mostly be focused on finding VA locations online. 

- Can you tell me of a recent time when you used the internet to find the location of a place that you needed to visit?
   - What devices or technology did you use? 
   - [probe if needed, specific app or website?]

- Could you tell me about the last time you searched for a VA location?
   - If yes, how did you go about finding it?
   - How was that experience?
   - What could have been better?

- Have you ever used the VA.gov website?
   - If yes, can you tell me briefly about the last time you used VA.gov?
   - What could have been better?


## TASKS

### Task 1

#### Getting to ‘Find a VA location’

Next, I'm going to ask you to complete a task. 

1. Could you please find your nearest VA?

- If they use, Google, ask them: 
   - Why?
   - Can you show me how you do that?
- Follow up with: “How about on VA.gov, how might you find your nearest VA?”
   - Can you show me how you do that?

[If user needs help:]
   - Send them a link: via preferred method (maybe email)
   - Type in a URL: [va.gov/find-locations](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)
   - Direct them to “main menu” [button reads: "menu collapsed"/"closed collapsed"] (failure likely)
    - What do you hear when you enter the menu, as you swipe right?


2. Let’s stop here for a moment. 
   - How was finding that link for you?
   - Was that different from what you expected?

_Things to look for:_
- What screen reader shortcuts did they use? 
   - E.g. elements list, rotor, navigating by heading vs. navigating by tab
   - Can Veterans successfully "Find a VA Location"?
    - If not, what path did they try? 
   - When activating the main menu [double tap "menu collapsed", then it will say ]

### Task 2
#### Using ‘Find a VA location’ near current location

[SEARCH]

Next, I'm going to walk us through a scenario. I’d like you to imagine that you’ve just moved to where you live today and you’re looking for a dermatologist at your nearest VA. You can pretend that you don’t know where that is.	

3. How might you do that on this page?	
   - Can you try that now?
   - How does this search experience work for you?
   - What could be improved?

_Things to look for:_
- Does the participant enable their location [if available at time of study]?
- Can the participant easily manipulate the inputs and dropdown menus
- Does the participant encounter a type-ahead
   - If so, what, if any, problems do they encounter?


[RESULTS]

4. Can you talk me through the location options? 
   - How does this listing work for you?
   - What could be improved?

_Things to look for:_
- Does the participant use the list or map
- Can the participant navigate backward and forward easily, no keyboard traps?
- Is navigation order logical to the participant?

### Task 3
#### Using ‘Find a VA location’ to plan ahead

Next, I'm going to walk us through a different scenario. Imagine you are planning a trip and you’d like to know what the closest VA hospital would be from where you’ll be staying. It can be somewhere you’ve visited in the past, if that’s easier.

5. How might you do that on this page?	
   - Can you try that now?
   - How did this search experience work for you?
   - What could be improved in this scenario?

_Things to look for:_
- Did the participant notice the 'clear input' button? 
- Did the participant use the 'clear input' button? 

[If participant did NOT interact with the map/list]

6. I’d like to point out the map/list feature to you	
   - Did you notice this feature?
   - Is there a reason that you didn’t use this feature?
   - What could be improved to make this more useful?


## Post-Task Interview

7. Are there any features or functionality missing for you on this page?
   - Why? Why here?
8. Are there any websites or apps that work well for you that do a better job of finding locations or searching?
9. If you had a magic wand and could fix one thing about the features you interacted with today, what would it be?

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing
