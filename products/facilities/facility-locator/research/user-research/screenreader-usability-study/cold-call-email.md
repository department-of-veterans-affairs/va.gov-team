### Improving VA.gov for Blind Veterans

## Email body:

Hello [Name],

 
My name is [Name] and I help the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) improve VA.gov for Veterans. We regularly run feedback studies to make sure we build features and functionality that work for all Veterans.

We’re looking for blind and low vision Veterans who would like to participate in giving us feedback. Can you help connect us to Veterans that would be interested?

Here’s some more information on how giving feedback on VA tools works:

- This is a [recent video that talks about our general process](https://govmatters.tv/the-department-of-veterans-affairs-is-optimizing-its-services-with-human-centered-design/?noamp=available) for making website improvements.
- Research sessions are typically conducted over Zoom where participants test out prototypes or different areas of VA.gov and give us feedback on how we can improve the pages to make them work better for them.
- Veterans receive a thank-you gift for their time.
- Interested Veterans can register by phone: 540-513-8510.

I’m happy to pass on additional information or materials you can share out to Veterans. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and thank you in advance for your help.  

Sincerely,

 [name/contact info]
