# Conversation Guide for Facility Locator search expectations

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.
- Tell me about your service history OR tell me about yourself
- How often do you visit the VA website?
- Have you ever used the facility locator on the VA website?
- Tell me about a time you used the facility locator? What did you use it for?

## Screenshare
I'm going to send you a link to the VA website. Once you have it pulled up, will you share you screen with me? I will be asking you to complete a few tasks. Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions. Information shown will not reflect any of your actual information.

## First Task: Find facility locator

**Scenario**
- You've come to the VA website because you need help applying for benefits and want to see someone in person at a VA facility. Show us how you would do that.

### Things to watch for:

- How does the participant search by location (ZIP, city, etc.)?
- Which dropdown options do they select?

## Second Task: Review results

- I noticed you clicked [search info]. Talk about why you chose this.
- What are your impressions of the search results?
- How many search results would you expect to see?
- Why would you choose [the one they choose]?

### Things to watch for:

- How do they interact with the map?
- Do they scroll through results? 
- Do they compare anything?

## Third Task: Start new search

Great! I'm going to give you another scenario:

- You have a sore throat and want to find a community clinic that provides urgent care for Veterans close to your house. Show us what you would do to find this.

### Things to watch for:

- What categories are they searching for?
- Do they make note of the listings?
- Do they look at the map first?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- How many results do you want to see after you search?
- Do you use any sort of map applications? If so, which one(s)?
- What kind of device do you normally use?
- Would you use that device to search for facilities on VA.gov?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
