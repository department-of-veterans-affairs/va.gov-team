# Research plan for facility locator user expectations for search
Prepared by Aricka Lewis, Ad Hoc | February 2020

## Goals	
The goal of this research is to learn what user expectations are for searching and receiving results on the facility locator.

### Background
Facility Locator is VA's single source of truth for customers to find VA facilities and location details about all VA facilities, across VHA, VBA, and NCA

### Research questions
- How does user interaction with the map and search results differ between urban and rural residents?
- What impact does facility or service type have on how participants interact with search results?
- How many search results should the facility locator display before pagination?
- How do participants utilize the map and search results together?
- How do particpants expect to refine their search results?

### Hypothesis	
- Rural participants will not want to see many return results if the facilities are far away
- Urban participants will want to see multiple locations and compare them by if they are close 

## Method	
- We will use Zoom to conduct remote moderated usability testing sessions to observe how participants use the live VA facility locator
