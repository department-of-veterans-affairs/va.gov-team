# Research Plan - Non-Clinical Services Taxonomy

[Reviewed by Lauren Alexanderson on _____]

Research plan for [#XXX](URL)

## Background

In order to align the way services are presented to veterans across multiple pages in the Facilities Locator application, we are evaluating the current naming conventions of services. These services range from Homeless Assistance to Education Benefits (see the full list: [#32819](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/32819)). We will be evaluating the current taxonomy for ease-of-use.

## Research Goals

### Goals

Our main goals are:
- To determine how Veterans would categorize existing services
- Note any services that could benefit from updated plain language titles

### Research Questions

1) Do the existing categories accurately reflect Veteran expectations of where to find services on VBA Location pages?
2) Do Veterans commonly misunderstand any of the current labels?
3) Will Veterans create additional categories for new services?
4) Are there services that are confusing, or need to be described using plainer language?
5) Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to described using plainer language?

### Hypotheses

- Veterans will associate most services with existing category headings.
- Veterans will create new categories for some of the existing services.
- Veterans will create new categories for some of the new services.
- Some of the existing, and new, services will cause confusion, and may require plainer language.

## Methodology

This study will utilize a moderated card sort, via [Optimal Workshop's](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) UX research tools. The card sort allows participants to arrange services into the categories they think fit them best, or, to create new categories if the existing categories aren't a good fit.

- **TASK:** Participants will perform a hybrid card sort for a list of new and currently existing services. The categories will include existing health services headings ("Primary care", "Mental health care", etc.), new suggestions, as well as the option to add additional categories.

### Future research

- If participants create any new categories (headings) during the card sort, it could be beneficial to run another tree test that includes the newly defined categories.
