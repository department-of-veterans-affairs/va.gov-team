# VAMC Communication Methods - Research Plan

## Background

[#34431 - Methods for contacting VAMCs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/34431)

Unauthenticated VAMC site pages give Veterans multiple methods for contacting their doctors, patient advocates, and other members of their broader health care team. The variety of communication methods, and their placement on VAMC site pages, needs to be validated with Veteran feedback in order to determine which methods Veterans find the most useful, where it is most useful to Veterans to place this information on site pages, and how Veterans actually go about searching for this information in general.

### OCTO Objectives 

[OCTO objectives & goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)

This research supports these main OCTO objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online

This supports decreasing theses measures:
- Time to successfully complete and submit online transactions

### Veteran Journey

[The Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

This research fits into the Veteran journey at these key moments:
- Attending to health needs
- Managing primary care and chronic health issues
- Take care my health

## Research Goals	

**The main goals of this study are:**
1) To identify where Veterans expect to find the various methods of communication that VAMC pages provide.
2) To validate the labels used to describe the communication methods found on VAMC pages.
3) To identify why a Veteran would choose one particular communication method as opposed to another.

**Secondary goals include collecting supplemental feedback:**
- What is confusing to Veterans?
- What experience do Veterans expect?
- What changes or additional things do Veterans suggest?

### Outcome

Currently, not all communication methods available to Veterans are present on each VAMC page. This study will determine which VAMC pages should have what communication methods, and how those communications methods should be described and labeled. This usability study will directly inform upcoming design changes to  VAMC pages.

### Research questions

1) Where do Veterans expect to find each of the different methods of communication? [Note: may need to confirm that the participant knows what each of these are, or onboard them in some way during the study.]
	- VA Health Chat
	- Secure messaging
	- VA health connect (24/7 phone)
	- VA telehealth
2) How do Veterans expect communications methods to be labeled/described? 
3) Under what circumstances do Veterans choose specific communications methods?
4) Which communication methods do Veterans prefer overall, and how does this impact their elevation/placement on VAMC pages?

### Hypotheses

1) Most participants will want to access these methods of communication on facility health care pages.
2) Most participants will prefer methods of communication *other* than phone numbers.
3) Most participants will find phone number labeling adequate.
4) Most participants will prefer at least one page that lists all available communication methods (ie. on the Contact Us page).
5) Most participants will have similar use cases for specific communication methods (ie. secure messaging for appointments).

## Method	

This is a list of the research methods this study will utilize, along with a description of how these methods impact the goals of this study.

**1) Usability testing**

This usability test will use staging/production sites as appropriate.

- Method
	- Task flow from specific starting points:
		- [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/)
		- [System-level health care page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/)
		- [Facility-level health care page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/pittsburgh-va-medical-center-university-drive/)
- Goals
	- Gives us data on how Veterans search for communication methods on VA.gov, where Veterans generally expect to find this information, and their overall impressions of this experience.

**3) Tree test**

Tree testing will use [Optimal Workshop's Treejack](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack/) tools.

- Method
	- A tree test using system-level health care links/headings
	- A tree test using facility-level health care links/headings
- Goals
	- Gives us specific data on where Veterans feel communication methods should be located on VAMC pages based on side navigation links, and page headings.

**4) Contextual inquiry**

Contextual inquiry will utilize a [Mural board with sections for different scenarios](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1646769310259/6ca0b11d0a55138780cfc6a03f4da72718e5932e?sender=u8a90be72499ecb4354e14700).

- Method
	- Asking specific questions about existing labels, based on micro-scenarios.
	- Asking specific questions about which communication method Veterans would use for a given micro-scenario.
	- [Note: It may be benefificial to explore participant mental models before showing them labels]
- Goals
	- Gives us feedback on communications elements themselves, as opposed to where they are located. This is also a chance to capture general feedback and suggestions that may not have come up in previous tasks.

### Location

Remote usability testing will be conducting via Zoom.

### Research materials
