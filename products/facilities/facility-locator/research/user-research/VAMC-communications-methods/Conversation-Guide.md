# VAMC Communications - Conversation Guide

## Guide for note taking

Thank you note takers! Here's a breakdown of what we're hoping to highlight in this study, in terms of Veteran feedback:

- **Which** communication methods have Veterans used?
- **What** communications methods do Veterans prefer to use?
- **How** do Veterans locate these communication methods? (This involves the usability tasks outlined below)
- **When** do Veterans consider using particular communications methods - under what circumstances?
- **What** labels or descriptions to Veterans associate with these communications methods?

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Mute your Slack notifications*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.*

*In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Nick, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the different ways of communicating with VA facilities and health care personell, that are available on site pages. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

[WARM UP Qs RELATED TO EXPERIENCE WITH COMMUNICATION]

1) Can you tell me a little bit about how you communicate with your health care team: what has your experience been like?
2) Do you have a preferred method of contacting VA facilities or health care personell?
    - **If yes:**
        - Why do you prefer that one?
        - How did you learn about, or find it?
    - **If no:**
        - Is there a method that you would prefer, that we don't have?
3) To you, what makes for a good experience when contacting VA facilities or personell?

## Task 1: Usability testing - 20 minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed]
- [Etc]

## Task 2: Tree test - 15 minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Task 3: Contextual inquiry - 10 minutes

- Step 1

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- Based on your experience with the VA.gov pages, is there anything you would like to comment on that we haven't discussed?
- Is there anything about the communication methods that already exist, that you would change or add to?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
