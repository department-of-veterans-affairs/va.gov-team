# Research Goals

As part of the effort to align benefits and services across VAMC pages, we need to determine how Veterans expect services to be categorized. This study is seeking validation for existing services and their categories, as well as for potential new services (tasks, rather, as opposed to official VHA services) identified in [previous services taxonomy audits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/services-taxonomy/taxonomy-research-2021).

# Research Questions

1. Do the existing categories accurately reflect Veteran expectations of where to find services on VAMC pages?
2. Will Veterans create additional categories for existing services?
3. Will Veterans create additional categories for new services?
4. Are there services that are confusing, or need to be described using plainer language?
5. Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to described using plainer language?

# Methodology 

This study will utilize a moderated card sort, via [Optimal Workshop's](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) UX research tools. The card sort allows participants to arrange services into the categories they think fit them best, or, to create new categories if the existing categories aren't a good fit.

- Participants will perform a hybrid card sort for a list of new and currently existing services. The categories will include existing health services headings ("Primary care", "Mental health care", etc.), new suggestions, as well as the option to add additional categories.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

*("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”; “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”)*

1. Veterans will associate most services with existing category headings.
    - **Definitely true:** Some participants created new categories, but even they sorted the large majority of services into the predetermined categories. Most participants did not create new categories, and they sorted new and existing services into the predetermined categories.
2. Veterans will create new categories for some of the existing services.
    - **Likely true:** Some participants did create new categories for existing services, and gave their reasoning for why those categories were a better fit. There was alignment across participants related to why new categories were created - that said it is likely that more information is needed before making a determination about adding specific new categories.
3. Veterans will create new categories for some of the new services.
    - **Likely false:** Only one participant created new categories for new services, and gave their reasoning for why they were a better fit. It is likely that more information is needed before making a determination about new categories for new services.
4. Some of the existing, and new, services will cause confusion, and may require plainer language.
    - **Maybe true:** Almost all participants asked for at least one service to be explained to them, and most participants asked about the same few services.

# Key Findings

1. **Most participants found the pre-determined categories adequate.**
    - **8 of 14 participants** sorted all of their services into the pre-determined categories. Of this group, the general sentiment was that the predetermined categories were sufficient for organizing the available services, and that they did not need to be changed (described differently, or re-worded) in any way.
2. **All participants utilized the new "Administrative" category.**
    - **14 of 14 participants** added services to the "Administrative" category. For the most part, participants were in the greatest alignment for the servies they added to this category. Participants seemed to have the easiest time identifying which services belonged in this category; this is the only category were there was total alignment for one service in particular, and it seemd like the overall sentiment was that administrative services were obviously and intuitively "administrative".
3. **Some particpants suggested new categories for existing services.**
    - **6 of 14 participants** chose to add existing services to new categories. There was definite similarity to the newly created categories: most involved the process of leaving active service, and entering civilian life and/or the VA health care system. Other new categories were more varied.
    - **New categories for existing services, related to leaving active service:**
        - "Onboarding", "Incoming Veterans", "Transition", and "Post-service (aka I'm out - what now?)"
    - **Other new categories for existing services:**
        - "Financial", "Dietary Improvement", "Substance abuse", and "Vocation Rehabilitation & Employment"
4. **Almost no participants suggested new categories for new services.**
    - **1 of 14 participants** chose to add new services to two new categories.
    - **New categories for new services:**
        - "Substance abuse," and "Post-service (aka I'm out - what now?)"
5. **There were services that needed plainer description, and/or additional explanation.**
    - **13 of 14 participants** had questions about services, and most of the questions asked were about the same few services. By far, the most confusing/asked about service was "Registry exams", with **13 of 14** requiring a definition.
    - **Services requiring more than one explanation, across participants:**
        - "Registry exams", "Veteran connections", "Returning service member care", "Whole health", "Library services", "Advice nurse", "My HealtheVet Coordinator", and "Privacy office"
6. **How service categorization was distrbuted across participants:**
    - **The "Administrative" category had the most consistent alignment** across participants: participants agreed the most about which services belonged in this cateory.
    - **Some services were much more likely to grouped together** in the same category. For example:
        - "Billing insurance" and "Medical records"
        - "Freedom of Inforation Act requests" and "Privacy office"
        - "Minority Veteran care" and "LGBTQ+ Veteran care"
        - "MOVE! weight management" and "Nutrition, food, and dietary care"
    - **The most popular categories were:**
        - "Administrative", "Social program and services", and "Specialty care"
    - **The least popular categories were:**
        - "Prepare for your visit" and "Mental health care"

# Details of Findings

**1. Most participants found the pre-determined categories adequate.**

[DSP: Pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/DSP%3A%20Pages)

> P3: I think the categories are pretty good you know...[they] are self-explanatory and represent a good group of where I would look for information for specific things.

> P7: I think it all makes sense. I think prepare for your visit would have more, like directions and a phone list - how to contact people sort of thing.

> P8: Those [categories] are fine for the moment.

> P13: I think it works that way.

> P16: They look fine to me.

**2. All participants utilized the new "Administrative" category.**

[DSP: Pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/DSP%3A%20Pages)

> P2: [Referencing "Registry exams"] It is registration paperwork, so it belongs in administrative...The distinction between that [the "Onboarding" category the participant created] and the admin group is that the admin group is paperwork.

> P12: Administrative is the starting point then start zeroing in on what you are looking for.

> P13: [Reference to "Employmenet verification"] Administrative because admin people will take care of that.

**3. Some particpants suggested new categories for existing services.**

[DSP: Pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/DSP%3A%20Pages)

> P2: I would put it ["Returning service member care"] in a different group. Every Veteran has to go through it. [Created "Onboarding" category]

> P7: I don’t know where else you would put it ["Registry exams"] unless you have a category for incoming veterans. That’s what I would do, have a category for incoming veterans so I would move it there...I look at it ["Returning service member care"] from returning from overseas...so I would move it there. [Created "Incoming Veterans" category]

> P12: That could be one for a different category ["Travel reimbursement"], you might have a category that is financial. I would create a financial section. [Created "Financical" category]

> P17: I might call that transition because that’s ["Returning service member care"] coming form the military to veteran side. I want to call that transition. [Created "Transition" category"]...I want to create a new category and put that ["Nutrition, food, and dietary care"] and move in the same category. I think I would call it dietary improvement but it might change [Created "Dietary improvement"]...Lets leave it at post service because I cant think of a label. It’s a place for a new veteran to go to answer the question they have. They could start there. If I saw that I would know exactly which one to tap on [Created "Post-service" category for card sort 2].

> P18: I love VR&E I just finished mine. I wouldn’t put that in social programs, its more administrative. Actually I would personally put it in its own category. It would be called VR&E [Created "VR&E" category].

**4. Almost no participants suggested new categories for new services.**

[DSP: Pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/DSP%3A%20Pages)

> P17: I am starting to think about developing another category with substance abuse and smoking in the same spot. Let’s just call it substance abuse for now [Created "Substance abuse" category]...Actually let’s put that ["Applying for health care"] in post service because it’s another one I might change the title later [Created the "Post-service" category].

**5. There were services that needed plainer description, and/or additional explanation.**

[DSP: Pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/DSP%3A%20Pages)

> P3: I am not sure about what this ["Returning service member care"] is, is it returning to the va or going back to the military?

> P6: Beats the heck out of me. maybe those are exams to register claims or something like that. ["Registry exams"]

> P7: As in coming home from combat? I look at it from returning from overseas. I know this is a va thing but it could be rephrases as "new veteran". ["Returning service member care"]

> P15: I guess I am not familiar with what the library services entail. Social programs and services because in my mind that’s where it fits.

# Additional Insights

_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._

# Recommendations

- **Recommendation 1: Add the "Administrative" category to system-level and facility-level pages**
    - Every participant utilized the "Administrative" category, making it one of the most popular categories for new and existing services. The general sentiment was that some services seemed obviously administrative because they involed registration, paperwork, and requiring employee help for same.
- **Recommendation 2: Adding relevant patient-friendly name to services requiring explanation**
    - Similar services required explanation across participants, so utilizing the service patient-friendly name design pattern for new and existing services where appropriate, should help Veterans more quickly understand why a service belongs in a particular category.
- **Recommendation 3: Consider creating a category heading that calls out returning Veterans**
    - Of the new categories that were created, the majority were related to leaving active duty service, and returning to civilian life and/or entering the VA health care system. Even though the sample size for this study was relatively small, since multiple participants pointed out the utility this category would have for them, it makes me believe that it is worth considering exploring this additional to facility pages.

# Next Steps

_Next steps here. Include owners if appropriate._

# Further research needed

- **More participants needed in general**
    - Certain statistical analysis methods (such as the "Actual agreement dendrogram") provided by Optimal Workshop and used to analyze the card sort data, work best with at least 30 participants. With card sorts, the more participants, the more accurate the data, and I believe this study would benefit from a larger number of participants.
- **LGBTQ+ participants needed**
    - We did not have any identified LGBTQ+ participants, and multiple participants stated that they did not feel qualified to categorize the "LGBTQ+ Veteran care" service. In order to better understand where LGBTQ+ Veterans would categorize services designed for their health care needs, it would be beneficial to to speak with LGBTQ+ Veterans to hear their suggestions.
- **More participants who identify as minority Veterans and/or people of color**
    - While this study had a few participants that identifed as people of color, it was mostly made up of white/caucasian participants. It would be beneficial to speak to more minority Veterans in order to hear more suggestions on how to categorize the "Minority Veteran care" service.
- **Additionl tree testing**
    - Based on the results of this study, a tree test may help validate any categories that are added/created to facility pages.
