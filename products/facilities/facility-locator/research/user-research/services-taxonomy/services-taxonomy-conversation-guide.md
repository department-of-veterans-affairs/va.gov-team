# Services Taxonomy Conversation Guide

[Reviewed by Lauren Alexanderson on 11/12/21]

## For note takers

Complete verbatim transcripts aren't necessarily needed for this study. Here's where note taking will benefit us most:

- When a participant talks about their own experience with VA health care
- When a participant asks a question about a card, or category
- When a participant gives a suggestion about cards, categories, or a description of either

Here's a note-taking template for the two card sorts, which lists the cards, the categories, and has space to write notes next to each:

## Intro [5 minutes]

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Nick, I'm a designer working on the VA.gov site, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today you are helping us simplify how Veterans find services on the VA.gov site. 

- **Do you have any questions before we get started?**

Before we get to the tasks you are helping us with today, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session is scheduled for 1 hour, but it may not take that long**.
- **There is no need to turn on your camera - if you perfer, audio only is fine**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. 
  - We are not testing you, or your ability, instead, we are finding out if the website meets your needs. 
  - You cannot do anything wrong. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  - We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - [If yes]: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  - [If no]: Alright, I will be writing or typing notes as we go.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

** **START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD** **

* **I have started recording.** 
  - I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Warm-up [5 minutes]

- **Can you tell me about your service history?**
- **Can you tell me a little about what kinds of VA facilities you have visited before?** [Hospitals, Vet Centers, etc.?]
- **Have you ever participated in a VA research study before?**
  - Are you familiar with what a card sort is?
  - [Yes]: Great, I'll just give you a brief overview since you're already familiar.
  - [No]: No problem, before we start I'll explain how it works.
- **During this session, you may need to share your screen - are you comfortable doing that today?**
  - [Yes]: Before you do so, please make sure there is no personal information visible on your sreen, like email, Facebook, etc.
  - [No]: Ok no problem, I can share my screen with you then, and you can tell me what to do.
  - [Work out any technical difficulties - worst case, run card sorts on my screen while explaining]

## Usability tasks [~ 40 minutes]

### Task: card sort

[Share your screen - open the [demo card sort](https://bananacom.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/bananacom-demo-survey-open/sort) to demonstrate the actions on your screen]

- **Before I send this to you, I'll give you brief demonstration of how the card sort works**
  - On the left side of your screen, there is a list of some of the services that are offered at VAMC facilities.
  - On the right side of your screen, are different ways to categorize those services.
  - You can drag items from the list of services on the left, into any category you choose, on the right.
  - You can create new categories by dragging a service into an empty space.
- **Would you prefer to sort these yourself, or would you prefer me to perform the sort, while you tell me what to do?**
  - [Participant wants to perform the actions]: Alright, I'm going to send you a link, and ask you to share your screen.
  - [Host should perform the actions]: Alright, we can continue using my screen, while I explain it to you.

** **Send high priority services card sort first, then lower priority services** **

[Low priority services card sort](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/fq1733b5-0)

** **RUN CARD SORTS** **

- **If you need an explanation for any services, or categories, please let me know**
  - [Ask them to explain why they think each service goes where]
- **[Be ready with VHA services descriptions, and descriptions of "new" services]**
  - [Link to VHA services list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rd7ms6umKBq71SaLH2wdaofEZLoA3F-U2wRBUgj6QNg/edit#gid=1899971175)
- **[Moderator questions to keep in mind]**
  - What does [service] mean to you?
  - Does this service/cateogry need to be explained more clearly?
  - How else might you describe it the service/category?
  - [Don't necessarily point out something that a participant didn't point out themselves]
  - [Has Veteran used their facility's website? ie. Pittsburgh has been out for a while, which means people may be more familiar with it]

** **MAKE SURE PARTICIPANTS CLICK "FINISH" TO CAPTURE DATA** **

## Closing [5 minutes]

### Post-research follow-up questions

- Is there anything else that you would like to point out, having gone through these exercises?
- Could we describe any of these services or categories more clearly?

### Thank you and closing

Thank you! Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, if you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session, our team can send you an email with a little description that you can pass along.

Thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.
