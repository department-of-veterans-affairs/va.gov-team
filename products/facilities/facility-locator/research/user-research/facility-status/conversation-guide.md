## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA.gov website and the information you see on those location pages. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.
- **Then, I'll ask you to share your screen.** This will allow us to follow along with you. I'll send you a link and we'll look at the location finder together and I'll ask you a few questions about it.
- **You'll be participating in four exercises.** I will send you a link to a different website for that. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

[Start recording]

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?
- Have you visited a VA location recently? 
- What reasons do you visit VA locations?


## First Task: [REVIEW LOCATION FINDER] - 15 minutes

[SHARE LINK]

I'd like us to look at the website together, so that I can point out the area that we'll be talking about. I'm going to share a link and ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along.

[QUESTIONS]

- Are you familiar with VA.gov's location finder? 
- Have you had a reason to use it recently? 
    - If so, what were you doing? What was that experience like?
- How are you currently getting information on location hours, closures, etc.?

[TASK]

- Now, I'm going to give you zip code to use to look up a facility. [01904] 
- Tell me about the hours and services at the location in this particular zipcode [01904]

    ### Things to watch for:

    - [Does the participant think to click into the Clinic for more information?]

- What information do you need to prepare for a visit to a facility?
- Can you think of a time when the information on a facility was unhelpful or inaccurate and affected your visit?
- What would make you trust that the information on the listing/result is accurate?

## Second Task: [DEFINE CURRENT STATUSES]  - 5 minutes

We're going to move onto the next exercise. So, I'm going to share a link for you to click on.  

[Shares OptimalSort link]

Today, when a location is not operating with normal hours and services, we display 1 of 3 possible statuses. On the following screens, briefly explain how you interpret each status.

    - Facility Closed
    - Facility notice 
    - Limited services

## Third Task: [MULTIPLE CHOICE - CHOOSE A STATUS]  - 5 minutes
 
[Multiple choice activity]

Now, i'd like you to read over this blurb and choose which status you think it should have.

## Fourth Task: [CARD SORT 2 - OPEN SORT OF SCENARIOS] - 10 minutes

[Card Sort]

Given what's important for you to know when visiting VA locations, how would you sort and categorize these scenarios.

Now we're going to look at a number of different scenarios that can impact a VA facility's hours and services. I'd like you to review them and sort them in categories that makes the most sense to you. You can create and name the categories in whatever way makes the most sense to you.

### Things to watch for:

- [What language is unclear or confusing?]

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
