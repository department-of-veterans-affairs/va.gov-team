## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA.gov website and the information you see on those location pages. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **First, we'll ask you to share your screen.** This will allow us to follow along with you. I'll send you a link and we'll look at the location finder together and I'll ask you a few questions about it.
- **Then, you'll be participating in a sorting activity.** So, we will send you a link to a different website to do that activity. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record this session** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.  

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you familiar with VA.gov's location finder? 
- Have you had a reason to use it recently? What was that experience like?

## First Task: REVIEW LOCATION FINDER - 10 minutes
*Facilitator shares link and asks participant to share screen*
https://www.va.gov/find-locations/ 

- I'd like you to think of a situation where you would want to look up a VA facility to know their hours and services. Can you try to do that search now?
- Is this the right information that you would need?

You notice that the search results have different alerts on them. There are many different events that can impact the hours and services that impact individual facilities. I'd like you to keep this in mind for our next exercise.

## Second: REVIEW CURRENT STATUSES - 5 minutes
*Facilitator shares OptimalSort link*
*Facilitator points out the status categories.*

- What do these statuses mean to you?

## Third Task: [CARD SORT] - 15 minutes
*Facilitator explains the card sorting activity.*

On the left, you see a number of scenarios that can impact a VA facilities hours and services. I'd like you to review each on and sort them in under the status that makes the most sense to you. 

If you don't find a category that makes sense to you, you can create your own category but wherever possible, try to use the 4 existing categories.


### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of the status categories]
- [What language is unclear or confusing?]


## Post-Task Interview - 15 minutes

- What would make you trust that the information on the listing/result is accurate?
- How are you currently getting information on location hours, closures, etc.?
- Are you interested in why a facility is closed or if the hours are affected? If so, please explain.
- What reasons do you visit VA locations? How would these messages affect your visit?
- Can you think of a time when the information on a facility was unhelpful or inaccurate and affected your visit?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
