## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA.gov website and the information you see on those location pages.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.
- **Then, I'll be sharing my screen.** We'll look at the location finder together and I'll ask you a few questions about it.
- **You'll be participating in four exercises** that we will do together. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?
- Have you visited a VA location recently? 
- For what reasons do you visit VA locations?


## First Task: [REVIEW LOCATION FINDER] - 15 minutes

For our first exercise, I'd like for us to look at VA.gov website together, so that I can point out the area that we'll be talking about. I have a few questions before we begin. 

[QUESTIONS]

- Are you familiar with VA.gov's location finder? 
- Have you had a reason to use it recently? 
    - If yes, what were you doing? What was that experience like?
    - If no, how do you go about finding information about VA locations?
- How are you currently getting information on location hours, closures, etc.?

[MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN & PULLS UP LOCATION FINDER]
https://www.va.gov/find-locations/ 

I'm going to walk us through a scenario. Imagine you are planning a trip and you’d like to know what the closest VA facility would be from where you’ll be staying.

- If you were in this situation, what information would you need when preparing to visit to a facility?

Let’s imagine the location is Lamar, CO.

[MODERATOR ENTERS A LOCATION]

- What can you tell me about the hours and services at the location?
- What would be your next step?

[MODERATOR CLICKS INTO LOCATION]

- What about now? What can you tell me about the hours and services at this location?
- What would make you trust that the information on the listing/result is accurate?
- Can you think of a time when the information on a facility was unhelpful or inaccurate and affected your visit?

## Second Task: [DEFINE CURRENT STATUSES]  - 5 minutes

We're going to move onto the second exercise.

[PULLS UP OPTIMAL SORT]

Today, when a location is not operating with normal hours and services, we display 1 of 3 possible statuses. On the following screens, we’re going to look at these statuses and I’d like you to tell me how you interpret each of them.

    - Facility Closed
    - Facility notice 
    - Limited services

## Third Task: [MULTIPLE CHOICE - CHOOSE A STATUS]  - 5 minutes
 
[MULTIPLE CHOICE ACTIVITY]

On this third exercise, I'd like you to read over the blurb of text and choose which status you think it should have.

## Fourth Task: [CARD SORT 2 - OPEN SORT OF SCENARIOS] - 10 minutes

[CARD SORT PREP]

This is the 4th and final exercise.

We just went over three possibilities for statuses that you could see on a facility, "Facility closed," "Facility notice," and "Limited services."  

We suspect that these might be confusing to some people and we think you might have a different idea about how you might name them.

The white boxes contain various events that could affect facility hours and services and currently could result in seeing statuses like the ones we saw earlier. I’d like you to consider each event and sort them into categories. I’ll move them for you.

Afterwards you can create "statuses" that make sense to you. You could use the statuses we’ve already seen or create new statuses.

[CARD SORT]

**Feel free to think out loud as you work through the exercise.**

[AFTER CARD SORT]

[QUESTION]

- Can you talk me through how these categories might work as more useful statuses on the VA locations pages

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
