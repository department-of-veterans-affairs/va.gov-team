# Facility Locator Research Gameplan

Function/Feature | Research Questions | Methodology | Notes
-----------------|--------------------|-------------|-------
Urgent Care | How can we provide access to the Benefit PDF for Veterans? What details do Veterans expect to see re: urgent care facilities? Do Veterans understand how urgent care and community care work together? Should we prioritize Urgent Care on the FL tool? | Remote Moderated Usability Study
Flow to VAMC Detail | What information do users find most helpful on this page?  | Mod/Unmod Usability Testing? | 
Health vs "other" VA services | How do veterans interpret the difference between these facilities? What way would be best to show different facility options? |
FL Widget | How might a facility locator widget be helpful on other pages?
Caregiver Usability | 
Find VA Locations Map |
Search Results Cards | | Card Sort, Mod/Unmod Usability Test | 
Facility & Service Filters | | Tree Test, Usability Test | 
Emergency | What's the most beneficial way to show Emergency on FL? What is the user objective when looking up an emergency location? Are they coming to research VA Emergency locations? Or are they coming to the site to prepare for an immediate visit? | | 
Urgent Care PDF | Does the language make sense? Is it accessible? Can it be simplified?
