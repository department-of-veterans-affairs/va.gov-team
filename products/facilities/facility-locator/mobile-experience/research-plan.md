# Research Plan: Facility Locator - Mobile Experience

## Goals
- Understand how Veterans expectations for Find a VA Location search results differ for mobile vs desktop users
- Understand how industry standards impact Veteran expectations for the Facility Locator search experience
- Evaluate new designs created for geolocation and map view

## Background 

- In a mobile month study, veterans were not interested in using the map view of Facility Locator #14484
- In the mobile month study, veterans were not able to find the Facility Locator from the VA.gov homepage
- The Facility Locator search experience has not been approached from a mobile-first perspective
- Updates to the user interface to be tested include the implementation of two new features ("use my location" and "clear field") and the resolution of accessibility defects

## Hypotheses

- Veterans need to be able to enter data and clear field inputs easily
- Veterans searching for a VA location on a mobile device will want to view closest VA facilities in a list and on a map
- Veterans using the map view will know that by tapping on map pins, they will see facility information and location
- Veterans want to be able to opt-in to geolocation at search level, rather than via browser
- Veteran expectations of the Facility Locator need to be alined with other private industry map-based mobile search experiences

## Questions

**When searching on mobile device**

**Search box**
- Do participants understand how to enable their location?
- Do participants understand how to clear inputs?

**Search results** 
- What are Veteran expectations of Facility Locator mobile experience?
- Will Veterans notice/understand the Geolocation functionality?
- Do Veterans using a mobile device prefer to view results on the map or in a list?
- Do Veterans expect to find detailed information on the map view?
- Does the information presented for a given facility match expectations?
  -  Does the Veteran understand how to find more detailed information about the facilities returned?
- What online maps/searches do these participants find easiest to use/why?

## Risks and assumptions

This study:
- will not test screen reader, keyboard or other Assistive Technology use; findings may not reveal problems that users with these technological constraints may encounter.
- will use a prototype with a map that will differ in how a fully programmed website will behave when a user uses certain gestures to adjust the map. 

## Method
- Sessions will consist of mobile device usability testing, with task analysis, of a high-fidelity, mobile prototype created in UXPin.
- Sessions will be remotely moderated via Zoom. 

## Participants and Recruitment

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for **recruiting and notetaking**.
- We'd like to schedule 15 participants to reach our goal of observing **10 participants**. 

### Participant Criteria:

**Primary Criteria**

- Participants must be a Veteran, active duty service member, reservist, or national guard member.
- Participants must have a mobile device to run the study with

**Secondary Criteria**

At least:
- 3 participants living in a rural or remote area
- 3 participants living in a major metropolitan area
- 2 participants that do not have a college degree
- 4 females
- 2 participants of color
- 2 participants 35 or under
- 2 participants 36 - 50
- 2 participants 51 - 65
- 2 participants 66 - over
- 2 participants with cognitive disabilities
- 2 participants with a disability rating of 70% or greater

## Recruitment Requirements
* All participants must use a mobile device.
* The participants have Zoom downloaded on their phone prior to the session
* The participants know how to screen-share.

We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.
