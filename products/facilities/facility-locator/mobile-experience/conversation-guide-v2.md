## Intro 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Laurel/Christian, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding the nearest VA facility near you. I just want to confirm that you joined the Zoom meeting on a mobile phone. 

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes or less

- We’ll start the session with a couple warm up questions

- Then we’ll be reviewing a prototype on a mobile device together. Since this is just a prototype, not everything will be clickable or functioning

- In this session, we want to hear your honest thoughts and opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to improve VA.gov to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Please try and think aloud as you are clicking through and interacting with the prototype.

- I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you'll be using today?

- Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.

**Have the participant share their screen FIRST, then send link to prototype in chat window to participant**

- Before we get started with testing the prototype, we need to get your device setup for sharing your screen.

_For iPhone:_

- When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll want to tap on the phone screen, this will activate a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share screen, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share screen." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share screen’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- It will give you some options, choose "Screen"
- You should get a page that says "screen broadcast"
- Zoom should be checked, if not, please select it and tap "Start broadcast"
- It should start counting down as it starts to share (Zoom uses the phone's recording software to share)
- If you need to stop sharing during this session you can click 'Stop Broadcast'
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! 
- Now I need you to pull up the prototype in the chat. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". Click on the link in the prototype.
_For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing_

_For Android:_

- When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll want to tap on the phone screen, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "navigate" as I "drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Participant clicks on prototype and should be screensharing**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will not be attributed to you directly. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

 - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

## Start recording to the Cloud

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions

- Can you tell me a little about yourself or your service history?
- Have you used the VA.gov website before?
- If yes, what was the last thing you were doing or looking for on the site?
- Have you ever tried to find a VA facility on VA.gov on your computer or a mobile device?
- Have you visited a VA facility for healthcare in the past couple of years?
 
## Prototype - 35 minutes

## 1st Task: Find the nearest VA facility in the Washington DC area that offers optometry near you. 

### Scenario
- You've come to the VA website because you need to find the nearest facility that offers optometry services near you. Let's imagine you are currently at your house, at 82 I St. SE in Washington DC. Can you walk me through how you would find a VA facility that offers optometry services near you? Let me know when you’re done and which one you selected.

**Things to watch for**

- How does the participant search by location (geolocation or address)?
- Is the participant comfortable with letting VA.gov use their current location?
- Which facility type dropdown option do they select?
- Does the participant find/use the map tab?

### Follow up questions once the user has completed 1st task

- Tell me more about why you choose the option of (VA Health, etc)
- Was there any information that you were expecting to see in this list of facilities that you did not see? 

## 2nd Task: Review VA location search results map

**[If they did go to the map view for task 1,]**
- I noticed you went to the map view, let's go back to it and take a look again.

**[If they didn’t go to the map view for task 1,]**
- Ok did you see notice tab that says map? If so, why didn’t you tap on it? Would you please tap on it now? 

### Follow up questions 

- Is this map useful for you?
- Compare the list view vs the map view. Talk out loud/tell us what you notice. 
 - If they do not notice: Is the information presented differently? 

**Things to watch for**

- Does the participant expect the information displayed for a VA location to be consistent or different in the list vs map tabs?

## 3rd Task: Viewing more than one location on the map

### Scenario

While you are in the map tab, can you show me how you would view all of the locations near you?

**Things to watch for**

- Does the participant know that more than one location can be viewed (swipe right)?
- How do they interact with the map?
- Do they zoom/pan?
- Does the participant find that the map pins are interactive and find that they can be clicked to display a VA location card?
- How would the participant dismiss the location cards?

## 4th Task: Contact a VA Facility

### Scenario
Choose one of the locations near you. Is there any information available on this view that would help you make an appointment? 
### Follow up questions 

- Can you see yourself using this tool on your mobile phone? 
- Can you tell me a situation when this would be helpful for you to use it?

**Things to watch for**

- Are links for directions, dial phone numbers for each location on mobile useful for the participant?

## 5th Task: Clear the location field, enter in a new location

### Scenario
Now you’ve decided you want to look for a facility that offers optometry near where your mom lives in Sacramento, California. How would you do this?

**Things to watch for**

- Does the participant prefer entering an address manually or sharing their location?
- Can the participant easily clear the location field?

## Post-Task Interview 

- What are your impressions of the list view versus the map view? 
- When might you use the list view? 
- When might you use the map view? 
- Do you have a preference? 
- When you are looking at the search results in the list view, how far is too far? Fill in the blank for me: "I wouldn't want to see anything on a list that is further than ___ miles?"
- How large of an area of the map would you want to interact with?
- When you are looking at the search results in the map view, is it helpful to see your neighborhood? Your whole town? Your county? Your state? 
- What other questions do you have?
