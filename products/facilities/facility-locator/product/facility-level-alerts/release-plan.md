# Release Plan: Display of Facility-level alerts
---

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)
- Not planned at this time due to urgent need to release this enhancement to support COVID-19 

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing
- Not planned at this time due to urgent need to release this enhancement to support COVID-19 

### Planning:
- Between March 1, 2020 and March 30, 2020, 51.5% of the 338,004 users were unique. The availability of  operating status is not expected to increase our average user traffic. 
- This will be immediately available to all Facility Locator users as part of the unauthenicated experience. 
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers)
   - Ideally, Facility Locator would link directly to a page displaying the facility-level operating status so that we could track that traffic. However, not all VA facilities have a website. Facilities which do display the information do not organize it in a consistent predictable way that can be logically linked. 
   - The Pittsburgh VAMC health care system **does** have specific pages for this purpose and will be used as a proxy, measuring click through rate beginning with the COVID-19 alert banner through to the facility-level operating status information. 
   - Additionally, Veterans will be directed to the webpages from facility detail pages viewed in Facility Locator. This traffic can also be measured.  
- KPI: Number of calls to contact center about facility status  
  - March 2020 = 235 calls

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
