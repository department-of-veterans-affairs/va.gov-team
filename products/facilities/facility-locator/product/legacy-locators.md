_Last update: 2020-06-08_

This list of locators was taken from https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/1528

There is also an [intranet locator](https://vaww.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp) this is also contains data for both facilities and staff profiles. This is a data source for several Locators such as PTSD, SUD, etc.
