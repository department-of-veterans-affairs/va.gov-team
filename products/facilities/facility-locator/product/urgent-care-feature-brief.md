### User Journey
- Following the Mission Act, eligible Veterans have access to urgent care benefits in their community and need help knowing where and how to receive care. 

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*
- As a Veteran using the Tricare or Optum network area, I need to...
  - Find the appropriate urgent care facility for my situation so I can use my benefits for care.
  - Find a retail pharmacy so that I can have fill my prescription. 
  - Understand my available benefit so I can be prepared for my visit to the urgent care/retail pharmacy.

### Project Rationale
_Why should this project be a priority?_ 
- The current implementation is not consistent with Veterans' mental models for urgent care. 
- The separate TriWest facility locator leads to a misunderstanding of coverage for the returned providers.
- The current implementation considers only TriWest network providers.  
- Users don't have a easy way to search for urgent care facilities.

**Stakeholder/Business drivers**
- The Office of Community Care has been dissatisfied with the community care implementation. (_Factors causing dissatisfaction: data errors and inconsistency of results compared to legacy system, search latency, lack of visibility for urgent care subtypes and frustrating usability issues. As a result, searches continue to be directed to an external TriWest Provider locator._) 
- Urgent care is a particularly high visibility subset of Community Care functionality. 
- The impending addition of the Optum network of providers on 2/1/2020 increases the priority of this work. 

**Findings from research conducted December 2019**
- Veterans are not aware of the type of care they can receive at urgent care facilities. There is a general lack of communication/education around the difference between community care providers and VA health care
- When prompted to choose an urgent care location to stitch a wound, a majority of participants mentioned that they would visit an ER or VA facility and not an Urgent Care location.
- Participants were drawn to location input and dropdowns and did not choose to filter their search results.
- Overlapping benefits cause confusion when visiting in-network providers.
- Internal language and inconsistent labeling cause users to hesitate when looking into facilities.
- Participants did not understand the difference between "retail" urgent care and urgent care until they were given a definition and example treatments

### Project Scope and Scale
_What's in and what's out?_

**MVP**
- Iteration incorporates previous community and urgent care research, Facility Locator discovery research and feedback
- Veterans are assisted in understanding the sub-type choices for urgent care and are able to determine which facility type meets their current need.
- Veteran can differentiate between urgent care sub-type in search results (but do not necessarily need to be able to filter or search by sub-type in MVP)
- Facilities returned as results of urgent care search do not reference a need for referral. [#4241]
- Veterans are able to download the urgent care benefit PDF (or a placeholder) to print or access on a mobile device. (_Dependency on OCC for final version of PDF_)
- Workflow includes information to help the Veteran understand how to fill an Urgent Care Pharmacy Prescription
- Design does not include TriWest link (which will be removed pending OCC approval) 

**MVP will also include some general usability and search functionality improvements**

Focused on solving the following problems:
- Search UI is inconsistent (i.e., free text search box, dropdowns, typeahead)
- Map functionality is confusing (iconography, results, mileage)
- Search parameters for facility type/service is not consistent with Veterans' mental models about care.

To address the following user stories: 
- As a Veteran, I want reliable and consistent information between online and physical locations so that I can trust the information which is displayed. 
- As a Veteran, I need multiple entry points to the Facility Locator tool so that I can search for a facility from different Va.gov hubs.
- As a Veteran, I want to view high level location information included with the search results (ie: Phone number, Today's hours. Directions, Service selected)

**Future Iterations for Community Care/Urgent Care**
- Veteran may need to filter/search based on urgent care sub-type. (Will be informed by future research)
- Workflow iterations for urgent care prescriptions

### Not currently in scope
- Emergency care
- Remaining Community Care services

### Measuring Success
_How will we know if we are successful?_

**Objective: Improve Veteran search experience**
- Key Result #1: 100% of known (legacy) usability and accessibility defects are resolved by April 1, 2020.
- Key Result #4: A baseline rate for 5 star user satisfaction will be established by April 1, 2020.
- _Note: We will also be assessing user satisfaction and success of our UX changes through user feedback during research sessions._

**Objective: Reform Community Care Implementation**
  - Key Result #1: The rate of search refinements for Community Care will be at parity with VA facility searches by July 1, 2020. 
  - Key Result #2: All urgent care searches will be performed using the modernized Facility Locator by February 2, 2020. (_This pertains to any search that originates within the Facility Locator. It does not include any external Urgent care locators which can be accessed directly._)
  - Key Result #3: A baseline for the percentage of users searching for urgent care who download the benefit PDF will be established by March 15, 2020. (Future: increase % with future UX iterations)

### Dependencies
_Are other features dependent on this one? What do we need from partners? What do we need outside of engineering?_

**Team/Internal dependencies**
  - Ability to differentiate among facility sub-types is access dependent.
  - Comprehensive QA strategy requires lower environment with PPMS data for testing. 
  - Dependency on OCC for final version of PDF
  - Dependency on OCC approval to sunset TriWest urgent care locator
  
**Partner dependencies**
  - Data quality is dependent on data owners, in part. (PPMS)
  - Benefit PDF will be available, pending OCC approval.
  - PDF content is entirely created by OCC, without user input or accessibility testing. _(We will work to mitigate these risks by including questions about the PDF during user research and by conducting separate accessibility research post-MVP)
  - API for PPMS source system is subject to change without notification. _(We will work to mitigate this risk in a coming sprint.)_
  
  ### Risk factors
  - This UX redesign is reliant on the data provided via PPMS and is dependent on the resolution of existing data concerns.
  - This work is dependent on the availability of Optum network information.

### Rejected Solutions
*What other approaches did we consider and why were they rejected?*
- Considered the need to return emergency care as part of urgent care research results
  - Emergency care will be separate facility type 
- Options for urgent care pharmacy search
  - Although urgent care pharmacies are considered part of the Community Care/urgent care benefit, our assumption is that Veterans are not likely to search for them under the "urgent care" heading. For MVP, we decided to add urgent care pharmacies to the initial dropdown box (with VA Health, VA benefits. etc).
- UX iterations
  - Quick links for urgent care and emergency care were considered but failed during user research sessions. Users did not seem to notice the quick links so we decided to make urgent care, emergency care and urgent care pharmacies more prominent in search dropdowns.
  - Opinions on the best labels to be used for urgent care subtypes differ for OCC and DEPO. Variations will be tested during user research sessions. 

### Definition of Done
- The Veteran must be able to successfully search for an urgent care facility.
- The Veteran must be able to successfully search for a retail pharmacy.
- High level location information is included in search results.
- The Veteran can view the name, address, phone number, directions, hours of operation and services offered for the chosen facility. 
- The Veteran can download benefit information to take to the facility.
- Veterans using assistive technology can achieve the stated goals above.  
- Existing functionality for searching VHA (including Vet Centers), VBA and NCA facilities will be maintained. 

### Key Links
_Links to requirements documentation, wireframes/mock-ups, research, etc._
