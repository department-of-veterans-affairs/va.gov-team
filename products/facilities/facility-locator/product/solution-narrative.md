# Facility Locator: Solution Narrative

## Technical Decisions
- Date: summary of any big changes and why

## Product Decisions
**Facility Locator is considered part of the unauthenicated experience.**
- Questions for our North Star discussion
  - If a Veteran has logged in, is the search for a facility different? If so, how?
  **Andy:** (Oct. 1, 2019) We are building an unauthenticated product. We have no immediate plans to "change" the product, or the way it works, when a user is signed in. However, we will more deeply integrate the Facility Locator into the global navigation and authenticated user experience, the latter of which may include user customization of the tool while signed in.
  - Where does the integration of benefits tie in?   
  **Andy:** (Oct. 1, 2019) We will be designed new structed content for the Facility Locator that (1.) surfaces basic benefits eligibility information and (2.) drives users to the benefit hubs.
  
  
  **What defines Facility Locator 2.0?**
  
  
  **Does it make sense to indicate what type of user is looking for a Facility?**
    - _I am a Veteran_
    - _I am a family member/caregiver (same? different?)_
    - _I am searching on behalf of a Veteran_
    
    **I notice counseling services (children, family, relationship) on the caregiver journey map. Are these services included under Mental Health?**
    **What about "peer support" for caregivers? (Is this CSP?) How are these services located?** Michelle: Note that I understand these may not be our first priority items but am asking in case the ideas impact how information is organized/presented.
