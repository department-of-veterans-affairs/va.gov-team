# Facility Locator: Solution Narrative

## Technical Decisions
- Date: summary of any big changes and why

## Product Decisions
**Facility Locator is considered part of the unauthenicated experience.**
- Questions for our North Star discussion
  - If a Veteran has logged in, is the search for a facility different? If so, how?
  **Andy:** (Oct. 1, 2019) We are building an unauthenticated product. We have no immediate plans to "change" the product, or the way it works, when a user is signed in. However, we will more deeply integrate the Facility Locator into the global navigation and authenticated user experience, the latter of which may include user customization of the tool while signed in.
  - Where does the integration of benefits tie in?   
  **Andy:** (Oct. 1, 2019) We will be designed new structed content for the Facility Locator that (1.) surfaces basic benefits eligibility information and (2.) drives users to the benefit hubs.
