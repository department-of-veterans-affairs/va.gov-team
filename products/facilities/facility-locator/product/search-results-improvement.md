### User Journey
- Veterans use the Facility Locator to find locations where they can access a variety of benefits and services. The Mission Act defined criteria under which Veterans may be eligible for additional benefits or an expanded list of locations. Regardless of eligibility, Veterans have a right to expect search functionality that returns relevant and meaningful facility information quickly. 

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*

As a Veteran using the Facility Locator, I need to...
- have relevant search results returned to me quickly 
- view an appropriate number of search results
- define my search area by interacting with the map
- find the location closest to me (whether it is five or fifty miles away)
 
### Project Rationale
_Why should this project be a priority?_ 
- The current implementation has significant latency, particularly for community care searches
- Search performance is impacted by current default settings which may not be aligned with user expectations. 
- User expectations may depend on location (urban vs rural) and type of facility searched. 
- The Facility Locator roadmap contains future iterations which will be shaped by our understanding of user expectations for search results and map interaction. 

**Stakeholder/Business drivers**
- The Office of Community Care has been dissatisfied with the usability and performance of the community care implementation. 
- Other business owners (NCA, VHA) have expressed their concern over latency and usability. 

**Findings from research conducted March 2019**
TBD
