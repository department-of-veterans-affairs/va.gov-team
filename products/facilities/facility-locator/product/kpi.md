# VSA - Facility Locator: KPI Setting (WIP)

## Product Line
- Unauthenticated Experience
## North Star: TBD
## Product
- Facility Locator 
## High Level Objectives
- Work with Veterans and beneficiaries to design and deliver the best digital experience in the federal government.
- Provide a single, consolidated place across VA.gov where Veterans and beneficiaries can easily find and understand high-level information about VA facilities and the benefits and services that are offered
- Design customer-focused, data-driven interactions to improve ease of use and comprehension 
- Integrate access to emergency/urgent care facilities
- Prepare Veteran for the visit: what are the obligations of this tool related to preparing for the visit?
## "Assumed" Pain Points
- Finding a facility is frustrating for Veterans. The process is lengthy and not always successful.
- Searching for a facility often requires use of more than one Facility Locator, resulting in inconsistent presentation of information and confusing navigation. 
- Search results can be incomplete and/or incorrect with high latency/timeouts
- Information presented can be easily misunderstood or incomplete, may not represent what is actually offered
## Desired Outcomes (WIP)
- Driving veterans into Benefit Hub 
  - _click events or tagging of search UI_
- Reduced time spent on finding facility information.
  - _I notice VSP has this:"90% of user requests are served in <1000 ms (latency)" or do we want to measure in "clicks"_fewer queries? less scrolling? Magnification? Search refinement? 
- Enhanced Veteran comprehension about available services, where to access the services and how they will be covered 
  - (_how can we measure this?_ _"did you find this useful? Did you find what you are looking for? Thumbs up/down?_
- Reduced number of calls regarding facilities and scheduling and satisfaction
  - (_Call center data about specific items, such as parking_)
## Hypotheses
- By ____, we expect search performance to be on par with private sector industry standard. 
- By redesigning the UI around Urgent Care services, we expect Veterans to find and understand information for these services more quickly. 
- By implementing Health Services taxonomy, we expect Veterans to be able to search and identify the services they seek.  
- By conducting research, we can test our assumptions about user pain points.
