## v2: December 2019

### Background
The following images are from the next iteration, a prototype used in user research during December 2019. 
- The goals of the research were to learn the best way to provide location information for Urgent Care facilities on the Find VA Locations page of VA.gov and to learn how Veterans view "retail" and "urgent" locations.

This iteration tested making urgent care and community health more prominent in the drop-down.

And providing more education about the differences between the sub-types.

This iteration also included some map modifications made after user research revealed existing iconography was confusing.

- The approaching addition of Optum as a network provider made the UX redesign MVP necessary by 2/1/2020.
