# Facility Locator UX Redesign Narrative

The purpose of this document is to provide a narrative of the iterations and decisions made during the UX redesign.
It is preceded by 
- [Beginning September/October 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/initiatives/2019-2020-UX-redesign/ux-redesign-narrative-sept-2019.md)
- [v1: November 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/initiatives/2019-2020-UX-redesign/ux-redesign-narrative-nov-2019.md)
- [v2: December 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/edit/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/initiatives/2019-2020-UX-redesign/ux-redesign-narrative-dec-2019.md)

## v3: February 2020

### Urgent care labels

Findings from the [User research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/urgent-care/research-findings.md) conducted in December including the following: 
- Preference for ER or VA facility for urgent care scenarios, rather than an Urgent Care location
- Confusion about benefit coverage at facilities outside the VA 
- Internal language and inconsistent labeling cause users to hesitate when looking into facilities.

Finding labels that are meaningful to Veterans _and_ acceptable to stakeholders was challenging during parts of this project. 
Labels which were considered midproject are documented [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/images/FL-MVP-Language-Revisions.pdf). 

MVP included urgent care as a **VA facility type** with two **service types**:
- VA urgent care
- Community urgent care providers (in VA's network): Searches for this service type returns results for URGENT CARE (if POS code = 20) and RETAIL/WALK-IN CARE (if POS code = 17). These urgent care facility types are designated on the search result card.

## Changes to search functionality
- Search functionality moved to new 2 row stacked design 
- Dropdown functionality has been maintained.
- Facility type-specific iconography has been removed from dropdown because Veterans did not find it meanigful during user research

Timeline continues:
