# Narrative: Facility Locator UX Redesign and Urgent Care MVP

The purpose of this document is to provide a narrative of the iterations and decisions made during the UX redesign. 

## Beginning: September/October 2019

### Background
- The Facility Locator team was formed during September/October of 2019. 
- The Facility Locator allowed users to search for locations within VHA (including Vet Centers), VBA, NCA and Community Care (recently added). 
- Based on known legacy issues and business need, it became clear that the recent implementation of Community care was not supporting Veterans, especially in their searches for urgent care. 
- Urgent care is a component of Community Care. Users searching for a Community Care facility are required to specify a service type as part of the search parameters. The logic for the search is not consistent with Veteran mental models for healthcare, causing frustration. 
- The search functionality and data quality concerns meant a link to TriWest's urgent care locator would persist above the search feature on the Facility Locator page. The workflow beyond VA.gov includes a PDF which explains urgent care benefits to Veteran, provider and pharmacy, A step in the process is downloading the PDF to take to the visit.
