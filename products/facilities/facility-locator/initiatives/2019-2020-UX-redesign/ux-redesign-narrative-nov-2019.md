# Narrative: Facility Locator UX Redesign and Urgent Care MVP

The purpose of this document is to provide a narrative of the iterations and decisions made during the UX redesign. 

It is preceded by [Beginning September/October 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/initiatives/2019-2020-UX-redesign/ux-redesign-narrative-sept-2019.md)

## v1: November 2019

### Background
- The team spent two Discovery sprints understanding users and the data to inform the redesign. 
- User research conducted during these sprints made it clear that the presentation of search results in both the list and map was confusing to users and that Veterans search by a specific service and by distance when choosing a location to visit. 
- The following images are from the first wireframe:

- These wireframes were discussed as a team. 
- Based on DEPO and OCC input, urgent care search improvements became the priority. 
- The issues remaining with non-urgent care community care are related to taxonomy and presentation at individual provider level rather than facility location level.
