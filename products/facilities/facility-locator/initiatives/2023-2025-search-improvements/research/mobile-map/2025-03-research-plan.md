# Research Plan for Facility locator mobile map

## Background

[Facility locator product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/product/facility-locator-product-outline.md)

The Sitewide team has updated the appearance and usability of the map feature on the [facility locator tool](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/) on mobile devices. The new map introduces several changes to the user interface of the map and results list.

Because the facility locator is an unauthenticated experience that Veterans and their families use as a source of truth for where they can access VA health care, services, and benefits, the team wants to perform usability testing to ensure the new mobile map experience improves user satisfaction and is accessible for users of assistive technology.


### OCTO Priorities
This research supports objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
The Facility locator tool assists Veterans at every step of their journey, from Starting up to Aging and Dying.

## Research Goals	

### The goals of this research are to:
* Get user feedback on design and accessibility enhancements to the facility locator map feature on mobile
* Ensure the new map experience is accessible
* Testing the segmented button group component as a new design pattern for VA.gov

### Outcome
At the conclusion of this research, the team will have a better understanding of how Veterans and their families use the facility locator map on mobile. The team will also bring the segmented button group component into the primary VA Design System.

### Research Questions
Key research questions include:

* What experience do Veterans and others expect from the location mapping tool on mobile?
* Do Veterans and others understand the distinction between map and list view on mobile, and how to switch between the two?
* Do Veterans and others understand how to interact with the map view on mobile?
* How do users of assistive technology on mobile devices interact with the facility locator?

### Hypotheses
Veterans and others will understand:
* How the list of results are organized and what options they have to refine or broaden their results
* The relationship between search results and indicators on a map
* The difference between map view and list view, and how to move from one to the other
* Which fields are required or optional for conducting a search
* How to get the information they need about a selected location

## Methodology	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability testing** to observe research participants using a coded protoype on mobile devices. 
- All users must be on **mobile devices**
- Half of participants should be **screen reader users**
- Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like Zoom transcripts

### Research materials
Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.
