## Intro 
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Moderator's name].

I have a teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information.

(For sessions with a participant using a screen reader:) [Usability Specialist NAME] is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of a screen reader during this session.

Before we continue, I'd like to tell you a little more about who I am and what we’re doing...

I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure our resources meet their needs.

For this feedback session, we're here because VA has updated the facility locator tool on VA.gov. Your input could help us make this tool easier to use by Veterans like you. You'll try it out while thinking about a hypothetical situation, not your own experiences.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes *(or up to 75 minutes for an AT user)*. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing you. We're testing these resources to learn how we can make them better for all Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. If at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, let me know and we'll move on to the next question.
* You'll be interacting with a prototype. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You can take a break from the session or end it altogether. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
* I would like to get your preference on how many people are on this call. We can conduct a private session between the folks on this call right now, or we can invite one of my teammates to join us. They find it helpful to be able to watch these sessions to learn more about how Veterans use VA.gov, but we can also just share our notes with them after this session ends. Both are perfectly OK. What matters most to us is what’s most comfortable for you.
    Would you prefer a private session between us, or are you comfortable with another team member joining the call?
    * *If not*: Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable? *(If not comfortable, slack observer(s) in #feedback-backchannel to let them know that they won't be able to join.)*
    * *If yes*: Thank you! I will now invite them in. *(Let observer(s) into the meeting with their camera off.)*
* I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We respect your need for confidentiality--we won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    * *If yes*: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording to the cloud.*

* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your device, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click **More...**)* or Share Screen *(on computer, button is green).*
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says **Share**. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the (red) "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and there should be more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## Protocol for Recognizing & Handling Trauma-Triggering
*Remember*: Getting to all the questions on your script isn’t as important as the Veteran feeling heard. Prioritize the participant over the research.
### OBSERVE the participant
*Be PRESENT with the participant. Notice their body language, tone of voice, and the environment* 

*SENSE discomfort, anxiety, nervousness, anger, teary/crying, shakiness, nervousness. Some signs may include:*
- *Prolonged silences*
- *Shifts in tone or attitude or interactivity*
- *New background noises*
- *Staring into space* 

### If notice a change, SAY one of these:
  - Sometimes talking about these types of experiences can be difficult. Do you think you would be comfortable telling me if it starts to affect you negatively?
  - This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?
  - Would you like me to stop recording?
  - I sense that this may be upsetting. We value what you’re sharing with us, but we don’t have to go there if you don't want to.
  - Do you want to just sit here quietly for a few minutes?
  - Would you like to pause, or are you OK with continuing?
  - Is this not a good time for this session?

### If resume after a break
I'm interested to hear more about...Are you up for continuing with that, or would you prefer to move on to the next topic?

### Handling other specific situations
- *If p isn't feeling well in the moment*
  - I'm sorry to hear that you're (not feeling well--repeat their words). Do you feel up for continuing? You will be compensated even if we stop early. 
    - *(If they want to keep going)* Please let me know if you change your mind.
- *If p describes something that seems unfair*
  - I hear you saying that this is unfair. It sounds incredibly frustrating. I'm sorry to hear that you've been going through this.
- *If MST (military sexual trauma) comes up*
  - I am so sorry that happened to you. I hear you, and I'm grateful you felt safe sharing this with me.

### If you notice something and want to make sure they know how to get mental health help
I want to remind you that VA can help connect you to mental health services--even if you're not enrolled in VA health care. To access services right away, call or go to any VA medical center at any time 24/7 or any Vet Center during clinic hours. You can also call 877-222-8387, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. That's 877-222-8387.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you're worried about their situation...
I realize I'm worried for you being in this situation. I don't have concrete help I can offer, but I do have a hotline number. Before we continue, would you like me to give you the number?
- If you need to talk to someone right away, you can contact the Veterans Crisis Line via phone, text, or chat anytime day or night. You can call 988 or text 838255. It's confidential and available 24 by 7.
- You could also call the Benefits Hotline at 800-827-1000.

### If I feel teary or emotional
*Turn off my camera and/or say,* I need to step away for a moment.

### When participant is fine to continue, but you're not sure you can
I hear that you're good to continue. Before we do, I realize that I need a minute--I'm going to go off video, mute myself, and get a glass of water. Is that OK with you? I'll be back in X minutes.

*(If I'm still not OK to continue)* After taking a breather, I realize I'm not able to continue. You didn't do anything wrong, and you will get paid for the full time. I appreciate your time and your willingness to share your experience.

### When a participant decides to stop the session
I don't know if you'd want to call, but the Veterans Crisis Line number is 988. It's confidential and available 24 by 7.

Thank you for your time in having this call. I honor your decision to stop and wish you well. *[Try to maintain a CALM tone]*
