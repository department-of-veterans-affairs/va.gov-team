This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

**Finding #1: Veterans and their families have extremely high trust in the information provided from the facility locator.**
-All participants noted very high confidence and expectation of accuracy of what services are provided at any returned locations. 
-Many expressed delight at seeing the full list of services & facility types provided by the VA
- Several expressed that they preferred this way of searching for facilities over Google or another search engine for accuracy reasons.

> “I’m going to look at it like this. If they have it on there…they better have them glasses. I’m going to trust that if they put it on here [they have them] because [if not] that would be more frustrating for me as a Veteran.” -S4

**Finding #2: Specific benefits Veterans see of using the facility locator is reduced phone calls and increased confidence that they will be able to receive specific services at a location, regardless of where they are (traveling, moving to a new location).**
- Many described the current state of needing to call to find out where they can or should go for services, and believed this could reduce at least one phone call.
- Several were glad to see more options than expected for services near them or near to a place they frequently traveled.

>”I think it would be helpful, because it would keep someone from making a pointless phone call”. -S6
>
> (At the start of interview S3) “We asked at the VA. The last time we went to California we were going to Anaheim and they gave us a VA location that was like 50 miles from where we were going….for continued care or places we could pick up medication if we needed it but they didn’t tell us there were clinics nearby we could have used.”...(At the end of interview)“I would look for these facilities [using this tool] before I even left the doctors office.” S3

**Finding #3: Participants did not realize that they could both type AND view a list of dropdown service types. Instead, most navigated the list of service types using one method or the other rather than combined, and did not notice the other option until prompted.**

- Only 1 participant read the helper text without prompting
- Most participants noticed the dropdown option first and began scrolling through to find their options
- Few participants realized they could type to search, most required prompting to type.
- Participants noted that the list was mostly expected items though some wording was confusing.


**Finding #4: Participants rated the facility locator search as easy to use for most scenarios. However, some common scenarios did not work as expected.**
- Average SEQ for real world scenarios provided by participants was 5.7 (out of 7).
- For standardized scenarios designed to explore progressive disclosure and autosuggest, SEQ averaged 7 out of 7 (Cemetery search), 6.3 out of 7 (Medical Center), 6.4 out of 7 (Glasses).
- Some users gave a high ease-of-use rating despite not succeeding at the task, but believed they had .
- Autosuggest worked for most searches, however there was unexpected behavior on common searches particularly around “Dentist”, “Glasses”, and common issues like “back pain” which did not return results and users had to try another search or default to all. See Appendix for all searches. 


**Finding #5: Facility locator does not always accurately or noticeably show system status (e.g. what is being selected/searched), leading Veterans and their families to believe that there may be more or fewer services available near them than is actually the case**
- Some users believed they could search any word and that the list reflected that word when it had actually defaulted to “All VA health locations” and therefore showing more locations than there would be for that service (e.g. going to a small clinic for a search for “Dental”) and would give that task a 7/7 ease of use score though the results were not accurate to their goal.
- Some users searched by state or moved their location on the map and believed there were no facilities available (when it was really a map radius issue).
- Pressing enter does not actually search but selects an item, but does update the results description (unexpected and inaccurate system status)


**Finding #6: When using keyboard navigation or some mobile devices, the dropdown options are hidden or difficult to accurately select & search.**
- On a mobile device, the keyboard covers the autosuggest dropdown but not the facility locator dropdown (system select).
- Pressing enter on keyboard does select an item from this list. It does not execute search, but does update the results description so that it appears to have executed search without actually updating results. 

**Finding #7: Progressive Disclosure did not surprise or disrupt users.**
- On mobile and desktop most users appreciated that progressive disclosure of service type field was not required but enabled them to be specific in what they would find.
