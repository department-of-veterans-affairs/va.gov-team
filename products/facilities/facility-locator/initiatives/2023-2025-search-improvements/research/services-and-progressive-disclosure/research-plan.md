**Please note that this plan is in draft form. Additional details (such as scheduling, participant roles, etc.) must be added before submitting to Perigean for kickoff.**

The Sitewide team is updating the appearance and usability of the service type field on the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) [facility locator tool](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/). The new experience includes two new features:

1.  Progressive disclosure: Where the Service type field only displays when a linked Facility type is selected, e.g. Urgent care;
    
2.  Autosuggest: Where users who select a VA Health Facility can use the Service type field to begin to type a service and receive a list of suggested queries, e.g. Allergy & Immunology.
    

Because the facility locator is an unauthenticated experience that Veterans and their families use as a source of truth for where they can access VA health care, services, and benefits, the team wants to perform usability testing to ensure the new service type field experience improves user satisfaction.

### OCTO Priorities

This research supports objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey

The Facility locator tool assists Veterans at every step of their journey, from Starting up to Aging and Dying.

Research Goals
--------------

### The goals of this research are to:

*   Ensure autosuggest works as intended for all users, especially users of assistive technology
    
*   Get user feedback on the progressive disclosure function
    
*   Ensure users are able to create a search that aligns with what they want to find
    

### Outcome

At the conclusion of this research, the team will have a better understanding of how Veterans interact with the facility locator tool. We will also better understand the mental models of users who need to search for specific services near them.

### Research Questions

#### Key research questions include:

*   Do users understand why the service type field is conditionally revealed?
    
*   Do users understand how to use the autosuggest feature?
    
*   Are users satisfied with the service types that populate when typing in the autosuggest field?
    
*   Some specific interactions with autosuggest to test:
    
    *   Type partial string → make selection → search → decide you want to search for a different service (see #[20684](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/20684#issuecomment-2731234967))
        
    *   Services don't start displaying until at least 2 characters are typed
        
    *   Sorting order of services after typing a generic string "cancer" or "diabetes"
        
    *   The fact that 90 services display in scrollable dropdown before typing see (#[3742](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/3742#issuecomment-2625153554))
        
    *   Width of input fields when magnified (see #[101887](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/101887))
        

### Hypotheses

#### Veterans and others will understand:

*   Why the service type field is revealed or hidden
    
*   Why some service types include a drop-down list and other include a required type-in
    
*   How to find a desired service or specialty by typing in a service type and selecting a suggestion from the list
    
    *   How to search for VA Health Facilities if no matching services are suggested
        
*   Why VA Health Facilities do not include suggestions for non-VA health services in the type-in list
    

Methodology
-----------

We will conduct **remote moderated usability testing** to observe research participants using a coded prototype on desktop and mobile devices.

*   We want to recruit an equal number of **mobile device** users and **desktop computer** users
    
*   Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like Zoom transcripts
    

### Location

Remote, via Zoom

Recruitment
-----------

We will recruit 20 participants: 10 on desktop, and 10 on mobile.

4 participants (2 on desktop, 2 on mobile) will be AT users.
