# Research Plan for Facilities, Progressive Disclosure and Autosuggest, September 2025

## **Background**

The Sitewide team is updating the appearance and usability of the service type field on the [VA.gov facility locator tool](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/). The new experience includes two new features:

1. **Progressive disclosure:** Where the Service type field only displays when a linked Facility type is selected, e.g. Urgent care;  
2. **Autosuggest:** Where users who select a VA Health Facility can use the Service type field to begin to type a service and receive a list of suggested queries, e.g. Allergy & Immunology.

The facility locator is an unauthenticated experience that Veterans and their families use as a source of truth to discover where they can access VA health care, services, and benefits. The team wants to perform usability testing to ensure the new service type field experience improves user satisfaction.

* Link to card in research repo (TBD)

## **OCTO Priorities**

This research aligns with the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md):

* VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

* Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)  
* Starting up (Finding something to do, Attending to health needs)  
* Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)  
* Reinventing myself (Finding the right job, Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials)  
* Putting down roots (Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)  
* Retiring (Taking care of my health, Finding additional sources of income, Participating in meaningful activities)  
* Aging (Managing my declining health, Planning for long term care)  
* Dying (Scheduling and planning a funeral service)

## **Research Goals**

* Veterans and their families can successfully find their desired search results using the autosuggest feature.   
* Assistive technology users can successfully use the autosuggest feature to find what they’re looking for.   
* Veterans and their families can successfully perform different facility searches using the progressive disclosure function. 

### Outcome

Learning will provide better understanding of how Veterans interact with the facility locator tool and its autosuggest and progressive disclosure features. We will also better understand the mental models of users who need to search for specific services near them.

### Research Questions

1. Do Veterans and their families understand how to use the autosuggest feature?  
2. Do Veterans and their families understand the service types that populate when typing in the autosuggest field?  
3. Do Veterans and their families understand that the service type field narrows their search results?  
4. Do Veterans and their families understand why the service type field is conditionally revealed?

### Hypotheses

* The service type field is intuitive, allowing Veterans and their families to find desired services by navigating a drop-down or using the autosuggest feature.    
* Assistive technology users are able to use the autosuggest feature with no issues.   
* Veterans and their families will understand progressive disclosure functionality and why the service type field shows with some facility types and not others.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct remote moderated usability testing to observe research participants using a coded prototype on desktop and mobile devices. This will allow us to use the autosuggest feature. 

### Location

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like Zoom transcripts.

### Research materials (TBD)

* Link to conversation guide  
* Link to prototype  
* Link to Research Notetaking Mural

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

### Prepare

Before recruitment starts, we would like to request a kickoff call with Perigean to align on recruitment criteria and terminology for screener questions in the survey and emails that will be sent to Veterans. We would also like to discuss the relative priorities of recruitment criteria and how the criteria are prioritized when recruiting replacements for participants who cancel in advance.

[Researcher] is available for a kickoff call during any of these times:

* TBD  
* TBD  
* TBD

Please invite [Researcher] (insert email here) and Dave (dave.pickett@civicactions.com)) to the kickoff call.
