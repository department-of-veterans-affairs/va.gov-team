# Facility Locator Launches README

The purpose of this document is to document the Facility Locator launch timeline and artifacts

## Urgent Care MVP
### Summary
- **Problem:** Eligible Veterans did not know how or where to access their new urgent care benefits in the community and were directed away from  VA.gov for information. 
- **Approach:** 
  - 1. Support Veterans searches within the Facility Locator with increased visibility for community urgent care as a search option
  - 2. Make the benefit call to action more prominent
  - 3. Improved sitewide usability and accessibility 
- **Quantitative Results:** 
  - 1. Deprecation of external link
  - 2. Improved user satisfaction ratings
  - 3. Resolution of legacy usability and accessibility defects
- **Recommendations:**
  - Improve search performance and continue to iterate on the search experience by incorporating Veteran feedback
