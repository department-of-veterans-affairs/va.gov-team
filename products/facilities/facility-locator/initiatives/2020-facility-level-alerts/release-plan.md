# Release Plan: Display of Facility-level alerts
---

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)
- Not planned at this time due to urgent need to release this enhancement to support COVID-19 

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing
- Not planned at this time due to urgent need to release this enhancement to support COVID-19 

### Planning:
- Between March 1, 2020 and March 30, 2020, 51.5% of the 338,004 users were unique. The availability of  operating status is not expected to increase our average user traffic. 
- This will be immediately available to all Facility Locator users as part of the unauthenicated experience. 
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers)
   - Ideally, Facility Locator would link directly to a page displaying the facility-level operating status so that we could track that traffic. However, not all VA facilities have a website. Facilities which do display the information do not organize it in a consistent predictable way that can be logically linked. 
   - The Pittsburgh VAMC health care system **does** have specific pages for this purpose and will be used as a proxy, measuring click through rate beginning with the COVID-19 alert banner through to the facility-level operating status information. 
   - Additionally, Veterans will be directed to the webpages from facility detail pages viewed in Facility Locator. This traffic can also be measured.  
- KPI: Number of calls to contact center about facility status  
  - March 2020 = 235 calls

## Go Live!

### Planning:
- Desired date: 04/20/20
- Go Live date: 4/22/20
- Post-launch KPI 1: Click through rate beginning with COVID-19 alert banner through to the facility-level operating status information
- Post-launch KPI 2: Number of calls to contact center about facility status  
  - March 2020 = 235 calls
- [Go / No Go: (ready / not ready)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/initiatives/2020-facility-level-alerts/go-no-go.md)

### 1-month results:
- Post-launch KPI 1: Click through rate beginning with COVID-19 alert banner through to the facility-level operating status information
  - These analytics are now in place. Measurements are not yet available. 
- Post-launch KPI 2: Number of calls to contact center about facility status  
  - April= 240 calls 
  - May = ~120 calls 
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes
  - As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, so has our understanding of how availability to facilities and services has been and will continue to be impacted. 
  - Internment language was added for NCA locations. 
  - Veteran usability was conducted the weeks of June 8 and 15 to validate Veteran understanding of the current statuses and determine the need to add additional categories or make language changes. In particular, we are interested in finding the best way to represent the availability of telehealth/virtual services. A research readout is pending once the sessions are complete. 

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
   - Early metrics from the Call center is encouraging with May's volume at half the number of calls made in April and May.  
2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
   - There is inconsistency in how VHA facilities are using the available statuses, particularly for virtual health. We are conducting Veteran feedback sessions now to learn more about their expectations and understanding. 
   - Although operating status was initiated to support facility information during COVID-19, it has already been utilizied to inform Veterans about facility and service status during two natural disasters and periods of civil unrest. 
3. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
   - Pending research readout
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
   - Categories and labels may evolve. 
   - We may need to add information for duration (how long will the facility be closed/services affected?) and may need to display planned/future events for Veterans planning visits in the future. There may also be an opportunity to "push" the information to Veterans by collaborating with other teams.
