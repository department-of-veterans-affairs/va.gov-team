# Release Plan Template

So! You're thinking about how you want to launch your product. You know you'll perform usability testing and you'll QA the heck out of it in staging, which are both very critical components of product development. But they don't tell you how people will naturally use your product when you're not there to guide them to it, how any submitted data will get to VA, whether that data will be easy or difficult for VA to process, whether people will be likely to submit duplicates, abandon partway through, or encounter bugs unique to the production environment. All of which could be very detrimental to users, which is the antithesis of what we're here to do. 

So: **how might we craft a release plan to test our product "in the wild" at a smaller scale, and learn how it'll actually be used, and what problems it actually might have or create, and then fix/adjust prior to going live to millions of VA.gov users?**

That's what this Release Plan Template is for! And note - there are feature flags and beta banners at your disposal that you can use as a part of your plan.

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: [date - date] or [duration]
- Desired number of users: x
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: lorem ipsum
- How you'll conduct the testing: lorem ipsum
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: lorem ipsum

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning:
- Desired date range: mm/dd/yy - mm/dd/yy
- Desired number of unique users: x
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: lorem ipsum
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): [use your KPIs to help guide this. It could be things like abondomnent rate < 20%, reported call center calls < 2 calls, error rate < 5%, etc.]

### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

More phases? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above.
