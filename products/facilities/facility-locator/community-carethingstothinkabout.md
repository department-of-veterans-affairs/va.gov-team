## Things To Think About:
  - Jack Bates 
      - Our Docs/ Customer Satisfaction
      - No user testing yet on this if we are implementing it
      - Sun setting old stuff
  - Primary Care and Mental Health Services
      - Do we launch with these two services?
      - Can we get the data of these two services better than 85% by launch?
      - Are we better off not doing services at launch but listing on details page?
      - Do we include more services but stay at 85% accuracy? 
  - What do we display so users understand not all the services are listed, and what do we want them to do to find out what is available? possible task: have someone try and find dental care.
  - What threshold of facilities needs to be accurate to turn filtering on for that particular service?
  - If we only had two services that were 95-100% accurate, is there a way to let the user filter by just those two without giving the impression they are the only services we have.
