# Facility Locator 2.0

All about the 2019-2020 roadmap to make the next version of the product even better for users.

## Product goals
- Switch primary data source from Vets API to Facility API: <https://developer.va.gov/explore/facilities/docs/facilities>
- Reach parity with all legacy VA facility locator tools, so they can be depracated
  - Main legacy facility locator: https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp
  - Will need to  meet users' needs, but also convince the business to turn off old tools
- Integrate urgent care facility and urgent care pharmacy facilities into the product
  - Here is VA's current product: <https://vaurgentcarelocator.triwest.com/>
- Incorporate Mission Act-required facility drive time functionality
- Update the product's information architecture to organize facilities based on users' mental models (e.g., mental health care vs. Vet Center)
- Update the product's UI and interaction design so users can get to facility results in just a few clicks/taps
- Update facility detail page to match new VAMC facility page design
  - Here is a health facility detail page design: <https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/pittsburgh-va-medical-center-university-drive/>
- Surface basic Veteran-benefit eligibility information for each facility type (e.g., health care facility, community care provider, etc.)
- Use the VHA health service taxonomy for health facilities
- Create/update new VBA service taxonomy and NCA service taxonomy, with new structured content designed, and powered by Drupal
- Make it faster
- Fix bugs

## Design problems
- Users don't have a way to get to urgent care facilities
  - See the following research study documentation:
    1. Main research repo: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Health%20care/UrgentCare/Research/June-2019/findings.md>
    2. Research readout: <https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Health%20care/UrgentCare/Research/June-2019/DSVA-UrgentCareUsabilityStudy-KevinMHoffman-V001.pdf>
    3. User flows Mural board: <https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1560946920965/4bb321f266f232e3e1d91559b168a0f3c11fe84f>
- Search UI is inconsistent (i.e., free text search box, dropdowns, typeahead)
- Community care "facilities" are actually providers, so users are searching for persons, not places
- Facility API data often do not load or show up on facility detail pages
- Web browser's location/geo-location functionality doesn't always work (or work well) on facility search page

## What to research
- Pain points and bright spots with the current product (i.e., evaluative usability testing)
- Users' mental models for VA facilities and services, including community care
  - Specifically, how users think about in-network emergency care, urgency care, and urgent care pharmacy facilities
- How to integrate services and facilities into the UX (i.e., search by condition or service needed vs. facility type)
- How/if we should integrate content editing/publishing of some facility detail page content using the Drupal CMS
  - Images! Should we use Drupal to manage facility images for each facility detail page?
- Creating facility detail page URLs and content that are SEO (i.e., /wilmington-vet-center vs. /vba456)
- How to include drive-time functionality into UX
- How to make the product work faster for users
- How to better architect how we call data from the community care database
- All the data sources! How can be better streamline our data sources, and structured product content on the UI, so users get a consistent product experience
