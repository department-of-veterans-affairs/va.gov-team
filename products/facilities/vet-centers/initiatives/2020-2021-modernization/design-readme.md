## MVP design (final for 2021 launch) 
- Designer: Leyda Hughes
- [Final MVP design](https://preview.uxpin.com/0a5eaacdf411fde0cb3abf4932010c29fbccb7de#/pages/138920563) - UXPin mobile prototype of Main and Locations pages. If prototype link ceases to work, the following is a link to the [original UXPin file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/design/2020-2021/Vet-Center-Product.uxp). The accordions in this prototype are accurate for content (at the time of launch) but do not behave as intended as they do not move the content below it.
- [Prototype used in user testing](https://preview.uxpin.com/0a5eaacdf411fde0cb3abf4932010c29fbccb7de#/pages/136042529) - includes working accordions and interactions.

### Component Notes:
- **Operating status** - This project required making an update to the standard alert in the design system to accommodate a mobile friendly operating status that could give inline information since they would not be able to link to other pages for more information. 
    - See the [Expandable Alert](https://design.va.gov/experimental-design/expandable-alert) in the experimental design section of the design system. 
    - See the [expandable alert with design specs](https://preview.uxpin.com/0a5eaacdf411fde0cb3abf4932010c29fbccb7de#/pages/138515145) for background.
- **Featured Content / Spotlight / blue box** - A unique version of the featured content component was created for this project. It is not in the experimental design system yet but should be in the future as the facilities learns from Vet Center editors what guardrails need to be put in place for an update to the official component to be proposed.  
    - See the [Featured Content](https://design.va.gov/components/featured-content) component in the design system. 
    - See the [custom featured content component with design specs](https://preview.uxpin.com/0a5eaacdf411fde0cb3abf4932010c29fbccb7de#/pages/137069227) used on Vet Centers pages.
    - See Kevin Walsh'es [audit of other permutations](https://www.notion.so/leyda/Work-Wiki-13ce566fc06449a185ede8a52d32f9e1#65fb7adc45354e37bb3c045953eb45d6) of this component.

## Iteration 6 - Sprint 36 (ending Dec 15, 2020)
#### Designs
2 options reflecting Mikki's input on IA structure

1. An option where each child location of a parent Vet Center gets it's own page

#### Feedback & Outcomes

Dec 2 - Met with Mikki, Dave, and Michelle to align on IA for Vet Centers. Feedback:

   • Remove side nav
  
   • child locations will not have dedicated pages for MVP
  
   • Keep "All locations" page. Child locations to live here only
  
   • remove link/reference to Facility Location on VC page, keep in All locations page
  
   • Remove categorizations from list of services, list alphabetically
  
   • Bring back "Featured story" components and mock up with localized content

## Iteration 5 - Sprint 35 (ending Dec 1, 2020)
#### Designs
Goal: refining the IA and relationship between Vet Center parent/child locations

   [Link to wireframe](https://preview.uxpin.com/7a8826eb89e70957ccbe33ea1380346a5128d86d#/pages/134613009/simulate/no-panels)

#### Feedback & Outcomes
1. Mon, Nov 23 - Dave has Leyda stop working on CLP. He will decide with other business leaders if CLP is the right approach. Vet Center detail pages should now only contain logistical information specific to each location to mirror VAMCs. 

2. Leyda OOO 11/25-27 (Thanksgiving)

3. Nov 30 - Start new research plan and conversation guide to test usability of logistical information and services with non-client Veterans, table "Client usability test for a later date to validate positioning study" since we are not designing any "About VC" content at this time.

4. Dec 1 - Met with Mikki to discuss how we might treat the relationships between the different locations. Gave Leyda feedback on nav, breadcrumb and overall IA.
Suggests:
 
   • removing "Main area location" and "Satellite offices" categories from side nav. 

   • removing links to "About" and "Facility locator" from side nav and work them into the page content stream 


## Iteration 4 - Sprint 34 (ending Nov 17, 2020)

#### Designs
Goal: Align on what we want to test with Veterans; refine research plan and prototype to match

   [Link to wireframe](https://preview.uxpin.com/7a8826eb89e70957ccbe33ea1380346a5128d86d#/pages/134613014/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)

#### Feedback & Outcomes
1. Tues, Nov 17 - Dave, Michelle & Leyda sync on designs and prepare for "Usability Testing Prep" the following day. The plan is to test the high level Vet Center concepts and positioning to validate what we heard in the research from Vet Center clients, now presented in a website prototype.

     •  Dave's feedback is to strip the yellow "Featured content" boxes and to pull back on any "About" content, thinks this type of content belongs on a "Content Landing Page". 

2. Wed, Nov 18 - Dave, Michelle, Leyda and Ryan meet for Ryan to give the team a walk-thru of the CPL 

     • Dave's feedback is to create a ticket to explore C.L.P.. 

     • Michelle creates a ticket for Leyda to do CLP exploration

     • Leyda starts starts working on a design with "About" content within the CLP template and while also refining detail page 
     
     • Dave OOO 11/19-20



## Iteration 3 - Sprint 34 (ending Nov 17, 2020)

#### Designs

#### Feedback & Outcomes
1. Dave, Michelle & Leyda sync on designs. Dave is concerned that the prototype does not adequately address catchment area/nearby locations, informs designer that it is now part of MVP.
2. Nov 12 - Leyda meets with Ryan for input on addressing locations feature/content and continues refining prototype

## Iteration 2 - Sprint 34 (ending Nov 17, 2020)

#### Designs
Vet Center prototype with an emphasis on incorporating concepts that were important to Veterans from research findings and testing out new service taxons and language

[Link to wireframe](https://preview.uxpin.com/73434f75b1664fb29a9340c025cf2bebd7e8e24b#/pages/133987808)

#### Feedback & Outcomes
1. Nov 4 - Dave, Michelle, Leyda sync - direction from Dave is to take an MVP approach to a new design for Vet Centers website template. 
2. Leyda's design decisions:
    • shifts from the original idea of using "Campaign Landing Page" template to using the VAMC layout
    • Applies feedback from Design Intent meeting to try "Featured story" component to convey the non-clinical concepts that were important to Vet Center clients as describes in research findings and incorporates "On this page" component.  
3. Nov 5, 2020 - Met with Dave, Ryan, Michelle to discuss the prototype and next iteration of the Vet Center prototype with the focus on solving the problem of awareness. Feedback:
    • Push the "warm" concept further by trying the featured story components in yellow instead of blue. Combine quotes and concepts of 'by Vets for Vets' etc. into less rows of "Featured story" components.
    • Add operating status
    • Remove sidenav
    • Remove 'events' > not doing for MVP

### Feedback & Outcomes

#### Design Intent Collaboration Meeting:
Meeting date: 09/18/2020  
Attendees: Leyda Hughes, Dave Conlon, Michelle Middaugh, Meg Peters, Ryan Thurlwell, Emily Waggoner, Jennifer Strickland, Trevor Pierce, Mikki Northuis, Peggy Gannon, Tze Lei 

Outcomes: Recommendations from team
- General: 
    - Consider: Do qualitative research with Veterans before testing design ideas
    - Consider: Communicate tone via language (not just imagery)
- IA: 
    - Consider: if subpages, how that affects breadcrumbs, etc
- Content:
    - Consider: Min required vs max content
    - Consider: Nat'l vs local areas (provide tight parameters for Drupal)
- Design: [#20140](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/20140)
    - Should: Flesh out mobile designs (how do horizontal rows of compnenents fare)
    - Consider: right aligning images instead of left aligning to avoid any awkward alignments
    - Consider: “featured story” for the horizontal groups of 3 across the page
    - Consider: 'On this page' component OR left nav from VAMC 
    - Consider: Photo descriptions for non-sighted
- Accessibility: [#13728](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/13729#issuecomment-696659540)
    - Must: Flesh out mobile designs to clarify hierarchy 
    - Should: Consider load times with imagery, load progressively (e.g. cellular connectivity)
    - Should: Establish performance budget
    - Consider: Accordions - Caution with burying rich keywords (load times, seo, screenreaders), try tables, columns
    - Consider: Events - add an ics to add to calendar or easily share
    - Consider: Use microdata and/or json-ld to improve SEO, smart google results (address, hours, maps) 
    - Consider: 'On this page' component 
    - Consider: Explore visual transitional cues (e.g. background color change from section to section)
