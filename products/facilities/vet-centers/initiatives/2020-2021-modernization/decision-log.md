## Vet Center Decision Log 

### Vet Center MVP decisions

The following were considered but rejected for MVP

| Content area | Rationale |
| ------- | -------- |
| Staff Profiles | Level of effort to maintain locally, challenge presented by inaccurate profiles |
| Events | Not all events are open to all clients or to new/potential clients |
| Social Media | Historically has not been allowed |
| Stories | Level of effort to maintain locally |
| Spanish translation | Will need to consider for full roll-out |
| Tagline | Potential for abuse with "branding", has been removed across VA.gov, needs input from Design Council | 
| Facility operating status for CAP | not in VAST, challenges with maintaining, need to determine how to display and communicate to Veterans |

### Vet Center taxonomy and language decisions

| Date | Decision |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1/6/2021 | We do not want to restrict list of services (ie: Psychology) available for use by Vet Centers but will want to encourage use of default list (TBD) |
| 1/6/2021 | Group counseling will be handled as a modality rather than a service taxon of its own |
| 1/6/2021 | De-emphasize "transitioning" as this alientates Veterans who aren't recently separated yet still access services |
| 1/6/2021 | Need segmentation of services for scannability | 
| 1/6/2021 | Mobile Vet Center as "other location" rather than service (was misunderstood in testing) |
| 1/6/2021 | No email will be featured as there is no centralized email |
| 1/6/2021 | "Satellite" tested well as label rather than CAP |
| 1/26/2021 | Grief counseling and bereavement counseling will be two separate categories. Bereavement counseling is offered to family members who experience an active duty death only. Grief counseling is offered to any eligible client who is experiencing grief (of any type : death of a loved one, natural disaster, etc)_Update: based on Veteran research in 2/21, the difference between these is more business rationale than experienced by Veterans and we will propose collapsing these services into one and prioritize what a Veteran or family member wants and needs to know when experiencing these situations_ |
| 1/26/2021 | Vet Center services will include services provided by community partners, if they are offered within the physical location | 
| 2/18/2021 | Services will be alphabetized for MVP, despite research recommendation to Consider reordering services by priority, leading with Mental health. This could be a significant technical lift so it will be deferred until we have analytics on most frequently opened accordions and understand Drupal capabilities for determining order at facility type level (i.e. different sort orders for VHA vrs Vet Center |
| 2/18/2021 | Will propose Veteran Connections rather than VA connections so referral to federal,state/local services (outside the VA) can also be listed |
| 2/18/2022 | Will add home loan assistance and housing benefits bullet within VA/Veteran connections |
| | Vocational rehabilitation and employment programs to be used only if delivered by VBA representative on site - otherwise, use Veteran connections |
|| Recreational and creative arts therapy tpo be used only if delivered by qualified staff - otherwise, use Whole health |


### Other Vet Center product decisions

| Date | Decision |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1/6/2021 | After hours call center informs Vet Center (within 24 hours) of a Veteran's call and provides the Vet Center with the Veteran's contact info and supplies the Vet Center info to the Veteran. However, if the Veteran reaches the Call center during business hours, there is no warm handoff to the Vet Center. This understanding will influence our placement of Call Center phone numbers/CTA. |
| 1/6/2021 | We will seek ways to connect to Vet Center services within the accordions of VAMC health services but not to the VAMC from Vet Center page. This is to avoid additional confusion about the differences between a Vet Cente and a VAMC. |
| 1/6/2021 | Vet Center pages will use same alert style as VAMC but can be dismissable. No need to include in future prototypes for research |
| 1/6/2021 | We do not want to restrict list of services (ie: Psychology) available for use by Vet Centers but will want to encourage use of default list (TBD) |
| 2/17/2021 | We will use Escanaba as the coded content prototype because it seems to have the great diversity of locations. This means the content will be entered by the Facilities/CMS teams (rather than by Escanaba staff) so we can use it to test the model. We will use the service content collected by Michelle during interviews with Outreach specialists |
| 2/18/2020 | Need to add "back to top" feature to  help users traverse the length of pages more easily.  _Update: a new implementation exists in the design system and can be reused for Vet Centers)_|
| 2/18/2021 | Will add "Appointments" accordion to the 'Prepare for your visit" section to provide another opportunity for Vet Centers to differentiate themselves from VA medical centers and to set realistic expectations for being seen |
| 2/18/2021 | Will not add map plotted with all are location at this time until we validate need |
| 4/15/2021 | Will use expandable alert design to show operating status details for locations since there is no comprehensive status page or link to detail page |
