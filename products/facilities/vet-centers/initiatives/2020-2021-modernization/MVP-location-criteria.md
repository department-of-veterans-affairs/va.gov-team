The goal of the vet center MVP is to establish websites for up to 10 locations
In our meeting on 11.23.2020 with the Vet Center team we discussed the following criteria for consideration in MVP locations for Vet Centers

* Geographic distribution
* Vet Center with outstation(s) and CAP(s)
* Vet Center with low service volume but high numbers of Veteran residents in the area
* Vet Center with limited relationship with nearby VAMC
* Vet Center close proximity to VAMC/Clinic
* Vet Center far away from VAMC/Clinic
* Vet Center with limited relationship with nearby military installation
* Vet Center with another Vet Center in close proximity (area with location options/small catchment area)
* Vet Center with Large catchment area
* Vet Center with no outstations of CAP(s) (unlikely but ask?)
