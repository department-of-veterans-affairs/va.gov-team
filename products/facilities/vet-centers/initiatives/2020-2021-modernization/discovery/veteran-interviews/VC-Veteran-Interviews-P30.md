**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I was in the Naval reserve during Vietnam and I guess as everyone back then I joined with the dream of not going to Vietnam. I requested nothing smaller than an aircraft carried being from \ CA I wanted to see the entire world and it being to big they would send it to Vietnam but I got a destroyer and three weeks later I was at Vietnam. 2 cruises in 3 years. I saw more than what I would have like to but yeah. I came home in one piece and got out. I spent 6 years drilling or going to meetings so I was a 2 by 6. I ended up staying in a total of 8 years until my wife got tired of me being gone for 2 weeks a year. I got out and now that I am older I regret it because I would be retired now. I ended up with a partial disability for tinnitus and Agent orange is up in te air. They keep denying it because they call me a blue water sailor and that is now coming back to haunt us. I guess I have to fight that to. I have only worked; I don&#39;t know if we are talking about Public vet centers or the VA services. I have used both one in plaster county where I live and the VA

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers?

  - When did you first learn about Vet Centers?
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center?
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center?
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way?

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer?

If yes:

- How do they differ or compare?

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them?
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend?
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities?
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them?

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time?
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center?

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? My home it is in Roseville, CA.

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? The one I went to was in plaster county office building, maybe that&#39;s why. Plus I must admit I really didn&#39;t like it; the guy was from the Airforce and not very helpful.
- Different location I should try: I don&#39;t have my wallet; it was the plaster county vet center at 1000 sunrise. Maybe it was community
- What services did they offer: They were in the county building so. I go to the McClellan for my health care. It is placer county veterans. Yes that&#39;s it.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center?
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings?
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience?

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change?

- What&#39;s most important for you to know?

Are you familiar with this website? Take a minute to look it over. I&#39;m happy to click around for you as well.

- What can you tell me about a Vet Center? Well like I said the one is placer; I wasn&#39;t to crazy about. I got to see the guy and again he wasn&#39;t to helpful because it was when I was trying to fight my claim. He wasn&#39;t to helpful and I got a bad vibe so I drove to Sacramento to the VA and they seemed more helpful. They helped me file the claim. I mean it still got denied but they seemed more helpful.
- Name of this place: Again that was the VA, I had a heck of a time finding the address. It was on old Placerville. I thought I had it but it seems like everything else is in here.
- What did you do at that location: I actually met with the guy that helped me file the claim and we followed up on it then filed an appeal.
- The guy that helped you was at one location and it was for disability: Yes and they are also the one that helped with my hearing claim. Which was approved.
- How did you find him: Actually I was recommended to someone in their office and she was no longer there so I was just talking with the gentlemen up front and he said I can help you with that so we got the information files. He asked if there were anything else and I said I have the thing from agent orange and that finally got through, he put me in touch with another advocate that was going back to Washington. He was retired and didn&#39;t really help and I heard nothing back from him.
- Who told you about her: That was at Mather Hospital, the VA hospital in the claims section. The release of information office. They suggested that I talk to the Vet center on old Placerville road. Then when I wanted to go back it was hard to find because they moved. They were listed on howe av but really on Placerville road.
- Do you use the internet to find the places recommended: I use to but not recently.
- How would you find a new address like this: I guess now it would be the internet. I no longer work so I have limited access besides mind which is old. My endeavors have been focused in other areas right now.
- What would be the easiest way: Frankly, I rely on my driving experience so if I have been there I know where it is without knowing the actually address.
- What made it hard to find the address: I didn&#39;t have the exact title so they had moved to howe ave but I guess I had the wrong name of the office. Before COVID they had to many offices.
- Anything that would have made it easier: No, other than I have to drive so far being in Placer county.
- How far: Its 15 miles but there&#39;s a lot of traffic. We really don&#39;t have freeways here; it is what they call a freeway but it is bumper to bumper going down to the state capital. It&#39;s alright, I try to do it all when I need to go to the medical center. Before COVID I was in a group at the VA center for quitting smoking until all of the problems with my wife and I intend to go back after COVID. I went once a week and learned about it through my doctor at the medical center.
- Same complex: Yes, but my doctor is up here at McClellan because it is closer. Most of my health care is there besides orthopedics so I really only go down there for the smoking cessation and neurology but now all of it is online.
- Can&#39;t access it online: Right.
- Neurology at the medical center: Yes
- How did you learn about that: I think I was finally referred by my primary care because I have nonessential tremors which is I guess more related to my age rather than my service. I thought it was Parkinson or the beginning to it but they said no and I guess that is a good thing but it is a prelude to agent orange.
- For the smoking groups, was it helpful: Yes, like I said I quit. I quit a couple of times but my doctor told me I quit 52 times last year. I quit the last time in February and I was doing okay until all of these problems started and I caved but I am sure I can get back on track now.
- What would you tell your friend if they could benefit: I would recommend it because they were very helpful even when I was having problems with my wife when it all first started they were very helpful in trying to keep me on the path before COVID. You know they gave me the encouragement I could get. The only thing that hurts is that all gentlemen that were in there and one lady when they quit, there were some we called old dogs, they have all gotten sick when they quit. Some have passed away so that&#39;s what bothers me. Most of them are living their lives so that is wonderful.

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me? No most of my issues is with the VA themselves not with the vet centers so I would like to get on a similar opinion thing about the VA. I keep trying these surveys. Getting appointments have been the hardest. I have a claim in for my audiology so that is the only one that is compensable and is the only one I should get regular service on and I can only get appointments 3 months out then they cancel them. I finally got an appointment for a month in advance and it&#39;s on statuary. I am sure part of it is due to COVID but it has been going on longer than COVID so frustrating.
