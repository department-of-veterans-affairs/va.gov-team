**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? Well I initially planned on joining but was talked out of it so I went to college and got a BA in science and got a job at the university and it was prior to 9/11. I jointed the army in 2003 and went through basic training and then did my training as a medic. Went home for a month for hometown recruiting then went to Germany for a month prior to going to Iraq and I was there for 8 months and I ran the aid station, sick call, to doing medevacs. I drive an ambulance 50% of the time going into the red zones into hostile territory. I have experienced medical care to dying individuals and have been under hostile fire and fired weapon under response and I have been on a convey where all 5 soldiers inside were lost and I came hone in August in 2004 to Germany where I had issues sleeping and I struggled with that for awhile then in November I was sexually assaulted by a male member of my unit and it was reported but was not processed because they could prove it and I fell apart and had issues feeling safe and was discharged in march 2005 due to my inability to continue with my unit.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? I am.
- How did you first learn about them? When I came home in 2005 I had adjustment issues and I found our local VA community outreach clinic wasn&#39;t great for me and I was referred to a group at the Rochester place. Then years later I returned to the vet center when I was working at the VA hospital, I didn&#39;t feel like it was safe getting treatment where I work and I have been seeing the counselor since may of 2017 and I do the women&#39;s group and marital counseling recently as well.
  - When did you first learn about Vet Centers?
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center?
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center?
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way?

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer? Individual and group, I have don&#39;t the linked therapy with other organizations there, yoga, social stuff to make it like the vet center family. There is a ton of different stuff they do.
- Equine therapy: My therapist was more directly involved and there&#39;s a local organization/farm where they have horses that were medically retired and they operate with a grant that specializes in helping veterans and work with quintessence which is more counseling. They are animals that are nonthreatening. They don&#39;t want anything from you and the animals learn to tune into who they are as you learn who you are. Horses by nature are a steady force no stunned movements and typically more afraid of you. Grounding exercises and boundary exercises where you learn to. I was skeptical at first but they are good listeners and sometimes you don&#39;t need to talk. It is good that no one is asking anything from me so I have a good time. As adults there&#39;s always someone asking me and I have three children and I am a nurse so I naturally take care of people and it feels like everyone is pulling from me. SO the horses is smoothing and I have had a lot of calm moments with horses even though I am a bit afraid of them so they help me check in with myself.
- Can you tell me a little about the services, activities, or resources you&#39;ve taken part of?
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time?
- If you had to rank the different things offered at a Vet Center in order of importance  **to you**  what would that look like? Number one would be confidentiality or privacy. I am a va employee and I tried to seek care at the va and felt like my privacy wasn&#39;t always respected. For me since I go to a vet center I don&#39;t feel like people are talking about me or judging me. I have seen patients of mine at the vet center but it isn&#39;t threatening because of the environment, it is very warm. The staff make a huge deal but I may be bias and they have a lot to offer. My therapist was when I got treatment at the VA years ago but she happened to be at the vet center when I needed someone and it felt just right to be back with her. Those are my big things. I am not really a group person because I don&#39;t really like people. If you suggest me going to a group I am skeptical and don&#39;t really want to do it but I have found the women&#39;s group to be surprising, wonderful and I can go and not feel judged or that it is to much. I can walk out and not feel like I need to sugar coat things. I am still a skeptic of group and not a big fan of it. Since my therapist forced me to go it is a pretty good thing even though I won&#39;t tell her that.
- What makes it warm: I think it&#39;s because it is smaller, you know the staff. At first it seems intimidating like they are talking about you but then realize they are all part of the same treatment team. When my counselor is unavailable I can call and always get a response I have never been told I have to wait until they are back. She has dealt with me for awhile and they are all equally excepting which is a huge thing. Crisis aren&#39;t always on a schedule and I have had situations where I have to go ask for help I am not disappointed because there is a warmth there. I have not met someone at the vet center that I&#39;m not comfortable to talk to I would not hesitate to call and ask them for the help. After time they don&#39;t have to ask me who I am so its not cold where last four. You see me every week you should know who I am.
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers?
  - Are there other ways you&#39;d like to be informed about them?
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that?
- Have you visited more than one Vet Center?

If yes:

- How do they differ or compare? There was a lot of time in between the others. I did individual counseling in 2005 but it didn&#39;t really fit anywhere, the privacy wasn&#39;t where it needed to be back then but then again I was in a difference place for my recovery but the buffalo is good and it is really nice and I like the counselor and environment there. It is warm instead of like the hospital.

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them? I encourage them to reach out and gave them a name. I am in a weird spot because I live in between two. I know people at both of them so I am like hey I would totally go and I do go. You can call them and talk and switch if you want. I have gone with others at their first appointments and I talk to people before I send them there so they haven&#39;t disappointment me yet. I explain how the barriers I had with getting care and not wanting to go to the va being I work there and I feel safe there which is huge because I don&#39;t feel safe many places and provided the 1800 number for them to talk
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend?
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities?
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them?

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time? You have the right to expect a certain amount of privacy and they can access a liaison at the VA if needed. If you call and ask to talk to a counselor it&#39;s like jumping through 1000 loops and the vet center can break those barriers and if you need to go to the va the Vet center can work as a liaison for you.
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center? Knowing that someone else has gone through it and has been there. I put myself out there so they know they aren&#39;t alone. The biggest thing is the stigma with mental health, you&#39;re not weak for asking for help. The va and vet center is separate but not at the same time it is good not having to go to the va but is backed by the va so its not like going to the community when they don&#39;t cover it by insurance or extra things. The vet center feels like a safe middle ground that you feel like you&#39;re getting private care. Its good to know there are other veterans there as well so if you judge others for going your judging yourself.
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center? That it is affiliated with eh va, so many of us have been burned by the VA and had bad expere4inces. For me obviously my experience is different now but in 2005 it was a lot different. I went to the Va first and they always asked me if I&#39;m here with my dad, or husband but I am like I spent this time in Iraq and you can&#39;t even respect me as a veteran so that&#39;s what changed now. At the vet center I have never felt like I don&#39;t belong. The vet center is where I felt like I belonged and not alone in what I was feeling. I am from a nonmilitary family so I came home feeling screwed up. I was in a car in front of the vet center waiting on a group but a Vietnam veteran made a statement to me that wasn&#39;t okay but it ended up being really funny. So I was in good shape and I was wearing clothes like a 20 something and my pants had something on it and he commented on how I looked. Then I was like oh crap you were my history teacher in high school. I realized that we made him, dump by dropping books so I realized I am going to be crazy for my life but It was more of a realization time. I felt like I belonged in a group I didn&#39;t want to belong in it. The fact that I was able to call him out but then we related because we had both been through something similar and we are still friends and I call him family now. I belong but don&#39;t want to sometimes.

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? 14482

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? I used to go to the Rochester but I tend to go to another one. You can put 14215 . That&#39;s the one I go to more often. I sure am.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? It accurately describes what they do there.
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings? Maybe various groups that they do offer there. I think that kind of an idea of the groups they offer would be good for people that are looking at it and gives you the idea of the populated that serviced so I wouldn&#39;t know that they have two active women&#39;s groups. Acknowledging the groups would be helpful.
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? I don&#39;t think so, I don&#39;t really see anything there that would need to be added. I don&#39;t really know anything to think of.

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change? I would like to see the list of key personnel I know it is else where but it is not here. They do a lot of outreach but you&#39;re not sure if they are from one or another vet center so I wouldn&#39;t know where to call. If you can&#39;t remember their name you can see if they actually work there so that would be helpful to know who you talked to and maybe you grab the business card then accidently dropped it. It would be helpful to know the key personnel.

- What&#39;s most important for you to know?

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me? It is one of the best I have ever seen, they have saved my life more times then I can tell you. Another thing I don&#39;t like is the hour of operation, their hors are more broad and they have someone that stays late, it may be the office manager is only there until 430 but if you are working 9-5 then you think this may not work for me because they end at 430. It doesn&#39;t give you the idea that someone is there until 8pm. Stuff like that, you feel more comfortable calling in if I need a late appointment but this website doesn&#39;t indicate that.
- How would you share this information: I send them to the va.gov and tell them to search for it. Most people can look for it, I wouldn&#39;t send them here but you can google it and it will bring up the closest vet center. It will give you think link to the page. If you go through the other way it will say key staff and you click on it that way. It is a va website and you get the western NY and it provides the list of everything and then it has the staff. Its been a long time.
