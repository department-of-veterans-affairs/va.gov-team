**Note taking template: Vet Center - Veteran Interviews - P#13: 9am - Oct 2, 2020**

**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I was in the Army reserve for 4 years, supply specialist. Joined while in high school, no deployed. That&#39;s pretty much it.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? Yeah.
- How did you first learn about them? Before I was able to get healthcare form the VA. I am only eligible for counseling at the VA but before that I saw a Vet Center Counselor.
  - When did you first learn about Vet Centers? Probably when I was starting to enrolled into VA care, that is something that leaders at the Va and other veterans were telling me about.
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center? It was pretty good, the counselor I had was nice and super qualified. You know it was in an easy to access location and it was quiet which was nice. Overall it was a really good experience but I needed more care than what could be provided there but the job they did while I was waiting for higher level care was good.
- Did they help you find the care need or did you find it: They did help me , I just had eligibility issues so they helped to provide records of my PTSD to further show that I deserve the care at the VA which is frustration that you need to prove and then do every expect give up your first born to them.
- Hard to do on your own: Yeah.
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center?
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way? No it was right by wall Street so that is the location that I have to take a ride and they are able to pull right up to the building. It was very easy to access.

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer? I don&#39;t know because I was only there for individual counseling, I noticed there were video games and stuff like that. I know in other vet centers other guys, mostly guys go there to hang out as a social thing but otherwise I don&#39;t know.
- Can you tell me a little about the services, activities, or resources you&#39;ve taken part of?
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time?
- If you had to rank the different things offered at a Vet Center in order of importance  **to you**  what would that look like?
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers?
  - Are there other ways you&#39;d like to be informed about them? I guess so, that would have been helpful to be informed. They had an email blast that had some activities but they were throughout New York State not just the vet center. What they did have were much smaller like administrative stuff. The director was trying to rebrand everything so it was a transitional period for them. I know the director was talking about making brochures for the veterans to see the weekly activities and things like that.
  - Things you&#39;d like to have seen: yeah like maybe representative from VA eligibility or eligibility counselors to go to the Vet center to help veterans with MST and things like that because there are a few veterans that are unable or don&#39;t know what is available for them and don&#39;t want to go to the va center so the vet center is the transitional center that may help people that are there and not aware of what they could be eligible for.
  - Only visited one location: Just one.
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that? I would say it is an office setup with different rooms for counseling and then the main area with veteran&#39;s specific information about potential studies in near by hospitals and common area to hangout or wait.

- Have you visited more than one Vet Center?

If yes:

- How do they differ or compare?

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them?
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center? I would say one category are folks that are recently transitioning out of the military so they don&#39;t get a huge culture shock then another category of individuals that have been out for a while but cannot receive va benefits. Also Homeless veterans because an issue s people have at VA medical centers you have to go through red tape and if you are homeless the resources at the medical center you may not be elieablge for if you didn&#39;t go to combat or were in the reserves so vet centers are better for the community resources and are not contingent on service obligations.
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend? It is a tough thing because it depends where and when you service, character discharged, gender identity because some people have gotten bad discharges due to don&#39;t ask don&#39;t tell or being transgender. Eligibility can be sticky in those situations because most of the time you have to get a lawyer to provide this is what you need. It is not as easy as civilians think, not everyone is eligible for full ebenfits. Like I was in the reserves you don&#39;t get the same thing up until a few years ago you didn&#39;t get the veteran status. Eligibility is bias.
- What about with vet centers: I think with vet centers they do their best to hep folks because it can be stressful when you have veteran friends that get benefits but you don&#39;t so you feel isolated or targeted because you don&#39;t get what they get. The vet center is able to show you that you can get help that is not contingent on va medical care.
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities? It is smaller tighter environment; I notices that they schedule the appointment with very little people or no people at all in the waiting room so you don&#39;t need to worry about people hearing what your conversation is. With confidently it was a big thing for me and it is nice to have the privacy, in the Medical center it is a landmine, you have to go around a lot of veterans and the culture may be still engrained into them. SO that can mess up your day. With the vet center it is more private. The groups at the va can be helpful but when first stating out it is a slippery slope you don&#39;t want both feet in the water.
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them? After experiencing and going to the vet center it changed my thought. When I first heard of them it seemed like a place to hangout but due to my experiences I didn&#39;t want to go hangout with a lot of bros and were hanging out but not getting paid. I was surprised that I learned it was more personalized and not so many people.

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time? I would say confidentiality, for myself when is tarted it was really important to me because of the military culture and my situation. I was worried that if I said anything I thought it would get back to the VA and would prevent me from benefits. I think most veterans are spooked and kind of in the mindset that what you said will be used against you. To let them know confidentiality is highly important.
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center? Maybe assuring that the individuals at the vet center are qualified. Because the issue are specific knowing that there&#39;s someone to handle it, I would tell my friend to go because of the qualifications. You don&#39;t have to worry they went to school for ten minutes and now helping veterans.
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center? Fear or the mindset of its not okay to ask for help. I was in the military 10 years ago and there were consequences if you showed people weakness. So there would be issues with others and thinking it would go on the service recorded or being treated different. I think the folks at the vet center have worked in units or with veterans in general they are good at removing the fear and understanding where they are coming from and the thoughts. They are able to evaluate the fears for the veterans.

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? 11435, it is the one that is Manhattan Vet Center.

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? No, I haven&#39;t looked at it before.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? I would say it is pretty close, yeah it is definitely representative of what they offer. The only thing I would add is a piece of about confidently like a disclaimer to easy the vet.
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings? Not that I can think of, I think it is straightforward.
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? Maybe where it says services, Please be advised that all information that is shared at the vet center or vet center counselor is confidentiality besides mandatory reporting of immediate harm.

Changed to make more accurate: no I would say it is accurate.

Most important for a friend to know: That services are free and you don&#39;t need to meet the VA eligibility and it should be somewhere. Other than that it is okay and maybe put a point of contact. I know they have the main number but for me seeing a person&#39;s number helps me if someone doesn&#39;t answer. If they are unsure of who to speak to they know someone&#39;s name.

Information for the person: Just their name, qualifications, and the role at the vet center.

What would make the comfortable: The confidentiality piece would be a big piece for sure.

What would deter them: I don&#39;t think there is a deterrent

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change? I would say maybe what to expect or yeah maybe testimonials would be a good idea, not just from combat veterans though. Maybe staff testimonials as well.

What would that sound like: what their experience working at the vet center then veteran testimonials talking about their general experiences. Is it easy to get there are the people knowledgeable.

- What&#39;s most important for you to know?

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together.

- Is there anything that you don&#39;t like on this page?

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me? Not that I can think of. I don&#39;t know if vet centers offer it but maybe virtual sessions/telehealth it may be helpful for them to know if there are virtual meetings.
