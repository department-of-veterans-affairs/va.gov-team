**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I starting in 1963 and left in 1993. 17 active and then 3 in nation guard and reserved. I was with the army.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? I have been to a few of them and the new one at fort Meade.
- How did you first learn about them? When I retired from the army and I went for checkups and I went there and there is a new vet center there as well.
  - When did you first learn about Vet Centers? I learned about them when I got out of the army in 1993.
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center? Initially I would have given it a 0 for the Baltimore one but as time went on I would give you a 10 for the eye center in glen Burnie and then the hearing center in fort Meade. I broke my back in the army and I went there and it took them months before I got a response and I got a 10 percent disability but I could hardly walk. Then they gave me a 10 percent for hearing. I got my medical records from private doctors as well and I brought it with me and it was north of Baltimore and I walked in the doctor knew I could hardly walk and I finally caught up to him and then he typed the entire time and I stood over and then had me bend over and sit down then asked me about my sex life. I didn&#39;t know what it had to due with it. When I finished I had all of the affidavit and then told me to drop it off at the office in Baltimore then I wrote my congressman and I heard nothing back. Then basically I went along with it and tried again for them to look at it again and they had to give me assistance in which I never got. Meanwhile my back hurt so much it has turned into 40 percent but it is how they treated you. I was talking to someone I served with and then I saw the glasses and I was really pleased with the eye center. I have a good set of glasses from there then my wife told me I can hear and now I have a good set of hearing aids and the doctor there is good and asked me to say hi to him. I have no issues with them now but the initial ones were terrible.

**Contingency plan:**

If no experience with Vet Center:

- What do you think a Vet Center is? They look like clinics.

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together.

**[SHARE SCREEN]**

[Show Vet Center website](https://www.vetcenter.va.gov/)

Are you familiar with this website? Take a minute to look it over. I&#39;m happy to click around for you as well.

- What can you tell me about a Vet Center? It looks like a USO center, we are volunteers its where troops kick back and relax together. We serve snacks and stuff like that as well. It looks like it is mostly counseling. like group therapy. Okay I am getting the idea. It is for individuals having adjustment issues, PTSD, family assistance. They are a bit different then the clinic, clinical is medical and vet center is psychological. I think I can get the same services at the clinic as well depending on how it is staffed. I had also signed up for the vet cemetery and that was easy to do as well.
- Is there anything that interests you on this page? I don&#39;t think I would qualify because I don&#39;t have needs for those services. What is PDHRA.
- Explain a bit: I don&#39;t have bereavement issues, active duty death, a lot of people die I don&#39;t have issues with that, military related issues I have been out since 93 so I don&#39;t have those issues. Sexual trauma I wish I did, substance abuse. I don&#39;t smoke or do drugs I don&#39;t need employment I am retired. The only thing would be screening and referrals but that has been taken care of by the VA or my private doctor I seem to be covered.
- What is a vet center: the servicemen are different from when I was in and I see this in the USO. When I worked at the defense school as a project manage, their attitude on like life is different. Us old guys say how easy they have it but they don&#39;t cope as well and their issues are more physiological then we had in the Vietnam war. You just coped with it better then and its either the media playing it up with all of the issues but if they are having issues the vet center would be a good place to go. Family counseling or service issues, anything along that line.
- No need or appeal for you: No but I can see where the Soldiers or sailors would have issues like this. I hear them complain but they don&#39;t complain what we did. We complained about drill sergeants and food. There is too much political correctness nowadays rather then being a good solider. The army&#39;s mission was find, kill, and destroy the enemy but now it seems like it is something else.
- If you encountered a young solider and the person doesn&#39;t know about it how would you tell them: I would tell them what is out there for them. I didn&#39;t really know they existed like this but if I see someone with issues we use to say go to the Chaplin but I would let them know there are tons of places to talk it out with and there are many individuals that have experienced or are going through what you are.
- What would be important on the website or know about: I would show them the website that you showed be so they can see what is offered if you are having issues. For example, the left hand side vet center services: if they had issues like that. They better not have substance abuse I have seen people thrown out of the military there is a zero tolerance. I had a tank company and we had a guy thrown out of the tank because we was smoking marijuana and he was never seen again.

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me? I am glad I saw this because when the USO opens up I can have this out. Is there a brochure I can have so I can leave them around.
- I would google VA Vet Centers in Maryland. One thing I learned from this is that there is a difference for a Vet center and VA center.
