**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I am a retired veterans, joined in 79 and retired in 2001. I served in air defense in Texas and Europe and Fort Bragg in Equal Opportunity field and I did that for the last 9 years of my career.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? Yes I am, yes.
- How did you first learn about them? I first learned about them when I retired, I did not immediately go because I didn&#39;t know what I was getting involved in (alot of turmoil going on at the time). I would say about a year and a half after I retired I went to Vet Center in Harlem, NY (125th street - [upon further checking this address this is listed as a Harlem VA Clinic and a Community Resource &amp; Referral Center (CRRC)] ). I went there a couple times to get services because I wasn&#39;t sure of the process. I retired at 70% disability and needed the guidance to start requesting my disability, getting social security. That is my first experience there.
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center? The last one for me was the best because it was Operation Sisterhood in Morristown, NJ. There I was able to get services as a female that had dealt with issues, you know, in the military because my female veteran friend told me about it so I eventually began going there, you know, to just sit and talk, relate to other women that had similar experiences as I did.
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center? The location in NY was basically word of mouth because I was using the Bronx Va at the time and as I said it was of word of mouth. My primary care is the one that told me to consider going because I really was familiar with where to go so basically that&#39;s how I ended up going there. I want to say it was a recommendation from my primary care at the time or word of mouth from other veterans, I honestly don&#39;t remember, it was in 2002-2003.
- Any issues finding them: Operation sisterhood no but the NY Harlem center, for me, it was a two way street of me not knowing what to expect, me having a little hang ups, but I needed the information because of the disability. I found the people there to be helpful to some extent but at first I just didn&#39;t feel comfortable. The man I spoke to, I don&#39;t remember his name, he didn&#39;t seem like he was understanding the assistance that I needed and he had to ask a supervisor. I felt I was coming there for help and I felt like he didn&#39;t have the experience or the knowledge to tell me where to go, he didn&#39;t know enough about his job. It was okay but I wasn&#39;t impressed. I went back once more after that and then not again. You have to remember that was back in early 2000, for me if I go somewhere, like a restaurant, if I am not satisfied I don&#39;t go back but because it was a Vet Center, being a Veteran, I absolutely needed their assistance but after the second time I did not go back but it could have changed since then.
- **What was different the second time:**
 The veteran friend that told me about it [Operation Sisterhood] had similar issues as I did and because she and I had become close, I felt comfortable talking to her. We were comfortable talking to one another, she kept telling me &quot;Come and try it, come and try it&quot; and I finally did and I was very hesitant at first because I didn&#39;t know anyone there but her. Over time, just meeting with the other women and sharing once I felt comfortable, the staff was really nice, I just felt comfortable. They also had resources, several other events. They just offered more service to me than I had experienced when I was in NY.
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way?

**Being a client:**

- **What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer?**
 The sisterhood, I was dealing with problems that we had in the military dealing with MST and PTSD. It was basically discussing similar things that had occurred that were not comfortable situations. We met to talk about each other&#39;s experiences to a point, sometimes it was difficult, but just the camaraderie, and being able to know that there was someone else. We shared a sisterhood and it was just easier to sit down and relate. By that time, I had gotten more info regarding claims and all of that, I was well on my way with that, but the helpful part with that I was learning more about the women that were not using the VA healthcare system and understanding why and it was helping me realize that I needed to do a little more if I wanted the help that I needed. Listening and talking about the same concerns I had helped, operations sisterhood helped me talk about the hidden things that I had issues with sharing before. I was concerned with my paperwork having a hard time getting it processed but having that behind me so I can now deal with the pain. That for me was good, pretty good, really good.
- **Operation Sisterhood the group that you attend or the program that they offer?**
The name of the program. They do a lot of outreach for women to come in and we help by letting other women know that it&#39;s a comfortable, safe environment and it really was. The staff was outstanding and the resources that they offer. It&#39;s a great organization.
- **What makes it feel safe and comfortable for you?**
 First, I&#39;d have to say the environment. When going there I felt comfortable. I normally don&#39;t like sitting with my back exposed. I felt very comfortable there because of the way the room was set up. The building was clean and comfortable community. I felt safe driving there, walking into the building, it didn&#39;t look like a vet center. Just a comfortable location and environment. There were women in there, I think there was one guy. I was comfortable there once we were in sessions. I didn&#39;t mind that the door was closed and my back, I&#39;m not going to say it was back to the door, it was sideways to the door and I could look at the door. But it was more comfortable than other places I had looked into.
- Can you tell me a little about the services, activities, or resources you&#39;ve taken part of? They do outreach and assist women that had issues finding jobs or counseling then I grow to help more because I found out people were not using the healthcare. As a result of being more comfortable we ended up being part of the women&#39;s subcommittee. We sat at the round table and they listened to the issues we had and why we were going to te VA system even though we deserve the services. We had round tables with one women and we ended up talking with eh director of the VA healthcare system to help make changes or suggest changes to allow more women to be comfortable going there. By feeling comfortable it allowed me to branch out and connect with other women, the outreach that were held they handed out papers and allowed me to meet other people and get involved with other events. It was a growth process for me to reach out for more assistance and help other women.
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time? Well I ended up getting involved in the problem my therapist got me on is vets chat and chew, you make a meal with a chef and then everyone eats together. It is wonderful you are cooking , eating, and sharing. It is fantastic. As a result from the help I got I spoke about unit. It is a nonprofit and I really like the program because they support each other. The more opportunity we have to talk and get assistance when needed to help a veteran to get through one day a week they were there for each other. Chat and chew offered employment as well. We all locked hands and worked together to make better and I credit operation sisterhood with that.
- If you had to rank the different things offered at a Vet Center in order of importance  **to you**  what would that look like? For me the vet center would be a one stop chop of possible. You would go and it would feel safe, staff would be knowledgeable and if they aren&#39;t then they should be honest if they don&#39;t know just admit it and then get back to us with the information. Just admit because we don&#39;t know everything and if you go out and try and get the help rather than leaving the veteran there. If it could be a one stop shop for 90 percent of wheat you need it would allow you to share with other veterans and it would improve their services because more veterans are going and more fund would be able to go there. If they had more resources veterans wouldn&#39;t think it is a waste of time. IF they are looking for a job maybe dress for success or resume writing. For me that is an ideal location a one stop shop.
- Referrals the same: For me yes because they can tell you where to go instead of not knowing or the services changing. The small business administration, it&#39;s like you can go here and its not there anymore so I wasted time and it is frustrating. I know it happens because of funding. If I can get the referral to the correct location it is easier and mor confident that you are helping me. You&#39;re up to date with location, hours, and number. For some people that&#39;s small because of google but if I go somewhere as a veteran and you&#39;re supposed to know more about it than I do I don&#39;t want the run around. If I can get the right information to take my path clearer than that is good and I will talk about the services more. I understand that it is not perfect but you should ensure that listings are up to date and the more you update and communicate the more veterans would want to use the services.
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers? With the folks I was dealing with it was mostly through emails or flyers about other events or things happening, word of mouth, rarely would it come through the mail. It was mostly emails that you would get with information that you need.
  - Are there other ways you&#39;d like to be informed about them? Emails are okay depending on who they&#39;re coming form. IF they are coming from the VA services, information can be shared now so I don&#39;t want 7 emails a day. I don&#39;t want garbage. As long as it is good agencies and not just trying to beef up their numbers
  - Sisterhood communication: When we did our round tables talking about the issues, conversations. That was known fact by email and a flyer would b e attached if they though you may be interested in. I don&#39;t remember any surprise visit or announcement; it was always scheduled far enough in advance for you to attend.
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that? With social distances it would be a phone call or email. For me that is the best way right now or texting.
- Have you visited more than one Vet Center?

If yes:

- How do they differ or compare?

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them? I have a friend that has been home maybe a year and she is having a lot of health issues and pain. She is having a lot of issues; we went out for lunch and the plate fell I the kitchen and she did everything but go under the table. I have been there done that so we left and went somewhere where we could talk. I will be honest and just talk to her, I am still trying to encourage her to come out of her safety area to get help. Just try to talk to her. I deal with that and now I have grown a lot but it is painful to see my peers that have gone through what I have and are in pain and need the help. You can&#39;t push them it needs to be baby steps and them to get the help when they need it.
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend?
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities?
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them?

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time?
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center?

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? I would put Marietta, GA. Then puts in Morristown, NJ.

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? It does but I haven&#39;t branched out to any since I got here because I have been using the resources from my friend because she has lived here for 15-20 years. I am not formular with that location. I know Secaucus Vet Center. I have also went to the Harlem Vet center, it was the first one I went to.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? They have moved since I had been there. They have expanded their services, when I went in 2001-2002 it was very small like 2 offices and I do not recall all of the services, they are offering more than when I retired and wanted to use them. Mine was mostly for claims because I wasn&#39;t ready to talk. I don&#39;t remember flyers or boards offering the MST counseling. I wouldn&#39;t have spoken to them anyways.
- What if it were the better Vet center, would it change your feelings: The services are okay but it doesn&#39;t grab my attention because it is a generic page and I understand that. It may be easier for people just starting on computers and not familiar. It is a lot better than it was. For be it is bland, I see it but I don&#39;t see if women go there or it is just for men. I see the services but it is bland. I see what they offer but for me it isn&#39;t making me want to do. I see what they offer but it is not speaking to me. There&#39;s no color, yes they offer things I may need like MST.
- Thinking about your friend: She wouldn&#39;t go looking at this, there&#39;s nothing here telling her she can go and open up. Yes you can&#39;t just look and not go.
- Wat would make her go: Maybe adding some color, a picture something that I can see. I need to see people and not just words. Pictures speak more to me because it explains. As an example, when me and my friend started working to get more women to use the VA. They started to add the pictures, not just changing the layout you don&#39;t have to listen to someone talking about who they screwed on the weekend then they started putting sign to watch your languages. Then there was an MST section of the VA and there were a lot more pictures of women in uniform, different races.
- Where the phots positive: Very positive. That&#39;s what I am saying I understand this is generic but pictures speak a lot for me and it isn&#39;t just works for me so I understand the picture but it doesn&#39;t say enough for me or my friend to feel comfortable.
- If in a few words , what would it say: I don&#39;t want to say we are here for you because to same people that may be lame. I am trying to remember the words, We served, don&#39;t make it generic for one gender, it needs to speak to both genders, to all races, and to the service they are looking for. If it is from military to civilian and if it is employment. If you have the military in have uniform and half civilian to show the transition. For community outreach we have tables set up with different outreaches we had, not only flyers but they had people to talk to you as well. The pictures should show that you can&#39;t put to many but many pictures that they are doing outreach to show that.
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings?
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience?

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change?

- What&#39;s most important for you to know?

[Show Vet Center website](https://www.vetcenter.va.gov/)

Are you familiar with this website? Take a minute to look it over. I&#39;m happy to click around for you as well. Yes.

- What can you tell me about a Vet Center? It is the vet center and it shows what they offer so I know if they offer what I am looking for. The resources is an important area because that s one of the big things and its where the first one right there is the most important. The vet center, once I got the paperwork out of the way, the medical issues were too far down I wasn&#39;t concerned but sisterhood allowed me to explore so its importance and the mental health one I go outside I don&#39;t go to the VA. This breakdown addresses everything which is important because I don&#39;t have to hunt. It is easier so I can read and know if they understand,. I can come here and I feel comfortable. The bullets are important it is symptoms like I use a heart monitor due to my issues. This website just hits it on the head because I am not running around trying to find it. It is up to be to utilize it. You have to get the comfortable experience the first time, I say you have to but it is important.
