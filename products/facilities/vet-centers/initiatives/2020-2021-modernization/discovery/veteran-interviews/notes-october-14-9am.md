# Vet Center Veteran Interview 

**Interview date:** October 14, 2020 <br></br>
**Time:** 9:00am

VC = Vet Center

**Service history:** 
Initially planned to join out of high school. Talked out of it by a recruiter. Bachelors of Chemistry in college. Worked after college for a bit.

Joined military after 9/11 in 2003. 

In Germany less than 1 mo b4 gg to Iraq for 8 mos. Medic in Iraq. Did variety of things. 700+ soldiers in unit. Drove ambulance. Convoys into more hostile file. 

Was medic for ppl who died. Experienced hostile fire. 1 time a vehicle in front went over explosive and all 5 soldiers died. 

Trouble sleeping when home. Struggled. In Nov, was sexually assaulted by male member of her unit. She reported it; he was not prosecuted. They said it was not sufficient evidence to prove non-consensual. 

She fell apart. Discharged bc of inability to continue with her unit. 

Home in 2005, difficulty adjusting. Found “local community outbased clinic to be not a great fit for me.” 

Referred to another clinic (?). [missed some of this]

Worked at VA hospital, did not want to get treatment at same place she worked.

Been going to Vet Center in Buffalo since 2017. Recently also getting marriage counseling at VC in Rochester. 

**Comparison of the 2 VCs?** 
In 2005 did individual counseling. “Back then, the privacy wasn’t really what it needed to be.”

Likes Buffalo. Warm environment, “as opposed to institutional.” 

**Other services VC offers?** 
Individual, group counseling. Equine therapy linked with community org in area. Yoga. Also “social stuff, making it part of the VC family.”

**Equine therapy?** 
Her individual therapist was involved with it. Local farm with horses retired for medical reasons. Farm has grant for working with veterans. 

Horses are natural empaths. They don’t really want anything from you. You learn to ground from them, and you learn to be intimate with yourself. Horses are very grounded. You learn to ground with them. Therapy is all on the ground, no riding. Leading exercises, boundary exercises. You learn to be in tune with the horse and learn the horse’s boundaries, so you learn to find your boundaries. 

She was skeptical initially. “Surprisingly, the horses are really good listeners.” 

She has 3 small children and is a nurse. Complex family life. 

“I’ve had some of my most calm moments with horses.” To be honest, I’m a little afraid of them. But they help me check in with my fear. 

**Rank the things at VC most important to you.** 
1) Confidentiality or privacy. She is a VA employee. She tried to seek some care at VA in Buffalo and didn’t feel her privacy was entirely respected. 

VC is “very warm” environment. “Non-threatening.” She thinks her therapist “may be the best the VC has to offer… It felt so right to be back with her.” (After gap in seeing her therapist.)

“I don’t really like people. … However, I have found this women’s group to be surprisingly wonderful.” “I never feel judged… I can talk about what I’m really feeling and not have to sugar-coat.”

Not a big fan of groups. Good thing that her therapist forced her to go to this group. It ended up great. 

**What makes the VC warm for you?** 
“It’s smaller. You kind of know all the staff after you’ve been there for a little while.” At first it’s a bit intimidating bc they are all talking about you. But they are talking about your treatment. 

“I feel like they’re equally accepting.” She was talking about her therapist being on vacation, dealing with other VC staff. When she has gone to someone else at the VC, she does not like it but she is always glad afterward (seeing another therapist). 

“I’ve never met anymore at the Buffalo VC I would not feel comfortable talking to… To me, that’s a huge thing… They always address you by name, even in the beginning.” 

“They never have to ask me who I am when I walk in the door.”

“It’s kind of like Cheers where everyone knows your name.”

**What would you tell a friend about VCs?** 
She has done this many times. Lives between Rochester and Buffalo VCs. Tells people, “I would go. It’s not threatening.” Usually tells them about her experiences. She has gone with people for their first appt. 

She has told VC staff about the people she sent to the VC. 

“I feel safe there, and that’s a big thing bc I don’t feel safe many places.” 

She has given people she refers the 1-800 number. 

**Most important thing they could know about VCs?**
“You have the right to expect a certain amount of privacy.” Yet the VC is linked to the VA. Lot of hoops to jump through with the VA. But VC can act as liaison to the VA, email your psychiatrist. 

**What would make someone comfortable calling or visiting the 1st time?** 
“Knowing that someone else has gone thru it, that someone else has been there.” 

“One of the biggest barriers is the stigma associated with mental illness.” She mentioned that it’s seen as weakness. 

“The VC is separate from the VA, but it's not…. There is something comforting about it being part of the VA.” No insurance problems, all that extra red tape. 

“The VC feels like the safe middle ground. It feels like you’re getting private care yet it’s backed by the VA.” 

**What would deter someone from calling or visiting?** 
The fact that it’s backed by the VA. “So many of us have had bad experiences” with the VA. 

“With the VC, I never felt like I didn’t belong.”

When she 1st came home in 2005, she went to Rochester VA. Was in parking lot and a Vietnam group had just gotten out. A Vietnam veteran made an inappropriate statement to her. Turned out he was her history teacher. She said she and her classmates were not nice to him in high school. She called him on this, said, “Aren’t you my history teacher?” “There was a certain sense of empathy between us.” 

“I belong but I don’t want to belong sometimes.”

**Showed Facility Locator, looked for her local VC.**
Entered 14482. Rochester was first result. Buffalo was not in results. 

Entered 14215, then went to Buffalo VC detail page. 

On Buffalo VC detail page…
**How does the list of services compare to your experience?** 
“It pretty much accurately describes what they do there.”

**Anything to add?** 
Maybe the groups they do offer. It just has individual and group. Acknowledging some of the groups would be beneficial. 

If she was looking at this page, she would not know they have 2 really active women’s groups. 

**Would you change any of the words, add anything?** 
No, not really. 

**As a regular visitor, what wd be helpful?**
List of the key personnel. Might meet staff at an event. Would not know where “Mark” works, at which VC.

“It would be helpful to know who the key personnel are.” 

“I think our Buffalo VC is pretty awesome… They’ve saved my life more times than I can even begin to tell you.”

Hours of operation. The hours are more broad than that. Every day someone stays late. The hours listing doesn’t really give you the idea that every Monday Lorette is there till 8 o’clock. It would put you at ease to know this if you want to call. 

**How share info about this VC?** 
Usually sends them to VA.gov. Says you can Google Vet Center and it knows your location. “Sometimes you end up at at veterinary hospital, and that’s a different issue.”

**Showed main VC landing page (readjustment counseling).**
She says she goes to a page with a picture of the VC. If you Google /western New York/, it gives you a list of the VA locations with VCs. 

Meg’s note: I think she’s talking about the legacy VC page, which has a picture of the VC:
