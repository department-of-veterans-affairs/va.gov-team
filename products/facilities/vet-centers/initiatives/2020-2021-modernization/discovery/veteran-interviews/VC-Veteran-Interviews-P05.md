**Vet Center - Veteran Interviews - P#5: 7pm - Sept 30, 2020**

**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I joined the Army September 13th 68 and served 2 years and 7 months, then honorably discharged. I extended to go to Vietnam.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? Are you talking about the clinic? Okay so the state supported vet centers. Yeah. I have had a few experiences with those, one good and one bad.
- How did you first learn about them? I think I was driving by and that&#39;s how I found out. I have heard other vets talk about them that have had good experiences. I think maybe I got them on a bad day. Stuff happens.
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center? The first time was in 89 and I had been fired from a job, failing marriage, and my sister died. They were acting for the VA at the time and they acted like they didn&#39;t want me there. The last time I went there was about 5 years ago when they were handing out the medals for Vietnam veterans and certification for it so that was okay.
- Where: It was in Oklahoma city. They were handing them out in events but I could not catch an event but I knew the individual that ran it and he made sure I got one and a certificated as well. Around 5-6 years ago yeah.
- Did you visit after: no ma&#39;am I did not, I have not had a need to. I have 100% disability so I haven&#39;t needed the v et center and I am to old and disabled to work anywhere and to cranky.
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center?
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way?

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer? My understanding is that they are there to help employment, housing and more. Basically to help vets get resettled and provide the resources to do so , I have never seen their mission statement but that&#39;s what it seems like to me.
- Understood when you got the medal: Yes, I did not actually meet in person they mail it to me so it saved a trip. My wife talked to someone there when she was working for the Army Nation guard and had interaction with them.
- Wife participate in vet center events: No she had not but knew the people that worked there but retired there. She was offered a job there but choose to retire instead.
- Other contact: No but my wife use to work with the individual over at the vet center, she is now retired so she does not have contact with them either.

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them?
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend?
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities?
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them?

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time?
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center?

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? Oklahoma city, Oklahoma. 73162

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? That is a lot of stuff that the VA offers but probably a lot faster. The state is much faster than federal. Counseling would be good, I have never had the substance abuse, I could have used the employment referral in 89 and the other referrals would be good but I am caught up with hat besides appointments because of CPVID. Yes they are useful. The other stuff I can imagine people that could use each and every service. Both male and female veterans can benefit from the services.
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings? My hearing limits me with what I can do so I would like to see more outreach and education. I did the group counseling at the VA and it didn&#39;t go well because I am deaf on the right side and I have a hearing aid on the left that limits me.
  - How could it be better for you: Well usually I am good if there&#39;s one person but if there are 2 or more people talking around me it destroys the chain of hearing.
  - Ways to vision groups situations for you: One on one would be best. The only other way would be written for me then I could keep up but other than that it is just a wash.
  - Outreach and education: Helping the public that we are not all a whole bunch of baby killers. Mainly helping the understanding between the military and civilian communities and bringing the good with it.
  - Services you would like to see: No, between them and the VA hospital and clinics it is pretty well covered.
  - Make someone want to visit: normally it is someone referring them or encouraging them to go. I worked for people that I got 5-10 people to go and go to the VA or outreach centers to help their problems. The one on one contact is better then just giving them a pamphlet.
  - What do you say to a friend: Well I can&#39;t use the language I normally I use. I tell them to get some help and the normally listen if they are good enough friends.
  - Anything here to make them comfortable if there&#39;s no one there to tell them: You got me; I don&#39;t know. One thing I have found that may help because there are a lot of veterans with hearing issues. Everyone gives you a phone number and then use the 4 letter TEXT and if they would do that, I even told them at the VA. You go the VA and they have a number but people still come out and call your name so you may not know if they called you. They have monitors out now in many places, VA and some vet centers are going to start using TEXT but ill believe it when I see it.
  - What would keep someone from calling or visiting a vet center: Probably afraid of the information not being kept confidential. I don&#39;t have an issue I have been very happy with the confidentiality.
  - Anything else: No. I noticed it says if you need to talk to anyone to call at any time but then has the hours of operation and then they are specific to each site and can change often. Don&#39;t put call at any time unless you have someone available 24/7. You need to have a statement that says we have someone available to help you 24/7. Then down at the bottom to contact the vet center for the actual schedule. You could text and it is more preferable for individuals hard of hearing.
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? No I think it covers everything well.
- How would you like to have been information of the services: As an out processing form the military. If someone would have told me and I had my hearing in 89. IF they would have told me about the resource for maybe finding a job but again I didn&#39;t even know they existed until I drove by one. I drove by it because I was going to our credit union.
- What did you notice: The sign that said vet center.

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change?

Other ways you would share the information: I interact with them on Facebook, that is how I connected with friends that were in Vietnam with me and that&#39;s how I hammer the point down to them.

Communicate on Facebook with them: Normally in private messaging so the entire world doesn&#39;t know what we are talking about

Other websites you use: No I don&#39;t use twitter or anything. That is foreign to me. I stay there but I try not to get on there to long because it can eat up your entire day. Someone has to mow the lawn.

Do you ever get invited to events on Facebook: I have but I don&#39;t go or use it because I like to stay home with my wife. She is who I go out with and travel with and we have friends we go to the city with but I am not that social anymore.

Would your wife want to share in a different way if she were telling people about vet centers: I have no idea.

Shares vet center page: No I have not seen that.

Anything that stands out to you: There is a lot of information there. I like that it has a vet center national directory. That would tell people where to go for help. It looks pretty good.

What is your understanding for eligible for vet centers: I would assume that you have at least a general discharge under honorable conditions or better. I don&#39;t know if people with a bad discharge are eligible or if they could help them upgrade their discharge. I have no idea. I wouldn&#39;t even be eligible would I. The Vietnam era veterans that had used it prior to January 2013, I doubt that they kept my paper from that short time I went.
