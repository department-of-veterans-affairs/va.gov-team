**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I was a pilot in the Marine Corps, I started in March 67 in OCS then the basic school for 5 months then flight school and in Vietnam until 70. Returned near to Camp Lejeune and flew in a squadron. And was in charge then accepted for a regular commission but I wanted to go to law school and I did. The marine corps told me they would pull me out even in school.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? I go for flu shots but this year have gotten more familiar and I have been getting my medical care for the last 8 months. Yes it is a medical center in Chicago and it is 20 minutes away from my house.
- What is a vet center: Anywhere that a veteran is serviced. I have been there but I haven&#39;t gotten care and the big hospital is 40 minutes away from my house.
  - If no, see &quot;Contingency Plan&quot;
- How did you first learn about them?
  - When did you first learn about Vet Centers?

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time?
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center?

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? 60630 is what I would use. I know where that is it is near northwestern university. I may be more inclined to go to Forest park even though it is a big farther, lets see what else they have. I would go to forest park because I like the area better. The other has its problems, it is a mix but I would go to forest park.
- Familiar with this site: No.
- Any questions: I like the services that they have and that they can do a referral to other services because that is a broad range. The hours seem decent but with COVID I&#39;m sure there are changes so I would call first. The number is there to contact so that is good. I see what is available, I dot necessarily need those things art this point but you never know.
- What can you tell me about the service: They have group counseling such as PTSD, as my buddies and I have. I never sought counseling for it and in all fairness after the first 8-10 years I don&#39;t think I have had any other issues. Greif counseling and referrals of other VA services. I like it all, it is possible I may look into group or individual counseling, today not likely.
- Other referrals to va services, what is helpful: I am guessing, well I would call and ask and tell them my problem. I have looked into caretaking things. I don&#39;t see that coming but then again no one ever does. I think that is something that would be helpful, I know where to go for healthcare and I like the docs and the way they treat veterans, very very very well. If I had medical referrals I would ask my doc.
- Imagining yourself after leaving service, if you needed to find one who would you find it: Well I assume my problems were induced by being in a combat zone and the whole thing from coming from a person not doing harm and considered being objective for a fact than deciding that it would not work in the situations I was in during Vietnam. It had more of an effect on my than I was willing to admit. I don&#39;t think I would have issue snow with the internet finding now with this website. I think I could find them now but back then I only knew about Hines because of my buddies going for wounds and psychological care.
- Tools now days, how would you search: I am sure I would start with the VA. I have a buddy that is a VVA service officer, if I didn&#39;t know how to I know my buddy would do it he has been doing it for 25 Years. I would call him but on my own I would search for VA assistance and see what I could see. I think I could get to this pretty easy.
- How would you find it one your own, there are many types of VA assistance: on my own I would go to VA.gov and look for my issue. If needing counseling I would put in counseling then see what it says. I just assume it is a medical situation, so I that is what I would do or go online and say veteran counseling options and I assume the VA would popup and it think I would get to this fast.
- What would make a buddy call or visits a vet center: I think now, really over the past 20 ears have realized that the men and women that have fought in combat have problems relating to it for a number of reasons. Not just from mortars but form hand to hand combat as well. They realize it is true and far more willing to assist. I think personally my buddies would go to Hines, I do mostly civil work but I started at the DA&#39;s office and I have defended veterans and it came out after interviewing them came from disorders due to service time. They were willing to get help and wanted help. I defended someone that was not getting help fast enough and he pulled a weapon out and it didn&#39;t go well. Fortunately, the judge was a veteran and we were able tog et him help. He went to get help and had been there before so I don&#39;t know. I think people now and for a while have been willing to accept help. I can only speak to the Marines we are invincible and it carries on. I remember being solicited from someone from the Camp legume area and she were a wife a Marine and I told her to believe her husband. Don&#39;t listen to others but to listen to her husband that something happened. These guys are not going to whine about things 99% but will say they are fine when they are not.
- Anything that we can add to the page: I think on the first page like the pictures don&#39;t hit me and say that you men and women may have problems and we want to help. It doesn&#39;t say don&#39;t wait or anything. This doesn&#39;t grab me that way but this looks like there are a lot of happy friendly people that want to help but it doesn&#39;t say we know you have problems to come in so we can help you.
- What would stop someone from call or visiting: The unknown, maybe I know some buddies that were not satisfied or feel it did them much good. Most thought it helped them a lot and the group things made them realize that they&#39;re not alone. I think that is what prevents a lot, I don&#39;t like going to doctors, asking for directions, so I think that is the type of thing that the American male especially veterans think they can do anything and don&#39;t like to ask for help. That is what is stopping them and I think sometimes they don&#39;t want to admit they need help. When I was in Boy scouts they were all WWII Veterans and you&#39;d never know it they were great and wonderful guys. They were combat veterans; they say significate combat and they didn&#39;t need help so why would I ask for help if they didn&#39;t need it.
- Better words for group counseling or any of them: I would have to think about it but I don&#39;t know what else you can say because issues can be bored and this is broad. I think initially you need to see something that addresses that we know you don&#39;t want to but you should come in and we can help. I know a lot of people that have been through a lot of counseling and it didn&#39;t help. All you can do is provide the area to try and help and most of the time it takes time. The first time may not be great because you don&#39;t know how to deal with it but if the seeds are planted it works out. It is clear and it is just the question does it entice me as someone reluctant to go. The people committing suicide are the ones not getting the help, they may have had issues prior to going and sometimes really made worse but that is a small percentage. It isn&#39;t unwelcoming but it doesn&#39;t grab me.
- Do you need more information that would be helpful to have: From what I see it covers, I don&#39;t know if it would be good or bad but I don&#39;t see PTSD listed in the services and from what I have seen that is one of the leading causes for needing counseling. I think one of my buddies have had spells of not knowing what to do and it was brought on spontaneously so seeing it it may bring him in but I don&#39;t know.
- How would you have liked to be informed of Vet centers: Well I think I was aware and there were standalone centers but I always think the physical health. I have thought its where you go to get medical care and not as counseling and other assistance centers. I am guessing I think if you ask my buddies with these issues they all know about them. I had the issues and resolved them on my own so I never looked for this. The information is there and I see if all the time. I was aware it was available but I just never asked for it. I think it was available 50 years ago but I wasn&#39;t going to ask for it. I get a lot of information, I am in the VFW, American Legion and I belong to them all so I get dozens of emails referring to these problems and it says contact these people or this place so I am aware that I can access it myself.

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? I don&#39;t recognize those photos, I use the .va and myhealthevet all the time but I have not seen this.
- gov, this site: Yes.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

-I have read the part that I can see. I see.

What can you tell me: I was thinking of the medical based situations but I have many friends in my neighborhood that get counseling at the medical centers and the vet centers. One thing I was going to participate in is the MOVE program. I had one meeting prior to COVID and should have been going to weekly group sessions, they never occurred because of the time with COVID. They are still postponed but when I went to counseling for being a fat person he asked why I didn&#39;t start today and I lost 106 pounds in 6 months.

Where should it have taken place: I think they are at all of the hospitals but mine was at Jessie Brown in the city of Chicago. There was a room but I never went so I don&#39;t know.

Anything that interests you: The readjustment counseling I wish we had this 50 years ago. It was hard to come back form a combat zone right into regular life, I did it but I think I was harder on people like my wife. I could have used some guidance. Eligibility I am guessing for disability, I have hearing lose I have nothing other then self-induced. I like that it provides more resources. Burials is a big thing because I&#39;m 76 so its coming. Then you can access myhealthevet from here and I use the regularly. There are a lot of emphasis on Veterans Criss and I am stunned that there is a high number of suicides and I don&#39;t understand it. None of my buddies that were flying and infantry or recon, no one I know that was a combat veteran has committed suicide or came close to it by my knowledge. 20 percent is sad.

Resources: Okay I looked at it. I don&#39;t think I have sued the mobile apps yet because I am getting a new phone. I don&#39;t know if the office of surviving individuals will apply to my wife if I pass first, It is good to know that they are there. From the outreach, I don&#39;t know if it was form me being a veteran 50 years ago or if it is in current day when you lose someone on active duty. I could read it and find out though.

Anything that you don&#39;t like on this page: I didn&#39;t see anything that struck me, no I like it all. I am glad it exist for people that have these continuing problems or sexual trauma. That is extremely important. I didn&#39;t see it in my tour but from what I heard it is highly important and it is good that they are available for people that need them.

Look over eligibility: READS last time of eligibility. It is a good question I use to get my flu shots does that qualify me? But I do qualify from being in a combat zone, yes I would qualify that is what I would be looking for.

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me? No I don&#39;t but I am glad to be aware of this more then I was prior to starting. First of all I may utilize it if I thought I needed to and I would be able to tell other veterans about it since I know about it now and possible put them in the right directions. My VSO buddy is the first person I would call because he has been doing it so long but I am glad to know about these things.
