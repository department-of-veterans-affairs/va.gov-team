VC = Vet Center

[missed first 4 minutes]

Woman veteran. Was in the Reserve.  PTSD. 

Went to VC near Wall Street. Was easy to access. 

Don’t know what other svcs the VC offered. I was only there for individual counseling. Know some guys go to play video games at VC. 

Would like to know about other svcs. There was email blast of activities throughout NYC. The VC activities were kind of “small, administrative” things. Director was talking about making brochures to show weekly activities. 

Maybe reps from VA eligibility or eligibility counselors, if they came to an open house, would be helpful. Maybe for certain issues like MST. Lot of vets don’t know what’s available to them, what they are eligible for. 

Been to only 1 VC. 

Wd describe VC as office setup with rooms for counseling, and there is an area with info about things like studies at specific hospitals. Common area where vets hang out or wait. 

Who cd VCs help? 
* Folks recently coming out of military. So they won’t get so much of a culture shock. 
* Vets who’ve been out a while but are not able to receive VA benefits. 
* Homeless vets. There is a lot of red tape if you go to a VA med ctr. You may not be eligible. The VC is a bit better equipped to show you comm’y resources that may not be contingent on svc obligation. 

How describe eligibility?
* When u served
* Where you served
* Even gender ID, like trans folks
* Some ppl got kicked out of military for sexual preference and ID 

Eligibility can be hard to prove — you may need to get an attorney. 

Ppl think: “Oh, you served in the military, you get taken care of, and that’s not necessarily true. 

Ppl in reserve and nat’l guard were not eligible b4. 

“I wd say eligibility is a little bit biased.”

VC is private environment. I needed that. 

VAMC is kind of like a “land mine.” There is is military culture, might get derogatory comments. 

“It is very helpful to be around other veterans, but I think when you are starting out that journey, it’s a slippery slope and you don’t want to dip both feet in the water.”

Perspective on VC has changed. Initially thought it was a place to hang out. “I was pleasantly surprised that when I went to a VC is was much more a personalized approach and not so many ppl.”

Most important thing for a person not aware of VCs to know is confidentiality. When I was in military, I worried that if I said things they wd get back to me and I wd lose benefits.

Important to tell a friend that the ppl at VC are qualified. You don’t have to worry. 

What could deter them from calling? 
Possibly fear. I was in military 10 yrs ago. “There were consequences if you showed anything that ppl wd say was weakness.” I didn’t want ppl to treat me differently. 

Think the ppl at VC are good at alleviating that fear. Fears were very ingrained. 

Looking at VC landing page, readjustment counseling. 

Never been to a VC website before. 

Want to know more about the call center. Only thing I wish is that it was free for maybe other folks who weren’t combat veterans. But can’t change that. 

Typed in 11435 ZIP code. 

Looking at 32 Broadway VC detail page. 

Quickly “took it all in.”

Services - how compare to your experience and knowledge of a VC? 
“I wd say it’s pretty close. It’s representative of what they offer. Only thing I wd add is maybe a pieced on confidentiality, maybe a disclaimer.” So vets can decide whether to go to a VC or VAMC. 

Include wording something like: 
“Pls be advised that all info that’s shared at the VC or with a VC therapist is completely confidential with the exception of mandatory reporting for anyone who’s going to harm themselves or others.”

Thinks list of svcs is pretty straightforward. Words are pretty accurate.  

Most imp thing for a friend to get out of a web page - 
VC svcs are free and you don’t have to meet any eligibility before seeing anybody. 

What else do you want to see? 
“Maybe a point of contact. Sometimes at least for me it helps to see a person’s name so that when I call, if I can’t get ahold of them, I can ask for” a specific person, a “central point of contact.” Want to see name, qualifications, and role at VC. 

Confidentiality piece is high priority on page. 

Don’t think there is anything on the detail page that wd deter a vet from visiting for the 1st time. 

Anything helpful for person new to VC? 
Maybe what to expect or testimonials from a varsity of ppl, not just combat veterans. 

Maybe even staff testimonials - what their experience has been working at the VC. 

From vets, want to know was it easy to find the VC, did the ppl seem knowledgeable, things like that. 

Maybe VCs cd offer telehealth. Vets who are homebound or living in rural areas. Wd be good to have that option.
