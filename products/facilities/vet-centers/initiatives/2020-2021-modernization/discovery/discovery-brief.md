## DISCOVERY BRIEF

### Project Name
Vet Center Discovery 

### Problem Statement
How might we use the current Vet Center detail pages within the VA.gov Facility Locator as the basis for Vet Center websites, similar to the VAMC page upgrade? 

### Project Team
* Product Owner: Dave Conlon
* Product Manager: Michelle Middaugh
* Designer: Leyda Hughes

### Stakeholders
* VA business owner: Jessica Schiefer
* Stakeholders who will be involved or interviewed:
  - Meg Peters (VA, taxonomy)
  - Aptiv, 3rd party vendor

## DISCOVERY PLANNING

### Project Details

* What do we know?
  - Vet Centers do not currently have websites across the VA.gov ecosystem. 
  - Vet Centers have services for veterans and families of currently deployed active service members.
  - Vet Centers are instrumental in the transition from active enlistment and frequently serve as the introduction to the VA system. 
  - Initial mock-ups envisioning pages following the style of the VAMC upgrade pages. 
  
* What don't we know?
  - What is the right process for pursuing Vet Center taxonomy? 
  - What services are available and for whom?
  - What information about these services will be valuable to our users?
  - What is the difference between services offered through Vet Centers and those available at a VAMC (ie: mental health)? Is there an overlap?

* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
  - We need to validate that Vet Centers will fit the VAMC (Pittsburgh) model. 
  
* How are we going to find out answers? 
  - Engage with Jessica Schiefer, the team from the marketing vendor

* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
  - Veterans 
  - Families of currently deployed active service members

* Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MHV Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives â€“ both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
  - 3rd party marketing vendor
  
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?

* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?

* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
 - Balancing competing priorities


### Timeline

  * User Research:
  * Complete & Readout:

## Upon Completion
