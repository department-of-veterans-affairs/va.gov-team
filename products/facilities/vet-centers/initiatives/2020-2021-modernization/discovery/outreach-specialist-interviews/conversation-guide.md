## Vet Center Page Critique

[CRITIQUE OF CURRENT DETAIL PAGE – 15 MIN]  

[Current Vet Center page example](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0342V)

This is what a Vet Center page looks like today, in an ideal world, what would the page look like if it was first exposure that a Veteran or service member had to your Vet Center, maybe after they did a google search.  

 - What would be the most important thing(s) that they should be able to learn or understand.  

 - What could be improved about [this] website to improve your needs as an outreach specialist?  

 - Thinking of all those first conversations with new and potential clients, what would they change?
