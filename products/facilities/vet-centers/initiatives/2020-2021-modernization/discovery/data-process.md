## Vet Center Data Collection


The following Q/A were supplied by Jessica Schiefer during the Vet Center dsicovery process in August 2020. 

<details>
<summary> Who does this work? </summary>
I want to make sure I answer correctly based on what you’re trying to get at so I apologize for the long-winded answer. RCS has a data team responsible for tracking most of our organization’s data as it pertains to workload, staffing, productivity, clinical documentation and client demographic information, and so on. They also currently input changes to addresses, hours of operation and telephone numbers into VAST. I’m hoping with this project we can iron out responsibilities because we have a lot of cooks in the kitchen and no one really ever took ownership over it.

Though I’m still uncertain of the data needs for this project, if I was going off of basic assumption of needing photos, easy to understand location and parking information, etc. of all 300 Vet Centers and outstations for the purposes of this project, I (the Communications team) would put out a data call well in advance to our five districts letting them know of the need. While we typically submit these data calls via Excel spreadsheet, if there was an easier or preferred way (such as a fillable form somewhere) we can try to maneuver that.

From there, I planned to provide all data call documentation to my contractor who I have hired mostly for the purposes of this project, and they will conduct a quality assurance to make sure the photos are clear and appropriate, we have the right information and everything looks good before presenting. Sorry, I’m making a lot of assumptions not knowing who will actually be putting this information in there. The web support person/contractor could also be trained to input anything into Droople or whatever else is needed as soon as I can get them computer access. I am currently working on that as we speak and once that is confirmed, I will have this individual available 40 hrs per week to help see this through as well as any internal intranet items in the meantime.

<summary> How is it done today? i.e. what does the process look like? </summary>

I believe I mentioned above, but currently the responsibility for data collection and changes on the internet is split between our NSS office and Communciations. I would like for this project to iron out responsibilities of who updates what.

<summary> How often is the data updated/validated? </summary>

Vet Center web data is updated as soon as the request is sent to either RCS Communications or NSS. As mentioned, NSS will generally do Vet Center specific hours, location and contact info where as comms has been making small edits to the Vetcenter.va.gov webpages. We are also tracking and submitting all the daily operational status updates since COVID began. That also includes when a Vet Center needs to close for the day due to weather or other unforeseen circumstances.

<details>
<summary> What tech tools and applications are used by Vet Center employees? </summary>

I’m unsure of what this is referring to. Vet Centers can utilize our intranet site (recently built) Sharepoint, and that’s about it. We have our own system of records that they submit clinical documentation to and outreach specialists track their outreach events on but only our organization has access to that for privacy reasons. No centralized scheduling tool or anything just yet. I’m not sure about any tech capabilities or systems available to our call center staff but I imagine it’s not much. Our counselors will also use VA Video Connect for virtual appointments. That’s all I can think of at the moment.
