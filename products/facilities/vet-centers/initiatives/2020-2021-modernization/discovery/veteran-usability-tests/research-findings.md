# Research Findings: Vet Center - non-client, Veteran - detail page usability study
**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Facility Locator**<br>

Leyda Hughes (leyda.hughes@adhocteam.us), 01/04/2021

## Research Goals 

The Facilities team tested a prototype of an upgraded Vet Center facility detail page with non-(Vet Center)client Veterans to understand if they would have enough information to choose care at a Vet Center.

We set out to gain high level input on Veteran’s understanding and usability of:

- Parent vs child location IA
- Service taxons
- Logistical information


Prior to the study, we hypothesized that:

- Veterans will understand the types of services offered/not offered. 
- Veterans will have enough information to visit a location. 
- Veterans will understand next steps for interacting with a Vet Center. 
- Veterans will understand that child locations may not have the same services as a parent location.


## Research Methodology 

Combined directed interviewing and usability testing, with task analysis, of a [high-fidelity, desktop prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp:~2F~2Ff) created in UXPin.

### Who we talked to

We talked to 9 Veterans:

* All had engaged in some mental health care with the VA (most dealing with PTSD and/or MST)
* Ages 35-74
* 2 Vet Center clients
* 6 rural
* 5 female, 4 male
* 6 Caucasian, 2 African American 
* 1 wheelchair bound Veteran
* 4 with disability ratings of 70%
* Veterans of diverse levels of education and socio-economic situation


### Research Questions

Would Veterans:

- understand what type of care is available at Vet Centers? 
- understand that they cannot get primary medical care at a Vet Center? 
- be able to find the service that they are looking for within the list of taxons?
- gravitate more towards some taxons vs others? 
- understand the relationship between Vet Center parent and child locations? 
- understand that not all services are available at child locations? 
- have enough information in order to visit or call a location?


### Interview Session Setup

Participants were told to imagine a scenario where they were going through a rough time and were searching on the internet for counseling options. They were to imagine that their search lead them to the prototype. To simulate conventional user behavior, participants were given quick moment to review the page, but were purposely not instructed to describe it. Instead, they were first given two tasks to find individual and group counseling respectively. The tasks were followed by questions regarding their understanding of other locations and next steps if they saw a service that they were interested in. This gave the participants the opportunity to learn about the facility and what it had to offer before being asked to describe the facility and the type of care that would be available.

## Findings

### Findings by hypothesis
* Veterans will understand the types of services offered/not offered. 
  - **FALSE. Most participants confused Vet Centers with medical facilities.**
* Veterans will have enough information to visit a location. 
  - **FALSE. Participants wanted more information than was provided in the prototype before they would plan a visit to a Vet Center.**
* Veterans will understand next steps for interacting with a Vet Center. 
  - **FALSE. Participants expected to see contact info and instructions on how to make and appointment and where exactly to go embedded within each service accordion.**
* Veterans will understand that child locations may not have the same services as a parent location.
  - **TRUE. Participants understood “Satellite locations” as related to the main location and that they are often smaller and with a reduced service offering than it’s parent location.**



### Key Findings

1. Most Veterans thought they were looking at a medical facility's website.
2. Veterans who have been through counseling are comfortable with the term, "Mental health care".
3. Veterans expected to see more service information available within each service accordion.
4. COVID alert created usability issues for most participants.
5. A satellite's location influences the type of care assumed to be available there.
6. How a Veteran prepares for a visit varies widely depending on their context.
7. Placement and user experience of "More locations" was unexpected.
8. Positioning Vet Centers as being for those "transitioning", alienates some Veterans.
9. Women were more apt to look for all their care in Women Veteran Care.
10. A Veteran's mental state impacts their ability to cope with challenge.

### Details of Findings

#### 1.  Most Veterans thought they were looking at a medical facility's website.

**Veterans didn't read intro paragraph on facility pages:**

Participants scrolled past the name of the facility and intro paragraph to complete their initial tasks, not noticing that this was not a VA medical facility.  4 never read intro, 4 read it towards the end of the session when they were asked to describe the facility.  

**A facility's main function is not obvious to Veterans:** 

Participants carried the mental model of a VA hospital campus when describing additional information they expected to see within the service accordions, such as a number to call or if a referral would be necessary.

By the end of the session, many participants (those that never read the intro paragraph) still believed that they could go to this facility for primary care.

**The long list of services made Veterans think this facility was a campus.** Veterans had a hard time reconciling the size of the facility in the photo with the number of services available. 

> “I would probably put it up at the top in that first little paragraph we do not offer any type of medical services.  I would definitely word it in a way that doesn't come off as being mean or threatening but just matter-of-factly so that the Veteran doesn't show up there,  thinking he's going to get his knee looked at. That's not what we do. But I think that'd be VERY frustrating for a veteran trying to go to these places. I would definitely put it at the top.  Mental health but not physical.”

>"Making it clear what's onsite and what's within the community. Its alot nicer for me here, my VA is pretty huge and everything is under one roof. Most of it is on the same campus. Is this one small building or a bigger campus?"

>"I'm looking at the picture of the facility thinking it's an awful small looking facility to be able to have all of these things that are available. I know from past experience that you're not going to have an office for each of these things in there.  You're probably going to have one office there that's going to direct you to other things that might not be at that facility but probably be directed to another facility."


#### 2. Veterans who have been through counseling are comfortable with the term, "Mental health care".

All participants in this study had engaged in individual and/or group counseling with the VA. 2 participants had also been clients of a Vet Center. These Veterans were comfortable with and used the term, "Mental health" and "Mental health care" and felt it was the logical place to look for individual and group counseling. It is unclear if Veterans who have not yet engaged in mental health treatment but would benefit from it would respond as favorably to this term. Most of the Veterans also used variations of the word "counseling" when discussing mental health. 

"Psychology" was a first pick for 3 participants to complete tasks but two of these same participants were quick to add that they did not like the term and that "Mental health care" was a better category.  "PTSD treatment" was not the first accordion expanded to complete the task for participants but was later expanded by most of the participants due to their own interest and curiosity in the service. Participants also showed interest and found individual and group counseling within "Military sexual trauma treatment" and "Women Veteran care".   

Where participants found individual counseling:

- 3 - Psychology (two later changed their preference to Mental health care, disparaging ‘Psychology’)
- 3 - Mental health care
- 2 - Women Veteran care
- 1 - Benefit counseling

Where participants found group counseling:

- 6 - Mental health care
- 1 - Military sexual trauma care
- 1 - Women Veteran care

> "If you couldn't identify it specifically for yourself, I mean 'Mental health care' the 5th tab down.  I myself, I could go under Women's Veteran Care, PTSD treatment, psychology, minority, MST, Mental health, there's 5 categories I can identify with."

> "I would look under either “psychology” or “PTSD treatment” …or “mental health care”– that makes more sense."

> “Psychology kinda seems, kinda cold – Veterans, we're very picky about labels. So when you pick psychology, well I'm not freakin crazy, I just need to vent or whatever. ”

> “I don’t think “psychology” should be its own dropdown. Most people are going to see that and then keep looking – they’re more likely to click “mental health care.” It could make sense to combine the two.”


#### 3. Veterans expected to see more detailed information available within each service accordion.

For some dealing with mental health issues, it was crucial to know what to have more information to lower anxiety. 

Participants expected to see:

- Name and phone number of person they need to contact 
    - Is a live person going to answer if I call?
- How is an appointment made?
    - Do I need a referral?
- What to expect during a first visit
    - Is it therapeutic or just an assessment?
- If Telehealth is offered, what are a Veteran’s privacy options? 
    - Can I remain off-camera? 
- Detailed information for each type of counseling
    - What specific types of therapy that might be available, e.g. EMDR, CBT.
- Details of a specific group therapy offerings 
    - Who would be running it, where would it take place, who could they call to inquire about it?

> “Yeah, and I don't know if its because its a prototype but you wouldn't be able to click on it. Say if I wanted to look into Family Counseling, if I were able to hit ‘Family counseling’, but it doesn't tell you what to do next. Yes, we offer it but it doesn't tell me what to do next.”

> "What type of group therapy do they have or a name and number to call if you're interested. Like the [city name] VA here, they have a group mindfulness therapy that met every Monday and they listed on the [city name] VA website and who was the person running it. How to get into it, who to call... but they have so many things. Having a name and number of who to call."

#### 4. COVID alert created usability issues for most participants.

5 of 6 participants were exposed to the alert (removed after #6). 

- COVID Alert took up the entire screen for the majority of participants. This caused wayfinding issues. Participants thought they’d clicked on the wrong page or thought the page was about Covid. The details of the alert also added to the confusion about whether this was a medical facility due to the mention of flu shots in the description.

- One participant was angered and expressed that depending on her mental state that day it would have put her in a worse state.

> “I don't need to read through COVID to get to the place I need to be. This would irritate me more honestly. This would drive me nuts, cause COVID is affecting everybody right now not just physically but mentally. And this is one of the problems, to see this in your face again. It would just drive me nuts as I am already.”

> “Took me to the original page that I was on.” [user doesn’t realize they navigated to a new page]

#### 5. A satellite's location influences the type of care assumed to be available there.

Some Community Access Points are located in YMCA’s, churches, etc.  Veteran’s made assumptions that the type of care available may depend on where it is located. 

> “To me, the Atlanta Vet Center is just that, it's a Veteran Center, where the rest of these are, looks like within a facility so I wouldn't actually be dealing with the Veteran's facility, I'd be walking into like the YMCA center, like an office within the YMCA. The Vet Center at the Veteran of Foreign Wars, to me if I am not a Veteran of a foreign war, I wouldn't even be looking at this location. Because there are those of us that don't qualify for VFW. I served during peacetime. So I'm not clicking on that. Disabled Veterans, yeah, that works but is it just for disabled Veterans? Is it a facility that anyone can use.”


#### 6. How a Veteran prepares for a visit varies widely depending on their context.

Car-bound participants appreciated the links to "Get directions" and parking directions but the prototype lacked information for other modes of transportation. One participant, who relies on public transportation and prepaid cell phone minutes, explained that he would need to know exactly where to go and could not waste time on hold if he called for more information. Another participant, who was wheelchair bound, echoed the need for exact directions or transportation options. Understanding which services were available onsite vs which would require them to go elsewhere is crucial. Knowing what to bring or have prepared was also important to Veterans.

Veterans wanted to know:

- Where to go, what building, floor, etc
- Do I need to bring or prepare forms (DD214, medication list, a referral from my doctor)?
- Public transportation directions/instructions
- wheelchair assistance availability

> “[without a] direct contact number, you could wait forever, run you over your minutes if you’re left on hold. Most veterans nowadays don’t have a landline they have cell phone services. Not everyone has a contract most people just use prepaid services.”

>"Not everyone has a POV [privately owned vehicle] and not everyone have an Uber or Lyft account. What I don’t see on this page is anything telling the Veteran about any shuttle service if there is one provided. Not every Veteran has POV. How we’re going to get there? Public Transportation, shuttle service to this center and back."

>"When I'm looking for services, I need to make sure I know what's going to be available there If I'm going to travel that far to get assistance."


#### 7. Placement and user experience of "More locations" was unexpected.

“More locations” was on a second page that linked from a small blur of text on the main page and was included in the “On this page” component. This was unexpected and created an “extra click” for users. Some participants never found additional locations on their own. Those that did expected to find more locations within the “Location and contact information” section and expected to see the listings after the first click.  

> “Well I clicked on it and then I gotta click on it again. Then it brings it up.”

> “the first thing that I would look at the 'Location and contact information'... I wouldn't look for it until after I was already looking at the [main location] address. I wouldn't have looked up [On this page] until you queued me to. I would have cruised down to location and zap right to the picture and contact information.”

#### 8. Positioning Vet Centers as being for those "transitioning", alienates some Veterans.

Some participants assumed that they would not be eligible to receive services at this facility after reading the words, “for Veterans, service members and their families needing help transitioning to civilian life”.

> “To me, this page seems to be specific to families who are transitioning to the VA, so I’m not sure if it is specific to me. I start to think that this isn’t what I’m looking for. I would probably keep scrolling some but just to check if the rest applies to me.”

> “It could be a lot clearer if it doesn't have to be for transitioning to civilian life. It could be family counseling period instead of 'putting transitioning to civilian life'. It could be a Veteran that's already out that needs the help. Yeah, I think that would throw some people off. If you've been out for a while you would think it doesn't pertain to you.”

#### 9. Women were more apt to look for all their care in Women Veteran Care.

Three female participants expanded “Women Veteran care” first when looking for individual or group counseling. They were all curious to know what would be offered that is specific to their needs.

> “I know not all VAs are up on Women Veteran Care, not that they're not up on it, but with Pittsburgh they usually that the latest things for women here if I didn't find it there then I would find something more specific like PTSD and see what they have there [opens PTSD] I guess individual counseling, it has. I like the Women's Veteran [goes back to it] A lot of the women now look for that when they go to VAs website, they look for specific to women.”

#### 10. A Veteran's mental state impacts their ability to cope with challenges.

Many participants shared how their specific mental state can impact their ability to handle certain situations. When in a negative mental state participants mentioned difficulty with: 

- reading lots of text, “big words” 
- overall confusion/overwhelm leading to giving up on tasks
- getting lost on a hospital campus
- wading through a webpage page to find phone numbers
- ignoring a COVID alert

Participants called out the yellow banner containing the Vet Center hotline that they could call during off hours as a good thing but also suggested moving it to the top or making it more prominent so that they'd see that first if they were in a bad state.

 > “Most people looking for help are just looking for simple. They aren’t looking for long, drawn out. If there gets to be too much information or too many big words that go on and on it’ll lose people, or they’ll just skip over it. When I was looking for help half the stuff I’d skip over it,  I’d be having anxiety headaches, really get confused and don’t want to be bothered by it. Simpler would be a lot more help.”
 
 > “This page looks fine if you're OK, have the time to look through this. But when you need help, you can get a more direct answer by putting in direct words into Google and it will come up directly "Veterans counseling number" or the "Veterans Crisis center" or whatever instead of having to read through all this.”
 
 >"And I also seen in the yellow-orange, if you need to talk to someone after hours. If it was evening, and I felt that I couldn't keep my shit together, I would've called that number first.
 
>"It’d be good to move the after-hours phone number[to the top], or make it bigger and in red letters. maybe don't spell out the 'war vets', just the number bigger, for someone having a really hard mental day."
 
 
## Additional Findings

#### 1. Facility photo was important to all participants (information is inferred, assumptions made).

>"handicapped accessible so that's good I work at the VA in Fargo and we have a lot of veterans coming and going and some of them struggle with the with the doors and stuff like that sometimes so  [responds to photo with ramps]"

>"I love it when they post a picture of the building. I'm going to look for this brown building instead of looking for numbers because they're hard to find sometimes. And I get anxious driving in traffic so I like to have the picture in my mind."

#### 2. Veterans thought the font on “On this page” was too small.

#### 3. “Satellite offices” was understood by 8 of 9 participants.

#### 4. Veteran's did not seem to notice or refer to the "Spotlight boxes" for any of the tasks.

#### 5. "Mobile Care Unit" was liked but set the wrong expectation.

> "I’ve learned a lot and I think it’s great that they have a mobile care unit is fabulous if your disabled."

> "Mobile care, if I click there, can I request them to come out and see me?"

> "if you live in remote areas but you have a Mobile care unit. I know people who have taken a bus 3 hours to get to their VA. Some people don't like coming into the city especially if you're an older Veteran."

>"I noticed you have Mobile Care Unit, that's important. That's one of the first things I noticed. [reads] it's mostly for counseling. I don't like going to the city and I'm pretty protective about who I allow on my property. I can understand the density of Atlanta, a facility like this, it looks like an easy to get to location, but again, I'm a hick from the sticks. There's alot of us that don't want to go into the city for services."

#### 6. “Psychology” was selected and understood but disliked by Veterans.

#### 7. Diverse Veteran population representation was valued (homeless, minority, LGBTQ, etc).
>"Seeing all of this gives me hope that the center would do well. I would expect that they can personalize care for different vet cases to cover everybody’s needs. They know its a wide span, all races all colors. As well general health."

>"[hovers over Homeless, LGBTQ, Minority] Pretty good as far as variety of... its not limited or focused on one particular thing, it's really pretty wide and which with the Military community, it's got a huge base and there's alot of things that need to be available. Looks pretty good."

#### 8. Veterans liked seeing group breakouts (no “lumping” of Vets) but also wanted more details.

 > "Depending on the counseling the person is looking for, those should be in my opinion, the indiviual groups, the e.g. Vietnams Veteran groups. To me, I would just start with the Peer group counseling and have the subsets under the peer group counseling. I would expect it to go to who's ever is organizing to running that particular group to be able request access or be able to speak to someone... some sort of contact. "

#### 9. ‘Peer’ didn't resonate within Group counseling taxon name but may work better as a description.

#### 10. ‘Military sexual trauma care’ description needs more sensitivity (“safe”, less group emphasis).

> "From someone that's been through some of the group counseling, I think this really sells it short. I would put something more like support, words that are more... support, peer support group, Confidential individual counseling is good but I don't know if its counseling when its a group. It needs to be conveyed that its a safe place, because people are so intimidated about telling their story in front of other people. It needs to be a safe environment, a confidential environment, you're not the only one, I'm sure there's descriptions out there that wording can be pulled out of. More sensitivity needs to be put into that. I lean towards that because I'm an MST survivor. Again, it's the Peer group counseling one that stands out to me, I think that's important because I think that will get overlooked so much because people are going to be like, "I'm not getting up in front of a bunch of people and telling what happened to me" I did that for years before I agreed to go into a group. Like I said, it was profound, what it did for my health care, my mental health. I'd hate for people to sell it sort because the description seems shoddy or intimidating."

#### 11. Veterans want to be given the right to choose their care (surface Vet Center option on VA websites).

> "I wouldn't have known what a VC was, that they had off...smaller type places you could go for mental health, I just assumed you had to go to the VA hospital. I mentioned it to my psychiatrist and she said, ‘Oh, I should have mentioned that to you.’ I don't know if that's something that they're supposed to mention to the patient and the patient has the option of what they want to do. That wouldn't be on a website anywhere. Like I said, I'd never heard of these and I'm pretty familiar with the VA. [use to work for the VA] I just learned about this a year ago. I don't know how to get the word out to people other than on the VA website. I'm thinking where it has locations maybe there would be under medical centers they would have Vet Centers."

## Recommendations

1. Increase information scent to allow Veterans to understand the page with only a scan.
- 1a. Shorten or replace intro copy, try tags or more scannable descriptors instead
- 1b. reconsider “readjustment counseling centers”
- 1c. Segment services into “Mental health counseling” and “social services” to give the page more context and make the facility’s purpose more scannable
- 1d. consolidate list of services to be more focused and scannable
2. Test “Mental health care” vs “Counseling” taxons on Veterans who have not gone engaged in either.
3. Make it more obvious that this is a small facility with one direct number to call.
4. Reduce height of COVID alert, progressively disclose details and/or reconsider placement.
5. Include more “Prepare for your visit” details in next prototype.
6. Try “Satellite locations” within “Location and contact information”, remove it from “On this page”.
7. Downplay that VC’s are for “transitioning" Veterans. 
8. Give more attention to “Women Veteran Care” service as the likely place a women will explore first.
9. Move call center alert to the top of page for Veterans to see first during off hours.
10. Keep “Satellite” as a way to describe community access points and outstations.
11. Consider increasing the fonts size of “On this page”.
12. Reconsider “Spotlight boxes” or enhance their design to be more interesting.
13. If used, “Mobile Care Unit” should be decoupled from list of services. Try treating it as a modality or as a separate location type with “Satellite office”. 
14. Remove “Psychology” as a Vet Center service. 
15. Keep diverse Veteran population representation but reconsider design to keep service list short.  
16. Consider “Group counseling” as a new taxon and give as much information about who, what, where and how to engage in this service within the accordion.
17. Lose ‘Peer’ in “Peer group counseling” but consider it in describing the concept of groups segmented by affinity that Veterans valued over group therapy that “lumps” all Veterans in the same group.
18. Work with copywriter on ‘Military sexual trauma care’ and all other service taxons/descriptions.
19. Consider cross-promoting Vet Centers from main VA medical facility pages mental health sections.


## Next Steps
