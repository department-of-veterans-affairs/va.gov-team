**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I joined the service in 1982 and stayed for almost 6 years. I spent a portion here in the states and the other portion in West Germany.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

Having MS, I&#39;ve been through all kinds of studies and tests. I had a counselor for a period of time and I&#39;m now seeing a new counselor for \*condition.\*

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would start with a search engine. I would start by trying to find a counselor. I&#39;m on MyHealthyVet so I could also check there too.

- What words would you use to get you this type of information?

If I were just looking for assistance I would probably start with &quot;counselor for \*condition.\*&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

\*scrolled down page until &quot;mental health care.&quot;\* This looks like what I&#39;m looking for. I assume from here there would be a hot link here in the description that I could click on. I would expect the link to take me to whoever is organizing or running the group/counseling that I&#39;m looking for. Or, having some sort of contact info would be expected.

For Mental Health Care it lists quite a few conditions that can be treated, but under the &quot;care we provide at Atlanta Vet Center&quot; it does not list treatment for all of the conditions that are listed above. The individual groups could also have some sub-groups to be a little more specific.

When I open one of these dropdowns, I&#39;d like to see the types of care that are available and a way to reach out to who I&#39;d need to. It would be good to be able to actually communicate with someone to ask questions and make sure I&#39;m set.

Feel free to click around.

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?

**Understanding alternative locations**

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re curious to know if they have other locations.

The way it is set up now is awesome. It gives you the address, contact info, and hours of operation. It means a lot to know that you are going to right place and to be able to get in touch with them easily.

\*clicked &quot;more locations&quot; and was taken to bottom of page. Unable to find the next &quot;more locations&quot; button until 2nd navigation to the bottom of page\* This shows a lot of other locations, this is what I was looking for - Just not where I expected it to be. It&#39;s nice that there is a picture for each center.

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

To me, the Atlanta Vet Center is the main Vet Center, and these others are Vet Centers that are part of something else – like the YMCA center.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

I would assume that the Atlanta Vet Center would have counseling or points of contact to redirect to counseling. It would be a one stop shop for help or information.

**Ready to visit**

Now that you&#39;ve had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re interested in one of their services

- What would your next step be?

Considering the COVID situation, I would try to reach out online first. Hopefully through online contact I could get someone on the phone to hear the requirements for some sort of telehealth or Zoom meeting session.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

The only thing that would stop me from going through my next steps would be if my call is never answered or my emails never get responded to. If they don&#39;t have the time for me, then I&#39;m going to go find somebody else.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center

From what I can see, it looks great. The only improvement would be if the building itself had some sort of identification that it provides veteran services – maybe just a military insignia.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

The website lists a lot of different things that are available here, but I know from experience that not everything works that way. They may need to refer you to other locations. The building looks a little small to host all of what they have listed. Maybe if they included some pictures of the inside of the building to show the different care options it would ease that concern.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

I don&#39;t see much for wheelchair equipment assistance. I&#39;d expect that to either be its own grouping (mobility assistance) or it would be part of one that isn&#39;t listed here.
