**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I joined back in 1981 when I was 21. I served for 3 years, and I got out in Germany. I stayed out for about 2 years until rejoining in Kentucky. I served in the Gulf war.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I first went when I was stationed in Nevada. I was going through a divorce.

- have you participated in any of these services?

(individual therapy)

- how was that experience?

it was really hard to get into the Nevada VA.

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

This is exactly what happened to me in Nevada. I didn&#39;t know how to get in, so I searched for &quot;VA counseling for veterans.&quot;

- What words would you use to get you this type of information?

&quot;VA counseling for veterans&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

If I&#39;m looking for mental health care, no. This page is mostly just about COVID – the info takes up the whole screen. This page looks fine if you have the time to go through it and look around. There&#39;s a lot of information here that is helpful, but if you&#39;re in crisis you would be looking for a quick and easy answer. It would be good if I could get this straight from my Google search. Looking through all of this information would drive me nuts, especially if it is led by the COVID info which already has everyone on edge.

Feel free to click around.

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations

I knew there&#39;d be some info when I clicked on the site, and there&#39;s a lot here. It&#39;s a little bit easier to use than I expected it to be. It&#39;s also all pretty upfront – checkboxes and directions that guide you.

Maybe some civilians won&#39;t understand all of the abbreviations, such as GWOT.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?

**Task #2 - Find Group counseling services**

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re curious about group counseling.

- Is that type of care available here?

\*was able to find group care quickly and without any issues\*

Feel free to click around.

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations

I knew there&#39;d be some info when I clicked on the site, and there&#39;s a lot here. It&#39;s a little bit easier to use than I expected it to be. It&#39;s also all pretty upfront – checkboxes and directions that guide you.

- If no,
  - Where you would expect to see that type of care?
  - Would it go by any other name?
- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click?

**Understanding alternative locations**

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re curious to know if they have other locations.

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

\*understood that the other locations are satellites to the main VA, but did not see the distinction &quot;satellite locations&quot;\* It may be helpful if that gets mentioned 2 pages earlier to let veterans know there could be other options.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

It looks like there is only the one location. \*saw &quot;more locations&quot; at top\* That option is a little small. If I wanted to learn more I would just click on more locations.

**Ready to visit**

Now that you&#39;ve had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re interested in one of their services

- What would your next step be?

I&#39;m not sure if their services are listed here. It has broad categories that I could go through to find the specific care I&#39;m looking for. I don&#39;t search for most of these categories, but it&#39;s good that its all here.

Maybe including parking information would be helpful…\*noticed the parking section\*…you guys thought of it all. This page looks perfect, it&#39;s good. All of the answers are here you just have to look.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

I would use the dropdown to read what information is included on the website. I&#39;d also want to know if I can just go directly to the center, or if I need a referral. I would call to make an appointment if I could. It&#39;s better to be able to do everything online so that I don&#39;t have to call and ask. It would be nice if it (whether referral is needed) was listed in each dropdown for care options.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center

I think it is fabulous. I&#39;ve learned a lot and I think it&#39;s great that they have a mobile option.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

Seeing all of this gives me hope that the center would do well. I would expect that they can personalize care for different vet cases to cover everybody&#39;s needs.
