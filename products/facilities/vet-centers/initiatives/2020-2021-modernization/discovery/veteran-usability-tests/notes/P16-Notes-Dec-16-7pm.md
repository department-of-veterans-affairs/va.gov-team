**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I served in the Air Force. I spent some time in Iraq and Afghanistan. I spent some time in Germany too. Part of what I did was to set up airfields in areas where they were needed.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

Yes, I&#39;ve done one on one counseling for about a year. Now I just go in whenever I decide too. My doctor referred me to it and ever since I go whenever things in life come up.

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I&#39;d probably search for &quot;counseling for veterans.&quot; I know they have the crisis line too.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

Yes. It includes the address, email, and phone number so you can reach out. \*did not look through all dropdowns\* I would call and ask if they have the specific counseling that I&#39;m looking for. \*clicked &quot;benefit counseling&quot; first, then found &quot;mental health counseling&quot;\* I like that it talks about confidentiality too. That&#39;s something that is important to a lot of people.

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

Response: I think it&#39;s pretty good. Maybe the &quot;click on a service for more details&quot; could be more specific to say click the plus sign, or it should be moved over by the plus sign to make it clear where they need to click.

The section about &quot;if you need to talk to someone&quot; (in yellow) should be bigger – and maybe at the top instead of the bottom. It does make sense at the bottom too though. The phone numbers and emails could be a little bigger too.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?

**Task #2 - Find Group counseling services**

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re curious about group counseling.

- Is that type of care available here?

I&#39;m looking through here to see what it says about group counseling – if it says anything. \*clicked &quot;benefit counseling&quot; again before going back to &quot;mental health care&quot;\* It doesn&#39;t explicitly say group therapy but there&#39;s something close. Unless it is &quot;peer group counseling.&quot; I think I would take off the word &quot;peer.&quot; That may confuse some people.

The information is organized well in the dropdowns as the title, a paragraph, and then the list of services.

The parking dropdown is good to have. Some places can be restricted on parking so it&#39;s good to know ahead of time. It&#39;s also good that it even mentions where the ramp is.

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

Response: I might also make the map a little clearer and/or larger. It would also be good to be able to zoom in. I guess they could also use the &quot;get directions&quot; link, that&#39;d be helpful.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click?

**Understanding alternative locations**

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re curious to know if they have other locations.

\*found &quot;more locations&quot; at the bottom of the page\* I think that&#39;s a good feature to have.

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

So the first is the main location and then there are some satellites. The satellites are similar to a VA but probably a bit smaller. It&#39;s good that each of the satellites has the &quot;get directions&quot; link and a phone number. All of the phone numbers are the same though…or most of them are. Maybe it redirects you. The pictures are also really helpful.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

They probably don&#39;t offer as much as the main Vet Center. If they didn&#39;t offer what you needed, then they could probably direct you where to go.

**Ready to visit**

Now that you&#39;ve had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re interested in one of their services

- What would your next step be?

I would make sure they&#39;re open and give them a call.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center

It looks like they offer a lot of services, and it looks like they can probably refer you to a satellite location for anything they can&#39;t do. It doesn&#39;t look like they do anything that is medical related.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

Response: Again, making the phone numbers a little bigger. It&#39;d be good to move the after-hours phone number, or make it bigger and in red letters.

It would be good to make it clear on the Vet Center page that they do not offer medical services. It could be at the top of the page.

- What would prevent you from going to this location?

If I worked a lot of hours or if I heard bad reviews I may not go. Word of mouth would be one of the biggest influencers.
