**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I retired from the Air Force in 1998. I was station all over the place – Germany, Turkey, and state-side.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I have PTSD so I started counseling through the VA about 10 years ago. I was in a structured 12-week program. It had weekly meetings and went well. Afterwards I saw a psychiatrist regularly. I just recently started using a Vet Center because I didn&#39;t realize they had them until recently \*Vet Center client\*. I&#39;m doing a program through them that is meant for moving towards next steps after trauma. My son actually has schizophrenia, so I&#39;m a little familiar with what goes into his treatment as well.

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would search, &quot;VA mental health care.&quot; I think what comes up from that is a little vague. So I would try to specify by my city. I may also include the condition.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

I would probably start by clicking on women veteran care because it might have the most up-to-date info. From there I would click on &quot;PTSD&quot; and look through that information.

Feel free to click around.

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations

What&#39;s there looks good. It has the information that I would need.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?

**Task #2 - Find Group counseling services**

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re curious about group counseling.

- Is that type of care available here?

I&#39;ll click Vet Center. I would want to know what type of group therapy they have and how I can reach out – such as a phone number.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click?

**Understanding alternative locations**

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re curious to know if they have other locations.

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

There are quite a few that just aren&#39;t the main center. They all have town names, so I assume they&#39;re the surrounding area. The Atlanta VA center would probably have more to offer.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

These other ones, the satellite locations, probably don&#39;t have all of the care options. The satellite locations are also probably smaller and have less people on-site.

**Ready to visit**

Now that you&#39;ve had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re interested in one of their services

- What would your next step be?

I would click, &quot;services offered here.&quot; Depending on what I&#39;m looking for, I would go to any particular category to see the info in the dropdown. I see the phone number by the location. I would just call them. They also have an email.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

I would want to know more about what I need to bring. \*saw &quot;prepare for your visit&quot;\* I would click here to figure out what I need.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center

I think everything I would need to know is here. It has all of the information and services listed here.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

It looks like you can get mental health care for a wide range of people/conditions. They also have the homeless care option.

Some of the larger vet centers can take a while to get an appointment with but some of the smaller ones are better about getting you in quickly.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

Everything I think I would need is there. It could be good to have contact names to reach out to, but then again people change positions so often that it may not work.
