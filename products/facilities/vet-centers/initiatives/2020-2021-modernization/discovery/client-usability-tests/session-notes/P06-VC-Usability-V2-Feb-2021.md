**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I served for 8 years in the Navy. I started in Florida and my duty station was in San Diego. I loved the SD area so much that I stayed.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes, I&#39;ve participated in counseling at the VA.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I know there is a VA.gov website. I don&#39;t know if it is for veterans or not but that&#39;s the first place I would go. I would search for &quot;mental health counseling&quot; on their search bar.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

I see on the page it has &quot;counseling services.&quot; This page starts off talking about counseling for PTSD so I would scroll down to either counseling services or referral services. I&#39;m not sure if I would need a referral so I would probably start with counseling services. \*went to dropdowns\* I like the way this is set up. Veterans can just scroll through and click on whatever fits their needs. I love that it is all laid out in categories and that is really helpful for the veteran so that they can select which one they want and be a part of deciding what counseling they need.

If I were to click the bereivment dropdown I would like to have some information about what it might entail and the types of counseling – such as group vs. one-on-one counseling.

My favorite dropdown on here is women veteran care. I&#39;ve had to work with the VA before they had women veteran care available and to now have a place where specifically women can seek care is important. If I were to expand the dropdown I would like to know if I can be seen by a woman doctor. Sometimes if a woman has experienced trauma they may feel more comfortable talking to a female doctor. &quot;Women peers and women doctors.&quot;

I would use the &quot;mental health care&quot; or &quot;PTSD&quot; dropdowns if I were looking for care when I was having a rough time. These dropdowns are well explained and would really help a veteran make an informed choice. \*excited to see the yoga option/availability\*

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations

Over the years I see that the VA has been doing work to take care of veterans and it really touches my heart – I&#39;m grateful for that.

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

By knowing other veterans I know that some people like a lot of information and some people want just enough to figure out what they need. For myself, I like to read. When I go to a website like this, it helps me. I like to be informed so that when I communicate with someone, I have the information I need to do it properly. The way this page is set up is good.

I think the distinction between bereavement and grief is that bereavement is for someone who has experienced a loss – not necessarily a person (loss of marriage or a job), and grief is something that is long lasting and interrupts daily living.

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

I think VA Connections would be for VA health and benefits. It is where a veteran would go if they have not enrolled with the VA. They would go there to see if they are eligible for benefits or if they are seeking healthcare. \*once opened\* This is excellent. These are the major benefits, but I think I would add home loan assistance where a veteran can see if they are eligible for VA housing.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

\*scrolled through dropdowns again until at bottom, then back to top\* Yes, it says &quot;view additional Orlando area locations.&quot; That&#39;s what I would click on. \*once on page\* This is perfect.I like that there is a picture because that helps if someone is going to a center for the first time it is so helpful. It gives them the address which means that they don&#39;t have to go to another site to figure out how to get there.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

These other locations are helpful for veterans who have transportation issues or are located closer to these other Vet Centers. They could go to one of these satellite locations IF it had the services that they need. For those with transportation issues, having closer location will make the difference in them getting care.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

I would expect that they have some counseling and educational services. Also, transitional services, because transitioning back into society can be tough.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

I prefer digital communication so I would reach out that way instead of on the phone – through MY Healthy Vet.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

This page has all I need. I would scroll through and make sure I have all of the information before going to My Healthy Vet.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

Not me, but there are some veterans that re-connect through Vet Centers and VA hospitals with former soldier and colleagues and they like that capability to see old colleagues and friends – so some veterans are biased toward that. Once they get comfortable in one place, especially if its with a particular doctor, they want to keep going there.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

When I think of a Vet Center I think of less expansive care and less specialized. I think of a Vet Center as being more for benefits and mental health. Health care would be for the VA Medical center.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

Nothing comes to mind; the VA programs are growing so I think you can get any of the care you need if you are eligible for it. If there was a hospital or medical center then I would prefer to go there for primary care.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

Having a chat box would be a good asset – especially for the younger veterans who want their information quick, fast, and in a hurry.

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

I would click the search bar.
