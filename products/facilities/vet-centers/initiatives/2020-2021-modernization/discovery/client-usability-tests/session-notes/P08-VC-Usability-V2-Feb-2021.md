**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

26 years active Air Force. I worked flight line. Multiple locations around the world.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes – I&#39;ve used both.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

Until I got involved with the VA, I had no clue where to start. I would try a search on the internet but I&#39;m not that tech savvy.

- Where would you search?

I would search through tri-care first because I have that for retired medical care.

- What words would you use to get you this type of information?

&quot;Mental health&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

The very next thing I would do after landing on this page is to look for contact information so that I can call somebody. I'm not one to look over this, I'd call. I know that you have to be part of these as a member before you can actually go there and get the services. I don't know how it works but, in my mind, I wouldn't think that I can just click on counseling services and talk to somebody. Maybe I&#39;d click on it just to see what it says. \*after clicking\* Okay, I get it. I see that there are the different services offered. From here I would be curious enough to wonder if I can get this care and I&#39;d click either PTSD or mental health care. Most of mine is PTSD related. If I hadn't been diagnosed yet um I would've just tried to find a generality, mental health care.
[what would you have connected with?]
I would have gone down, I'm not that, I'm not that. I can eliminate a majority of these based on my personal issues. I would probably go to mental health care to see if that is elaborated further. I was looking at grief counseling too but based on prior experience I have more prior knowledge and wouldn&#39;t go there.

\*clicked mental health care\* This is exactly why I would click it – to get an idea of what exactly it means. This information fits the category. It gives a phone number here too.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations

I think it is nicely put \*referring to mental health care\*. Under other categories, there could be more specific conditions or types of care needed as it does in the mental health care category.

\*Under PTSD\* I&#39;m not sure I know what &quot;evidence-based treatment&quot; means. I would think that it may mean you have already been diagnosed. Would you want someone walking in if they haven&#39;t already been diagnosed? I assumed you would have to be diagnosed beforehand, but it says you can have same day appointments or walk ins. Maybe it could say &quot;diagnosed or not diagnosed&quot; in parentheses.

I don&#39;t really know what the difference between bereavement and grief is. I don&#39;t know that I truly understand the definition of bereavement vs. grief. You could have one tab that says &quot;grief/bereavement.&quot;

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

VA Connections makes me think that you are already in the system. My first thought is that it would match me up to who I need to talk to in the area. I base a lot of my thoughts on you having to already be a member so this could be a good starting point to do that. They may think that it is just another term for who call. \*once dropdown was opened\* It looks like it is starting to drive a person to that process. You clearly state that a referral is not required – it&#39;s good to see that. I don&#39;t think there is a better title for this dropdown.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

I would do a Google search because I don&#39;t see anywhere on here that says there are other locations. Everything has Google Maps connectivity so I would expect to see a map showing where the other locations are. \*directed to top of page\* If there are multiple then shouldn&#39;t the &quot;Orlando Vet Center&quot; say &quot;Orlando Vet Centers.&quot; I would then click on the map and see which is closest to me and then click on that one. \*directed to additional locations link\* Having each location with an individual address is a lot to look at, especially if there a lot of them. I&#39;d prefer to look at them on a map so that I can see them all at once and figure out which is closest to me.

I like the mobile vet center. It would be good especially for issues that can wait, and you need someone to come to you. Certain health issues will actually be addressed if there is a more convenient option. The mobile ability would give you that option.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

They look like they are fairly decent regional areas. I don&#39;t see a map that shows exactly where they are all. Those who are more faith oriented may feel more inclined to go the to Vet Center that is in the church, so the options are good.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

To me it would be more of a general service. It would probably be more mental health based but also a bit of variety. It may even be one of those cases where you have to be there on a specific day of the week to receive a specific service.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

\*Clicked the &quot;Orlando Vet Center&quot; link\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

I&#39;m always one to try calling first to make sure I am on the right path. I would&#39;ve gone back to the phone number with an idea of what I&#39;m looking for.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

To me, calling is eliminating the unknown. I wouldn&#39;t go through each of these links.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

The only thing that would ever prevent me would be whether I have to already be in the system or not. Although, either way you&#39;re going to have to contact them I would think. There is also the question of how do you know if you&#39;re going to be helped. You may need proof that you served and not everyone has that readily available.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

I think it is very well set up for support. It&#39;s not like you have to go to the big VA Hospital to get care – which is important to a lot of people because they don&#39;t want to go there, especially now with COVID. Just the idea of going to a hospital is enough to prevent people from going. A Vet Center does not sound as dramatic.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

Would you be able to get pharmacy-related service here? To figure it out I&#39;m going back and forth on this page so at this point I would just call and ask.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

I&#39;m not sure but…\*noticed first sentence of page\* okay this is not a medical facility as much as a mental health facility. That&#39;s how I see it.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

I would recommend having a map that shows each of the Vet Center locations in one view.

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

**Things to watch for:**

• How does the participant navigate? Breadcrumb? VA.gov logo?

I would look for a link to the main page, which there isn&#39;t one here \*on more locations page\*. Sometimes you expect to see a link like that at the end of the page – but I can&#39;t say I see that. I would think that the first link there would be one that can take you to the main page. \*directed to click logo\* I wouldn&#39;t expect that to be a link.
