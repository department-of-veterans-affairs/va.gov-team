**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I spent 23 years in the Marine Corps, active duty. My most significant jobs were foreign tours.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I&#39;ve done individual counseling – CBT. I&#39;ve also done tai-chi counseling and vocational job counseling.

- have you participated in any of these services?

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would go to VA.gov and then home in on the closest VA to me.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

The first thing that jumped out at me are the hours of operation because it can be terrible to have to work around taking time off from work. I love the section that says they have non-traditional hours.

I&#39;m trying to find the part where it says, &quot;one on one.&quot; I would expect to se that &quot;mental health care.&quot; \*opened tab\* there&#39;s a lot of stuff on here so I&#39;m just looking around now. For example bereavement and grief – I don&#39;t even know the difference. I&#39;d like to click on the minority veteran care to see what that is about because something we pride ourselves on is that we all wear green, so I&#39;d be interested in what that section is.

I think the suicide prevention care should be at the top rather than in alphabetical order. They have the suicide prevention hotline up there, but it would be good to double stomp it.

One of the challenges when facing a mental health issue is you don't want to say you have mental health issues. So even going to a website like this is a huge step. You don't want to overwhelm someone with too much data when they finally get here. [too much data] Is sometimes not good. [Mod Do you think this page has too much info?] I would say yes. I would put more on subsequent pages. "Like prepare for your visit" Well, I haven't said I want to visit.

It would be good to include the telehealth options here. Especially considering COVID but also in the future for accessibility.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations?

[Regarding mental health care section]  “I mean technically it's true,[laughs] sometimes when you're struggling, it's just a struggle. You don't put labels on it. If you're just struggling with coping – you may think, 'Oh, I'm not depressed. I don't have grief'. Maybe you don't know you have anger. Or trauma. If you're struggling with your day to day activities or having trouble sleeping; I would stick to the symptoms and not the diagnoses. The diagnosis is what they're saying here. The person like me that's too proud to say that he's got anything... you'll want to say other stuff, you know, 'you having trouble keeping relationships?', or yeah, 'sleeping','nightmares','hyper-vigilant or something that's a little dumber downed than that'. I mean that I think is more descriptive.”

I would change the Iraq and Afghanistan, I know those are the big buzz words, but these days people are fighting everywhere. There's people in Syria and Philiphines or Yemen. You don't want someone to not see themselves.

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

I don&#39;t know what VA connections is and I deal with the VA all the time – I&#39;ve got nothing. \*once opened\* Oh I guess I get it. Maybe calling it &quot;Navigating the VA&quot; or &quot;VA navigation assistance&quot; would be better. I don&#39;t think people would necessarily come here for certain benefits; they would probably go straight to the VA instead of a Vet Center. It would also be good to include information on VSOs – &quot;Understanding VSOs.&quot; The 4th bullet doesn&#39;t actually make grammatical sense.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

I would assume that they don&#39;t. \*noticed other locations\* Oh I see now – it would be good to include this on the first page somehow. Maybe by using a map that has dots where each of the locations are. I also wouldn&#39;t refer to this location as the main location. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is the main location because as long as it has what we need then we just want to get there. Calling the first one a main center makes it sound like it has everything but that the others don&#39;t. \*noticed section that explains satellite location services\* It says that they don&#39;t all offer all of the services, but it doesn&#39;t tell you what each one does offer. Which may be the way it should be.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

I clicked the back arrow on my phone \*NOT the VA.gov back button\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

I would prefer to email rather than call. It would be good to have a mailbox there where it is a 24-hour response situation. They could either send you an email back or call you the next morning.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

It could be good to include information about confidentiality. You could add it as a small box by the phone number and email option.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

Nervousness or coping with the stress of talking to someone and explaining yourself. That is why giving people multiple options can be good.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

I honestly thought Vet Center were more for homeless people who wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable going into a large VA hospital. I guess it just means that it is out in the population more than the hospital. \*noticed &quot;how we&#39;re different than medical centers&quot;\* I guess this makes sense; I just didn&#39;t really know it. I would probably put that at the top rather than being the last part of the page. The next dropdown that tells you that you don&#39;t have to be enrolled in the VA is important too.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

I&#39;d click the VA.gov homepage link.

**Things to watch for:**

• How does the participant navigate? Breadcrumb? VA.gov logo?

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?

I&#39;m always a fan of phrasing the symptoms as questions. For example, you could ask &quot;Are you having nightmares? Do you suffer from nervousness? Etc…&quot; to identify symptoms rather than asking about overall diagnosis.
