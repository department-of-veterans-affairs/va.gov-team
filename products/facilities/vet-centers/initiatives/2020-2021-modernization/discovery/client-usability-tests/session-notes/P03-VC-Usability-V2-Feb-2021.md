**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I was in the Navy for 24 years at many different stations. I started as a dental assistant and retired as a chief petty officer in 2005.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

Group counseling, individual counseling, a psychiatrist, and weight loss counseling.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would probably go to Google and search for &quot;counseling services offered by the VA.&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

\*clicks jump link counseling services and manually scrolls down and back up, then notices the spotlight boxes \* I would go to referral services and then open the links for whichever type of care I want to get more information on. [moderator restates one on one counseling prompt] Under &quot;minority veteran care&quot; I would expect to find something educational to explain what minority care is. One of the things that should be there is a description for the COVID vaccine because many minorities don&#39;t want to get it because of things that happened in the past.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

[moderator restates one on one counseling prompt adding the word 'psychology']
I would want to see it under &quot;mental health care.&quot; \*opened the tab\* Something that is missing is &#39;overall mental wellbeing&#39; because that affects our behavior, too. Getting your mind right for everyday life is different than grief or anger or other issues. There are times when counseling would be helpful for day-to-day life.

Veterans come from different backgrounds so it could be good to have faith counselors available too.

It would be good to have a separate tab and separate group for MEN who suffered sexual trauma. Men may be afraid to talk about those situations in a group setting with women or even in a group setting. I would expect to find that as a sub-section of the &quot;intimate partner violence support.&quot;

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

I think &quot;VA connections&quot; would be for referring veterans to other counselors or medical reasons. It may also be where they refer me to VA benefits to get information about benefits that may be available to me. \*after opened\* This makes sense – it tells me how to get specific benefits. I would also like this to tell me how to file for Chapter 35 benefits. I would expect that to be under the appointments section. I think I should be able to view that information without actually making an appointment. I like to do my research before making an appointment. That will let me know if I have more questions before making the appointment. It would be good to be able to click on say &quot;medical benefits&quot; it would give me details as to what is available based on disability ratings. I would use that information to form my questions because I would prefer to sit down with someone and talk to them, but I need to understand what questions I need to ask. Most vets would prefer to talk to someone. I could look over the details of what, for example, chapter 35 is, and then go talk to someone about it. I think labeling the section &quot;VA connections&quot; is exactly how it should be.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

Yes, I would go to where it says, &quot;view additional locations.&quot; I would want to try to find a location that is closest to me. \*after clicking\* I can see this offers a wide variety of options.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

Since they are satellite locations, I would not expect the same extent of treatment. They probably would not have medical treatment, but they may have benefit counseling. I would want to know what the schedule for the mobile Vet Center is and how they operate.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

\*clicked the Orlando Vet Center link\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

I would want to know that my communications are confidential. I see that it says, &quot;We offer confidential help.&quot; I would turn that first paragraph into a mission statement. &quot;Our mission is to offer confidential help for veterans…&quot; The second sentence can be adjusted to say, &quot;our goal is to meet counseling needs such as…&quot; The last sentence could be part of the services offered section or it could be left as it is. I think adjusting it those ways would help catch my eye.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

If I hear something negative from another veteran. If information was leaked or if there are negative reviews. The main thing is customer service – everyone who is on the first line of contact needs to be trained in customer service.

If I knew other veterans in the area, then I would ask them if they have been to the center and how their experience was.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

Going by what I see here, I would say it is an excellent tool for veterans to help them meet their life needs.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

I don&#39;t see anything about nutrition or nutritional information. What about weight loss counseling or nutrition counseling?

I would probably go to this vet center for primary care. I don&#39;t think it would be any different than going to the VA medical hospital.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

I don&#39;t like the text for the introduction. You want something that will catch someone&#39;s eye. I would change the font and spell out veteran – someone may confuse it with being a veterinarian center, especially if they are in crisis.

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

I would click VA.gov home.

**Things to watch for:**

• How does the participant navigate? Breadcrumb? VA.gov logo?

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
