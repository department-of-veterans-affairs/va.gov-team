**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I was in the Navy for 4 years – active duty.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes, with some.

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

They have a mental health department where you can see a counselor if you have depression or anxiety. I know there&#39;s also a suicide prevention hotline that you can call too.

- have you participated in any of these services?

Yes – counseling.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

If I didn&#39;t know anything about the VA, I guess I would go to the VA.gov site to figure out where I can get that information.

Knowing what I know, I wouldn&#39;t go to VA.gov because I know the website can be cumbersome to go through, so I would probably try to go directly through the VA hospital or My Healthy Vet.

- Where would you search?

I would do a Google search for VA.gov.

- What words would you use to get you this type of information?

I guess &quot;mental health&quot; would be the next search term.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

I would look under &quot;counseling services.&quot; I see the hours and phone number. \*opened &quot;Mental health care&quot; I would give that number a call to schedule an appointment. I would also include anxiety with the other terms in this list. I think there is more you can add to the bulleted list, such as anxiety, depression, and other symptoms. The way it is written now makes me think that I have to be an Iraq or Afghanistan veteran or looking for help with anger management. There should be more key words or labels.

Where do I make an appointment? There should be something that just says &quot;Appointments&quot;, but I don&#39;t see that. It has a section that says, &quot;Prepare for your visit.&quot; You may want to make an online option for scheduling appointments. That way you could just schedule it yourself without having to call someone. There should be an explicit call-out for how to make an appointment.

Bereavement is specific and grief is more general. Bereavement would be for a funeral if someone close to you dies. Grief can be over the loss of something more general, such as a job.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

VA Connections seems like it would be for referrals to see a private doctor. \*opened the dropdown\* I was wrong. I would just call this VA appointments and then just also include the information about VA benefits. VA Connections makes me think referrals. Another benefit to add would be for home loans or care for veterans who are homeless.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

\*scrolled to bottom, first. Then back to top and down again until clicking &quot;additional locations&quot; link\* The link is in a good spot and then the first sentence you see tells you that you can go to any other these other Vet Centers. If I could click the VA locations near you link, then I would use that to get one closer to me.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

The Orlando Vet Center would be bigger, and you&#39;d probably be more apt going there. I wouldn&#39;t mind going to a satellite location, but the main center probably has more people is a better facility.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

Not much. I think the Vet Centers are more for helping with claims and small things. The Vet Center&#39;s resources are smaller, too. I know that if I have a broken arm, I can&#39;t go to the Vet Center.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

Ideally, I would make an appointment. I would call the main number and make an appointment.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

I know it can be hard to initially get in touch with the therapist. You have to call the operator who sends you down the wire until the therapist is ready/available. Having the online option would allow for you to make an appointment without having to get through to the therapist.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

Its okay for a Vet Center. It would be good if a Vet Center could give more information for claims, but for what they do I guess it is okay.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

Counseling or information for claims/benefits.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

I could not go to a Vet Center for anything medical-related.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

The page does convey what a Vet Center is and what they do, but I think it makes Vet Centers seem like they can do more than they can and more quickly/immediately than usually happens. It may be good to temper veterans&#39; expectations to understand that they&#39;ll need to go in and make an appointment and work through the bureaucracy.

Having the option to schedule appointments online would be good and it is always helpful to include as much information as possible to relieve the stress on the Vet Center – because they are not overly-staffed and get a lot of the same questions from people.

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?
