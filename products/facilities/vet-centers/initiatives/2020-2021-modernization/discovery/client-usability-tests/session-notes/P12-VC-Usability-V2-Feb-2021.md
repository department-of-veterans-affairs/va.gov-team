**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I joined the Air Force in 1962. I served for 23 years. I was an aircraft mechanic and later went into computer systems administration and went on the earn a degree is systems engineering.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes. I participate in mental health services.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would probably Google, &quot;Veterans administration help&quot; or &quot;Veterans administration phone number&quot; or &quot;Veterans administration mental health.&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

This page is LONG. That happens to be a pet peeve of mine – VA pages tend to be that way. The information is in a good order, but some of the information could be linked to other pages so that a veteran can skip over what they don&#39;t need to see without having to scroll through it. For example: the hours could be linked to another page.

I assume I can get care there. I see where it says &quot;prepare for your visit&quot; so I assume you can get this care there, but I don&#39;t see where to get it set up \*(to make an appointment)\* 
[moderator restates prompt, asking user to assume they don't know yet if they want to make an appt but ooking for info first]
I see counseling services... [reads off services] I'm not any of the others so mental health must be what I want \*opened Mental Health Care dropdown\* It took me a while to read through all of the information and it took a little while – I&#39;m a slow reader. The phone number is what I&#39;m looking for and that is at the bottom there. This gives a good description but there is also a fine line between having every type of care and the details of it vs. just the basic information that is easy to get through.

The bullet that lists a specialty group for Iraq and Afghanistan calls out the younger groups, but it has passed by the Vietnam veterans. It can make us feel left out.

The term anger management is interesting to me – I&#39;m much better about it now, but that used to be a big problem for me. Survivors Guilt is a good term that you can use to tie into that because it is a layman&#39;s term that a lot of people are dealing with.

I&#39;m personally glad to see the &quot;intimate partner violence support&quot; dropdown. Same for the LGBT Veteran care. Those are good to have and are problems in the world, but I personally know some veterans who would take offense to seeing that. I&#39;m also glad to see the women&#39;s care, MST, and minority care.

The &quot;What are Vet Centers&quot; dropdown is good to have – I had to learn about it.

I&#39;m very impressed with the page, somebody put a lot of work into it. My comment about length is still valid.

The word Bereavement is very emotional and brings back the names of the people you&#39;re grieving over. I think that is good, that is what you are looking for because it will get a veteran o click the dropdown to see what the care is.

Vocational rehab is a good section to have. The title does a good job conveying what it is.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

Its going to one of 2 things. It will either be a list of local or nearby VA centers that I can go to or it could a part of the new outreach program where the VA is using other hospitals and doctors for care. \*opened dropdown, read the entire section\* I&#39;d like to know about benefits and help but not forms.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

&quot;Community outreach&quot; \*dropdown\* makes me think this has other locations.

The Orlando VA is one location and I assume there are other VA locations near by but I don&#39;t think they are part of the Orland center. There is nothing that makes me think there are other locations that are part of the Orlando VA. \*realized the page is for the Orlando VET CENTER and not a VA hospital…then clicked &quot;other locations tab&quot;\* This specifically explains that there are other locations that are part of the Orlando Vet Center. Vet Center is a term that has a very specific meaning – I know what Vet Centers are, but many people do not. \*explained difference by size of facility\* After looking at these locations I realize that these Vet Centers are not full hospitals, but rather small suites which means they won&#39;t be able to do as much. Every hospital can do certain things to provide care, such as fix a broken leg or deliver a baby – what do a Vet Centers do that is equivalent? I don&#39;t know.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

\*used back button on web browser\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

I would drive by the building since it is so close. I would also call before going in.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

Are they real doctors? In this case it doesn&#39;t mean a doctor with a PhD and years and years of school – in this case it is someone who knows what they are doing and are competent enough to do right. The doctors are not volunteers who are good intentioned but not knowledgeable enough to give care. I&#39;m not sure who I will be talking to, whether they are knowledgeable or dingbats, so I will have to determine that over the phone before going in. I&#39;d start by telling them my name and what I&#39;m looking for in terms of care to see what they say back.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

It is a government agency. It is a small group of people – somewhere between 1 and 25. It is probably trying to do some good in the world, but just because you are a government agency does not mean that you are doing good for the world. I don&#39;t know what I think of the center until I get there.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

**Things to watch for:**

• How does the participant navigate? Breadcrumb? VA.gov logo?

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?

The outreach program that the VA is trying to set up and make work – for the homeless, marginal, and depressed/suicidal veterans – is a great initiative and I&#39;m glad that they are trying to do it, but it isn&#39;t working quite yet. An example of things that you may not think of: sometimes I need to use text-to-voice and certain pages won&#39;t allow me to do it.
