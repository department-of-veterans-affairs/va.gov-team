# Vet Center branding secondary research synthesis

From [Vet Center 2.0 Initiative ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/17661): There is a desire for Vet Center pages to be visually distinct from VAMC pages.
- Although Vet Centers are under VHA, they have a distinct identity as a warm, welcoming,
nonclinical front door to the VA. RCS has asked for consideration of the brand colors and logo.
- More photos are commonly requested as a method to better convey the difference in the
services and activities available. ([Relevant ticket for this work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/15718))
- A CLP is planned to replace [legacy high level Vet Center pages](https://www.vetcenter.va.gov/) and we may need to connect the
dots between facility pages and main RCS presence.
- Add reusable Q&As to Vet Centers. ([Relevant ticket for this work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/15157))

## Past research
1. When looking at Vet Center pages, most Veterans thought they were looking at a medical
facility’s website.
     - Findings from [Vet Center Product Usability Study - V2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/initiatives/2020-2021-modernization/discovery/client-usability-tests/Vet-Centers-Usability-V2-Research-Findings.pdf), Feb 2021:
          - Most Veterans thought they were looking at a medical facility’s website.
          - Veterans continue to equate “Referral services” with “getting a doctor's
referral”. This may be perpetuating the notional that this is a medical facility.
2. Vet Centers aren’t well known among Veterans. Clients of Vet Centers expressed being
“separate from VA” as a key benefit of Vet Centers.
     - Findings from [Vet Center - Client Interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/initiatives/2020-2021-modernization/discovery/veteran-interviews/research-findings.md), October 2020
          - Vet Centers are not well known among Veterans.
          - Clients had a favorable view of Vet Centers.
          - Clients expressed being “separate from VA” as a key benefit of Vet Centers
          - Clients value the Veteran to Veteran approach to counseling, outreach and
staffing of Vet Centers
3. Outreach Specialists identified the most used services at Vet Centers. The geographical reach of
Vet Centers is powerful, but not easy to communicate.
     - Findings from [Outreach Specialist Interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/initiatives/2020-2021-modernization/discovery/outreach-specialist-interviews/research-findings.md), September 2020
          - Individual counseling, groups and referral services were rated as the top three
most used services at their Vet Centers.
          - Referral to external services is as important as those provided by a Vet Center.
          - The potential geographical reach of a Vet Center is powerful but not easy to
communicate today.
          - Vet Center staff are often veterans themselves.
4. Vet Centers could increase efforts to promote its distinguishing qualities, such as having
individualized treatment plans.
     - Findings from the [Vet Center Brand Analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/801e368b7d65df9496b6381c6ad423e37a7d0a1c/products/facilities/vet-centers/initiatives/2020-2021-modernization/VetCenters_BrandAnalysisReport_03272020.pdf#L2), March 2020
          - The variety of services and individualized treatment plans are largely recognized
for being unique and distinguishing qualities of Vet Centers.
          - Often confused with VA medical centers and CBOCs, Vet Centers have not yet
established themselves as an entity distinct from VA.
          - Vet Centers could increase efforts to promote its most distinguishing and highly
praised qualities, which are often unknown to different stakeholder groups.
5. Editors experience friction around adding images.
     - Findings from [CMS Editor Qualitative Research Meta-Analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/meta-analysis.md), April 2023
          - Editors report the process for uploading images to be confusing and lacking.
They want more flexibility with adding images to text areas as well as adding
captions to images. They are also displeased with how the cropping feature
works as it isn’t in line with how they expect it to work.
6. (Potentially irrelevant to Vet Centers but is another example of a service co-branching with VA.)
MHV co-brands with the VA and recommended to not use MHV branding during the initial
launch.
     - Findings from [VA Mobile App Co-branding Research with MHV](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/47), Dec 2021
          - With the exception to Rx Refill , MHV branding does not impact Veterans'
expectations about features in the Mobile App
          - “All other things being equal, we would not recommend using MHV branding
during the initial launch. We think this will reduce opportunities for
disappointed Veterans.”

## Knowledge gaps
No knowledge gaps were identified that would prevent work from starting.

## Other takeaways to consider
- Past research supports the following:
     - Consider adding Vet Center branding to pages to help differentiate them form VAMCs.
     - Consider making content changes to Vet Center pages to better emphasize the
difference between Vet Centers and VAMCs. For example, changing the “Referral
services” header.
     - Consider adding reusable Q&As to Vet Centers and reviewing the current content. The
content is in the “How Vet Centers are different from a clinic” section and may be
modified to better emphasize the difference between Vet Centers and VAMCs.
     - Consider adding more photos to Vet Center pages. Editor-facing research could be
conducted to get feedback on any improvements to the image uploading process.
