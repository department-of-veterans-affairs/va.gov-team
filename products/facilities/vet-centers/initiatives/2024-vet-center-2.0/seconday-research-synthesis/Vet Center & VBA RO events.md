# Vet Center & VBA RO events secondary research synthesis

From [Vet Center 2.0 Initiative ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/17661): Design needs to support the addition of event functionality.
- These pages have no left nav menu. How might we make events discoverable on these pages?
- Vet Center and VBA editors may use events very differently than VAMC editors.
- Consider adding filtering to events search.

## Past research
- Veterans desire more event filters.
     - Finding from [Medallia feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/outreach-events/research/2023-medallia-feedback/outreach-events-medallia-summary.png), 2023:
          - Veterans want location and event type filters.
- Veterans are able to use the current filters on the Outreach & Events search, but desire more.
     - Findings from the [Outreach & Events usability research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/outreach-events/research/2021-filtering-recurring-events/research-findings.md), Nov 2021:
          - Participants had success using the Apply Filter button and Date entry view
dropdown
          - Participants had issues using the Next week and Next month filter options. They
felt that the Date filter wasn’t enough

## Knowledge gaps
- There isn’t a clear understanding of how Vet Centers and VBA Regional Offices would use
events.
     - Questions:
          - What events do Vet Centers and VBA Regional Offices have?
          - Are these events different than VAMCs?
          - Do satellite locations and mobile Vet Centers have different event needs than
regular Vet Centers?
     - Potential research:
         - Some discovery work has been started in [Initiative - Events for Vet Centers ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/12926)    
         - Audit current events on Vet Center and VBA (legacy site) pages. This work was
started during a [VBA Regional Office audit](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/vagov6717/1660588245137/17e30f1f578bfeb51b90c051e7f5124e57a835e5?sender=u01810f3edbfc878c08be5925).
         - Use Vet Center hours to ask about their event needs

## Other takeaways to consider
- Past research supports the following:
     - Consider adding more filters when adding events. Additional filters could be tested
during usability testing with a prototype. If additional filters test well, they can be added
to the Outreach & Events search as well.
- No past research, but no knowledge gaps preventing this:
     - Consider adding left nav to Vet Center and VBA pages to support events.
