## Project recap
### MVP
- Prior to the 2020-2021 modernization initiative, Vet Centers did not have an online presence beyond the minimal information found on the Facility Detail pages within Facility Locator. Staff relied on the partnership and social media accounts (etc) of community partners or Public Affairs Officers at VA Medical Centers to promote activities.
- MVP Vet Center pages were intentionally very lean to avoid overwhelming staff who were new to the role of web editors.
- Scope for the modernization initiative
   - establish Veteran-facing taxonomy for Vet Center services
   - design and build new front-end VA Vet Center facility pages focused on locations and services
   - develop national and local content maintenance capabilities
   - train VA local and national staff to create and maintain content.
- The first pages were published in 7/14/2021. The national roll-out was completed on 1/27/2023.
- More information about this initiative is available in the [2020-2021 modernization product folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/initiatives/2020-2021-modernization).

### Project rationale for Vet Centers 2.0
- Vet Center pages have not been updated in any meaningful way since the national roll-out was completed.
- Vet Center editors and leadership continue to request access to features and enhancements which had been considered out of scope for MVP.
- We have not been able to iterate on these pages due to competing priorities and limitations caused by the content build.
- As of April 2024, with Accelerated publishing nearly production ready, we can begin planning Vet Center 2.0, beginning with design.

## Scope and Scale
_What's in and what's out?_

The following features are most needed in this iteration but may be rolled out as separate enhancements (_prioritization to be informed by design and engineering_)
**In Scope**
)_updated 4/16/2024_
- Look/feel distinct from VAMC pages
- IA/secondary navigation to support individual pages for Satellite locations ( Draft IA for Vet Centers 2.0 #17195)
- IA/secondary navigation to support discoverability for events (Draft IA for Vet Centers 2.0 #17195)
- Prominent link to Salesforce intake form
- Increased visibility of link to Locations page
- Implementation of reusable Q/A,if possible

**Not in Scope**
_updated 4/16/2024_
- Event design/enhancements (owned by PW)
- Integration with Salesforce platform
- Reorganization of services
- Multiple photos
- CLP content
- Other suggestions in the Vet Center enhancement epic

### Not in scope
We do not expect to act on complete list of requests and ideas listed in [Enhancements/optional features for Vet Centers #15712](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sitewide-facilities-639f5253e4b702a32376339e/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/15712). The epic is simply a place to hold ideas and suggestions which did not necessarily have a validated business need or technical feasibility. 

## Measuring success
**Options for measuring Veteran-facing outcomes**
- Increased customer satisfaction and experience scores over MVP level (baselines available in [analytics folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/analytics/2024-vet-center-data.md#user-surveys))
- Number of Intake forms initiated through Vet Center pages
- Click through rates for event details initiated from Vet Center pages
- Number of services associated with Outstations

**Options for measuring internal editor outcomes**
- Increased Vet Center editor satisfaction (baseline metrics pending via CMS editors Views survey)
- Vet Center editor engagement (measured by CMS access rates ([Vet Center editor access baselines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/analytics/2024-vet-center-data.md#vet-center-editor-stats))

## Dependencies and risk factors
_Are other features dependent on this one? What do we need from partners? What do we need outside of engineering? What factors may limit our ability to be successful?_

- Technical ability to integrate with Salesforce intake form 
- Sitewide Facilities capacity and competing priorities
- Lighthouse capacity to support discoverability efforts

## Definition of Done
