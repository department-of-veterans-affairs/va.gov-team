# VA Vet Center Facility Product

This is the new VA.gov facility product for VA's Vet Centers.

- VHA runs 300 Vet Centers
- Vet Centers are stand-alone facilities; they are not integrated into VAMC health care systems
- Veterans do not need to be enrolled in VA health care to receive care from a Vet Center

**Business partner:**

- Jessica Schiefer, VHA Vet Center Communications Officer (Jessica.Schiefer@va.gov)

## What we need to do

- Research, design, and write new content for "Prepare for your visit" section
- Research, design, and write new VHA Vet Center services taxonomy
- Research, design, and write (first draft/pilot) local facility content for each Vet Center service
- Build Vet Center facilities in Drupal
- Build VHA Vet Center services taxonomy in Drupal, and integrate into the Facilities API
- Build and publish new front-end VA Vet Center facility product
- Research, design, and write new content for new facility products

## Old/legacy Vet Center websites

We need to reach parity with our new Vet Center products so we can turn off all the old sites.

- Vet Center program site: https://www.vetcenter.va.gov/
- Facility Locator facility detail page: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0201V

Vet Centers do not have their own facility detail pages outside the Faciltiy Locator tool.

## Assumptions and early discussions

- Vet Centers form a lot of partnerships with local community groups, so they need an Events section to highlight and promote events
- Vet Centers are an under-utilized and -promoted benefit/service for Veterans, so we will need to explain the value proposition of a Vet Center in our content design
- We need to design a Make An Appointment page that applies to all Vet Centers
- We need to design a Connect With A Counselor Now page that applies to all Vet Centers
