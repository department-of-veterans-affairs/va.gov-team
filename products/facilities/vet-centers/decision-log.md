## Vet Center Decision Log 

### Vet Center MVP decisions

The following were considered but rejected for MVP

| Content area | Rationale |
| ------- | -------- |
| Staff Profiles | Level of effort to maintain locally, challenge presented by inaccurate profiles |
| Events | Not all events are open to all clients or to new/potential clients |
| Social Media | Historically has not been allowed |
| Stories | Level of effort to maintain locally |
| Spanish translation | Will need to consider for full roll-out |
| Tagline | Potential for abuse with "branding", has been removed across VA.gov, needs input from Design Council | 
| Facility operating status for CAP | not in VAST, challenges with maintaining, need to determine how to display and communicate to Veterans |

### Vet Center taxonomy and language decisions

| Date | Decision |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1/6/2021 | We do not want to restrict list of services (ie: Psychology) available for use by Vet Centers but will want to encourage use of default list (TBD) |
| 1/6/2021 | Group counseling will be handled as a modality rather than a service taxon of its own |
| 1/6/2021 | De-emphasize "transitioning" as this alientates Veterans who aren't recently separated yet still access services |
| 1/6/2021 | Need segmentation of services for scannability | 
| 1/6/2021 | Mobile Vet Center as "other location" rather than service (was misunderstood in testing) |
| 1/6/2021 | No email will be featured as there is no centralized email |
| 1/6/2021 | "Satellite" tested well as label rather than CAP |
| 1/26/2021 | Grief counseling and bereavement counseling will be two separate categories. Bereavement counseling is offered to family members who experience an active duty death only. Grief counseling is offered to any eligible client who is experiencing grief (of any type : death of a loved one, natural disaster, etc) |
| 1/26/2021 | Vet Center services will include services provided by community partners, if they are offered within the physical location | 


### Other Vet Center product decisions

| Date | Decision |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1/6/2021 | After hours call center informs Vet Center (within 24 hours) of a Veteran's call and provides the Vet Center with the Veteran's contact info and supplies the Vet Center info to the Veteran. However, if the Veteran reaches the Call center during business hours, there is no warm handoff to the Vet Center. This understanding will influence our placement of Call Center phone numbers/CTA. |
| 1/6/2021 | We will seek ways to connect to Vet Center services within the accordions of VAMC health services but not to the VAMC from Vet Center page. This is to avoid additional confusion about the differences between a Vet Cente and a VAMC. |
| 1/6/2021 | Vet Center pages will use same alert style as VAMC but can be dismissable. No need to include in future prototypes for research |
| 1/6/2021 | We do not want to restrict list of services (ie: Psychology) available for use by Vet Centers but will want to encourage use of default list (TBD) |
