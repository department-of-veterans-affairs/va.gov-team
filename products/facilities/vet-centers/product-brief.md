## Vet Center Foundational information

### User Journey
- Vet Centers are community-based counseling centers that provide a wide range of counseling, outreach, and referral services to eligible Veterans, active duty service members,  and their families. 
- Vet Centers guide Veterans and their families through many of the major adjustments in lifestyle that often occur after a Veteran returns from combat. 
- Vet Center benefits never expire so Veterans can be engaged in services off/on or continuously throughout the journey. 

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*
- As a Veteran, I need to search for services so that I can successfully transition from military to civilian life or find assistance after a traumatic event.
- As a family member of an active duty service member, I need to find supportive services for issues related to my loved one's military experience. 

### What constitutes a Vet Center?
- VHA runs ~300 Vet Centers 
  - Vet Centers are stand-alone facilities; they are not integrated into VAMC health care systems
- Vet Centers may have an Outstation (included in VAST). 18 exist, small physical locations, like Vet Centers
- Vet Centers may have one or more Community Access Points (CAPS), not in VAST. Donated space at community partners. Approx 1000 exist
- Approx 83 Mobile Vet Centers (MVC) which are used for outreach and community disasters
- Veterans do not need to be enrolled in VA health care to receive care from a Vet Center
- Vet Centers also serve Veterans not eligible for other VA services (e.g. less than honorable discharge) and may serve the families of existing, active-duty service men and women who are deployed
- Services that Vet Centers offer can be similar to those offered at a Medical Center but the way in which the service is provided may be very different (e.g. Group therapy, Equestrian Therapy, no ability to prescribe medication)

- Individual and group counseling for Veterans, service members, and their families

### How do services get accessed?

- Can they have relationships with multiple Vet Centers?
- Are services underutilized?

## Project Rationale
_Why should this project be a priority?_ 
- In addition to 300 stand-alone (not integrated into VAMC health care systems) Vet Centers, the VHA runs 
  - ~ 18 outstations (small physical locations, like Vet Centers)
  - ~ 1000 community access points (donated space at community partners
  - 83 Mobile Vet Centers (MVC) which are used for outreach and community disasters
- Vet Centers are under-utilized and under-promoted benefit/service for Veterans, even through they are often the first touchpoint an active service member and/or family has with the VA.
- Outreach coordinators at each Vet Center are tasked with creating awareness/promotion about the services in their community.

## Measuring success

**Options for measuring success**
- SEO optimization, search results rankings
- Increased phone calls of Vet Centers (call to action?)
- Decreased conflation of Vet Center = VA Clinic (possibly through phone calls?)
- Increased utilization of Vet Center services (?)
- Increased understanding of Vet Center services (scroll depth, expansion)
- Rank in Google search
- **Verified contacts/month (currently exists Vet Center) -> considered most valuable by Outreach Specialists** 
   - (in-bound) Referral source is tracked nationally (how did you hear of us?) (NSS)
   - Not all Vet Centers capture call data (can be standardized)
