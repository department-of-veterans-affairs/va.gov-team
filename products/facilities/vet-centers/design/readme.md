# VA Vet Center Facility Product Design 


## 2022


## (2020-2021)

### Summary: 
Upgraded Vet Center product pages launched as an MVP design largely following the VAMC template with minimal deviation. This will allow the Facilities team to work with editors to uncover opportunities and painpoints with the current template. The **design does not address** most of the problems uncovered during discovery. The most significant findings that remained consistent throughout the 4 studies conducted yet unsolved with the current design are: 

- **Awareness:** Vet Centers are not well known among Veterans 
- **Positioning:** 8 of 8 clients interviewed had a favorable view of Vet Centers and of those 7 expressed being “separate from VA” as a key benefit of Vet Centers. 

The final usability study conducted showed that the current design actually confuses Veterans into thinking that it is a medical facility. Many assumed that they could go there for primary care which is untrue.
