### Feedback & Outcomes

#### Design Intent Collaboration Meeting:
Meeting date: 09/18/2020  
Attendees: Leyda Hughes, Dave Conlon, Michelle Middaugh, Meg Peters, Ryan Thurlwell, Emily Waggoner, Jennifer Strickland, Trevor Pierce, Mikki Northuis, Peggy Gannon, Tze Lei 

Outcomes: Recommendations from team
- General: 
    - Consider: Do qualitative research with Veterans before testing design ideas
    - Consider: Communicate tone via language (not just imagery)
- IA: 
    - Consider: if subpages, how that affects breadcrumbs, etc
- Content:
    - Consider: Min required vs max content
    - Consider: Nat'l vs local areas (provide tight parameters for Drupal)
- Design: [#20140](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/20140)
    - Should: Flesh out mobile designs (how do horizontal rows of compnenents fare)
    - Consider: right aligning images instead of left aligning to avoid any awkward alignments
    - Consider: “featured story” for the horizontal groups of 3 across the page
    - Consider: 'On this page' component OR left nav from VAMC 
    - Consider: Photo descriptions for non-sighted
- Accessibility: [#13728](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/13729#issuecomment-696659540)
    - Must: Flesh out mobile designs to clarify hierarchy 
    - Should: Consider load times with imagery, load progressively (e.g. cellular connectivity)
    - Should: Establish performance budget
    - Consider: Accordions - Caution with burying rich keywords (load times, seo, screenreaders), try tables, columns
    - Consider: Events - add an ics to add to calendar or easily share
    - Consider: Use microdata and/or json-ld to improve SEO, smart google results (address, hours, maps) 
    - Consider: 'On this page' component 
    - Consider: Explore visual transitional cues (e.g. background color change from section to section)
