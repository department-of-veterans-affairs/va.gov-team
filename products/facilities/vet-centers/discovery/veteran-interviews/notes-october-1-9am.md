VC = Vet Center

Helicopter pilot 1967
Vietnam
Training officer
Lawyer
In Marines till 1972

Goes to Jesse Brown Center - med ctr in Chicago - since Jan. 

VC is any place veterans get serviced. 

Hines is the big VC west of us.

Not familiar with VC landing. 

Is familiar with VA.gov hp. 

Looking at VC landing… Has main phone number for VCs. 

Has friends in neighborhood who go to Hines for counseling, and and Jesse Brown, he thinks. 

B4 COVID, was going to start the Move program. Lost 100 lbs in last 6 mos. The program would’ve taken place at Jesse Brown. 

Readjustment counseling - “I sincerely wish we had that 50 yrs ago. … It was very hard to come back from a combat zone into real life.” I was very hard on ppl, especially my wife.

Has hearing loss. 

He is almost 76. Burials are coming — I am 76. 

Went thru left nav. 

Mentioned eligibility while looking at VC landing. 

Stunned at the number of suicides. “I don’t understand it, honestly.” Nobody I know who was a combat veteran has committed suicide, to my knowledge. Surprised that it’s 20% this year. 

Looked at VC Eligibility page… 

Thinks he qualifies under the first bullet — active duty in combat theater. Read footnote, then was sure. 

Tripped up on last bullet — not sure about it.
> * Vietnam Era Veterans who have accessed care at a Vet Center prior to January 2, 2013.

Is getting a flu shot accessing care?

Wife’s eligibly should I predecease her?

Outreach page — could not tell if his wife is eligible. 

I’m glad to know these things exist, these resources for vets. Likes everything on the VC landing page. 

Did not know of  any MST when I was serving. 

Looked at Find VA Locations page… 
60630 is ZIP code. 

Evanston Mobile VC is in results. He could go there, but he thinks his choice would be to go to Forest Park. His daughter works as a “police person” there. 

Looked at Forest Park VC detail page… 
Likes the services they have and referral to other VA svcs — “that’s a broad range.” 

Wd call b4 going bc of COVID. 

“I don’t necessarily need any of those things at this point, but you never know.”

Saw group counseling for PTSD. Hates to admit he has it, and all his buddies do. Hasn’t had any problems for 10 yrs. 

Saw grief counseling. Possible he’d look at individual and group counseling at some point, but not today. 

Wd call and ask — “here is my problem.” 

Caretaking things — that could be helpful. 

“I know where to go for health care.” Likes docs at Jesse Brown. They treat vets very, very, very well. Wd ask doc for medical referrals. 

Imagined having just left the service…
Problems wd be from being in a combat zone. Conscientious objectors — that kind of thing affected him more than he wd admit — but he’ll admit it now. 

Only med ctr I knew about back then was Hines. A lot of my buddies went there for wounds and psychological care. 

What would you search for? 
“I wd start with the Veterans Administration.” Has a buddy who is a VBA svc officer for 25 yrs. “I wd call him.” “On my own, I wd search for /veterans assistance/. “ Wd go to VA.gov and look for counseling (for example), and see what they would say. 

“Vet Centers”
“I just assumed it was a medical situation.” 

“I wd search the VA site for whatever my problem was, and I think I would get to this [VC detail page] pretty fast.”

Ppl now realize that veterans have problems from serving. Hand to hand combat, etc. 

Thinks his buddies wd go to Hines for any help. 

He was a public defender. Defended someone (a decorated Marine) who wasn’t getting help fast enough and pulled out a weapon. Fortunately the judge was a veteran, and we got him help. 

Marine Corps - “We were basically invincible. I turned out to be, but my buddies were not.”

Lot more of my buddies have died in their 50s of Agent Orange than I thought. 

Knew a woman whose husband had Gulf War Syndrome. 

Today more ppl realize veterans need help. Seems like some vets also are better about getting help. 

Marines are going to say “I’m fine, I’m fine, I’m fine, when they’re /not/.”

Looked at VC detail page…

It doesn’t say to me:
* “You men and women may have problems… We want to help you. We want you to come in. Don’t wait.”
* “I doesn’t say to me, you know you have problems. get in here and let’s talk about it so we can resolve them.”

Does not like to go to docs, to stop and ask for directions. “The American male — and especially combat vets — they feel they can do anything, and they don’t ask for help. … Sometimes they don’t want to admit they need help.”

My Cub Scout leaders were WWII veterans. “They had it far worse than I did on a much more massive combat scale, so why wd I ask for help?”

Are there words that wd resonate for group counseling (on VC detail page)?
“I don’t know what you wd say bc the problems can be across a broad spectrum.”

“Like anything else, the 1st time might not be great bc you don’t know how to deal with it. But as the seeds are planted, it works out.” This was true of a lot of his buddies. 

Wondering if the words on the VC detail page are words that wd entice me to go. 

Some ppl have problems b4 they go into the svc and those problems get worse after the svc — small % of ppl. 

Just want to say, “Get in here.” 

Buckets of services? 
“Some ppl don’t want to be marked as PTSD.” I don’t see that I understand that to be a leading cause of counseling. 

Thinks he did know these svcs existed. “I knew there were standalone Veteran Centers, but I always thought they were medical centers.”

How wd you want to be informed? 
Thinks his buddies knew about VCs. He had the problems and resolved them on his own. Was aware this kind of help was available but never asked for it. Seems unsure whether it was available 50 yrs ago. 

Belongs to a lot of vets orgs. Gets lot of emails referring to these problems. Sees contacts. 

Possible he would use something like this if he thought he needed it. Also he wd be able to tell others about VCs. But also he’s close to his buddy who works for VBA / VSO. 

“I think the VA in my experience does a terrific job.”
