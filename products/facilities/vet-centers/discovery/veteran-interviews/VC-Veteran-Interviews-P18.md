**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? Basically I enlisted under the delayed enlisted service in 75 and I didn&#39;t ship until May of 76. I enlisted as a infantrymen, I was sent to fort Leonard Wood then ft Benning , GA. My first duty station was Texas because I was enlisted under bonus program. I was assigned to the unit and it was due to route to the brigade 75 in Germany for 6 months with the German army. I came out then went back to ft hood, I meet my wife there and left there to go to Germany. Then left Germany in 1980 to get out of the service to reunite with my wife. Then reenlisted in 1981 and went to ft Knox and then assigned to Korea and then they sent me to Ft louis. I did my time there and changed my MOS to a mechanic and was sent to CO, before that I was at ft Knox for school then to co. Then I went to IL and did my time and went back to Germany. Not a month later the Gulf war broke out and I was sent to Sadia Rabia, Kuwait, and Iraq. After that I went back to Germany then I got a bonus to get out of the service and I cam to IN and I have been here since.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? Yes, shortly after I got here I was having issues with the war and I went to the vet center.
  - If no, see &quot;Contingency Plan&quot;
- How did you first learn about them? My wife did the digging for the vet centers then for the VA. She got me involved and I started going to counseling and shortly after I went to the VA for counseling. Then everything got to much as far as PTSD and driving and going off on people due to my PTSD so I don&#39;t drive and I don&#39;t go to the vet center anymore but I still go to the VA for PTSD group and I get individual counseling and medication. The va isn&#39;t close but that is another story in itself. The vet center was really close but they didn&#39;t stay there for long and moved it further away and then they moved it right across from the VA.
- How long ago: 1996 for 10-15 years then I stopped going.
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center?
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center? My wife called and got the address and we drove by it and she took me to it.
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way? Not really unless they have pickup transportation.

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer? They had activities like taking the group out. While I was there they went on a trip to the wall in DC, they had a picnic at the lake and the guys went fishing that one was good. They had different activities. I didn&#39;t go to DC because I have issue sin my personal life and it would have interfered with it.
- Can you tell me a little about the services, activities, or resources you&#39;ve taken part of? The counselor at the vet center then you have a therapist but the VA says you can&#39;t have two therapists because they contradict each other.
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time? The group was always as a group and it was weekly and individual was scheduled with the social worker there it was like once out of the month.
- Start with one and move into the other: I started with the counseling first and then they asked me if I wanted to try group. I gave it a shot and liked it so I kept going.
- If you had to rank the different things offered at a Vet Center in order of importance  **to you**  what would that look like? Number 1 would be for veterans getting out is readjustment counseling, like myself I didn&#39;t realize I had PTSD and I had to take a test then maybe they can get with families to work with them secondly. Also I would say maybe if they had someone in there to help veterans with resumes and gather the military experience to equal civilian life. When I got out the first time they didn&#39;t care but after the gulf war they cared about veterans. They didn&#39;t care at first about the experience in the military.
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers? Since I went there weekly they put out a flyer to spread the word, and some of the guys that go there are in the American Legion and they would pass it out to fellow veterans.
  - Are there other ways you&#39;d like to be informed about them? Not really, I got informed and I am still informed because the guys that go to the Vet center leave flyers in the VA and put it on the board there as well so you can keep up with what&#39;s going on.
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that? Basically, depending on the event and how I felt I would just call them up if I wanted them to go as well.
- Have you visited more than one Vet Center? They just kept changing location, same people, and vet center just different location. I went to one other vet center but that was only because my wife went to another one and I went with her.

If yes:

- How do they differ or compare? They were the same, the guys were just as friendly as the first one. Some of the guys would go to mine and vice versa.

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them? I would tell them it is something like being back in the service due to the comradery.
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center? The vet themselves. The vet center and veteran. Vet center because they are getting their job and the veteran because he is getting help. A veteran would benefit the most because he is around people that will understand how he feels.
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend? I think you have to have served in a war but that is the only on I remember or MST for mostly females but males too.
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities? Well to be frank be with you the guys get together and take the same as the va. Individual counseling is the same as well you go over what you need to go over.
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them? I still think they are ridged for the women; vet centers are rougher on women other then guys. My wife, they never had female groups. They did later on but they weren&#39;t the same as the men. If they allowed them to intermingle between things that would help.
- Anything they would appreciate: Going to certain events like when I was in the hospital they would take us out at times. Maybe something women would enjoy I guess.

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time? I would tell them about my experiences and it is there for their benefits so you might as well take it. That they would be excepted. They are all the same. They are friendly and sit down and introduce themselves. Mine and my wife&#39;s vet center are identical as far as how they treat you.
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center? If they can bring someone that they are comfortable with like their better half that they like to hold on to the person and lean on them. Eventually they can leave the meeting once they are comfortable instead of just dropping him in the frying pan in a sense.
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center? Some people don&#39;t trust the government and think they are up to no good.
- How would they trust the experience: Maybe if someone they knew would go with them and hold their hand without putting press on them to see how it operates.

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? Highland, IN 46322

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? Those are the ones I went to them, both of them. Nope, not really.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? (Reading page), I did two out of those and it is a lot of the stuff that veterans will need. Yes that is what my vet center offered expect for MST because they didn&#39;t have a counselor for that.
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings? That pretty much covers it all, I can&#39;t think of anything else.
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? I don&#39;t have an option on that, it sounds good to me.

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change? It has everything covered already; I can&#39;t really think of anything.

Most important thing for you or someone else that hasn&#39;t been here: Most likely the individual, group, and family counseling. Maybe one more thing, they could put the counselors name and who runs the center so the person knows what to expect and who they would see.

You look at this but don&#39;t know who I will meet, their experience or what they look like. The VA has this thing for peer counseling but don&#39;t know how to counsel. Some guys think its like having a lt looking over you again and people don&#39;t like that. They will understand who they will meet now and have an idea.

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me? Nope, sure don&#39;t.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
