**Note taking template: Vet Center - Veteran Interviews - P#12: 8am - Oct 2, 2020**

**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I served in the Ohio army national guard from 99 to 2007. I deployed in IOF in 2003 and 2005.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? Yes. I have used the Dayton area since 2013, 2014. I use it off and on through last year. I don&#39;t think I have been there in about a year
- How did you first learn about them? Just doing some internet research looking for resources that I could use to help me and my family with some issues we had been having.
- Google search: yes that is how I found out about it.
- How did you find the physical location: Again I think it was the internet search and once I found it I found the information and what they offered. From what I remember I called them and set up and appointment and went for the first time with a dd214. Just a general internet search.
- Do you remember issues finding it: No not at all.
  - When did you first learn about Vet Centers?
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center?
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center?
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way?

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer? I know that they offer individual , group and family sessions. I also know that they have some flexible scheduling and make some appointments available to come in early or later in the day and weekend times but it is on a case by case basis.
- Is that important for you: For me I think it is great but it wasn&#39;t needed for me because I could meet during normal business hours.
- Can you tell me a little about the services, activities, or resources you&#39;ve taken part of? I focused on individual counseling and family counseling.
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time? I think while I was actively using it, it was constant. I was not aware of anything new but the biggest things were that a year ago they moved to a new location which was a bit further away and the counselor that I was working with retired. Those are the only two note worthy things. I don&#39;t know the new services, resources that they have offered since they moved because I had only been there a few times. No, no changes.
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers? I guess I have probably seen some information put out o Facebook but primarily from the Dayton VA medical center mentioning the Vet center. I don&#39;t think I have noticed anything directly from the Vet Center. I get the emails from the VA and they sometimes mention the Vet Center.
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that? I am in a unique position because I work for the state as a VSO. That is what I tell each vet about that I work with. I have some reading materials that I would share but now it is more of an information link so they can look at it. Depending the circumstance I let them know it is a great resource and if I am more personally connected with, not in a working environment but in a personal setting I would share my personal experience with it and encourage them to take advantage of it.
- What would it sound like: I think one of the ways I often describe it- we are lucky that we have one lose by because not every area has access to one and that I share with them the founding principles or mission statement that it was founded by vets for vets. Even though it is part of the VA it is also kind of off from the Va so you can feel free talking about any issues without it crossing over the other benefits and services from the VA.
- Is that important: Yes I think for a lot of veterans they want to have some measure of reassurance that there is true confidentiality and that they talk about in vet center counseling isn&#39;t open to the rest of the medical staff at the VA unless it is a noticeable exception. That sense is reassuring to a lot of folks, the veterans I talk to especially the older ones are skeptical of the VA so offering that or having the sense helps.
- Different for other eras: I don&#39;t think there is as much distrust with OIF OEF era vets is quite as high for the most part. The vets that are within my peer group we are comfortable with the Va and don&#39;t have as much of as skeptical outlook. That being said I think there are some challenges and issues that are not unique and still feel apprehensive and fully disclosing with PCM. It can have impact other things throughout the VA such as benefits and eligibility or even the limiting the access to their rights if they have worries about having someone appointment to them or statements they make getting into their file then it creates the admission issues. I sue to work with the VA police so when someone meets with them sometimes law enforcement was standing by but with the Vet center this doesn&#39;t happen so it makes veterans feel more open. With he understand of the environment and if it were said during a VA appointment then procedure would take place and not everything can be said. I don&#39;t know if it is less important but I think the vet center can take in account what is occurring and the training/understanding they can maybe take an error comment like I&#39;m going to kick your ass where as if it is at a PCM appointment it has to be taken at face value. Whereas in counseling a counselor may have better understand and get deeper without having to do a more normal of reporting. Not that it isn&#39;t documented but they have better context if that makes sense.
- Have you visited more than one Vet Center?

If yes:

- How do they differ or compare?

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them?
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center? I think any vet at some point in their transition form military service could stand to benefit at some level. I think it is more helpful for those that are really struggling with the adjustment from the structure of military life to the chaos to civilian. There&#39;s a lot of things that go with it. I think in general those that have tough times with the transition if it is months or decades the veteran transition is always on going and if you are still relating more with military rather than civilian and those two things doesn&#39;t sync up or transition between the two is when the guidance form the vet center is the most helpful
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend? Basically service that is another other then less then honorable, service during any time of declared of hostilities. So for the most part if you have served from in the 40&#39;s to current times except with a few exceptions in the 90s&#39;s. I know there are certain times but I can&#39;t say from the top of my head but I can look it up quickly if speaking with someone.
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities? In my experience they are not intimidating, has been in a none descript office building like an office meeting so there&#39;s not the grandsire of being part of the medical center. There isn&#39;t a lot of over VA signage either it is normally just a name plate. Then inside it is comfortable, always offered coffee and a snack like peanuts. Again a neutral and very open and welcoming type of experience and atmosphere.
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them? I went from 0 to 100 having stumbled upon it and having not expectations to advocating for it. I think everything I have learned about it has only reenforced my appreciation for that resource being there. I guess it has continuously grown positive. I cannot speak negatively in any aspect at all.

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time? 100 percent safe and they are there for you. Whatever the circumstance that you&#39;re going through they will meet you and be there for you. They are there to do whatever they can for you.
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center? I don&#39;t know.
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center?

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? Dayton

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website?

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? That tracks with my understanding but I didn&#39;t know they did employment referral and that&#39;s what I actually do I work with job seeking veterans.
- What would make someone call: Well I mean I guess is it in context of this center or what a vet center is in general. I think they are two different things. If they are curious or have been directed there they have some type of understanding but may not have the completed understanding. The bullet is completely fine for me and someone that has an understand but maybe offing a narrative form like we can help you with this or are you struggling with this. It may be easier for someone to have an understanding what is available in general. For a specific center it may be helpful having information about the staff that is there and what their background is or specialists or prior service staff. That is what a lot of veterans would key in on.
- What would knowing about the staff and seeing prior service what would that do: I think that would lessen some of the unknowns, for me when I first went in I had very few expectations and was open to it but I didn&#39;t know what I was getting into so if I had the opportunity to learn a bit about the staff that were there I would have taken advantage and read it before my first visit. I don&#39;t know how possible that is because of privacy and rules. I am sure you don&#39;t just want to put the counselor&#39;s information there. I think it would be useful to an extent but I don&#39;t know how useful . Also focusing on MST, I think if there were a subpage for that because it has a whole lot of stigma and the servicemember/veterans suffering from MST. It is one of those things that it is a mind field as where they are and how they are coping with it. I think if there were maybe something that those that are suffering from it they could click on it and get a little more specific information about how a vet center may be able to offer them resources and service along the way. I think a lot of folks can draw conclusions from the other services. For MST, they are going to be particular about the gender of the person, keyed in on how confidential it is. I can envision some that would be comfortable doing it in group but others that would be terrified of group sessions. Maybe spelling it out what resources for MST is available for the vet center and how it is different from the medical center would be useful.
- How do you reach both genders for MST: I think I am not the guy to ask because I can&#39;t give a good insight for it. My first thought is keeping it as neutral as possible because the assumption would be the it pertains to mostly female veterans it is not an absolute, I don&#39;t have person experience helping male vets with it but it is there for them as well so keeping it neutral either gender would feel okay to clicking to learn about it. I don&#39;t know there it&#39;s a topic that I only have a little experience with. It is a sensitive topic for everyone.
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? Maybe changing it to one on one on and then maybe peer counseling. It may convey more individualized aspect of it. Group counseling to me brings to mind AA meetings whereas if it is peer it is like someone you served with or was there when I was type of thing. The rest of it I am okay with. Family was on of the biggest for me seeking care because of my family dynamic and helped bridge the disconnect that I and my family had. We were saying two different thing that meant the same thing but interrupting it wrong. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s another term for family counseling but yeah in general I am good with the words and language for most of it is straightforward.
- How would you rank them: as they are listed I am pretty okay with it but the modification I would do is move outreach to just about other va referral/services. Order of importance goes I know that substance abuse is important but if listing it I don&#39;t know if I would want to see it at the top, I like the idea of seeing the individual and family stuff higher. Maybe substance abuse right above or below MST.
- IS this page useful or could it be useful: If you are familiar with it, it meets the use of it. It has the information needed and contact information. I don&#39;t think there needs to be anything different for a regular visit.

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change?
