**Vet Center - Veteran Interviews - P#2 8am - Sept 30, 2020**

**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I entered service August 1st 68 at 21 years old. I enlisted in Dallas Texas, It was a new experienced, I was scared to death but I was brave to do what I did when it wasn&#39;t the popular thing for women to do. I wasn&#39;t sure what would happen and I didn&#39;t have family support but I did it. I started in 68 and proudly left April1 of 75.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? If talking about the satellites yes and also the Hospitals. I live in a rural area and live 6 miles away from it so it is close to me. I tried to go to a women&#39;s clinic but I didn&#39;t think I got the service that I normally get. It is called the CBOC, I don&#39;t know what it stands for but its near me.
- How did you first learn about them? Well I first learned about it years ago during President Bush&#39;s presidency and I checked into becoming a patient with the VA. I stopped trying once I figured out I did not qualify finically so I didn&#39;t have anything to do with the VA for many of years up until maybe 2018. That&#39;s went I became active in the VA again.
- Someone tell you about it.

I ran into a veteran that informed me of the location and it was a small office. I went in to see if I was able to become a member. They needed my tax forms and I found that an invasion of my privacy so I didn&#39;t not continue. It became more like a clinic, doctors office.

Have you been since: Yes, I have been. I got blood work done and an anomia shot. The doctor is proactive and I am happy I came back. I left thinking I would get better treatment but I know I needed to be more active in my healthcare and that was what I was doing. I went to the email and came in that way. If you tells me the website I can just go to it.

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? It came up with lake Ridge drive, which is where I am located at now. Let me see if I can find one here. 100 lake ridge drive sunrise beach. 64808. I must have location search turned on so I will see if I can find it here. 65079

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? It only provided one and it is 60.2 miles away from me. It is the Columbia vet center. I have been there before.
- Your experience: It wasn&#39;t a very pleasant one. I was there a little over 2 years ago when I sought help from the VA in Kansas City. I spent 7 days in a mental health ward and I was not a happy camper. I didn&#39;t like the idea of the treatment but I made up my mind to get out I had to conform so I never want to go back or ever want to experience that again. I have been received PTSD treatment with the VA and have on going virtual meetings with my doctor. It provides you with directions.
- Finding different location: It is really crazy it shows the VA hospital and it shows the VA mobile vet center but it does not show me the facility that I know of or the honors building. It only shows two but there are more than two. You would think it would be on the VA website. Well now we know.
- Better care here: I agree I have had better care here.
- Looking for different location: 64012 It takes me to the 4800 main street but that&#39;s a VFW there then it mentions it again.
- Click on one of those: it provides the address, the phone number.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center?
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings? (reading page), Those are what I refer to as what I presently participate in at the hospital called the STOP program and they are psychologist that help with my issues. They do not do the medical treatment. This does the mental health issues.
  - Did you know this was available there: Yes I have been there before seeking help. The experience was trying to get my VSO to help me with the claim and it started fine until COVID and then it went south after that.
  - Explain: My claim was denied, I asked for an appeal and it was like pulling teeth because he was working from home and I had to become more aggressive when locating him. He finally answered me via email then I decided that maybe since I wasn&#39;t getting the help I needed I visited with a different VSO but that didn&#39;t work out either so I had to go to the DAV and talk with them. That VSO sat with me face to face and helped but now we are waiting for an answer form the VA.
  - Was not providing services seen here but they were not able to help: Exactly. Each time I was told that due to COVID they were not working form the office.
  - Any virtual: No, I had to do all of the footwork. They are probably helping other people. These are men I am dealing with and I am dealing with PTSD and MST, it is like pulling teeth. I feel that they&#39;re going through the motions because the VA is offering the service to women but my experience as a military person is that the don&#39;t want to deal with it. I have to be proactive and seek help for myself from other female veterans that have been through the same thing as I have so I am more knowledgeable and to know what to expect.
- What else should I know: It is in downtown, easy to get to, good parking, security. It is just a small office. It is very small on the second floor; it is not for health it is for mental health. I was able to get mental health and paperwork filled out.
- Did they connect you to STOP; they helped by filling out the paperwork for the VA claim which was denied so now I am appealing it and have been since March. I have also filed for military records, medical records, paperwork that I need and nothing has came to fruition . It is the hurry up and wait. Just be prepared for them to shake their head and not do anything about it. I don&#39;t see them listening to you. As you can see this website doesn&#39;t give me the honors center for women&#39;s health and then the VFA center in Belton. There is another in Warrensburg but veterans can go there. Warrensburg, MO; CBOC in Belton; Honor Annex building, if you do a search for it you will find it but it is not listed on the va.gov.
- What would you search to find it: google the location then use the zip code.
- What treatment would you search for: The women&#39;s health because that is what is was supposed to be
