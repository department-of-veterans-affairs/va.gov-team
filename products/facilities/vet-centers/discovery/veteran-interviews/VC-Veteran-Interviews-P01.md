**Vet Center - Veteran Interviews - P#1: 7am - Sept 30, 2020**

**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I initially enlisted in the Marine corps in 72 for 2 years, at that time women did not have an obligation and I separated then in 96 in joined the Army and spent the next 20 years in the Army and retired as a Sergeant Major.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? I spent many meaningful sessions with my counselor.
- How did you first learn about them? I went to the Va after my retirement and in 1995 I had a hysterectomy and in 96 I gave up the ghost and I didn&#39;t like my frustration with things. I called it an inappropriate level of angry. During my time it was not okay to seek out mental health issues so I realized that I was being overwhelmed. I obligation it to my retirement and hysterectomy cy so I sought out help and I started working with the VA. The counselor I worked with at the VA referred me to the Vet center because the sore of my angry came from being raped when in the Marine Corps so I started down the path with working with a counselor that specialized in the sexual assault of veterans. I am here to tell you because of the counseling I am able to share this with you. I held it in when it happened almost 30 years ago.
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center? I live in a large metropolitan area and it was located at a commercial building which is a major road. It was easy to access.
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way? When I sought help after the hysterectomy at the Air Force base, the military people here were sent over to Ohio and that trip is an hour. Initially when talking to them I was on active duty and then when I was discharged I started going to the Annapolis hospital and I shortly worked with the counselor there. Thank god that they referred me to the other counselor at the vet center. It was a better fit; I do not remember the counselor but I will forever be grateful for them referring me. I couldn&#39;t say enough positive things about Joanne.

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer? If I had drinking issues I can get individual counseling or group counselling. All guys would be in a room telling war stories while I waited. Other than that I am not aware of other things at the vet center other than the counseling I received.
- Can you tell me a little about the services, activities, or resources you&#39;ve taken part of? I wouldn&#39;t say I took advantage but I talked to the counselors for educational opportunities and had a discussion with them. Joanne was aware of the opportunity and I have a 50 % disability rating. I was only aware of the GI Bill.
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time?
- If you had to rank the different things offered at a Vet Center in order of importance  **to you**  what would that look like?
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers? The only thing I received is as I indicated I was enlisted as a Marine and we have a retired General that is associated with the women&#39;s Marines associate but I do not receive anything directly from the vet center.
  - Are there other ways you&#39;d like to be informed about them? I would like to mention to you because I need to fill in the holes. When someone retires they normally have all kinds of counseling and discussions as far as assistance. Due to me being placed on medical hold, I think there were somethings I did not have access to. I initial talked to one base and then out processed at another because the original base was closing down. There was a lot of me going everywhere and it was not a normal veteran experience.
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that?
- Have you visited more than one Vet Center? I have only visited this one but it has moved. I received the information from the retired General but I would have to look up where it relocated to.

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them? An institution that was established to respect the privacy of veterans that were distrustful of the VA hospitals. I feel there is a certain level of distrust but I have never heard of it. It is for a veteran that is not comfortable with the counseling at the hospital and they can use it as a tool.
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center? I benefited because of the expertise and I cannot imagine someone being as talented and helpful to someone that had been a victim of sexual assault. I spent years of counseling and I told her she saved my life because that&#39;s how I feel.
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend? I would tell them to call the center, which I did recently. I came in contact with a lady that has a son 80% and has drinking issues. So I looked up the number and encouraged that her son call the vet center. I would assume he is eligible due to being 80%.
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities? I have been blessed with the healthcare on active duty and VA. The VA hospital here is outstanding it is excellent care and I never had a disrespectful encounter. I have been pleased with the care both in and out of the military.
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them? Once again I could not be more pleased with the interaction with the counselor, she is what someone would want in a counselor. I was trying to think of the timeframe I was in counseling but I don&#39;t really remember other than to tell you it was for years. It took me awhile that I was not alone because she went through the hold things in and blame yourself then making me come to realize it wasn&#39;t my fault.

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time? We didn&#39;t really get into that but my opinion is that I would want them to know that their privacy is respected. Over and over again because of my concerns of what I was talking about being raped in the military I didn&#39;t want the entire would to know.
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center? That they are not alone and the vet center is the place to go to get help without judgement.
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center? I would say that the distrusted by veterans in the system. Well the trust ahs to come from within the veteran and my experiences on active duty and once I retired may not be typical. I was never deployed to a war zone and I was always in a garrison environment. I spent a lot of time in recruiting command and they leave you alone and not messing with you. No one really messed with me, especially in the Army. They were awed that I was a Marine.

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? 46229.

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website?

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? I did not know they did employment referred. What is substance abuse and assessment mean? I would think that means they would refer a veteran to an outside agency. Yes it is different than what I thought would be there. I didn&#39;t know realize that Cathy and mike could assume that a mother is eligible, she has stage 4 cancer. I did not know that they both could be provided counseling as well. I will share that with her, she has on more than one occasion expressed concerns of her sons drinking.
- What do you want it to say?

I am assuming when it talks about referrals, I assume it is of a veteran to an outside agency. If it is talking about an inhouse counselor, I don&#39;t know how to correctly answer your questions because the referral part is unknown. I would have to think about, maybe put counseling/referral.

Referral confusing? Yes

  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings? I am not sure why there is the referral of other va services. If I were doing it on a website I would be inclusive on whatever is being spoken about. I volunteer at the VA and each county has a counselor; I forget their title but one of my bosses was a vet counselors. He works 3 days a week I think. Do you know the frequency that people go to the site? I would say make sure that you include the information of the vet center to where they are located or retiring to. Make sure to talk to the audience or maybe provide all locations throughout the country because I never heard of a vet center until I go into counseling. I don&#39;t know if this is happening at out-processing offices.
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? I guess initially it has to be pretty nonspecific then make it inclusive and make general statements so I don&#39;t know if have I suggestions. I don&#39;t have an answer for you.

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change? I guess I would use the word confidential because as I stated before I was concerned about my privacy and who would have access to the information. Maybe something like we respect your privacy. The need for dealing with a lot of people at times privacy isn&#39;t not respected so I would include that. Maybe because I ama women I have different outlooks than a guy.
