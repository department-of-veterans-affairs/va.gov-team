**Note taking template: Vet Center - Veteran Interviews - P# 15: 8am - Oct 13, 2020**

**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I was in the Army from June of 69 to May of 71, I was drafted and sent to Vietnam and was there for 11months.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? Yes.
- How did you first learn about them? Oh gosh, I was talking to other Vietnam vets online like 20 years ago and they mentioned their experiences so I thought it would be good to see what it is.
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center? Well mostly I go to the groups, they are helpful and you listen to others and their issues. If you haven&#39;t been to one you hear about their family and their experiences. It helps a lot.
- When did you first learn about them: Yeah it was over 20 years ago.
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center? I looked on the phone book or online.
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way? If you go look for a vet center it comes right but I think that&#39;s the easiest it can be.

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer? All I participant in is the groups I didn&#39;t really get involved in anything else. I don&#39;t know if they had any one on one stuff going on.
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time, always been the groups? No it has basically been everything I participated in and it was really helpful hearing their problems and how they dealt with them.
- Group always the same: Generally you have a group with the same war experiences I was in a group with mostly all Vietnam veterans so I would assume that&#39;s how it would all be and that&#39;s what they try to do.
- Activities as a group or just getting together to talk: I have only done that.
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers? When I went to sign up for a group there would be something there but if someone were to tell me about everything else going on that would have been good to.
  - Are there other ways you&#39;d like to be informed about them? I guess just look it up but I haven&#39;t really done that.
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that? I wasn&#39;t aware that they reach out to family members. I would just tell them about it but I wasn&#39;t aware that they do that.
- Have you visited more than one Vet Center? No just the Memphis one.

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them? I would tell them my experience, have a group of veterans from your era then the leader starts the topic and then talking about the issues like living with PTSD with family. It was instructional the first time I heard it because it was the same issues I was having. Meeting with people that you were in war with is the number one way to deal with it.
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center? Anyone dealing with family issues. There are a lot of things that go along with it like isolations, getting wrapped up in your thoughts, depression, anyways. Anything that causes family disruption that is related to war.
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend? Well generally if you were in combat or in war that would be the number one. I am not sure if they screen people for that or not.
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities? Well it is completely different I don&#39;t think I have seen anything at the VA to reference the vet center. It is separate and it is good in ways and not so good in others.
- How is it good: It is good because you are not involved in the BS at the VA hospital.
- How is it bad: Well like I said I don&#39;t remember seeing anything at the VA that referenced the Vet Center, I think it should. That&#39;s the main thing.
- Not promoting it enough: absolutely, you never see a reference to it on the wall and my psychiatrist never said go there or providing the resources. I have been getting care at the A since 2004 and they just don&#39;t mention it.
- If going through the va and you saw it what would it say: Well they mention it but it should just have what they do and where they are and it is completely different so you never have the idea of going here.
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them? No like I said for what I go there for it hasn&#39;t changed much. It is just getting with veterans of your era and hearing the experiences about the war, dealing with family and society in general

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time? I would mention my experiences and the fact that if you get your issues out and talk to others that have gone through it to it helps. It is with people that were there at the same and you are able to get it out and dump it all out. The psychiatrist or therapist just give you meds and if they are being bothered by it then they should go and talk.

Well, just that hopefully you&#39;ll be with others that have the same problems as you and you can talk about it and they wont second guess what you are saying because they have most likely felt the same way.

- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center? I don&#39;t know an answer to that.
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center? Someone that doesn&#39;t know what happens there may not want to talk about how they feel the first time and that&#39;s why it is important to have someone talk to you that ahs gone there and what they did.

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? This is VA.gov I have been here before, I thought this was the vet center site. Memphis, TN.

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? Yeah.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? Like I said I have only done the group counseling and I haven&#39;t been involved in the rest of it.
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings? No I think that is encompassing.
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? No I think it is pretty good.
- What about the other services, are any unclear: Um, I think they are all well down.
- Other veterans that have never been to a vet center, what would be important for them to know on this page: Well, not really sure. Like I said I was always in the Vietnam era group. It is possible they could list the wars and that the groups for the eras below. It may be helpful.

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change?

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me? Not really like I said in all the time I have gotten care at the VA for mental health in the past 16 years I do not recall anyone saying about the Vet center. I don&#39;t think that is right. The psychiatrists are more into medication and the counselors do not mention it either and I think that is a failure on the VA&#39;s part because the groups aren&#39;t like the va groups and they are better in same ways. That&#39;s all I have to say about that.
- What makes them better: you are in the group with the individuals that have the same experiences/ The groups at the va is just a lot of different veterans what they need but at the vet center they have the same background
