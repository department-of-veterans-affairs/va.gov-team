**Note taking template: Vet Center - Veteran Interviews - P#9:1pm - Oct 1, 2020**

**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? Well I am a Vietnam vet so that was many years ago close to 50 years since I have been in the service. I have been going to the VA since 2005 right after I had my stroke.
- What do you go there for: I have a doctor there and one on the outside, from the two of them they kind of take care of me.

**Contingency plan:**

If no experience with Vet Center:

- What do you think a Vet Center is? A place where I can get medical attention if needed and in my case I have a doctor that I meet with once a month for my PTSD, (Psychologist).

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together.

[Show Vet Center website](https://www.vetcenter.va.gov/)

Are you familiar with this website? Take a minute to look it over. I&#39;m happy to click around for you as well.: Not really, not this one.

- What can you tell me about a Vet Center? There is a lot of things on there, it says who they are, the eligibility which is what it takes to be a member of vet center services for sexual trauma services and stuff like that. Well I can tell you right now we get to see physical doctors rarely because of COVID so half of the counseling is over the phone instead of in person. Sometimes I have to go to the actual building to see a doctor like tomorrow I have to go and see the doctor, he had me get a scan done of my stomach because the last time I had a CT scan they thought they saw something there so they want to verify due to their scan not being complete.
- What about the counseling: There are two people I talk to once a month or a few months. One is a social counselor and a psychiatrist I see.
- Where at: Right now everything is phone conversations, yes.
- Before covid: yes it would have been in person, I went every 30 days to talk to the counselor.
- At a hospital, clinic or: Boden county has the clinic and the main hospital is in Miami so I don&#39;t go there. I go to the clinic because it is 3-4 miles away from me, much more convenient.
- Is there anything that interests you on this page? Not really, nothing in particular.
- Is there anything that you don&#39;t like on this page? No, not really. It is very informative page you know.

[navigate to eligibility]

- What&#39;s your understanding of eligibility? (reading page), Yes that is basically why I go to the VA center for.

I&#39;m going to pull up another website to look at it together.

**Scenario**

Let&#39;s imagine that you just learned about Vet Centers and you want to know if there is a Vet Center near you. How would you go about finding out that information?

We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? 33071
- What looks like a place you might go to: I would look for the closet one to where I live. Yes the first one is the Oakland park office.

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose, Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? No I have never been to the vet center online here.

Take a minute to look at this page. Let&#39;s focus on this area here:

- What can you tell me about the different services? (Reading all services)
- What kind of services would you find most useful? Well yeah, the one in particular would be psychiatric problems. I am not seeing it one here thought, there is nothing under referral for va services.
- What would you expect it to say: Well I would think they would say psychological services like PTSD and things in that area that they may cover.
- What do you think the first bullet means: That is one of the things I go to is the individual counseling, I am not much of a group person. I do not associate with groups I don&#39;t want to talk to a group of 5-6 veterans once a month, I am not into that. I guess you can say I am more of a private person.
- Is it different than the once a month you get now: No it would be individual rather then group counseling.
- Anything else useful: If I could get my wife to go yes because it would be a good idea because she could explain the difficulty as a result of my PTSD.
  - Is there any other information about the services available at this Vet Center that you&#39;d like to see? Well I would think that it would eb a good idea if you could click on the heading and get a more in depth explanation of the services they offer. Yes.
- If you needed one of these services and you didn&#39;t know Vet Centers existed, how would you go about finding it? (use their preferred example) Well it was through the VA as a result of going there. All you need to do is ask questions and they can answer what you need or are looking for. There&#39;s like an information center where you can ask questions and they point you in the right direction.
- In person: I have never done it online, I have just gone to the center and spoke with a person that sits in the booth by the door and ask where I would find the information and/or service and then they tell you where to go.
- Are there other services that you don&#39;t see on this list that you&#39;d like to see? No I don&#39;t think so. Like I said if there were clickable links where you can get more information instead of just making a statement like this but I think it covers the questions of what service they may want.
- What would you tell someone: When I was looking for someone to talk to due to problems in my marriage that is PTSD. They told me what I needed to do is make an appointment with a counselor and sit down and talk with them and explain to them what I was looking for then they would make the appointment or provide other recommendation on where to look.
- If you say this for the first time and had not found help already but didn&#39;t want to ask in person, is there something helpful that would have them call: There is a main number listed on the page if you do it by phone so they don&#39;t know who they are talking to, that is one way to ask questions and have them point you in the direction.
- Anonymously a good thing: To a point, I am not the person to sit down and talk war stories. I choose individual counseling to talk to one person so I can discussion my life and my marriage. It is all personal stuff and I don&#39;t want to bring it up in front of a group of people that&#39;s why I say it is not my style I am more private. I have been dealing with the PTSD since Vietnam and have just started talk to them last December so I have been hanging on and just letting it go for 50 years before I said something. Not that I am talking to someone I am doing better and stuff like that. It is hard to explain.
- Is there any other information that you don&#39;t see on this page that you would find helpful?
- What would make you want to call or visit a Vet Center?
- What would keep you from calling or visiting a Vet Center? NO not really, it took me 40 some years to bring it up and I have been suffering with the memories. It is not something that I personally want to talk about it but that&#39;s why I choose individual counseling.
- When you see this does it seem like you can only get group: Well you would have to ask.
- How would you like to have been informed that Vet Centers and these services existed? Well I was to the point that I realized and gave into the fact that I needed the help. That is why I connected them and I have been sitting on it for many years.
- If you saw a friend that you think they may benefit what would you tell them: I would recommend that they go to the vet center and talk to them. Just tell them what you are interested in finding out and they&#39;ll tell you where to go and who to talk to. If the vets not ready to talk you&#39;re not going to drag them there. They have to have the desire to talk about it for some type of reason.
- Any service that could have a better explanation or named differently: No, I don&#39;t know who put it together but that is the best that they could describe it as. It is clear, concise but again you can ask questions. You have to be willing to talk to someone.
