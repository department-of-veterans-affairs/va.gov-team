**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? I am 23 year army veteran and I served in the national guard I did a year deployment to Iraq in 2004 and retired as a staff sergeant.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? Yes
- How did you first learn about them? I think I went to an outreach center, where they have veteran fairs and that&#39;s how I learned about it.
  - When did you first learn about Vet Centers? That was probably around 2 years ago.
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center? I actually go there for my counseling, well when you can go to a place. I have been going there for almost 2 years, right now it is the counseling over video but we use to do face to face counseling.
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center? It was pretty easy; I normally google everything. This one you need to know where to go because it is not visible from the street. It is off in the cut so you have to go down a road and it is in the back of the place. You can see it but you wouldn&#39;t know what it is from the street and you wouldn&#39;t know until you are at the front door. I didn&#39;t have a problem finding it they are very helpful in helping you find it and I know the area.

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer? They have connects with other organizations and I have tried to use those but have not been selected for them. Outside of that no.
- Not successful: they have different agencies that offer retreats and apply for it then hope you get selected. I have submitted a few times but I have not been selected. I don&#39;t know if I got them in to late or just haven&#39;t provided enough information.
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time? No everything has been consistent except now they as the COVID questions if its effecting you emotionally or mentally.
- Aware of other services: No but I know they do counseling and use to do paint night or other activities during the day while I was working so I wasn&#39;t able to participate.
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers? I would see the information table there and I would look at it or my counselor would tell me about it. If there were anything of interest they would give me a call because she doesn&#39;t email a lot.
  - Are there other ways you&#39;d like to be informed about them? I like the call better; with email you may get it or you may not but I don&#39;t mind email.
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that? I normally do word of mouth; I have recommended a vet center for counseling services before.
- Have you visited more than one Vet Center? I don&#39;t think I have. I know there are others because I have talked to others from different centers but I have only been to one.

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them? It is like a small suit, its not to big but it is very personal in presentation. You go in and wait and they offer refreshments. It is small and intimate.
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center? Any veteran that needs help with mental health like suicidal or depression.
- How would you describe eligibility requirements to a friend? I would just say any military veteran that served. I cannot remember if it required me to be a war time veteran, they normally help anyone that needs help.
- How would you compare Vet Centers to other VA facilities? It is smaller and more intimate. Less people and less track. It definitely isn&#39;t the VA.
- What does that mean: the VA is big and a lot of people all over. The VA is nice but it is a matter of fact business.
- Have your opinions or expectations of Vet Centers changed since you first learned about them? NO, they haven&#39;t. I think they are a great organization that provides important services. My experience has been great with the vet center and counselor.

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time? I would tell them that they can go to the vet center and I recommend my vet center and counselor because she&#39;s nice and listens. They provide as much help as you need and I use to go weekly but now I go every 3 weeks. There is probably one close to them because there are a few. It is not affiliated with the VA and you don&#39;t need to worry about it is in your VA medical records. The counselors are pretty good there.

Make sure they know they are separate form the VA and what you tell them is between you and them unless you want it in your VA records. A lot of people like the vet centers because they don&#39;t want it in the VA records.

- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center? I believe the staff actually you know aid in that, provide in giving the level of comfort. That component and it being separate form the VA that they could use.
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center? I am not sure, maybe because they aren&#39;t connected to the VA, it depends on the services or help with benefits. It doesn&#39;t seem like they can help with benefits at least not from what I am aware of.

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? Orland park, IL

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? I don&#39;t think I have ever actually looked at this page.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? That is simple and not much to it. It sounds about right it is mostly counseling and yeah mostly counseling and community outreach/education. They tend to go to the veteran fairs and they have the referrals for VA services.
- VA referrals: who to call at the VA and I think they have a connect of who to call or have someone call you maybe.
- If they could help with other benefits: Most veterans need help with claims so if they help with va claims and appeals you need to say that and it be prominent. They are not VSO&#39;s like people that help with claims so if they are you need to spell that out.
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings? Well in terms of what they do that is straightforward. They mostly only do counseling and sometimes the table at outreach events to let people know.
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? No I think it is self-explanatory.

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change? They could add a picture to show the front like a storefront. SO you know what you are looking for when you are headed to the address I guess.

Anything else: I cannot really think of anything else unless they expand on other va referrals but if they offer counseling that&#39;s really all they need to put. It is what it is and they do what they do. I am happy and have been going there a long time and pleased with eh services. Less is more and this is enough it has where they are and their hour.

- What&#39;s most important for you to know?
