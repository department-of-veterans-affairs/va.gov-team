# Vet Center Veteran Interview 

**Interview date:** October 16, 2020 <br></br>
**Time:** 8:00am

VC = Vet Center

He didn’t go to a Vet Center — it was a VBA office. (He didn’t know what a Vet Center was.)

**Service history -** 
Naval Reserve during Vietnam. As everyone back then, “I joined with the dream of not going to Vietnam. I requested nothing smaller than an aircraft carrier. I’m from CA, wanted to see the other part of the world. Knew they wd not send the boat to Vietnam. But 3 weeks later I was off the shore Vietnam. “Saw a lot more than I would have liked to. … Came home in 1 piece, much to the chagrin of everyone else.” 

I was a “2x6” — total of 9 years. I regret it bc I’d be retired now.

Have partial disability for tinnitus. “Agent Orange is still up in the air. They say I was a ‘blue water sailor’ and now that’s coming back to haunt us.” Mesothelioma (?). “I guess I”m gonna have to fight that, too.”

Don’t know if you are talking about the Dept of Veterans Affairs or VC. I have used both. 

**Showed him Vet Centers landing page.** 
This is not familiar to him. (Page that has readjustment counseling.)

He’s not familiar with va.gov.

**Showed him Facility Locator.**
Entered “roseville, ca.”

Has seen the Citrus Heights VC but has not been there. Went to one in Placer County Office Building. “I must admit I didn’t really like it. The guy was an Air Force jockey and not very helpful.”

He knows a facility at 1000 Sunrise. In county building. They offered…

**Looked at VHA facilities in Roseville, CA.**
He gets healthcare at McClellan. 

**Googled “Placer County Veterans”.**
Claims assistance. Found where he goes: Placer County Veterans Service Office at 1000 Sunset (not Sunrise). 

**Showed him Vet Centers landing page again. What can you tell me about this Vet Center?** 
“Like I said, the 1 in Placer I wasn’t too crazy about. The guy wasn’t too helpful. It was when I was trying to fight my claim. ….I got a bad vibe from him.”

Drove to Sacramento to the Veterans Administration. They helped me file the claim. It still got denied. “They just seemed more helpful.”

It was hard to find the address for this ^ place. It was on Old Placerville… Think I still have the envelope here. He looked for it but could not find it. Mentioned having cemetery stuff. 

His wife passed away 4 mos ago — “All my paperwork is a mess.” 

I met with the guy who helped me file the claim, and then we followed up on it and it still got denied. I thought we’d filed an appeal. 

He apologized for being unprepared for this (interview) — “I really didn’t know exactly what we’d be looking at.”

**It was a disability claim?** 
Yes. And they helped me with my claim for hearing. “And that did work.” 

Found someone in the office — she was no longer there. Was talking to another man there, who helped him file the claim for his ears, then filed an Agent Orange claim. “That finally got thru.”

They put him in touch with an advocate who was retired who was going back to Washington. Don’t know what happened with that. 

They told him about the woman in the Vet Center (?) at Mathur, a VA hospital. In the claims section. They have separate offices — release of information. They suggested I talk to the Vet Center. It’s on Old Placerville Road. 

When I wanted to go back, it was hard to find. They moved. They were listed on Howell Ave, but they were on Old Placerville Road, and I don’t know why. 

He went to make coffee. 

**Found the office he went to online, a VBA office:** 
Sacramento- Oakland Out-Based Office
103665 Old Placerville Rd
Sacramento, CA

“I don’t know if that meets your criteria of Vet Center.” 

**Asked how he finds out about VA offices and service and gets there.** 
He’s retired and doesn’t have much access to the Internet. His computer at home is old. He relies on his old driving experience. “I will just drive there until I find it.”

Re: the Placerville office: “It was in the VA’s hierarchy.” Discussed that VA offices are confusing. 

**Is there anything that would have made that easier for you?** 
No, other than I have to drive so far. 15 miles but a lot of traffic. We really don’t have freeways. “It’s bumper to bumper going down to the state capital.”

“I try and do it all when I’m going down to the medical center.” B4 coronavirus I was in a group for smoking. I had quit, before all those problems with my wife. Went to smoking group once a week. Learned about group from my doctor, who’s up here at McClelland. 

I chose McClelland bc it’s closer. Mentioned orthopedics. 

Only goes to Sacramento for smoking cessation and neurology. 

Think he was referred to neurology by his primary care. I have “non-essential tremors.” Guess that’s more related to my age than my service. I thought it was a prelude to Parkinson’s but they said no. Parkinson’s is a prelude to Agent Orange. 

Smoking cessation group was helpful. Last time he quit was in February. “I was doing OK until all these problems cropped up, and I caved in. But I’m pretty sure I can get back on track now.”

**If you had a friend who needed help and COVID was over, would you recommend the smoking group to a friend?** 
Yes. “They were very helpful.” Even when I was having problems with my wife, when it first started. “They gave me about the only encouragement that I could get.”

“Oh, I’m sorry. I finally got a cup of coffee. I apologize.” 

“They only thing that hurts is, all these gentlemen that were in there… Seemed to have quit — and there were some we called ‘old dogs’ — they all quit, but then some of them passed away.” That’s the only thing that bothers me. 

“Most of my issues are with the VA themselves, not with the Vet Centers. I would like to get on a similar opinion thing about the VA. I keep trying these surveys.” 

Getting appointments is most difficult.

Have a claim in for audiology, only claim that is compensable, only one I get regular service on. I can only get appts 3 mos out, and 2 mos out they cancel them. Just got an appt 1 month out and it’s on a Saturday. “That’s unheard of.”

It’s gotten to the point where I call to make an appt, only to be sure it’ll get cancelled. I’m sure COVID is part of this, but my problems with getting appts predate COVID.
