## Scenario: A friend is having a rough time

I'd like you to imagine a scenario: 

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you’ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center. 

   - What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time?
    
   - What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center?
    
   - What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center? 


## Services critique: 

I'm going to pull up a website to look at it together. We're going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

  - What location should I enter?
  
   If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)
  
I'm going to choose Vet Center as the facility type. 

- Are you familiar with this website? 

Take a minute to look it over. Let's focus on the list of services on this page.  

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center? 

    - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings?

- Sould any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? 

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change?

    - What's most important for you to know?
