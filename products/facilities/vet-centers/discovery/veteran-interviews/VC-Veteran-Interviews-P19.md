**Start recording to the Cloud**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history? Bravo engineers in the army for 12 years I was in Iraq and I got two combat service ribbons and a CAR and love me things for the wall. I came back after Iraq and became a deputy sheriff HI I have done everything from arresting drug lords to my own brother. I joined in 94 I am somoni and come from a military family. Everyone is in the military or in a military family. I was with my brother in-law in 06 in Iraq. We swapped bases and wed mess with each other&#39;s stuff. We barely got to see each other but that was our thing to keep it the same.

**Learning about Vet Centers:**

- Are you familiar with Vet Centers? Yes, I was sent to the vet center by my VA combat dress coordinator counselor. When I came back they threw me and other Iraqi guys and they placed us with the Vietnam vet guys because they weren&#39;t really ready for us they started bringing in us little by little. We were the first to go in and the PTSD program didn&#39;t know what to do with us. We were young, angry, and angry and not suitable for the general population. The va here the veterans are broken into within combat era and within the Vietnam group they had don&#39;t play well with anyone group. They were guys that did a lot of time in Vietnam, Beirut, and gulf war so I was one of the first 4 Iraq guys that were placed in the group. It was the best thing they could have done for us because the first day we walked in and there was a Semolina/Hawaiian guy that was an amputee. He was one of the veteran&#39;s games guys and his leg as soon as we walked in he was like who the heck are you and why are you here. Our friend looks at him and is like who do you think you are talking to. It was the 6 Vietnam veterans and us, we were about to go at each other but everyone started laughing. The counselor was nervous but our old counselor just sat on the wall and smile. We all just clicked. Different eras and everything but we just clicked. We spent the next two years learning the VA system and it helped it wasn&#39;t from the VA because you have the VA admin and medical side. We were learning the ropes from the guys fighting it for 20-40 years. We were learning the small things like who&#39;s bad and who&#39;s good. They finally got groups set up for us which took 3 years. When our counselor left because he retired, there were VA counselors and for mental health. He just sat there and said that the vet center was the best place to get mental health. Only go to the va for your pills and medical. He sent me to a specific vet center, I was sent there and he told me who to go talk to so I did. When I walked in I ran into my counselor that took me to the vet center, he was a three time loser meaning he had volunteered to join but was a cop first but then went to Iraq and Afghanistan. It just clicked, similar background and even some of the stuff he was helping with it wasn&#39;t to far off the mark for him to understand and it helped. I have had some doctors that were solid and others that it just doesn&#39;t work. It is hard because it was hard for them because they are there to help but they are trying to help with the wrong thing. I understand what they are seeing as the issues, that&#39;s great but that&#39;s not on a functional day to day basis. It came with the idea that it was more difficult because I was a deputy sheriff. Being here in the states, I couldn&#39;t be a cop now. The VA put me on 100% now but after Iraq I was 80%. There were aspects of it, you just had to leave some things go. The want to help outweighed, I wasn&#39;t willing to open the box at that time because when I open it the daily effects would bite me in the butt especially when looking for drug dealers. I didn&#39;t need any other bad days I already had enough regular bad days. There aren&#39;t many sheriffs and the moto is once you bite it you eat it. There were times on the call that it was me then 3 suspects and my buddy was on the other side of the island and the state of mind had to be I&#39;m going home tonight they aren&#39;t. It was a normal shitty day, lets do my mental health at the same time and see how much worse it could be. I think that was the biggest reason I was sent to the vet center.
- How did you first learn about them?
  - When did you first learn about Vet Centers?
- What has been your experience with a Vet Center? Honestly, donuts and coffee, that was my first experience with the vet center. It is funny, it wasn&#39;t like anything set up there was coffee it was like God&#39;s milk in that place. I walked in and I guess they already talked but I still had to bring my dd214 and go through were part of the VA but not and they can&#39;t get your records. They gave the history of the vet center and they were good at explaining why the vet center is the way it was. I came in when they were ending the Korean war group and they got together once every other week and some of them were world war 2 vets as well. The group they had were made up of the guys that came in just to sit down and bring donuts and breakfast and get away from their wives to talk about what they went through. Brock was running the group and the guy called him and he came out and invited me in to listen in on the group. I went in and it was like a big take with everything you could think of. I go in there and it wasn&#39;t really brock that gave me the run down it was the group that started before he could get to. Simply because the va system was overstressed and they didn&#39;t know how to deal with a war that wasn&#39;t excepted and they needed their own place. IN the earl 70&#39;s the vets came together to get authorization from congress for vet centers.
- I still go to the vet center; I had a group Saturday on Zoom. They sent us up for online yoga, the air force person just got out and was like I can teach yoga. Which is cool because the vet center counselor now is former army captain and the counselor prior he was air force and went back in that&#39;s why he left. Everyone was in the military. I think the family counselor was the only person not in the military but he has done it for so long and on other female that wasn&#39;t in the military but her family was. It is not that it is important but it stops problems sometimes before they start. There are things I can say to a prior military that I can&#39;t to a civilian, certain topics that get reached is uncomfortable for others, I had had it before that its like a zookeeper in a cage with a lion but forgets it sometimes then the face goes oh crap this is a lion and I have had those days with the counselor at times. The va has BBQ days to remember all the vets at times and this was back in the days when you could have a beer, we talked and she mentions that when we first meet she was uncomfortable being in the room with me because I have a tendentious to overpower the room. You weren&#39;t a meth monkey but you were on that sits in the corner and everyone gets uncomfortable. One of my biggest pet peeves is not to BS or ask a question that you don&#39;t want the answer to. I have found that the VA thinks they need to ask but don&#39;t really want the answer to. When you give them more truth then they actually want it wraps the tension in the room and the conversation changes. I guess it becomes distracting I guess. I have had shirks that truly wanted to know and were good with the answers but some younger ones couldn&#39;t handle the fact that I spent my adulty life as a human handler and that&#39;s what I did but some of that time it was people and at times they had a hard time that that portion of the job that it had little effect on me. We have gone through the discussion even today that I was raised between both and the cultural norms are not the same. It was the doctors that had a hard time dealing with that because in our culture the normal that they think once it is outside of that there is no footing then unstable with it and that&#39;s what has happened a few times even when they try to understand but they muddy the waters up more. The military people are easier to deal with because the tribalism related to the military so I don&#39;t have to explain to them that I had no issues calling a strike on a mosque even though it was middle of pray and I didn&#39;t need to explain the need for that because they know something happened and caused the need for it and they have an understanding of how the military works and I didn&#39;t need to hide behind it. Some people have the idea of the military but don&#39;t understand. I have spent time with other countries military and they are peacekeepers where we were taught to win wars. We don&#39;t have the need to be the nice guys and it is projected in all movies when the reality is that we are a bit of both but it can be difficult from what we are and what they assume. It is the same thing as law enforcement. The cop and criminal are the closest thing we are the average. The vet center for me was a great fit because we all are similar.
- Before you first visited, how did you go about finding the location of your Vet Center?
- Could finding your Vet Center have been easier in any way?

**Being a client:**

- What kind of services, activities or resources does your Vet Center offer?
- Can you tell me a little about the services, activities, or resources you&#39;ve taken part of?
- Have the types of services or activities that you&#39;ve engaged with changed at all over time?
- If you had to rank the different things offered at a Vet Center in order of importance  **to you**  what would that look like? Individual/group, then family, MST, substance abuse, then dump in employment and then the rest.
- How do you learn about new events or services that your Vet Center offers?
  - Are there other ways you&#39;d like to be informed about them?
- If you wanted to share information about a Vet Center event with a friend or family member, how would you like to do that?
- Have you visited more than one Vet Center?

If yes:

- How do they differ or compare?

**A client&#39;s concept of a Vet Center:**

- How would you describe what a Vet Center is to a friend who hasn&#39;t heard of them? Us taking care of us.
- Who would benefit from calling or visiting a Vet Center? Any vet honestly but the ones that are the lost boys of the group because the fact that even with bad paper you can go to the vet center. Me personally I get the honorable discharge against the others and maybe when I was 18 and thought the rules are real I could see it but after my time in the military and law enforcement and seeing one day bad and it doesn&#39;t even have to be one that you make bad, I can see how easily it is to walk out of the military with bad paperwork. I have seen really good guys get bad discharges that should have never gotten it. To watch them get hammered by the system for doing what everyone thinks it is right but the rules being the rules took it the other way. All veterans can benefits but that group especially and then the MST portion of it. I don&#39;t know much about it but it is talked about it heavily because the MST service is needed and you can come if that happens to you it is away from the VA and the commands. You are in control.

**Scenario: A friend is having a rough time**

I&#39;d like you to imagine a scenario:

You have a friend, a fellow [Veteran, service member], who you&#39;ve noticed has been going through a rough time. You think he or she might benefit from visiting a Vet Center.

- What is the most important thing for someone to know before visiting for the first time? Here&#39;s the hard part, the problem is that it is ran by the va and there are somethings that the vet centers do that the va isn&#39;t happy about. One big one is that the bad paper discharge that vet centers are able to help them. The va has gotten better with bad paper discharges but they are still hard lines where anything less than an honorable discharge they don&#39;t get services whereas vet centers are able to interrupt what happened of what happened. Vet centers ask why they made them do and they get the answers. The army there is little room to recover or grieve. Like 45 minutes to grieve then get back out to the mission, we lost 19 guys and we had the highest casualty rate. You come in grieve then go back out to combat, you get water and eat, cry, and get back out there. The big boy reality covered a lot of things. I wish they could put it in there that there are more veterans that can get help through the vet center then the veterans know. A lot of vets don&#39;t know that they can use it. It is worse for the others with bad papers because they are ostracized but with the vet centers there are ways that they can get back into the system for help and it is better than nothing.
- What would make them comfortable calling or visiting a Vet Center?
- What would deter them from calling or visiting a Vet Center?

**Services critique:**

I&#39;m going to pull up a website to look at it together. We&#39;re going to find your local Vet Center website together: [Facility locator](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)

- What location should I enter? 96816

If none given: [Atlanta Vet Center Detail page](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0304V)

I&#39;m going to choose Vet Center as the facility type.

- Are you familiar with this website? Funny story the guy that runs the mobile vet center use to work at the VA and now is the one that runs the Vet center stuff, he was a communications guy in Iraq/Afghanistan. The va page yes but not the vet centers page.

- Have you been at the mobile one: They brought the mobile one out when the Marines 247 went off of the point and the aircraft propellers touched and ended up taking all of the marines to the bottom. Everyone was there looking for them after the crash trying to find pieces of the aircraft or the people that washed up. The mobile vet center was there to give them a break and give out water.

Take a minute to look it over. Let&#39;s focus on the list of services on this page.

- How does this list compare to your experience and knowledge of a Vet Center?
  - Is there any other information that you would want as part of these service listings?
- Could any of the services be changed or renamed to be more accurate of your experience? Some of the stuff I would put in would change the aspect of the page, here s the bad part I would and would do is put the post combat or post-employment but that could alienate 90% of the veteran population because they may thing that&#39;s were just combat guys go. The truth of the tell is that only 10 % have had direct combat so the other 90% is just supporting them. I met one of the vets from USS Cole that was sealed into where the water was rising but started to fight the fires he walked into a room full of guys and shut us all down. It wasn&#39;t him being mean but when he told his story it was the most humbling thing of my life; he closed a door to the door where it was just fire and water and you just went in. By putting the combat portion it would isolate those guys but everyone needs help so maybe that they do the paper review for services if that makes sense. In the vet center even dishonorable discharged can get services, I meant they review the paperwork from the discharges. I think that is something that the va since it is big until recently bad paper meant no benefits. One of the biggest groups that were hit by it was the LQB community because of don&#39;t ask don&#39;t tell. The ban was from the 1800&#39;s and you have a ton of veterans that were caught but didn&#39;t matter one way or the other. It was a personal situation, no one cares who was sleeping with who but back then you had the purity aspect but growing in the military you know who&#39;s dad was sleeping with who&#39;s mom but you know everything and I think that they need to be able to look at the paperwork so see if you can get services. They just started to look at the quality of the discharge and why.

If this website could be improved for you, as a regular visitor to a Vet Center, what would change?

- What&#39;s most important for you to know?

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me? Anything you can do to help them please do because I have seen to many bad guys go down for things they shouldn&#39;t have. You made us into an attack dog some worse than others but then I feel they don&#39;t want to bring us back but they don&#39;t have the balls to put us to sleep. In that aspect I would have stayed in Iraq until I was in the ground, they don&#39;t want to win the war so they send us in then take us back out. That is the worst thing that they can do to us, once a dog starts to hunt let them hunt. Sometimes it is better to just take us out and put us to sleep if they cannot admit what they created. I have watched my best friends that was a premed student straight A&#39;s and within 18 months they are in a shoot out and spending the rest of his life in prison. He was told he needed mental help and he is not guilty due to insanity but he lost his mind when he did what he did. He was the best I had ever seen. He went to a place where every norm and turned upside down. It was wrong that what he did but on the other side I can understand but the reaction was how we did in Iraq. He is scared because the system, each time he goes for help he gets the you are the criminal if you could make that in this portion to get them in there.
