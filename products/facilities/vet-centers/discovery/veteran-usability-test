# Research Plan: Vet Center Client - Usability Test  

**November 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goals

The goal of this study is to understand a Vet Center clientâ€™s experience, impression and relationship with Vet Centers. 

### Research questions

- How do Veterans and service members first learn about Vet Centers? 

- What is the client experience for different demographics? 

- What services, resources or activities are most valuable to Veterans, service members and their families? 

- How long do clients typically engage with Vet Centers and does their engagement or opinion of Vet Centers change over time? 

- What information do Veterans and service members want or expect to see on a website? 

### Hypothesis 

Current clients have a favorable view of Vet Centers and the services that they offer and view them as distinct entities from other VA facilities.
