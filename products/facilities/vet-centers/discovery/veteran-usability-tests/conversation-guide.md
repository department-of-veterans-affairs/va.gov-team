## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. I also have some colleagues on the line listening and taking notes.
Today we'll be discussing ideas for a new webpage that will live on the VA's website.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes.
- We'll start the session with a couple warm up questions.
- Then, I'll ask you to share your screen so that we can look at and discuss a website together and I'll help you through that.
- Lastly, I'll share a link for you to click on. It will open a separate website that we'll also look at and discuss together. 
- Throughout the session, I'll be asking you about your thoughts and opinions about the information and content on the pages but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the designs and the information contained on the pages to see how we can make them better for Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question. 
- This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** So, I'd like to confirm:

Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions 

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

Thanks for sharing that. 

## Counseling services 

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA. 
  
  - Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  - how was that experience?
  
## Searching for counseling online

We're going to switch gears and look at a few websites. So that I can follow along with you, would it be OK if you shared your screen with me? 

We're going to start with a blank page in your web browser.
 
I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine you have a Veteran friend who's been going through a rough time. You think this person could benefit from some mental health care or counseling. You're not exactly sure what's available but you wanted to help out by doing a little digging for them on the internet. 

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?
 
 (If they need more direction: What might be some common issues that you think might benefit from counseling?)
 
 - Can you try that search for me?
 - What words or phrases would you search for to get you to some answers?

## Searching for counseling on VA.gov

Now let's imagine that you want to see what you can find on VA.gov. You'd like to know where your friend can go to get mental health care or counseling.

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on VA.gov?
 - Can you try that search for me?
 - What words or phrases would you search for to get you to some answers?
 

## Prototype

For the last part of this session, we're going to switch gears again and look at a different webpage together. I'm going to share a link with you to click on. It's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a fake prototype of a website. 

[Share link to prototype](http://)

With the same scenario in mind, helping a friend, except this time I'd like for you to imagine that you did a search and you landed on this page. I'm going to give you a minute to look it over and feel free to think out loud any thoughts that come to mind.

 - What can you tell me about this place?
 - What kind of care or services do you think you get here?
 - What are the most important services offered here?
 - Is there any additional information that you think should be added about each service?
 - What would you be able to tell your friend about individual counseling?
 - What would you be able to tell your friend about group counseling services offered here?
 - What do you think is the relationship between the different locations listed on this page?
 - Is there any other information that you don't see that you think would be helpful or necessary before visiting?
 - What would make this website better?


## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
