## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. I also have some colleagues on the line listening and taking notes.
Today we'll be discussing ideas for a new webpage that will live on the VA's website. We're looking for Veteran's input on how to make it better.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes.
- We'll start with my asking you a couple warm up questions
- Then we'll do a bit of technical set up of Zoom. So that I can follow along with you today, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen and I'll help you through that.
- We'll look at a website togther and we'll be discuss that for the remainder of the session. 
- Throughout the session, I'll be asking you about your thoughts and opinions about the information and content on the pages but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the designs and the information contained on the pages to see how we can make them better for Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question. 
- This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** So, I'd like to confirm:

Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

Ok, great. Thank you for that.


## Warm-up Questions 

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

Thanks for sharing that. 



## Counseling services 

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA. 
  
  - Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  - how was that experience?
  
  
## Zoom sharing set-up

We're going to switch gears now and look at website together.  It's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a fake prototype of a website.

## Scenario
 
Before we look at the website, I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine you have a Veteran friend who's been going through a rough time. You think this person could benefit from some mental health care or counseling. You do a little digging for them on the internet. 

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this?
 - What words would you use to get you this type of information?

## Prototype

Now let's imagine that as your searching, you land on a website. 

I'm going to send you a link to the website. 

[Share link to prototype](http://)

I'm going to give you a minute to look the page over. As you're looking, I'd for you to think out loud your observations and any the thoughts that come to mind.

 - What can you tell me about this place?
 
 - What kind of care can you get here?
 
 - What type of services do you think could benefit your friend?
 
 - What are the most important services offered here?
 
 - What services are less important?

Let's imagine that your friend is the type of person that prefers one on one interactions with people. 

 - Could your friend get one-on-one counseling here?

 - What would you be able to tell your friend about individual counseling at this location?
 
Let's imagine that your friend is a real people person and misses that camaraderie from the service.  

 - What kind of services would likely be appealing in this case? 

 - Is there any additional information that you think should be added about the services listed here?

 - What can you tell me about Vet Centers locations? 
 
 - Where would your friend be able to go for services?
 
 - What type of services would be available at another location?

#### Locations page 

 - What do you think is the relationship between the different locations listed on this page?
 

#### General website questions

We're almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

 - Is there anything on this website that's missing for you that you would need to know before visiting the Atlanta Vet Center?
 
 - What would make this website better?

 
## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
