## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. I also have some colleagues on the line listening and taking notes.
Today we'll be discussing ideas for a new webpage that will live on the VA's website. We're looking for Veteran's input on how to make it better.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes.
- We'll start with my asking you a couple warm up questions
- Then we'll do a bit of technical set up of Zoom and I'll help you through that. 
- I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along with you today, but we can keep our video turned off.
- We'll look at a prototype of a website togther and we'll be discussing that for the remainder of the zoom call. 
- Throughout the session, I'll be asking you about your thoughts and opinions about the information on the pages but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the designs and how we communicate the information contained on the pages. We're trying to learn from Veterans how we can improve the website. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question. 
- This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** So, I'd like to confirm:

Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

Ok, great. Thank you for that.


## Warm-up Questions 

To get us started:

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

Thank you for sharing that. 


## Counseling services 

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on different types of counseling services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting. 
  
  - Are you familiar with these type of services offered by the VA?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  - how did you learn about those services?
  - how was that experience?
  
Thank you for sharing that.
  
## Zoom sharing set-up

[zoom help - make participant the presenter and ask them to share their screen. Guide user to a search engine]

At this point we're going to switch gears now and look at website together. Before you share your screen, let's start by having you open a browser window, whatever you normally use to do searches on the internet. Let me know when you have one open.

Now I'd like you to go back to Zoom and find a "Share screen button" Its usually at the bottom of the screen within a row of buttons and sometimes disappears until you mouse over the bottom area of Zoom. 

Once you click the button and Zoom should ask you which window you'd like to share, it should give you small preview images of the open windows. Look for the browser window that I just had you open and click on it. You may have to click another button to start sharing.

[USER IS SHARING]


## Page sharing warm-up with internet search 
 
I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. I'd like you to imagine that you've been going through a rough time. You'd like to talk to a professional so you're considering looking into counseling options but you're not really sure what's available.

Imagining this situation,

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?
 - Where would you search?
 - What words would you use to get you this type of information?
 
 Ok, thank you for trying that for me.
 

## Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services

I'm going to give you another scenario to consider. Let's imagine that as you're searching, you land on a website that looks promising.

I'm going to send you a link to that website to click on.  It's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

So, I'm going to share the link in the chat window inside Zoom. You may have to find that same row of buttons and find the one that says "chat" or it may be within a "more" button.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp:~2F~2Ff)

I'll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our scenario and imagining that you're looking to talk to a professional one-on-one. 

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what's going through your mind
- If yes, 
   - How did this line up with your expectations 
- If no, 
   - Where you would expect to see that type of care?
   - Would it go by any other name?
- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

#### Things to watch for:
• Where does the participant first click?
• Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?
 
## Task #2 - Find Group counseling services
 
I'm going to change the scenario just slightly. Now imagine that you've heard good things about group therapy.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?
 
[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what's going through your mind
- If yes, 
   - How did this line up with your expectations 
- If no, 
   - Where you would expect to see that type of care?
   - Would it go by any other name?
- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

#### Things to watch for:
• Where does the participant first click?

## Understanding alternative locations

- From the information available on this website, what can you tell me about the Atlanta Vet Center location?

Let's say you're curious if this place has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

[Navigate to the locations - has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

## Ready to visit

Let's imagine that you've had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center and you're interested in one of their services
 
 - What would your next step be?
 - What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?
 - Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?
 

## General website questions

We're almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

 - In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center
 - How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?
 - Are there any types of services or care that you don't think you can get here?
 - What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

 
## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
