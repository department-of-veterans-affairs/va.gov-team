**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I joined the Army in 1989 and got out in 1999.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I&#39;m most familiar with mental health services – counseling. My primary care doctor referred me to the VA for mental health care.

- have you participated in any of these services?

(Individual counseling or therapy and Group counseling or therapy)

- how was that experience?

For most of the time I felt like I was just sitting and listening to what was being said.

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

The first thing I would search for is &quot;counseling help.&quot; Then I would look through the threads that pop up to see which has what I&#39;m looking for.

- What words would you use to get you this type of information?

Counseling help

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)

This looks a lot easier to use than the Washington DC VA page. At the bottom it gives a list of, &#39;services offered here&quot; and that would be a lot more useful than searching for what you want. This looks like it simplifies everything.

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

I would look under either &quot;psychology&quot; or &quot;PTSD treatment&quot;…or &quot;mental health care&quot; – that makes more sense. \*opened the dropdown\* this specifies all of the most common conditions that people would be coming here for. I did not expect this dropdown to be so simplified.

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

Response: It would be good to give more contact info and potentially directions, especially for navigating within the VA, because it can be easy to get lost in the larger centers – or you just aren&#39;t in the state of mind to search around and explore.

It would be good to include phone numbers/names to the various different clinics / contact information for who you&#39;ll need at that particular clinic – rather than a main number that redirects you.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?

**Task #2 - Find Group counseling services**

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re curious about group counseling.

- Is that type of care available here?

It should be since it&#39;s related to mental health care. It should be within the dropdown.

I don&#39;t think &quot;psychology&quot; should be its own dropdown. Most people are going to see that and then keep looking – they&#39;re more likely to click &quot;mental health care.&quot; It could make sense to combine the two.

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

Response: It is always good to keep things simple. If there gets to be too much information or too many big words that go on and on it&#39;ll lose people, or they&#39;ll just skip over it. I think the way it is now is better and simpler than in the past.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click?

**Understanding alternative locations**

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re curious to know if they have other locations.

I would assume there are no other locations because I do not see any listed. \*did not see, &quot;more locations&quot;\*

\*on, &quot;more locations&quot;\* The only thing I don&#39;t see here is shuttle service information. A lot of veterans needs public transportation or VA support. That&#39;ll be one of the first things people are looking for. That information could be between the hours of operation and parking sections.

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

I don&#39;t know much about these locations, but this is what I&#39;d be looking for to see if there are other satellite locations near the main center that is also close to me.

Again, not everyone has transportation so it could be good to include that information for the satellites too. Parking at the DC location is a pain, you&#39;re actually better off taking public transportation there. To figure out which location is closest, I would look up the directions.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

I&#39;m not sure what the difference is, but I&#39;d assume that they offer mostly the same things.

**Ready to visit**

Now that you&#39;ve had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re interested in one of their services

- What would your next step be?

My next step would be to call and make an appointment.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

Based on this site, no.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center

From what I see on this page, it looks cool. It doesn&#39;t look so depressing on the outside as other locations.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

In my opinion, it looks like it would have everything I would be looking for.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

No, not for mental health care. I don&#39;t see mention of a pharmacy, and that&#39;s very important to me. You&#39;d probably have to go somewhere else to pick up what you need and you don&#39;t always want to have to wait 2-3 days before picking up medication for mental health. Knowing that could make me want to look elsewhere for care.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

Apart from the shuttle info and lack of pharmacy, it&#39;s fine.
