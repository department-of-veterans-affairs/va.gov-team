**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I was in the Army from 1984-1992.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

A doctor diagnosed me with my condition, which was not through the VA. Once I went to the VA, I was told that the issue was actually interpersonal. After losing a family member, I went through grief therapy.

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

Since I JUST used the VA, I would use the VA website. It would also be easy to just pick up the phone and call.

- What words would you use to get you this type of information?

Counseling. Counseling services.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

The first thing I see is COVID.

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

Response: Yes, there&#39;s &quot;psychology&quot; and there&#39;s &quot;mental health care.&quot; I would probably start with the mental health option. This system does a good job separating care options so that you don&#39;t feel lumped into one group. I&#39;ve been to group counseling before where people are all grouped together without any distinction for their condition. That&#39;s why I like the groupings on here. The term psychology sounds a little cold – some veterans can be sensitive to labels so they may avoid psychology and just click on mental health.

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

There could be some more information for each of these sections. Maybe a dropdown box would be good to include scheduling or care details. All of the options are listed, but I don&#39;t see anything that tells me who to call or how to contact. I would assume that each of these different care options have different contact info. It could be helpful if the person on the other side of the phone knew you were calling about whatever specific care option you need to avoid the veteran having to admit it.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?

**Task #2 - Find Group counseling services**

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re curious about group counseling.

- Is that type of care available here?

Yes, I see it listed on here.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click?

**Understanding alternative locations**

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re curious to know if they have other locations.

I like how the Google Maps option appears right at the bottom and I like that this 1 page has all of the info you need. When I would go to click on the option to see more locations, I would start with Locations and Contact information – because it is the first one and sounds like what I need.

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

Clicking more locations scrolls you down the page to then click more locations again. I would not have expected that. \*did not realize she navigated to a new page because of the COVID statement\*

\*once on more locations\* This is what I would have expected to see the first time I clicked more locations. I see that it lists the Atlanta VA with the other satellite locations in the surrounding area. The Atlanta VA is the main center, and the rest are smaller.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

It seems like I would need to click on each of these to get more info, but I can&#39;t for that. I would assume that I need to call.

**Ready to visit**

Now that you&#39;ve had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re interested in one of their services

- What would your next step be?

I would&#39;ve clicked the Atlanta Vet Center title. From this page, I would just use the listed phone number and call.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center

This center seems to have a lot of stuff/services. Any vet that is in this area is lucky. A lot of their services seem to be mental health related. It seems more like a primary care facility.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

After noticing how much mental health services they offer I would think there may be certain things, such as blood work, that the center may not be capable of. An older veteran may not realize all of what is offered here because all they see if mental health related care.
