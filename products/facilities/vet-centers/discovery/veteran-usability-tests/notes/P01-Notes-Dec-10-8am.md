**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

It was a really long time ago, &#39;74-&#39;78. For the most part I was stationed in VA Beach.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I personally suffer from PTSD - not related to service. I&#39;ve gone to the VA for mental health services. I started using the VA system about 4 years ago, up until then I did not know I could get care through the VA. Now it&#39;s my primary source of care.

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would go to Google first and start by searching for therapists in my area. I may also call the VA.

- What words would you use to get you this type of information?

&quot;Trauma therapist&quot; or &quot;PTSD therapist&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

\*clicked &quot;services offered here&quot;\* I see it now. I would click &quot;mental health care.&quot; I quickly scanned the page to see if I could find anything with mental health in it.

Feel free to click around.

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations

I think the page is fine, all of the info is here. It all makes sense too,

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

The only thing that jumps out at me would be for specifically woman-centered PTSD care…Oh, I see &quot;women&#39;s veteran care.&quot; It would be nice to have PTSD as an option under &quot;women&#39;s veteran care.&quot; It would also be good if they included the different types if therapy that are available.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?

**Task #2 - Find Group counseling services**

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re curious about group counseling.

- Is that type of care available here?

Yes, I just saw it a moment ago.

A separate note about remote therapy – if you are in remote therapy with video sharing, your space is on display for anyone who&#39;s on the other end. It can feel invasive and impact whether people want to participate.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click?

**Understanding alternative locations**

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re curious to know if they have other locations.

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

It seems like there are specific locations for certain needs that stem from the main location. The main location itself could probably offer just about everything.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

The titles give general or broad terms that describe what they offer, but I&#39;d need more information to know exactly what they offer. I would need more info to determine if any specific location is what I&#39;m looking for. If the offered services could be listed, that would help.

**Ready to visit**

Now that you&#39;ve had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re interested in one of their services

- What would your next step be?

I would click on the main Atlanta vet center to see what&#39;s offered. Once I see what services are offered, I would figure out what I need. To schedule an appointment, I would have to scroll back to the top of the page to find the phone numbers and call. I usually just call and ask for the department that I&#39;m looking for.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

I don&#39;t see anything that would prevent me.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center

It looks like the Atlanta Vet Center covers all of the bases for what would be needed for mental health counseling. I can&#39;t think of any other counseling services that would be needed. It looks like it covers everything.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

Primary care physicians, eye doctors, physical therapy…it says non-medical.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

I don&#39;t think I have any.
