**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I was in the Marine Crop first. Then I joined the Army National Guard in Indiana. I was dual status for a couple years until becoming a recruiter. Afterwards is when I got out – so I did 18 years of service.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I&#39;m familiar with individual and group counseling. I have not done family counseling.

I can&#39;t complain about any of the mental health services I&#39;ve received because they have been critical in my recovery.

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would go to Safari or a search engine and type in, &quot;mental health professionals.&quot; -If I were not an already established patient with someone. It would depend on the situation a little bit – for example, insurance coverage.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

To me, this page seems to be specific to families who are transitioning to the VA, so I&#39;m not use if it is specific to me. I always like to see, &quot;non-medical center&quot; because it is less intimidating to me. I see mental health issues as private and being at a large medical center makes me uncomfortable – so I prefer the non-medical centers. &quot;Free and confidential&quot; are always good to see. Once I see the section about family care, I start to think that this isn&#39;t what I&#39;m looking for. I would probably keep scrolling some but just to check if the rest applies to me.

I like the, &quot;location and contact info&quot; and &quot;prepare for your visit&quot; options. That really helps with anxiety and allows you to prepare. As a veteran with \*condition\* this is really important to me. The options for, &quot;services offered here&quot; and &quot;more locations&quot; are also good. &quot;Why choose a vet center&quot; makes me realize that this is all for a vet center and not a VA hospital. I&#39;ve actually used a vet center before in my area. Being in a vet center alleviates some anxiety because it is not so military oriented. I sometimes question the qualifications of the vet center employees than I do the VA medical center employees. The vet center employees do not seem to have as much of an understanding of with military operation and what that means for vets. One of my counselors at a VA medical center had never served but understood what it meant to be in the military – I did not have that same experience at the vet center.

Other things that would reduce anxiety before going: knowing what you need to bring, having access to medication lists, knowing where you&#39;re going/who you&#39;re visiting, a layout of what to expect if it&#39;s your first visit (especially if you&#39;re doing an assessment to determine future care). Sometimes you end up leaving a little scrambled because you weren&#39;t ready for every aspect of your visit.

Parking – that&#39;s good to have.

\*clicked services offered here\* The options are great, I don&#39;t fit into a lot of those categories, but I personally feel better knowing that there are options for fellow vets who need specialized support. Sometimes you get so caught up in your own issues that you forget about what other people are/could be going through – so having a range of care is good. It&#39;s good to see that the support is there because it is heart breaking to see struggling veterans. I&#39;m grateful for the services that we have.

If I were looking for individual counseling, I would assume that it lives under mental health care. I could also look under psychology or woman&#39;s care too. The psychology tab does a good job explaining the services and description. The Military Sexual Trauma tab is not as great. If I had only read the description here, I wouldn&#39;t even be interested in the care. In the MST tab, I would not list the GWAT and equine therapy group counseling after, &quot;peer group counseling.&quot; I would put &quot;group support&quot; rather than &quot;group counseling.&quot; I think there&#39;s an important difference between the two where counseling is more 1 on 1 and a group is more about support-based – rewording it could help people be more comfortable in a group. There should also be mention of confidentiality and support to help with intimidation. I hate for the group support to be sold short because it was so helpful in my mental health care.

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

Under &quot;Why Choose a Vet Center&quot; the last sentence is worded in a way that makes it seem like confidentiality may be an issue at a VA medical center.

I would make all of the links under, &quot;on this page&quot; bigger to attract more attention. It would also be good to direct people to click on the links so that people are aware that they are live links instead of just statements.

If there&#39;s anything admin related, I would include that here too. For example, if you have to show up 15 minutes early or bring X form. Maybe that is also where you could include the bit about whether there will be an assessment so that people aren&#39;t expecting care/a cure.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?
