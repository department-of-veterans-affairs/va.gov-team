**Intro - 3 minutes**

**Warm-up Questions**

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I went into the military when I was 16. I deployed to Germany and when I came back to the states I was in Arizona. After that I was part of Desert Storm. I requested to stay there but they ended up sending me back to Germany.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I first did one-on-one counseling with a psychiatrist for 6 months. They then referred me to group therapy for 12 weeks. After that I went back to individual counseling - which I am still doing.

**Page sharing warm-up with internet search**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you&#39;re not really sure what&#39;s available.

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

Ever since I signed up for MyHealthyVet I always go on there and message a doctor before I do anything.

- What words would you use to get you this type of information?

The exact words I use would depend on exactly what I&#39;m looking for. I could search by &quot;mental health.&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

Now let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website.

I&#39;m going to send you a link to that website. It&#39;s going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)

\*wanted to click the dropdowns for &quot;benefits counseling&quot; and &quot;About VA&quot;\*

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one.

- Is that type of care available here?

Yes. The page breaks it down into the different areas that they cover. It is laid out pretty clear to show what they offer.

Feel free to click around.

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations

This is definitely what I&#39;d expect. Sometimes pages don&#39;t go into much detail or don&#39;t break down the services into categories the way this page does.

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

I like it just the way it is. Some people like to see pictures, but I just want the information.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click? • Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?

**Task #2 - Find Group counseling services**

Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re curious about group counseling.

- Is that type of care available here?

Yes. It has group therapy, but I&#39;d like to check if it&#39;s the kind I&#39;d be looking for – peer group therapy.

Feel free to click around.

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations

It&#39;s what and where I&#39;d expect.

- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

The service about transitioning to civilian life could be worded to include veterans who have been back in civilian life for a while and are still having trouble.

**Things to watch for:**

• Where does the participant first click?

**Understanding alternative locations**

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re curious to know if they have other locations.

- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?

The other locations are satellite locations to the Atlanta center. They aren&#39;t main facilities, but they can refer. These multiple smaller locations help to reach a wide range of people rather than having everyone congregate to one.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

Most of the are probably for Vet services such as claims. A few have had &quot;American Legion&quot; in the title. That&#39;s known for the paperwork side of things.

**Ready to visit**

Now that you&#39;ve had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;re interested in one of their services

- What would your next step be?

I would start by checking what they offer. If they have what I need then I would call and schedule an appointment or ask if they accept walk-ins. I would also want to get the directions.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

Nothing.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center

I&#39;m not familiar with Atlanta at all. This center looks pretty small, I assume that its not a full center, but they seem to cover a lot of services.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

Bloodwork, ER services, administrative needs (for ID cards, etc…)

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

There are a few cases where changing the wording could make things more clear. The transition counseling is worded as though only a civilian veteran can get the care – that should be more clear.
