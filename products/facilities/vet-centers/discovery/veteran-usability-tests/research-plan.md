# Research Plan: Vet Centers Detail Page - Usability Test  

**December 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goal

The goal of this study is to get high level Veteran feedback on webpage designs to understand if they would have enough information to choose care at a Vet Center.

### Research questions

- How would clients go about searching for counseling and benefit services on a search engine? 

Will the designs provide Veterans with enough information to:
 - understand what care is available at Vet Centers?
 - perceive a difference between Vet Centers and other VA facilities?
 - understand the relationship between a main location and regional satellite offices? 
 - have enough information in order to visit or call a location? 
 - understand how indivual services will be rendered at this particular location vs another facility?

### Hypothesis 

- Clients will be able to find a service and feel they have enough information to choose care at this facility.
- Clients will feel that have adequate logistical information in order to visit or call a Vet Center.
- Clients will understand a Vet Center is not a traditional medical clinic.
