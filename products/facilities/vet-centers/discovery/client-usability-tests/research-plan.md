# Research Plan: Vet Center Client - Usability Test  

**November 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goal

The goal of this study is to get Vet Center Client feedback on high level concepts and information design in order to position Vet Centers accurately according to actual client experiences and opinions so that potential clients feel able to make an informed decision about their own care options.

### Research questions

- How would clients go about searching for services on a search engine? 
From the designs will clients:
 - understand that Vet Centers are different from other VA facilities?
 - understand that they can get care at satellite locations throughout the region? 
 - have enough information in order to visit or call? 
- Do our service descriptions give Veterans the information that they need to make an informed decision about their care?

### Hypothesis 

Clients will feel that have adequate logistical information in order to visit or call assuming they are already familiar with Vet Centers.
Clients will feel that the concepts don't communicate the warmth that they experience at Vet Centers.


## Method

Moderated qualitative research sessions with generative questioning and usability preference testing via Zoom.
