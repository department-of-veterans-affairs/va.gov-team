# Research Plan: Vet Center Product - Usability Test - V2 

**January 2021 Discovery**<br>

## Goal

The goal of this study is to validate whether or not the design changes made to this prototype version improve the usability and understandability of the facility product page content to determine if Veterans have enough information to choose care at a Vet Center.

[Mobile prototype to be tested](https://preview.uxpin.com/1f805ba5adb8ee2152f94a19944cefcb2ddda9cd#/pages/136897449)


### Research questions

Will Veterans:
 - understand what type of care is available at Vet Centers?
 - understand that they cannot get primary medical care at a Vet Center?
 - be able to find the service that they are looking for within the list of taxons?
 - know how to expand a service accordion to get details about individual services?
 - understand the relationship between Vet Center parent and child locations? 
 - understand that not all services are available at child locations? 
 - have enough information in order to visit or call a location? 

### Hypothesis 

- Veterans will understand the types of services offered/not offered.
- Veterans will have enough information to visit a location.
- Veterans will understand next steps for interacting with a Vet Center.
- Veterans will understand that child locations may not have the same services as a parent location.


## Method

- Sessions will combine directed interviewing (to understand participant's context and experience with VA counseling services) and usability testing, with task analysis, of a high-fidelity, **mobile phone prototype** created in UXPin. 
- Sessions will be remotely moderated via Zoom.
 
## Risks and assumptions

This study:
- will not test screen reader, keyboard or other Assistive Technology use; findings may not reveal problems that users with these technological constraints may encounter
- will use a prototype that will differ in how a fully programmed website will behave when a user zooms their browser and under low bandwidth conditions 


## Participants and Recruitment

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for **recruiting and notetaking**.
- We'd like to schedule 16 participants to reach our goal of observing **7-10 participants**.
