**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I was in the Marine Corps from 2010 to 2015. I was deployed to Afghanistan in 2012 – I was a radio mechanic, but I deployed as extra hands for patrols and security. I finished the rest of my tour in San Diego.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

There is a nightmare group (PTSD) where a group of people talk through nightmares once a month.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would Google &quot;VA mental health groups&quot; and see what comes up.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

Yes.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

I would click &quot;counseling services [clicks jump link].&quot; \*clicked mental health dropdown for more information\*

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind.

I would write down the phone number for making appointments and then scroll back up to see when some of these sessions/groups begin before calling.

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations?

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

I&#39;ve got nothing. This looks like it would be easy for me to figure out and understand. It looks well-constructed – there&#39;s a lot on here that I&#39;ve never seen before, even for a prototype. An example of one that stands out is the description of how to get there (prepare for visit section).

It would be good to expand on the telehealth section. I would prefer to do this over the phone so it would be good to know if and when that is available.

Having them listed with dropdowns is helpful when looking for a specific type of care. You can scan across and then get the details after.

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

It is for getting benefits and seeing what you qualify for. \*once dropdown opened\* This is pretty close to what I expected. On other pages you have to dig pretty deep for this information. It may be good to include the details of what could be received from the benefits/types of benefits.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

\*scrolled to top and clicked other locations link…easily found\*

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

They all seem about the same.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

I would expect to be able to get the same services from all locations with the exception of the mobile center.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

\*clicked Orlando Vet Center\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

I would call to schedule an appointment. I don&#39;t think I would need to bring anything for that appointment.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

The hours of operation, which are here. Parking information. \*opened &quot;what to bring&quot;\*

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

If I felt like I needed to be a member, but it says that I don&#39;t need to be enrolled to receive service – so nothing would prevent me. I would also want it to be a friendly environment, and this page makes it seem like it would be.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

It&#39;s a place that veterans can go to get registered for benefits and participating in the services listed here.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

Immediate medical attention. I would assume by the picture that it is not a big canter so probably not x-rays or MRIs or advanced healthcare. I would go here for primary care.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

It would be good to mention that you can be seen here for primary care, I don&#39;t see that anywhere…never mind, I see that it is included here \*found the &quot;who is eligible for care&quot; section\*.

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

\*scrolled to top\* I would either click &quot;VA.gov home&quot; or the VA logo at the top.

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?

No, this all looks pretty cool.
