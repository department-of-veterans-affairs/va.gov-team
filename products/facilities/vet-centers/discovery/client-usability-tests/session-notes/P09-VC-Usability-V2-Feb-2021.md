**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I served in Army special operations. 1 deployment to Iraq and 2 to Afghanistan.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

I am.

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I&#39;ve used both of those at a regular VA and at a Vet Center.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I probably wouldn&#39;t start with the internet; I would start with a peer – probably by texting someone. If I did try on the internet, then I would Google &quot;Veteran Mental Health Counseling&quot; and look for the first VA.gov site to come up.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

The first thing I look at is locations. I see they also have a phone number and an email address. An email would be nice but I&#39;m sure there are HIPPA concerns. The hours of operation render this facility completely useless because that is during work hours.

\*scrolled through dropdowns and quickly/easily found &quot;mental health care&quot;\* I like the options for care here – the science-based options are what I&#39;m looking for, not the yoga options.

\*after seeing women care, minority care, and homeless care\* that makes me feel a little left out. I think that every group should receive their care. I&#39;d like to see specific care for veterans of combat. Maybe prioritize by level of sacrifice for your country.

It is nice to have Vet Centers as part of public areas such as strip malls because some vets, especially Vietnam vets, are not trusting of the government and don&#39;t want to go into a government building. It is important to meet people where they are.

\*referring to mental health care dropdown\* "we have non-traditional hours" yeah, they say that but that's not been the case. I know if you've been to one VA facility, you've only been to one VA facility but this is the second time I've reached out to a Vet Center. Once I finally got in, it was a much better experience. 

In my experience, you cannot get same day help from a Vet Center. Within the past 6 months I called and asked for same day help and there is nothing remotely close to my area that would take me within a week. They say they have non-traditional hours but that is not the case. They are not as flexible as this makes it seem.

Loved the Durham, NC VA

Hated the Raleigh, NC Vet Center

Referred to the D.C. VA as a &quot;dumpster fire.&quot; \*Is there a difference?\*

I would break up the second sentence of the description under Orland Vet Center to be a bulleted list rather than a long sentence.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations

\*mental health care dropdown\* It gets the point across. My preference would be an email instead of phone number. I&#39;m sure there is a HIPPA restriction, but it would be so much easier to just send an email. About half of my day is consumed with phone calls and I don&#39;t want to have to set aside 15 minutes for a call when I can just shoot an email and have someone get back to me. If they have to reach back out by phone, then I&#39;d prefer they email me to schedule a time.

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

I wouldn&#39;t know what &quot;VA Connections&quot; means. \*after opening the dropdown\* that&#39;s good to know but I would go to a VSO for that. Maybe it could be called &quot;VA access&quot; or &quot;how to access VA benefits/healthcare.&quot;

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

\*clicked &quot;other locations&quot; link\* It would be nice to see a map that has pinpoints for each of the locations to give a visual representation.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

I would assume they have the same or similar services but smaller staff. I would assume that the mobile center is an intake center for giving certain locations the opportunity to talk to a vet center.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

\*used back button on phone/web browser\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

Since there isn&#39;t an email address, I have no other choice but to call or go into the Vet Center itself, so my next step would be to call.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

Outside of prior experience, no.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

I would say it is an off-site VA facility that provides mental health care and counseling.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

\*clicked the VA logo\*
