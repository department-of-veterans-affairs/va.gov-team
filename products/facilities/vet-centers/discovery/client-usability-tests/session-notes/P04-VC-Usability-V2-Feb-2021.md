**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I was in the Army reserves for 8 years.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I&#39;ve used the in-person counseling services with the VA.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would Google, &quot;VA counseling services.&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

\*scrolled to &quot;on this page&quot; and then &quot;counseling services&quot;\* Yes, it looks like it is. I saw that is said &quot;counseling services in the on this page section and then under there, I went to the behavioral health counseling [mental health counseling] it gave the types of services and a phone number to schedule an appointment. I would probably just call because it says that I don&#39;t need a referral.



The dropdowns are pretty straightforward to say what they are about.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

You have to scroll through everything to get back to the top of the page and since everything is on the same page there is a lot. It would be nice to have an easier way to navigate back to the top.

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

The VA connections dropdown is a little unclear. I&#39;m thinking that it is for someone who can help you navigate the benefits that you have/are available. Such as a person would helps you with your claims. It would be helpful if they had a name to call them – if I went to a VA hospital and told them that I am looking for VA connections then they may not know what I&#39;m talking about.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

Under locations and contact information is lists the main location information and then has any other locations section that would allow you to see others in the area. If I weren&#39;t in Orlando and wanted to change the location, I don&#39;t see anywhere that I could change the state. Maybe that should be under other locations – a section that gives you other VA locations within the region.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

I think it makes sense the way it is outlined here.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

I would guess that the mobile vet center does not offer the same services as any of the other centers. The rest all look like they offer the same services. I would not want to go to the mobile vet center for mental health services just because it isn&#39;t an actual building.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

\*clicked &quot;Orlando Vet Center&quot; back button\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

I would probably go back to Google and see what other people experience was like at this vet center. I would search &quot;Orlando Vet Center reviews.&quot; It would be important to know if the center had good patient care and customer services. I&#39;d like to see any reviews where they were rude or not helpful to veterans. An example of rudeness or not being helpful would be when you get the feeling that you are a burden to the center and are not getting the answers you came for.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

How far the location is from where I live. Then, I would just look for the phone number to call. I would call the 2800 number under mental health care.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

I can&#39;t think of anything that would deter me.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

Well I&#39;ve never been but based on the pictures it seems pretty inviting. The plants in front and the fact that it seems like it is in a shopping center make it friendly and accessible.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

It seems versatile which I think would be beneficial to a lot of different people.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

No, it prey much seems like it has everything that I would need. I don&#39;t think I would come here for primary care – I don&#39;t think I saw primary care information here.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

Reducing the amount of scrolling to get back to info at the top. I think the blue box information should be moved to the bottom. It is placed in a weird spot.

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

\*VA.gov home back button\*
