**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I was a cook in the Army and served in Germany.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Very much so.

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

One-on-one, an MST group, and PTSD.

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I have done that. I searched for &quot;PTSD&quot; or &quot;Mental health&quot; or &quot;military sexual trauma.&quot;

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

Yes. I would go to the search bar or down to the link that says, &quot;counseling services&quot; or &quot;referral services.&quot; \*clicked counseling services, expanded &quot;mental health care&quot; dropdown\* This is very informative, and it is nicely laid out.

In the &quot;women veteran care&quot; I would expect to find basic health care the pertains specifically to women.

There isn&#39;t really a distinction between bereavement and grief – to me they are the same thing.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind.

Having the phone number to reach out to is good to have.

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations?

It is very well organized, and it is very clear. I&#39;ve seen VA websites that you had to really dig to find anything but this one looks very simple to use.

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

No I think it is laid out very well.

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

I assume the VA Connections dropdown would connect you to outpatient clinics and eBenefits and a list of places that have free or discounted services for veterans. \*opened the dropdown\* These look good. There are other benefits that are missing from this list, such as the housing benefit.

\*looking at &quot;What are Vet Center&quot;\* This is pretty much what a Vet Center is.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

One of the first thing it says is &quot;locations and directions&quot; which gives you the address and the Google Maps map right here. If I wanted to see more, I would click &quot;view additional locations.&quot;

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

These are satellite locations of the Orlando center. I assume they are relatively close by but I&#39;m not familiar with the area.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

I assume the satellite locations have the same services because they are just in different locations.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

\*clicked &quot;Orlando Vet Center&quot; link\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

Once I found the center closest to me, I would click &quot;contact us.&quot; I see that it gives the main number \*looked for a different number\* I guess they would have to direct you from there.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

I don&#39;t think there is anything else to put on the page that I&#39;d need.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

I can&#39;t think of anything that would prevent me from contacting a Vet Center.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

It sounds like there are very caring people who work there. The fact that they have after hours, weekends, and holiday availability gives me that impression.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

Mainly counseling – in either group or one-on-one sessions. They are a support center. They offer information on other services that a veteran may be eligible for.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

Medical care.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

It looks good and complete.

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

**Things to watch for:**

• How does the participant navigate? Breadcrumb? VA.gov logo?

I would go all the way to the bottom where it has &quot;Veteran programs and services&quot; and &quot;More VA resources&quot;
