**Warm-up Questions**

So, to get us started

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

I was in the Marine Corps for 20 years - aviation administration.

**Counseling services**

For the purpose of this session, we&#39;ll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.

- Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

Yes

If yes:

- can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?

I&#39;ve only experienced the one-on-one sessions. I know they also have PTSD and sexual trauma-specific sessions.

- have you participated in any of these services?

**Internet search scenario**

I&#39;m going to give you a scenario to consider.

I&#39;d like you to imagine that you&#39;ve been going through a rough time. You&#39;re considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven&#39;t done before so you&#39;re not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

- Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?

I would probably go to the VA webpage and search for &quot;mental health&quot; to see what came up.

**Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services**

I&#39;m going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let&#39;s imagine that as you&#39;re searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you&#39;re need. Also, for purposes of this session, I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I&#39;ll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you&#39;re looking to talk to a professional one-on-one.

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?

I would think so…it says, &quot;counseling services.&quot; It gives me the impression that there are multiple options for counseling there.

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

\*Scrolled top to bottom a couple times and then clicked the dropdown for services\* I think it is in a perfect place and also then gives me a lot of information. If I wanted to find more information on any particular one, then I would click the plus sign.It is a little deceiving to have to go through each of the other types of care even though most types of care will fall under mental health care. Mental health care should be at the top because it is most common and most important – I just realized that this is in alphabetical order, which it shouldn&#39;t be. If I were looking for counseling, I would go straight to &quot;mental health counseling.&quot;

What is &quot;women veteran care?&quot; I don&#39;t know what specifically this is for or why it would be on this page. I know that there are services that are specific to women, but it seems like the counseling services that are directed to women are already listed above. I think the same thing for &quot;minority veteran care?&quot; I don&#39;t know what that would be for – and I&#39;m a minority. It seems a little offensive to me, what kind of different care would I need just by being a minority? Why segregate the care? More information would definitely be helpful for that.

At first glance it seems like bereavement and grief counseling can be the same thing – but I guess grief can be extended beyond loss.

I would suicide prevention way to the top instead of having it at the bottom – seeing as that is an issue within the military. People who are in those situations don&#39;t want to go through a list to get their information. If I hadn&#39;t gone under &quot;counseling&quot; I don&#39;t know if I would have found it.

\*understood &quot;referral services&quot;\*

- Tell me what&#39;s going through your mind

- If yes,
  - How did this line up with your expectations

- If no,
  - Would it go by any other name?

- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled &quot;VA connections&quot;.

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?

[have user expand an accordion if they haven&#39;t done so]

Maybe it is for doing claims or…I don&#39;t know – it could be a lot of things. \*after clicking\* This is what I&#39;d expect. This is good to have, I would call it &quot;VA benefits&quot; rather than &quot;VA connections.&quot; The title is a little misleading.

**Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations**

For the next task I&#39;d like for you to imagine that you say you&#39;re curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?

\*scrolled back to top…clicked link under other locations\*

- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

They look about the same.

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

I would think they are different – totally. Especially the mobile vet center. The Stanford center looks small so it may be a satellite clinic. The Clermont Vet Center looks like the hospital and administrative center – based on the size. The Melbourne Center looks like part of a strip mall – I would definitely call ahead to make sure they offer the services I need. It does not look inviting; it looks very small. Daytona looks like a full-service clinic. The Lakewood Center looks like a satellite clinic like we have around me.

All of these look good, but you may want to put a different picture of the Melbourne Center.

**Task #3 - Navigating back to main**

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

\*scrolled back to top, clicked &quot;Orlando Vet Center&quot;\*

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you&#39;re interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

From this page? I would probably call them and try to make an appointment – based on this page.

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

It includes parking information and the hours of operation. It tells you what to bring. For me, that is pretty much all I would need. It even includes transportation services.

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?

Nothing would prevent me from contacting them unless the hours of operation don&#39;t align with my needs.

**General website questions**

We&#39;re almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

- In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center

It looks like a full-service clinic that has everything you would need. It seems very sufficient.

- How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?

If I were to use the VA for primary care, I would feel comfortable going here.

- Are there any types of services or care that you don&#39;t think you can get here?

No I don&#39;t think so. If not, it even directs you to where you could get it.

- What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

This is one of the better VA pages. I like it.

**Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov**

- Lastly, let&#39;s imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov&#39;s homepage. How would you do that?

I would click the button that says &quot;VA.gov home.&quot;

**Post-Task Interview**

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?

I like the way this page is laid out, a lot. It is simple and you don&#39;t have to dig around for information. If every page were like this it would make things a lot easier. The only thing I would change is &quot;VA connections&quot; to &quot;VA benefits&quot; to help veterans recognize/find that information.
