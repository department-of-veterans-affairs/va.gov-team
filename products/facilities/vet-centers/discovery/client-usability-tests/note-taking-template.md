## Warm-up Questions 


- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?


## Counseling services 

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.
  
  - Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  
Thank you for sharing that. 
  
## Internet search scenario
 
I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. 

I'd like you to imagine that you've been going through a rough time. You're considering talking to a professional, maybe for some one on one counseling or maybe group counseling. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven't done before so you're not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?
 - Where would you search?
 - What words would you use to get you this type of information?
 
 Ok, thank you for considering that. I'd like you to keep this scenario in mind for the next part.
 
 ## Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services
 
[Share link] 

I'm going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom. You may have to find that same row of buttons and find the one that says "chat" or it may be within a "more" button. As I mentioned before, it's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. And because it is just a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would. 


Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let's imagine that as you're searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you're need. Also, for purposes of this session, I'd like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I'll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

[TASK]


Given this scenario, imagine that you're looking to talk to a professional one-on-one. 

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here at the Orlando Vet Center?
- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?


- Tell me what's going through your mind
- If yes, 
   - How did this line up with your expectations 
- If no,    
   - Would it go by any other name?
- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?

Looking at the other services offered here, I wanted to direct your eye to the box labeled "VA connections". 

- Before clicking on it, if you had to guess, what is this service?


[have user expand an accordion if they haven't done so]

#### Things to watch for:

- Where does the participant first click?

- Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?
 

 ## Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations

For the next task I'd like for you to imagine that you say you're curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?
- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

 ## Task #3 - Navigating back to main

Let's imagine that you're interested in one of the services at the main location. 

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

#### Things to watch for:

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you're interested in one of the services at the main location:

- What would be your next step?

- What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?

- Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?
 

## General website questions

We're almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

 - In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center
 
 If Vet Center client:
 - How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?
 - Are there any types of services or care that you don't think you can get here?
 - How does this website compare or constrast with your own image or idea of a Vet Center?
 - What recommendations do you have for improving this website?
  
 
 If **NOT** a Vet Center client:
 - How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?
 - Are there any types of services or care that you don't think you can get here?
 - What recommendations do you have for improving this website?
 
 
## Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov

Lastly, let's imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov's homepage.

- How would you do that?

#### Things to watch for:
• How does the participant navigate? Breadcrumb? VA.gov logo?
 
## Post-Task Interview

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing
