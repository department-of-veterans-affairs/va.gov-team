https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/meeting-notes/Vet%20Centers.pptx

*Timeline:* 
* Aug-Sept - svcs taxon, research strat dev
* Oct to early 2021 - Vet research and synthesis, editorial research and synth, prototype dev (MVP)
* Early to mid 2021 - scaled deployment to all VCs

JS - Lot of ?s. Probably can’t answer most today. Need to make sure I have the right team. 

Bryan, Elizabeth and others on the call are outreach spec’ists. 

Don’t have web support. Have team from Apdiv (SP?) ready to support. 

We also see active duty svc members and family. May have diff needs. 

From 1st glance, timeline looks good but if we can do anything like get photo of every VC, we can work on those things. I have staff ready. 

You mentioned maintainers — we need to figure out who will maintain these sites. Ofc mgr? Outreach spec’ist? VC director? 

We want to work on how to make this work organizationally. 

Ashley - we can collect content. 

DC - maintainers is thing that concerns me the most from product standpoint. Don’t want to make  extra work for you. Want to partner with whoever is maintaining. 

Leyda is lead researcher and designer. We can figure out low hanging fruit… Also data calls. 

Outreach spec’ists’ job is to get out to community and make connections. Websites for VCs cd be a tool, especially now with COVID bc not as much contact with Vets.

DC - Seeing how we can grow the product past MVP. 

JS - if our outreach ppl ID a need that Vets don’t say, can we work to meet both? 

DC - yes, and event calendar is on our list (JS’s example). Might be a “not yet.”  Press release is another example. 

DC - finding balance between Vet needs, what org needs, what we can scale. Poss leverage things from other parts of VA.gov. Vets will always come 1st. 

*Leyda’s questions…* 
Want baseline understanding of all we know today b4 building the 360 view of the taxonomy. 

*1) Definition of a Vet Ctr.*
JS - Tech we have 300 physical brick and mortar VCs.
* 18 or 19 “out stations” — step down, bit smaller, might be open 4d a week. 
* 990 comm’y access points — donated space. Church, YMCA, etc donates space for our counselor. 1 time/week or few times a month. 
* Mobile VCs for community events, used for disasters. They support all VCs in the area. They are assigned, the MVC and the driver, to a specific VC but they support every VC within a particular *catchment area* but also do emergency response. 

Some VCs are in medical plazas. All VCs look and feel diff. 

*Important to differentiate the diff types?* 
> JS - not seeing need with out stations. Community access points — check in with your local VC bc we might have a counselor closer than you think. Fluctuates freq. 

> Ken - outreach spec’ist. I wd say the main thing is location. VC in populated area but just having the community access points listed on website wd be good. Needs to be up to date. Ofc mgr, 1 or 2 therapists. 

> Out station - need to figure out if person who maintained Salt Lake wd also maintain the comm’y page. 

> Ken - they don’t have a director. 

> Bryan - MVCs are really underutilized. Some VCs use them often; others don’t. They are often used as mobile billboards. Primary duty is emergency response. Can use as clinical spc. Find way to ID MVCs, looking at how to expand that — include their *catchment* areas. 

*What is a “catchment area”?*
> Catchment area so if VC is in Nashville, it is for a large portion of TN. So MVC wd be in charge of gg throughout that catchment area. We go out and try to find ppl in those areas rather than wait for them to come in. 

*2) Is this an accurate list of svcs?* 
> JS - yes, that is our primary list. Do believe that captures all. 

> JS - RE: Marriage and Family Counseling. “Family” might not seem inclusive. Need to be inclusive. 

> Elizabeth - Shifted to saying “Employment Svc Referral” so we can say we are putting resume (referring?) 

> JS - yes, these shd be offered at all VCs. Might be shift in focus. Might be more svcs. Trips, recreational activs cd be diff per VC. 

*LH - do these svcs differ on when they take effect?* 
> JS - main focus is those eligible wd receive any svcs that wd help benefit them. If they meet eligibility criteria, they cd use. 

*MM - is there overlap with these svcs?* 
> JS - depending on indiv need. Might need to be referred. 

> Bryan - Vet cd come in for substance abuse, we work with med ctr to make sure they get treatment. 

> JS - if need substance abuse help, wd they 1st go to med ctr or to VC?

*MM - Need to know how these things coexist in a list or do they need to be diff?* 

> DC - yes, gets to nuances with svcs offered in the overlap.  Need to test that understanding with Vets. 

> JS - it’s really the eligibility, too. If they need assistance is 1st ?, then need another ? Might be elig for our svcs but not for VA healthcare svcs. Like active duty svc member. Or family we will help thru deployment with counseling. 

> Is your loved one on active duty? If yes, then go to VC svcs. 

> Character of discharge is another factor (ex: dishonorable). Might not be eligible for VA HC but can get VC counseling. So system should direct them.

> JS - crucial to map that out. Hurricane Katrina and COVID cd add another layer per upcoming legislation. 

*LH - Who is eligible for svcs?* 
> Bryan - anyone who served overseas, anyone in a war theater. Or area of hostility. Things gg on overseas might not have defined… We analyze that on invid basis. 

> Bryan - Who is eligible is based on:
* Area of hostility 
* Campaign or war
* Sexual trauma
* Drone crews
* Mortuary svcs, casualties of war
* Svcs to fam membs. 
* Expeditionary medal. 
* Primarily focused on trauma work. 

*LH - is this really the 1st touch point?* 
> JS - not sure if that is true. 
> 
> Eliz - we watch this and it’s about 50-50 or 60-40 of us being the very 1st VA ppl they have ever spoken to. Lot of ppl from Nat’l Gd and universities. Us seeing them in the community is the first contact with VA. 

> DC - Vietnam Vets may not engage with a VC 1st. 

> JS - With Vietnam Vets, they refuse to engage with VA in general. 

*DC - who should we contact? We have more ?s.* 
> JS - it’s the group on the line now, maybe not Apdiv team yet. 

*DC - Want to set up a follow-up. Will send any ?s in advance.*
