### User Journey
- Vet Centers are community-based counseling centers which provide a wide range of counseling, outreach, and referral services to eligible Veterans, active duty service members and their families. 
- Vet Centers guide Veterans and their families through many of the major adjustments in lifestyle that often occur after a Veteran returns from combat. 
- Vet Center benefits never expire so Veterans can be engaged in services off/on or continuously throughout the journey. 

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*
- As a Veteran, I need to search for services so that I can successfully transition from military to civilian life or find assistance after a traumatic event.
- As a family member of an active duty service member, I need to find supportive services for issues related to my loved one's military experience. 

### Project Rationale
_Why should this project be a priority?_ 
- In addition to 300 stand-alone (not integrated into VAMC health care systems) Vet Centers, the VHA runs 
  - ~ 18 outstations (small physical locations, like Vet Centers)
  - ~ 1000 community access points (donated space at community partners
  - 83 Mobile Vet Centers (MVC) which are used for outreach and community disasters
- Vet Centers are under-utilized and under-promoted benefit/service for Veterans, even through they are often the first touchpoint an active service member and/or family has with the VA.
- Currently, Vet Centers do not have an online presence beyond the minimal information found on the Facility Detail pages within Facility Locator. They need to leverage the social media accounts (etc) of community partners or Public Affairs Officers at VA Medical Centers to promote activities
- Outreach coordinators at each Vet Center are tasked with creating awareness/promotion about the services in their community and digital presence will help with this, especially during this time of limited face-to-face. 

**Business drivers**
- Jessica Schiefer (VHA Vet Center Communications Officer) and selected team of representative Outreach Specialists 
  - Bryan Doe (Springfield, MA)
  - Elizabeth Jackson (Orlando, FL)
  - Ken Milam (Escanaba, MI)
  - Austin Wilmarth (Colorado Springs)
  - Troy Stormoen (Reno, NV)
- Aptive (vendor: asssting with data collection and organization from the technical side)

### Project Scope and Scale
_What's in and what's out?_

**3Q 2020**
- By establishing Veteran facing taxonomy for services offered at Vet Centers during 3Q 2020, we can support our long term goal of enhancing the online presence for Vet Centers 

### Not currently in scope

### Measuring Success

### Dependencies
_Are other features dependent on this one? What do we need from partners? What do we need outside of engineering?_
- Availability of Jessica Schiefer and team to support our discovery process. 
- Coordination with CMS 
   - The CMS team will need to add taxonomy to Drupal for single source of truth
   - A handful of Vet Centers exist in TeamSite as part of the VHA Meidcal Center websites. 
- Detail pages with entries in Lighthouse API
- Pages within the Legacy Finder will need to be sunset. 
- Aptiv: This vendor will be asssting with data collection and organization from the technical side
  
### Risk factors
 
### Rejected Solutions

### Definition of Done
- Vet Center Facility Detail pages include a comprehensive, accurate list of services in Veteran facing language.
- Veterans/active service members/families can search for services using standard taxonomy. 
- Vet Center services are aligned with existing health service taxonomy.
