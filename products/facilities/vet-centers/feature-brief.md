### User Journey
- Vet Centers are community-based counseling centers which provide a wide range of counseling, outreach, and referral services to eligible Veterans, active duty service members and their families. 
- Vet Centers guide Veterans and their families through many of the major adjustments in lifestyle that often occur after a Veteran returns from combat. 

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*
- As a Veteran, I need to search for services so that I can successfully transition from military to civilian life or after a traumatic event.
- As a family member of an active duty service member, I need to find supportive services for military-related issues.

### Project Rationale
_Why should this project be a priority?_ 
- The VHA runs 300 Vet Centers which are stand-alone, not integrated into VAMC health care systems.  
- Vet Centers are under-utilized and under-promoted benefit/service for Veterans, even through they are often the first touchpoint an active service member and/or family has with the VA.
- Currently, Vet Centers do not have an online presence beyond the minimal information found on the Facility Detail pages within Facility Locator. 

**Business drivers**
- Jessica Schiefer (VHA Vet Center Communications Officer) has expressed an interest in partnering on this initiative.
