# VA.gov Facilities & Services Product Portfolio

**Product Owner:** Michelle Middaugh (Suzanne.Middaugh@va.gov)

## Why VA facilities and services matter to Veterans

- Veterans associate their VA benefits and health care journey with where they go to receive help and care.

- VA facilities humanize VA by demystifying "the VA black box" and by delivering in-person services and support.

- Veterans' mental models for VA benefits and health care start with the task they are trying to complete (e.g., get disabiltiy benefits), the service they are looking for (e.g., career counseling), or the condition they are experiencing (e.g., depression). 

**Why this matters to VA**

VA has a responsibility to provide accurate VA facilities and VA services information to its customers--and that align with the Veteran experience of getting and managing their VA benefits and health care.

## Product vision

1. VA will provide a single, high-quality facility web page for each VA facility

2. Users can find all VA facilities, both VA-operated facilities and in-VA network facilities, based on their current geographical location, another starting/preferred location, or the VA.gov page they are on

3. Users can find all VA services, both VA services and in-VA network services, based on their current geographical location, another starting/preferred location, or the VA.gov page they are on

4. VA facilities and VA services are contextually presented to users based on the VA.gov page they are on
