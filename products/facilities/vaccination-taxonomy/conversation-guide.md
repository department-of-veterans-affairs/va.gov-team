## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Chris, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding vaccination information on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to make sure that vaccination information is easy to find on VA.gov. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Now I'll give you a quick overview of today's session.
- First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.

- Then I will share my screen to show you a health services page on VA.gov. This is just to show how services are displayed, before we start the main part of the session.

- After that I will send you a link to a web page. On that page, I will take you through 6 quick tasks. The goal of these tasks is for me to understand where you would most likely look for vaccine information on the page.

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?

- Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past couple of years, or perhaps before the pandemic?
    - If yes, can you tell me about that?
    
- Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years? Can you share any reasons behind your decision?


## Health Services Page - 5 minutes

Thank you! Now I want to and show you the webpage I mentioned that is on the VA.gov website.

I'm sharing my screen - do you see a web page with the title Health Services? Great. I want to walk through this example of how health services are shown on VA.gov. 

###### MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN OF HEALTH SERVICES PAGE
[Link to Health Services page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/pittsburgh-va-medical-center-university-drive/) --> Podiatry
This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. There are several categories, and just as an example, I am showing the section on Podiatry. Each section has a description of what is treated, like arthritis, bunions, and other foot care. Below that is information on location, contact information and making appointments.
 

## Card Sort - 35 minutes
<em>Zoom sharing set-up</em>

<em>zoom help - make participant the presenter and ask them to share their screen.</em>

At this point we're going to switch gears now and look at a website together. Before you share your screen, let's start by having you open a browser window, whatever you normally use to do searches on the internet. Let me know when you have one open.

Now I'd like you to go back to Zoom and find a "Share screen button" It's usually at the bottom of the screen within a row of buttons and sometimes disappears until you mouse over the bottom area of Zoom. 

Once you click the button, Zoom should ask you which window you'd like to share, it should give you small preview images of the open windows. Look for the browser window that I just had you open and click on it. You may have to click another button to start sharing.

I am going to send you a link, and we will go through the tasks I mentioned.
I will send it to you via the chat function within Zoom. The chat button is also usually within the bottom row of buttons as a button on its own, shown as chat or under a more button.

**USER IS SHARING**

**BE PREPARED TO MODERATE THIS IF USER HAS DIFFICULTIES**


- This page looks very different from the VA page we just visited, but imagine that we are looking at the same page, where the health services are shown on the right. 

- We’re going to do a sorting exercise. On the left hand side you will see cards with vaccines or immunizations displayed on them. I will give you a task for each vaccines or immunization type. All you need to do is move the card into one of the health service boxes on the right. These boxes represent the place on the website where you would expect to find information about that vaccine or immunization. 

 - And if none of the groups on the right seem like the best place, you can also create your own group and call it by a name that makes sense to you. You can do this by dragging the vaccine card to the open area outside of the health services boxes.

 - Now, it looks like there are a lot of cards to move from the left side. Each type of vaccines or immunization actually comes with an extra card which is optional. They are there only in case you would expect to find vaccine information in more than one place on the right. You can use the extra cards for that, but you don't have to. 

- As you sort these cards, if you could share your thoughts out loud while you work, that would be great. That will help me to follow along.

###### BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

### Task 1 Scenario

For the first task, I’d like you to imagine that you are planning to get your annual Flu vaccine or shot, and would like to read information on the Flu vaccine provided by VA.gov:

- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Flu vaccine card to the place on the right where you would look to find more information. And if could share your thoughts as you decide, that would help me follow along.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting the Flu vaccine?

Would you search for flu or influenza?

Have you had the flu vaccine? 
    - <em>(If yes, received vaccine)</em> When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? Pharmacy visit? Town hall or other community-based vaccination program? (Ask for each of the vaccines that the participant states having received). Have you gotten the flu vaccine at other locations outside of the VA?


### Task 2 Scenario

For this second task, imagine that it has been many years since you last had a Tetanus shot, also known as a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), and would like to know more about how to receive this shot:
In which group on the right would you look to find Tetanus, or Tdap, shot information? 
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Tdap shot card to the space on the right where it makes the most sense to you.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot?

Have you received the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine or immunization / Do you know if you have received a Tdap booster?

<em>If no or don't remember</em>: Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit?

<em>If Yes</em>: When you received it, was it part of a VA visit?



### Task 3 Scenario

Great! I have one more task with the tetanus vaccine or immunization. Imagine that it has been a few years since your last Tetanus booster. You have had a minor injury and think you might need a Tetanus booster.
Which group on the right would you search in for Tetanus booster information? Talk me through your thought process. 
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Tetanus-for-injury shot card to the place on the right where it makes the most sense to you.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot? 

Have you experienced this type of need in the past and received care?
<em>If yes</em> - When did you receive it, and how did you receive the care?



### Task 4 Scenario

For this next task, I’d like for you to imagine that you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine or immunization, its availability, and where you might go to receive it:

Which group on the right would you look in to find COVID-19 vaccine information? Talk me through your thought process. 
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the COVID-19 vaccine card to the space on the right where it makes the most sense to you.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization?

Would you search for Coronavirus vs COVID? 



### Task 5 Scenario

For this task, imagine that you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine or immunization once you have reached a certain age. You would like to know if the VA provides this service:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would look in to find Shingles vaccine information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Shingles vaccine card to the right to the place where it makes the most sense to you.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization?

Have you gotten or plan to get the shingles vaccine? Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit?
    - <em>(If yes, received vaccine)</em> When you received it, was it part of a VA visit?


### Task 6 Scenario

For the last task, imagine you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccines or immunizations you need before going:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would search in to find travel-related vaccine information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Travel-Related Vaccines card to the space on the right where you expect to find more information.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):</em>

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting travel-related vaccines or immunizations?

Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit?

Thank you! That is it for the tasks! As a small favor, would you mind clicking on the Finished button? That just closes out the card sort.



## Post-Task Questions - 5 minutes

In these tasks, you saw or heard words such as vaccines, vaccination, immunization, shot. What words connect with you? Did we miss any?

That is it - thank you for going through these with me today. It is really helpful as we try to make improvements to the VA.gov website.
- Any questions for me? 

<em>COVID-19 Vaccine information - in the case of any questions by the participant about the COVID-19 vaccination.</em>

There's a lot going on with vaccines right now as I'm sure you're aware. VA has a web page that they are updating regularly with information about vaccine plans including answers to lots of questions.

https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/

<em>From the Stay Informed page</em>

You can also sign up for an easy way to stay informed about our COVID-19 plans. When you sign up, we'll also ask about your interest in getting a vaccine when one is available to you. 

https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/stay-informed

## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we work to make vaccine information easy to find for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
