## Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy #17522
The Facilities and VAOS teams need better understanding of the process for searching for community care providers to inform the PPMS taxonomy work and to improve the Veteran search experience. 

## What we need to do

- Learn how we can support Veterans who search for vaccination services.

## Goals

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs

- Where in the VHA taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching for vaccination-related services?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching - such as

- Vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot

- Flu or influenza

- Coronavirus vs COVID

- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - COVID vaccination/testing
