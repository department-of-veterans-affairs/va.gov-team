# Research Findings: Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy

## Research Goals 

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs.

## Research Methodology 

Remote, moderated card sorting sessions were conducted via Zoom.

### Who we talked to
We spoke with 9 Veterans:

* All had visited a VA facility for health care over the last one to two years.
* Ages 35 to 74
* 5 in major metropolitan areas, 4 in rural areas
* 5 female, 4 male
* 7 Caucasian, 1 Asian, 1 Hispanic/Latino/Spanish Origin
* Diverse levels of education (some college to Master's degree)
* 8 had a disability rating of 70% or higher

### Research Questions

- Where in the VHA taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
- What words do Veterans use when searching - such as
  - Vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot
  - Flu or influenza
  - Coronavirus vs COVID
- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - COVID vaccination/testing

### Interview Sessions

The sessions were structured as follows: 
- To provide context to the participants in preparation for the card sort, the moderator shared an example of a Health Services page. Participants gained an understanding of how health services are structured into categories, as well as the type of information contained in each.
- Participants were then asked to share their screen and open the web page containing the card sorting exercise.  
  - On the left side were cards with the names of vaccine types displayed: Influenza, Tetanus (used in two separate scenarios), COVID-19, Shingles, and travel-related vaccinations.
  - On the right side of the page, the following categories were displayed: Primary Care, Urgent Care, Emergency Care, Specialty Care, and Other Services.
  - Participants were given a scenario for each vaccine type, and then asked to move the appropriate card(s) into one or more of the categories on the right where they expected to find information about the vaccine. 
  - If none of the categories on the right seemed appropriate, participants had the option to create their own category and assign a a name that made sense to them.
  - Each scenario included an extra card to use if participants expected to find vaccine information in more than one category.
  - Scenarios were followed up with questions to better understand participants' thought process behind selections, the information they expected to see, and their own real-world experience with the vaccine (if applicable), either with the VA or with an external provider, and what terms they would use to search for that particular vaccine.
- Following the card sort, participants were asked what terms for vaccines they would use (vaccine, vaccination, immunization, shot, or other terms that weren't used in the card sort).   

## Findings

### Key Findings

1. The majority of Veterans associated COVID-19 as a unique event, and most expected to see COVID-19 information in Other Services, or in its own category.
2. Most Veterans expected routine vaccinations, such as Influenza, Tetanus (Tdap), and Shingles to be part of an existing care visit (Primary Care). 
3. Veterans all connected and expected to use terms such as vaccine, vaccination and shot, and expected those terms to be seen on VA.gov.
4. Most Veterans found terms such as Flu and Influenza to be interchangeable, but expected to use Flu.
5. Most Veterans expected to use search terms COVID or COVID-19, but not Coronavirus when searching COVID-19 vaccine-related information.
6. Veterans' expectations on where to find information depend on the type of vaccine.

### Details of Findings

#### 1. The majority of Veterans associated COVID-19 as a unique event, and most expected to see COVID-19 information in Other Services, or in its own category.
Almost half of participants categorized COVID-19 vaccine information under Other Services. 
> In my mind COVID-19 to the extent of our experience, this is a one time event. Now I don’t know if we are on a curve or will be annual, it is an extraordinary thing. COVID may become routine as well but for me the COVID-19 is extraordinary for a lot of reasons and its infancy. In the list of things to go to the doctor for, this is a unique event in my mind.

> I would go to other services, they probably have so much going on with it, it is probably under a different category when you pull up the main va.gov page.

> I would start looking in other services. Well the way I saw people getting the vaccine today. They run a little clinic, it’s not primary care, it is a nurse. You go and sign in and get your shot but you get information about the second shot and the adverse reactions that could be experienced. It is another service, from what I saw in the Baltimore va today.

Other participants who associated COVID-19 as a unique event created an entirely new category for COVID-19 information.
> "Vaccine information," [and] it could be under other services so they could be mirrored, because vaccines can be an entire separate entity.

> "COVID-19," [and] I could could mention emergency care with a link from one to another.

#### 2. Most Veterans expected vaccinations such as Influenza, Tetanus (Tdap), and Shingles to be part of an existing care visit (Primary Care).
> Primary care, It is more convenient because I see them twice a year and during my visit it is the flu season.

> Primary Care, to me it makes sense because you go to them prior to specialty clinics. If I am up for shots I call them and then I go in to get it done. 

> Normally I use primary care they keep up on the vaccines you need on your chart and know if you are due for one.

For an injury-related need that might require a Tetanus shot, most Veterans would look under Urgent Care. If the injury were more serious, they expect to see information under Emergency Care.

#### 3. Veterans all connected and expected to use terms such as vaccine, vaccination and shot, and expected those terms to be seen on VA.gov.

#### 4. Most Veterans found terms such as Flu and Influenza to be interchangeable, but expect to use Flu.

#### 5. Most Veterans expected to use search terms COVID or COVID-19, but not Coronavirus when searching COVID-19 vaccine-related information.

#### 6. Veterans' expectations on where to find information depend on the type of vaccine.
Many Veterans associate certain age-based vaccines, risk-based vaccines, and seasonal vaccines, to be part of their primary care. 

Veterans expect to find COVID-19 vaccine-related information outside of primary care information.

## Additional Insights 

1. Veterans generally expected one of two types of information about the COVID-19 vaccine:
  - Information on how to sign up for the vaccine, where they would receive it, and what priority groups they would be a part of.
  - Information about the vaccine itself, its effectiveness, possible side effects and whether and when a second shot should be received.
2. A couple of Veterans expect to find COVID-19 vaccine-related information under more than one category
  - One expected to find information under Primary Care and Urget Care.
  - One expected to find information under Other Services and Specialty Care.
3. The majority of Veterans receive vaccines at least periodically. The Flu and Tetanus shots are the most commonly received.
4. Many Veterans receive vaccines regularly. 
5. A couple of Veterans are vaccine-hesitant.

## Recommendations

* Add a dedicated, easy-to-spot content section for COVID-19 vaccine information on Health Services pages. This will help Veterans locate the information, regardless of which category they anticipate would contain COVID-19 vaccine information. Cross-link to this content from other content
* In the COVID-19 section, provide two types of information:
    - Information about how and when to sign up for a vaccine (or sign up to be notified when that information is available), what to expect, and contacts for further information. 
    - Information on the vaccines themselves, including facts about COVID-19, vaccine benefits, effectiveness and possible side effects.
* Include vaccine-related information in the Primary Care category, but include Tetanus shot information in Urgent Care and Emergency Care for Veterans who have an injury.
* There is the possibility that events for certain vaccines, such as Influenza or Shingles, will be held outside of a primary care visit. Display information at a top level on the facility page about the event, and cross-link to the information from other categories such as Primary Care.

## Next Steps

* Implement design decisions
* Share findings with other teams and stakeholders
