**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

•	Can you tell me a little about your service history? 

I am an air force veteran, I retired after 21 years. I was stationed all over the place, Europe for 10 years and involved in the Gulf War and Bosnian War. 

•	Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past year? 

Yes, I use the Va for all of my healthcare. 

•	Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years? Can you share any reasons behind your decision? 

I don’t think so, is tetanus considered a vaccine. Yes I had a tetanus shot. Is shingles considered one, I had it about a year ago. I had fell and got cut so the tetanus thing was needed and I got shingles frequently so the doctor suggested that I get the vaccine. 

**Health Services Page - 5 minutes**

Thank you! Now I want to and show you the webpage I mentioned that is on the VA.gov website.
I'm sharing my screen - do you see a web page with the title Health Services? Yes. 
Great. I want to walk through this example of how health services are shown on VA.gov.

MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN OF HEALTH SERVICES PAGE

Link to Health Services page --> Podiatry This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. There are several categories, and just as an example, I am showing the section on Podiatry. Each section has a description of what is treated, like arthritis, bunions, and other foot care. Below that is information on location, contact information and making appointments.

BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

**Task 1 Scenario**

For the first task, I’d like you to imagine that you are planning to get your annual Flu vaccine or shot, and would like to read information on the Flu vaccine provided by VA.gov:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary care and other services. Primary care is when you go to the doctors, that’s the first question they ask. My doctors is adamant to get one so they send you out to get one. Maybe under other services as well, maybe there is something where they list vaccines. People that don’t use the va as primary care but only for the vaccines they would look under other services. 

- Would you search for flu or influenza? 

I would probably do flu. 

- Have you had the flu vaccine? - When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? Pharmacy visit? Town hall or other community-based vaccination program?  

I didn’t get it this year yet. I forgot, I didn’t even think of it as a vaccine, I got it last year but not this year yet. Last year was part of the VA visit. I figure if I am going there for my primary care appointment I would get it then. 

- Outside of the va in the past: 

no. 

**Task 2 Scenario**

For this second task, imagine that it has been many years since you last had a Tetanus shot, also known as a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), and would like to know more about how to receive this shot: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

The same as the flu, primary care, and other services. 

- Same reasonings: 

Yeah. Normally because I use primary care they keep up on the vaccines you need on your chart and know if you are due for one. In my case I had fell so I needed to get one. 

- Outside of the one you got for the injury, do you get them regularly: 

No I had fell and hit some metal and fractured my wrist. I am not accident prone so. 

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

No because I would try to avoid it because it hurts. I wouldn’t even think of looking at vaccines, after having so many in the military I try to avoid them. I don’t like to get anything. 

**Task 3 Scenario**

Great! I have one more task with the tetanus vaccine or immunization. Imagine that it has been a few years since your last Tetanus booster. You have had a minor injury and think you might need a Tetanus booster. 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I like I would put that in urgent care and emergency care. Like when I fell, usually I had to go to the ER then there they give you the tetanus shot. The same with urgent care. 

- One more likely: 

Probably in the emergency care more. The VA where I am at don’t have an urgent care they only have the ER. 

- Have you experienced this type of need in the past and received care? 

Yes

- When did you receive it, and how did you receive the care? 

The ER at the VA. 

**Task 4 Scenario**

For this next task, I’d like for you to imagine that you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine or immunization, its availability, and where you might go to receive it:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I would look under specialty care and other services I would look to. Specialty care because it is new and just came out, they might have something there to let you know how to get it and maybe under other services. I have asked the primary care about COVID but not the vaccine. They all referred me to the ER and they didn’t really figure it out. I guess specialty care because it is something new that they haven’t dealt with. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization? 

I would hope to see how you find out when the VA you are at will be starting to administer it and how to go about scheduling it if you need an appointment. More than likely you will but I haven’t looked at it myself yet. I guess it would tell you if you needed to contact your primary care or if they have a special clinic for it, I assume it will be a mass amount of people so they must have a system but you don’t need to stand inline for a vaccine. 

- Of the two, would you want the same information in both areas: 

yes and who you need to call, primary care or the special clinic for the shots. 

- Would you search for Coronavirus vs COVID? 

I would look for both words. 

**Task 5 Scenario**

For this task, imagine that you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine or immunization once you have reached a certain age. You would like to know if the VA provides this service: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary care I am not sure if I would put it somewhere else. I guess you can put it under specialty care as well for a specific condition, like if you are experiencing shingles contact your primary care. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization? 

They have an age thing if you are over the age and I don’t know what else. Maybe if you have any allergies, I don’t know if there are any allergies to that vaccine. 

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit?   

It was part of my VA visit. I think I had to come back to get it, I know you have to get two vaccines for that and they set it up to come back. I can’t remember why I got it. I cant remember if it was in the lab or the office. 

**Task 6 Scenario**

For the last task, imagine you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccines or immunizations you need before going.

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I went to Honduras a few years ago and I had the appointment and asked if I needed any vaccines before I went to those countries. I asked my Primary care doctor and looked up the countries to see what was required. I had to get hepatitis. Maybe put it in other services for travel related. 

- Tell me about other services: 

I am not sure what is under other services. Is this other services for va hospital or vaccines. 

- What would you expect: 

I guess travel issues, how to get health care in another country especially if you use the VA and have an emergency issues and vaccines needed. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting travel-related vaccines or immunizations? 

I guess travel issues, how to get health care in another country especially if you use the VA and have an emergency issues and vaccines needed.

- Same information: 

under primary care I would just look at the vaccines, under other services more infomration about how to get medical help in a foreign country. 

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

I am not sure, that was like 3 years ago. I think it was actually part of my normal visit that’s when I go for my checkup. I probably brought it up to my primary care doctor. I use the VA for all of my healthcare. 

**Post-Task Questions - 5 minutes**

• Any questions for me? 

Nope. I really like the VA’s healthcare and am very pleased with it.
