**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

•	Can you tell me a little about your service history? 

I went in the Marine corps at 17 and spent 3.5 years in and got out due to a second pregnancy. Tried to be a civilian for a year but didn’t adjust well so I went to the national guard and became a federal technician then went active guard reserve as a recruiter. I have 18 years of service and now out for 12 years. I am 70% but are unemployable so I get 100% benefits. 

•	Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past year? 

I was there Monday so yes. Things are very tight and straight right now. A big change is that they use to have valet parking but that has been gone for awhile now which is understandable and then how you enter has been changed. You8 have to use a mask from them, you need a date label so there’s a sticker for that then an appointment and screened, vitals are taken to ensure you are not running a fever. 

•	Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years? Can you share any reasons behind your decision? 

I am going to say no but I don’t know when my last tetanus was. If I did it would have been that one because its ever 10 years but I don’t remember when I had the last. I don’t get the flu shot so I don’t get that. Tetanus because it has been something I had on a regular basis for years now, I feel like it is something. I feel like there is a risk for it. The flu shot I have taken in the past and got sick from it and there has been many years I have not got the flu so I don’t want to introduce my body to something that I haven’t really gotten. 

**Health Services Page - 5 minutes**

Thank you! Now I want to and show you the webpage I mentioned that is on the VA.gov website.
I'm sharing my screen - do you see a web page with the title Health Services?  

Yes

Great. I want to walk through this example of how health services are shown on VA.gov.

MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN OF HEALTH SERVICES PAGE

Link to Health Services page --> Podiatry This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. There are several categories, and just as an example, I am showing the section on Podiatry. Each section has a description of what is treated, like arthritis, bunions, and other foot care. Below that is information on location, contact information and making appointments.

BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

**Task 1 Scenario**
For the first task, I’d like you to imagine that you are planning to get your annual Flu vaccine or shot, and would like to read information on the Flu vaccine provided by VA.gov:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?  

Primary care, I would say that has to do with general/overall health. So I would contact primary care.

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting the Flu vaccine? 

I would say either walking or appointment and the locations where they could be or if you need to go into primary care clinics and a descriptions to possible side effects and a point of contact incase there’s an issue

- Have you received it: 

No

- Would it be a VA or somewhere else: 

I would add it to my VA visit.

- Would you consider elsewhere like a community based programs: 

I am not sure; I have not researched into it so I don’t know the locations or hours or cost. I don’t know enough infomration about the local places. I guess I would find it and see which was the best fit for me. 

**Task 2 Scenario**

For this second task, imagine that it has been many years since you last had a Tetanus shot, also known as a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), and would like to know more about how to receive this shot: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary Care, once again as it says it is routine, part of general health. People normally stay on top of it for when it needs to be updated. I would discuss that with my primary care doctor when there for an appointment and find out when I need it again and make sure I can take care of it when needed. 

- Have you received the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine or immunization / Do you know if you have received a Tdap booster? 

I am not sure if it has been 5 or 2 years ago. I would have to look at my record and see what it says. 

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

Regular visit, it is something that is reviewed and discussed during a routine appointment. When I go we go through the labs, urine checks, they are thorough with the head to toe checkup. We cover vaccines, blood work, any pains, and things like that. 

**Task 3 Scenario**

Great! I have one more task with the tetanus vaccine or immunization. Imagine that it has been a few years since your last Tetanus booster. You have had a minor injury and think you might need a Tetanus booster. 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Urgent care and emergency care, If there is an injury I would say you need to seek urgent or emergency care. Maybe there’s an injury you can wait to see primary care but ill go with it needed immediate attention. It would be urgent or emergency care. If it is an injury that could cause tetanus you would get the shot then but those are the two I would expect it to be. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot, same information in both: 

I think so because that would be doctor recommended depending on the type of injury.

- What type of information: 

That it is available depending on the doctors orders. Not everyone that goes in will need it so it will be determined after being looked at. It could be listed as a treatment option available if a doctors sees need be. 

- Have you experienced this type of need in the past and received care?  

No. I broke my foot but when to an urgent care outside of the VA. 

**Task 4 Scenario**

For this next task, I’d like for you to imagine that you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine or immunization, its availability, and where you might go to receive it:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Other services and emergency care, I think with it being a pandemic it qualifies to be a service all its own or a category, a special area of itself so I would like it in its own area. 

Creating own category: COVID -19. I don’t know if I would leave it under emergency care because of the fact it would have its own area, I may pull it out of emergency care because maybe it is just the vaccine. I may put the category of COVID 19 I could mention emergency care with a link from one to another. Can I take that one back. Yeah, this makes more sense to me. When I look at emergency care I would expect to see COVID 19 if there is a category of its own. 

**Task 5 Scenario**

For this task, imagine that you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine or immunization once you have reached a certain age. You would like to know if the VA provides this service: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary care or general health then I am not super educated on disease or vaccines but I think it is a skin related issue so I would pout it under specialty care to because you could talk to a dermatologist as well. The flu and tetanus is primary but shingles is kind of special so putting it in both you would find it. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization? 

Similar information as the other vaccines. If you need a referral to a clinic,  the who, when, where. If you qualify for it, if there are side effects, when and where you can get it. Like  a pamphlet. It reminds me when I take my 4 boys to the doctors for shots they give you the information sheet that tells you what it is for, possible side effects and if there are preventative medicine for a fever if it runs for more than 24 hours call the doctors. I think an information sheet if they hand it out that would be sufficient infomration. 

- Specialty care, same or different?: 

It would be similar, maybe more of a discussion because they could be there for a skin related issue already. They may be more prone to the disorder so it may need to be more thorough as to why they are at specialty care, if they are at cardio then they would get the same of primary care. If could be more of an intense conversation if at a dermatologist but more in depth if at specialty care. 

- Have you gotten or plan to get the shingles vaccine? Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? - (If yes, received vaccine) 
When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? 

I have not gotten it but I think it is the one that my children have asked me to get. I think it would be part of my regular visit. I will discus it at my next appointment because I don’t know if there is an age recommendation on that one or not. 

**Task 6 Scenario**

For the last task, imagine you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccines or immunizations you need before going

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary care, that is it on that one to. Once again that is a general health it is not an urgent or an emergency and its not specialty or COVID. I guess COVID could be part of the travel related but I would talk to primary care. I am going to central America for spring break so I will have to have that conversation with my primary. I wouldn’t go to the ER and I wouldn’t go to urgent care. I don’t know what department it would make sense to be in. I am going to stick with primary care. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting travel-related vaccines or immunizations? 

Of course narrow it down to the country and what health issues they are having, the recommended vaccines and decide if I want them or not or if anything is mandatory to travel safely. 

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

If I didn’t have a regular visit I would schedule on prior to my travel. Right now we know it is Costa Rica for spring break so I need to see if I have an appointment between now and march. If I don’t then I need to get one scheduled to discuss that. 

**Post-Task Questions - 5 minutes**

- In these tasks, you saw or heard words such as vaccines, vaccination, immunization, shot. What words connect with you? Did we miss any? 

Vaccinations and that’s because in the military that is what we call them. No. Inoculation is another word. 

•	Any questions for me? 

No. 

Thank-You and Closing
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we work to make vaccine information easy to find for Veterans.
Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
