**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

•	Can you tell me a little about your service history? 

I am a veteran of the Army(Vietnam), 100 percent service connected and retired now. 

•	Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past year? 

Yes. For an allergist, a specialty. 

•	Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years? Can you share any reasons behind your decision? 

Yes the normal, flu and pneumonia vaccines. I get at least the flu vaccine regularly. Because I believe they will help, I am not allergic to vaccines. 

**Health Services Page - 5 minutes**

Thank you! Now I want to and show you the webpage I mentioned that is on the VA.gov website.
I'm sharing my screen - do you see a web page with the title Health Services? 
Great. I want to walk through this example of how health services are shown on VA.gov.

MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN OF HEALTH SERVICES PAGE

Link to Health Services page --> Podiatry This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. There are several categories, and just as an example, I am showing the section on Podiatry. Each section has a description of what is treated, like arthritis, bunions, and other foot care. Below that is information on location, contact information and making appointments.

BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

**Task 1 Scenario**

For the first task, I’d like you to imagine that you are planning to get your annual Flu vaccine or shot, and would like to read information on the Flu vaccine provided by VA.gov:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I would move the first to primary care, basically I think it is the most appropriate out of the five. Well urgent care is for something that need prompt attention. The emergency care is an emergency, specialty is like podiatry and I am not sure about other services. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting the Flu vaccine? 

Side effects, that’s about it and how long it is good for. 

- Would you search for flu or influenza? 

I would just say flu vaccine. 

- Have you had the flu vaccine? 

Yes

- VA before: 

yes. 

- Town hall or other community-based vaccination program?  

No it was always the VA or local pharmacy. 

**Task 2 Scenario**

For this second task, imagine that it has been many years since you last had a Tetanus shot, also known as a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), and would like to know more about how to receive this shot: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Taking a guess but I would go over the emergency care because usually you get it after an injury or steeping on a rusty nail. 

- What about a routine shot: 

Yes, then I would go to primary care. The only time I think of tetanus is when you did something.  

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot? 

- Basically a little infomration of the vaccine, what it does and what it prevents as well as how long it is good for. 

- Have you received the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine or immunization / Do you know if you have received a Tdap booster? Yes. 

- Booster as well: 

I don’t think I have had a booster; I do not recall that.

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit?  

If I got one or? The booster yeah, I will check that at my next va appointment so I will ask about it. It would definitely be the VA. 

**Task 3 Scenario**

Great! I have one more task with the tetanus vaccine or immunization. Imagine that it has been a few years since your last Tetanus booster. You have had a minor injury and think you might need a Tetanus booster. 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Well I would look at urgent care or emergency care depending on the injury. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot? 

Basically what it does and what it prevents and the time limits. 

- Have you experienced this type of need in the past and received care? 

Yes, I never got the routine those. The couple I have receive it was due to injury. 

- When did you receive it, and how did you receive the care? 

It was private like a hospital. 

**Task 4 Scenario**

For this next task, I’d like for you to imagine that you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine or immunization, its availability, and where you might go to receive it:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I would go to other services, they probably have so much going on with it, it is probably under a different category when you pull up the main va.gov page.

- Be in its own category or other services: 

other services.

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization? 

Explaining about the vaccine, we know what it is for now. What the effects are, the two shots and the purpose. When you need the second one after the first. 

- Would you search for Coronavirus vs COVID? 

COVID is the main word so I would just type in COVID. 

**Task 5 Scenario**

For this task, imagine that you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine or immunization once you have reached a certain age. You would like to know if the VA provides this service: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I would look in primary care because that is who you would most likely get it from. Normally you don’t go to the orthopedist and ask for it. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization? 

What shingles is, I know it is painful, a description of the disease, how long the shot is good for. Things along those lines, like a follow up shot. 

- Have you gotten or plan to get the shingles vaccine? 

I don’t think I had it. When I go to the VA I have to check with them

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

Yes, primary care. 

**Task 6 Scenario**

For the last task, imagine you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccines or immunizations you need before going

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?  

If I were going to use the va for travel vaccines, we went to Israel a few years ago. I would go to primary care, last time my wife and I went to a private provider. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting travel-related vaccines or immunizations? 

What you need for the area you are going to, things along those lines. Side effects and anything related to the vaccine for that area. 

**Post-Task Questions - 5 minutes**

- In these tasks, you saw or heard words such as vaccines, vaccination, immunization, shot. What words connect with you? Did we miss any?  

Vaccinations. Shots can refer to a few things. That’s about it. 

- Any questions for me? 

I think the only thing the VA needs to do, I contacted them about the vaccine. They have infomration about the vaccine but doesn’t tell you when they are going to be getting it. I think they need that or a ballpark estimate because they cant know exact dates. when I used secure messaging a month ago, she stated she didn’t know and then I messaged her the other day and she still didn’t know. Then she messaged me the other day, and said we had to request it then have it reviewed by the board. 

**Thank-You and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we work to make vaccine information easy to find for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
