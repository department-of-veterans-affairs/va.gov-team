**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

•	Can you tell me a little about your service history? 

I was in the navy and went to Afghanistan. Despite the negatives in the combat zone that was my best experience. You learn to look at things differently and appreciate more. I am out the navy but I was sad but looking at it I am glad because I don’t like the next uniforms. They took the female uniforms away and now they wear the male uniforms. 

•	Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past year? 

Yes. 

•	Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years? Can you share any reasons behind your decision? 

During the pandemic or in general. My most recent one was 3 weeks ago, there are negatives and positives. I am happy with them, proactive and response quickly. There are some departments that you call and leave a message and no one responses. Sometimes I had to go to patient advocate to get them to call back. Sometimes they don’t check voicemails or answer the phones. I don’t know how busy they can be to have that as an excuse after calling multiple times and no response. 

•	Good and bad: 

yes. 

•	Vaccines: 

Yes, my most recent was the flu this season.

•	Reasons: 

To protect myself. 

**Health Services Page - 5 minutes**

Thank you! Now I want to and show you the webpage I mentioned that is on the VA.gov website.
I'm sharing my screen - do you see a web page with the title Health Services? Yes. 
Great. I want to walk through this example of how health services are shown on VA.gov.

MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN OF HEALTH SERVICES PAGE
Link to Health Services page --> Podiatry This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. There are several categories, and just as an example, I am showing the section on Podiatry. Each section has a description of what is treated, like arthritis, bunions, and other foot care. Below that is information on location, contact information and making appointments.

**Card Sort - 35 minutes**
•	As you sort these cards, if you could share your thoughts out loud while you work, that would be great. That will help me to follow along.
	
BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

**Task 1 Scenario**
For the first task, I’d like you to imagine that you are planning to get your annual Flu vaccine or shot, and would like to read information on the Flu vaccine provided by VA.gov:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary care, It is more convenient because I see them twice a year and during my visit it is the flu season. 

- VA visit: 

Yes. 	

**Task 2 Scenario**

For this second task, imagine that it has been many years since you last had a Tetanus shot, also known as a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), and would like to know more about how to receive this shot: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary Care, to me it makes sense because you go to them prior to specialty clinics. If I am up for shots I call them and then I go in to get it done. Fi I have an appointment I can do it at the same time. 

- Have you received it: 

yes, but I don’t recall if it were at the va. I would have to check with them 

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

Regular

**Task 3 Scenario**
Great! I have one more task with the tetanus vaccine or immunization. Imagine that it has been a few years since your last Tetanus booster. You have had a minor injury and think you might need a Tetanus booster. 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Urgent care, because if I am injured it is quicker to go to urgent care than waiting for primary care. 

- Have you experienced this type of need in the past and received care? 

No

**ask 4 Scenario**
For this next task, I’d like for you to imagine that you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine or immunization, its availability, and where you might go to receive it:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?  

Primary care, It is my first thought when I go there for my health.

**Task 5 Scenario**
For this task, imagine that you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine or immunization once you have reached a certain age. You would like to know if the VA provides this service: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary care, like I said if I have any questions as to where to go I go to primary care. 

- Have you gotten or plan to get the shingles vaccine? 

I had my shingles shot last year and when I came in they gave me all of my vaccines. 

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

Regular visit

**Task 6 Scenario**

For the last task, imagine you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccines or immunizations you need before going: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary care, same thing I start with them and ask the questions as what vaccines I would need. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting travel-related vaccines or immunizations? 

What vaccines we need for the region being traveled to and when.

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

Normal visit would make more sense to me.

**Post-Task Questions - 5 minutes**

- In these tasks, you saw or heard words such as vaccines, vaccination, immunization, shot. What words connect with you? Did we miss any? 

No.

•	Any questions for me? 

No but I am glad to help improve this for everyone in the va.
