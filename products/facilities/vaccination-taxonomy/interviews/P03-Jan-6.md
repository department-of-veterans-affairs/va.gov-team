**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

•	Can you tell me a little about your service history? 

I am a Marine Corps veteran; I tour in Afghanistan. I am service connected disabled.

•	Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past year? 

Many times. I go every week; I go all the time. I went early this week, last week, the COBC here for physical therapy. My primary care and dermatologist. Yeah. It is cumbersome. You can never really get ahold of anyone at the VA. 

•	Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years? Can you share any reasons behind your decision? 

Yeah, sure.  For my kids safety, I had a PPD recently. Then I was voluntold when in the military, smallpox, I got all sorts of stuff.

**Health Services Page - 5 minutes**

Thank you! Now I want to and show you the webpage I mentioned that is on the VA.gov website.
I'm sharing my screen - do you see a web page with the title Health Services? Yes. 
Great. I want to walk through this example of how health services are shown on VA.gov.

MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN OF HEALTH SERVICES PAGE

Link to Health Services page --> Podiatry This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. There are several categories, and just as an example, I am showing the section on Podiatry. Each section has a description of what is treated, like arthritis, bunions, and other foot care. Below that is information on location, contact information and making appointments.

BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

**Task 1 Scenario**

For the first task, I’d like you to imagine that you are planning to get your annual Flu vaccine or shot, and would like to read information on the Flu vaccine provided by VA.gov:
Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?  Other services I guess or a separate ones. I can do both or just change the name to vaccine info. Other services can come from anyone, but will you go to each on of those. Especially right now with vaccines a big thing in the news it should be in a vaccine info. It is important and now that COVID is monopolizing ideas, I don’t know if people look into the vaccine infomration outside of the pandemic. There are a lot of anti-vexers as well so just a vaccine tab is helpful or other services because you can get them form anyone. It could be in primary care to but I don’t know if I would look there for the vaccine information. 
In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting the Flu vaccine? The integration of flu it is trying to treat, the flu this year. My understanding is that when you get the vaccine, what they are saying the most popular flu, it won’t inoculate you from all flues but to understand which one it will. Then maybe infomration to where you can sign up to get the flu vaccine. Then any stats for the flu. 
Would you search for flu or influenza? I would look up flu, I know it is influenza but lain terms would prefer flu.

Have you had the flu vaccine? - When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? Pharmacy visit? Town hall or other community-based vaccination program? I have in the past like 10 years ago. It may have been at the VA; the last time I got the vaccine I got the flu. It was mandated when I was in the military. I don’t like to put foreign substances in my body if it cant fight it off on its own. 
Other facilities: yeah, I think I would be more likely to go to a CVS or a CBOC to get the flu vaccine if it were all covered. It is easier to access instead of going 30 minutes away. 

**Task 2 Scenario**

For this second task, imagine that it has been many years since you last had a Tetanus shot, also known as a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), and would like to know more about how to receive this shot: 
Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?Vaccine infomration and other services. I think you can put other services in primary care, if this is for VA I have had horrible experiences with primary care. I wouldn’t go with them for anything. I could go to my HealtheVet to ask a question and the nurse could do something but the doctors out there its nothing like the relationship I had with a pediatrician outside of the VA. They see so many people and don’t know who I am so I would go other services or vaccine infomration. 
In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot? Why you would need it, when you would get it, side effects. I think that would be on all of them. Then rates of injury. 
Have you received the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine or immunization / Do you know if you have received a Tdap booster? Yes I have received both and I think I got Tdap recently because of my daughter going to school. 
Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? I did that at my outside primary care. I cant actually remember where I did that but it wasn’t a scheduled visits because I wouldn’t have done it unless especially asked to do so. 
When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? 

**Task 3 Scenario**

Great! I have one more task with the tetanus vaccine or immunization. Imagine that it has been a few years since your last Tetanus booster. You have had a minor injury and think you might need a Tetanus booster. 
Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? Vaccine information and Emergency care if I thought I needed to get it done. If it were an injury, but you said minor injury so probably urgent care so I would ask wherever I go. I wouldn’t go primary care because I would die before I heard back from them. 
Urgent care instead: If it is a minor injury I am not going to the ER. It’s a nail through my leg I would go to the ER but if I stepped on it, it would be an urgent care. 
Have you experienced this type of need in the past and received care?  Nothing recently thankfully. When I was younger I did. 

**Task 4 Scenario**

For this next task, I’d like for you to imagine that you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine or immunization, its availability, and where you might go to receive it:
Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? Vaccine information, it could be under other services so they could be mirrored because vaccines can be an entire separate entity. 
In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization? It depends again if I am saying I am getting this. Then know which on is being given, how to sign up for the vaccine, how many  people have been vaccinated already, the priority, who is prioritized. I would like to be able to sign up for it as well to be able to do it. 
Would you search for Coronavirus vs COVID? But probably COVID. 

**Task 5 Scenario**

For this task, imagine that you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine or immunization once you have reached a certain age. You would like to know if the VA provides this service: 
Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? Vaccine infomration and it could be in specialty care or other services. 
In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine or immunization? When people are recommended to get it, why they should, side effects of the vaccine, side effects of not getting it. Pros/cons, all the good stuff. 

Have you gotten or plan to get the shingles vaccine? Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? I haven’t gotten it, my dad had it and I had chicken pocks so I would probably get it. 
Special visit or regular. : yes but they have never been proactive. I would imagine in good healthcare it should be part of regular health care but I have set to experience that. 
Find it at a CBOC ort community: I would expect it to be standard practice in regular healthcare. 

**Task 6 Scenario**

For the last task, imagine you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccines or immunizations you need before going
Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? Vaccine and other, others could be it is outside of the standard and doesn’t it in anything else. You are traveling to Africa so need the malaria vaccine and so stuff like that in other services. 
In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting travel-related vaccines or immunizations? What disease to look out for, where they are, the vaccines to be helpful in the areas, side effects, how long it has been out and used, that kind of stuff. 
Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? It would be outside due to it being travel related. Special visit. 

**Post-Task Questions - 5 minutes**

In these tasks, you saw or heard words such as vaccines, vaccination, immunization, shot. What words connect with you? Did we miss any? 

Vaccine. No vaccine is the big thing, it would be the key word for a lot of people. The most commonly used word would make it the easiest to use. 

•	Any questions for me?

Thank-You and Closing
