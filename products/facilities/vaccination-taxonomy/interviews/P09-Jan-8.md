**Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

•	Can you tell me a little about your service history? 

I went in the Army in January of 67. I went through basic training, advance4d, OCS(Officer Candidate School), and jump school. Of January of 68 I joined the 82nd and was in Vietnam until November, I was wounded and evacuated home. After I was healed I was then restations and left active duty. 

•	Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past year? 

Yes, I went today. It was time for my blood work and I received my second shingling vaccinations.

•	Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years? Can you share any reasons behind your decision? 

Not that I can remember. I have known people that have had shingles and I don’t want to have it. I think I may have had the pneumonia shot in the last ten years. 

**Health Services Page - 5 minutes**

Thank you! Now I want to and show you the webpage I mentioned that is on the VA.gov website.
I'm sharing my screen - do you see a web page with the title Health Services?  Yes
Great. I want to walk through this example of how health services are shown on VA.gov.

MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN OF HEALTH SERVICES PAGE

Link to Health Services page --> Podiatry This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. There are several categories, and just as an example, I am showing the section on Podiatry. Each section has a description of what is treated, like arthritis, bunions, and other foot care. Below that is information on location, contact information and making appointments.

BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

**Task 1 Scenario**

For the first task, I’d like you to imagine that you are planning to get your annual Flu vaccine or shot, and would like to read information on the Flu vaccine provided by VA.gov:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I would go to primary care; well primary care is the beginning to the whole process for va medical. You get a primary care doctor and they manage your care. They may not provide it all but they manage it is. If I need my ears checked they put in the request. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting the Flu vaccine? 

I would expect it would explain what it is, what it does, how often you need to get it, what the negatives are. 

- Would you search for flu or influenza? 

Good question, I would start with flu and if I didn’t get what I wanted I would go to influenza. 

- Have you had the flu vaccine? 

I have had the flu vaccine.

- When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? 

Yes

- Pharmacy visit?  

No

- Town hall or other community-based vaccination program?  

No

**Task 2 Scenario**

For this second task, imagine that it has been many years since you last had a Tetanus shot, also known as a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis), and would like to know more about how to receive this shot: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?

I would look to primary care. Well I would assume that type where it is a routine booster, my primary doctor would care for and not farmed off to another service. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot? 

I would expect it would explain what it is, what it does, how often you need to get it, what the negatives are just so I have knowledge when I go in to get it. 

- Have you received the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine or immunization / Do you know if you have received a Tdap booster?  

Yes. 

- Booster: 

I don’t know about that. When I go to my primary they look at my records to see if I need anything. 

- When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? 

Yes

**Task 3 Scenario**

Great! I have one more task with the tetanus vaccine or immunization. Imagine that it has been a few years since your last Tetanus booster. You have had a minor injury and think you might need a Tetanus booster. 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I would probably since it is not a bad injury I would look in urgent care. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot? 

I would expect it would explain what it is, what it does, how often you need to get it, what the adverse reactions are.

- Have you experienced this type of need in the past and received care?  

I don’t think so. 

**Task 4 Scenario**

For this next task, I’d like for you to imagine that you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine or immunization, its availability, and where you might go to receive it:

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I would start looking in other services. Well the way I saw people getting the vaccine today. They run a little clinic, it’s not primary care, it is a nurse. You go and sign in and get your shot but you get information about the second shot and the adverse reactions that could be experienced. It is another service, from what I saw in the Baltimore va today. 

- Would you search for Coronavirus vs COVID? 

COVID-19, that’s the name everyone uses. 

**Task 5 Scenario**

For this task, imagine that you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine or immunization once you have reached a certain age. You would like to know if the VA provides this service: 

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

Primary care, well again. You would want to know the possible side effects, what it is, why you should get it and if you are a certain age you should get it. 

- Have you gotten or plan to get the shingles vaccine? 

Yes

- When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? 

Yes

**Task 6 Scenario**

For the last task, imagine you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccines or immunizations you need before going

- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)? 

I would think other services. Well I don’t think it is normally taken care of my primary care, it’s not urgent, emergency or specialty. 

- In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting travel-related vaccines or immunizations? 

What vaccines you need to go to an area of the world, how often you need them and the possible adverse impact. 

- Would you expect it to be part of a regular VA visit or a special visit? 

I guess I think it would be a separate visit.
