## Description
To efficiently plan for a change or new feature in the CMS, we need to quantify the overall degree of change to help us understand who will need more support during the transition. You will need business research to complete this assessment. You may be able to substitute discussions with the Product Owner, but guard against doing the assessment based on hypotheses or conjecture.

## Change impact assessment tool
Quantifying the degree of a CMS change lets us understand the level of effort needed to help editors successfully use a new or changed product feature. 

We do this by gauging the impact of the product change across 5 dimensions:

- The type of change
- How much it impacts a process
- The degree of technology change
- If it means a job role change for a particular group of people
- The duration of the change

Step 1. Use pre-existing or new business research to understand which roles are involved in the CMS change and how many people are in those roles. Also pull from the research the insights that give us a sense of the change impacts on these roles. List the roles in the appropriate sections of the spreadsheet (either user or stakeholder group).

Step 2. For each role, record the degree of change on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being high in each of the 5 dimension columns. The cumulative change score will appear automatically based on an underlying simple equation.

Step 3. Add the estimated or actual number of people in each role.

Step 4. Observe which roles have the highest change score and the number of people in those roles.

Step 5. Based on the number of people impacted and the cumulative change score, consider:
- what is the best way to communicate this change given the number of people involved
- when can we realistically use two-way communication (such as office hours), which is more effective than one-way (such as email)
- who will be the most effective sender of the messages to CMS users
- will people need specialized training for this change
- are there other roles or stakeholders that are impacted by this change, and what are their needs during the transition
- what are the risks if we don't communicate this change
