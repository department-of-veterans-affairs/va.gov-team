# Template name: Change Management Journey Map
- **About:** Use this template when the change has been sized as L or XL, with planned beta testing and interactions with stakeholders.  
- **Issue default title:** [PRODUCT/INITIATIVE] Change Management Journey Map
- **Assignees**: n/a
- **Labels:** Change management
- **Template content:** 

## Description
When planned CMS changes are sized as L or XL and involve beta testing with CMS users, there are a lot of moving parts that benefit from seeing them on a visual map. Develop a journey map from the perspective of the CMS editor with input from the team, User Support, the Product Owner and any key stakeholders who will be involved in change management. The resulting map can reveal any unforeseen dependencies, blockers or opportunities to engage with editors about the change.

[Sample editor journey map](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/vagov6717/1651590806174/26f6f8f43ab698d12f8fe90ad02eff0cb7d1359d?sender=u0b235d03cbd64f7f93673243) (Mural)

Step 1. Identify the roles apart from the CMS editor who will be involved in change management. Create those actors on the left side of the journey map.

Step 2. Add the editor actions in the first row of the map for the beta phase, launch and post-launch.

Step 3. Add the stakeholder and CMS team activities in the second row of the map. Add different color blocks for ideas, notes, questions and problems.

Step 4. Add the underlying systems and policies supporting the activities and editor actions in the third row of the map.

Step 5. Connect activities with dependencies.

Step 6. Validate the first iteration of the map with the team, the Product Owner, User Support, and key stakeholders involved in change management. 

Step 7. Update the map as activity dates are moved and questions or problems addressed.
