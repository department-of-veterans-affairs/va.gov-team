### Research questions
The goal of change management research is to understand the context for those using the CMS to create content. This research informs the communications approach and training needed to help editors learn to use the CMS and new features or changes. 

Construct your research questions to learn:
- Number of potential editors (if each editor has a backup) and locations
- Reporting structure
  - Who they take direction from
- Level of understanding (high, medium, low) of web principles (accessibility, web writing, etc.)
  - This will relate to how hardened the content model is
- Other editor responsibilities and which take precedence, if any, over the website
- How editors view the purpose of the website in relation to other channels
- How work priorities are established and monitored
  - Estimated percentage of role that would be dedicated to the website
- Previous experience publishing web content
- Preferred way to learn how to use, or get support for, computer applications and tools at work
  - This will inform training approach
- Preferred way to get updates on changes or additions to the website CMS
