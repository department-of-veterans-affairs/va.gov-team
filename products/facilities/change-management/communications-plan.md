# Template name: Change Management Communications Plan
- **About:** Use this template when the change has been sized as L or XL, with planned beta testing and interactions with stakeholders.  
- **Issue default title:** [PRODUCT/INITIATIVE] Change Management Communications Plan
- **Assignees**: n/a
- **Labels:** Change management, Communications
- **Template content:** 

## Description
The communications plan helps create a roadmap of the required communications including senders, key messages, timing and delivery channels.

Communicating well and often ensures that people going through any change feel supported. Any written communications should be in plain language, be concise and consider the editor's context. 

## Workflow
- Develop the draft plan in Google Docs for input from team members
- Export the draft plan to MS Word for sharing with the Product Owner and key stakeholders for feedback
- Put the finalized plan into markdown
- Integrate the communication activities into the Change Management Journey Map if one is being used for this change

## Tactics
The following tactics have been used for previous CMS changes. 

Select one or more of these tactics for the Communications Plan:

**One-way**
- Email -- reaches a larger number of editors but will require review cycles with stakeholders and team members. Typically emails to editors are sent by the client's digital team.<br>
  - [Sample emails](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QYA9N06FZhzuX3HFgw3gxQsGdtMzb8Yu7ARumf3rWnM/edit#heading=h.4uq51b1zl92l) (Google Docs)
- CMS announcement block -- appears in a content type in use by an editor

- Login page announcement alert -- currently the CMS team can post a message on the editor log-in page. This message would be seen by all editors.<br>

- Knowledge Base (KB) article -- explains the new or changed feature and can be illustrated with a link to a video
- Video -- created by the CMS team, a video gives step-by-step instructions on how to use a new or changed feature

**Two-way**
- Office hours -- hosted by the client's digital team. These may not be held frequently so plan well in advance. 
- MS Teams -- the client may have dedicated team chats for editors to share ideas and ask questions. These spaces are not a replacement for User Support, but they can point to upcoming changes with reminders for editors to look for announcement emails.
