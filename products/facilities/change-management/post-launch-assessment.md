## Description
The [Change Management epic](URL) created for this change included these performance metrics:
- [ ] The content adheres to VA policies and standards for VA.gov, as measured through a dashboard tool and/or audit
- [ ] No help desk support is needed, as measured through help desk tickets

## Workflow
- if the goal is to validate adherence to VA policies and standards, open a ticket for a dashboard tool and/or audit of the area of the CMS involved in the change
- if the goal is to gauge the degree of editor self-support after the change, search the [Jira ticket system](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/jira/servicedesk/projects/VAHELP/queues/custom/22) for instances of support associated with the CMS area that has been changed (requires Jira access)
- Report the performance metrics to the Product Manager, Delivery Manager, Product Owner and client digital team via a deck
  - include analytics data about the [number of relevant KB articles accessed](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report-home/a50123418w196569434p211458524) and [videos viewed](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UC5Y2p4ASQ5HdRR-pQ8RVQKQ/analytics/tab-overview/period-default) (requires Google Analytics and Youtube admin access)
  - use the data to discuss the communications tactics that were chosen and if the approach needs to refined for future CMS changes
  - [sample deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mj3UlauuoF6QzQfCfxqPDfHsGOBWYUgIaLNXfd4eAvg/edit#slide=id.gcd567e2ae4_0_432)
- Add the performance data to the [VA.gov CMS Change Management Airtable](https://airtable.com/appJCOGGJRTAwcH2v/tblPHoElsBWwr83Z0/viwSfROR69D6seBkB?blocks=hide) for quarterly tracking and reporting
- Report quarterly performance results for all change management work to the Product Owner using a report output from Airtable
