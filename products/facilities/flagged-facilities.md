# Flagged Facilities
The Lighthouse Facilities API is the source of truth for Facilities data. When the Facilities API reports certain kinds of data changes, Drupal CMS will add a Flag on that node, for followup. 

Flagged items then appear in Drupal's [Flagged Content view](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content/facilities/flagged) for moderation. 

## Managing Flagged Facilities
The [Flagged Content view](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content/facilities/flagged) should be maintained with an "inbox zero" goal. 
* In preparation for every new sprint, tickets are created for any new flags that have appeared since last sprint planning cycle.
* Each new sprint, tickets related to flagged facilities will be prioritized, at the discretion of the Facilities PO, relative to other sprint priorities.

## Flagging logic - engineering
Flags are determined via Drupal CMS config files, e.g.
* [New facility flag](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/config/sync/flag.flag.new.yml)
* [Changed name flag](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/config/sync/flag.flag.changed_name.yml)
* [Removed from source (removed_from_source) flag](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/main/config/sync/flag.flag.removed_from_source.yml)
* These flags should only be removed from a facility with all work has been completed and the only step remaining in communication with stakeholders that the work has been completed.

## Flags that are applied manually
The "⏳ Awaiting ..." flags are applied while working the Flagged Facilities in the [Flagged Content view](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content/facilities/flagged). They are secondary and should never be the only flags on a facility.
* "⏳ Awaiting Editor" should be applied by Help Desk while awaiting approval, confirmation that a new homepage draft is ready for review, or holding off until a specific date when the facility's status can be changed.
* "⏳ Awaiting Redirect" should be applied by a CMS Engineer, as a step in the URL Redirect workflow in the [URL Change runbook](runbook-facility-url-change.md).
* "⏳ Awaiting CSV" should be applied by a CMS Engineer, as a step in the Canonical URL change workflow in the [URL Change runbook](runbook-facility-url-change.md).

## Runbooks 
When a Facility is flagged, the facility type and the nature of the flag will determine the runbook that should be used to mitigate the flag.

Some NCA & VBA flags could theoretically be removed / stop flagging. However: data changes are happening now on draft nodes that will require action before publishing, e.g. data for alias / operating status / Section terms / archive status. This partially because some data changes for NCA/VBA are not yet automated.
