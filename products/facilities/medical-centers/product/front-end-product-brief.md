### Background
The VAMC (VA Medical Center) website upgrade project is a VA digital modernization initiative to provide a better customer experience on the VA.gov website. 

Research indicated that the old VAMC websites were not meeting the need of users. VHA Digital Media partnered with OIT Digital Experience Product Office to research, design, test, and build the new website design with Veterans, family members, caregivers, and patient advocates (900 participants over 9 months). The new website design is focused on top tasks and content that Veterans, families, and caregivers need most. Of the hundreds of content pages each old VAMC website has, users were only going to about 5-10 pages. Website analytics for the old websites revealed that users are mostly looking for health services, facilitiy services, contact information, and appointments and pharamcy information--all parts of the new website that have been prioritized in the design.

The release of these pages began with the soft launch of the new Pittsburgh health care in September 2019. Initial veteran feedback and research was conducted on the Pittsburgh health system site in November/December 2019.

This upgrade project is the collaboration of multiple product teams within VSA. 
- **CMS Team**: Drupal "Core" (stops at content API) and editorial front-end 
- **VAMC Upgrade Team**: Content creation and mapping
- **Facilities Team**: Veteran-facing front end (from content API to Veteran-facing UI)
  - Ownership of the front end work was transferred from the Public Websites team to the Facilities team following a decision to implement on VAMCs only (rather than globally).
  - These pages intersect with the Facility Detail pages surfaced on Facility Locator. When each VAMC website is upgraded and launched on the new VA.gov, then the facility website links will also be updated in the VA Facility Locator tool (va.gov/find-locations) and in the VA Facilities API data (developer.va.gov/explore/facilities).
- **VSP**: Transformers
- **Public Websites Team**: Benefit hubs and global components
  - Some templates cross product lines and extend beyond the VAMC pages 

### User Stories / Use Cases
*What two or three core use cases do we believe should cover ~80% of users?*
- As a Veteran, I need to quickly find and navigate to the content or functionality I need on a VAMC website so I can complete my online task.

### Project Rationale
