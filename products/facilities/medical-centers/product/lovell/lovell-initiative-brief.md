## Background

The VAMC modernized websites were designed to provide the top tasks and content that Veterans, families, and caregivers need most to prepare to visit a VA medical facility  including location information, available health and social services, patient registration, and other acccount needs. 

**This initiative aligns with the following OCTO-DE's mission and goals**
- Veterans, active duty service members and their families can find accurate health service information for local facilities
- Veterans can manage their health services online. 
- Connect Veterans with the services they need.

## Problem Statement

The Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center serves Veterans _and active duty military, their family members, and military retirees_. They also care for an estimated 40,000 Navy recruits. Therefore, existing VAMC page design cannot support Lovell Federal health care system's unique needs.

The Lovell health care system includes facilities which serve both Veterans and active duty personnel and other facilities which serve only Veterans _or_ active duty personnel _or_ enlisted recruits.

VA and DoD benefits have different information and separate portals for completing tasks. 

### Problems to solve
- How can the system home page support the needs of two distinct populations: Veterans _and service members_?
- How can some facility pages support the needs of both Veterans _and service members_ while others in the same system support the needs of an entirely new audience of service members or enlisted recruits?
- How can we ensure the user knows which facilities and information is relevant?
- How can we accommodate the dual beneficiary individual who needs access to both VA and DoD benefit information?

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes
- Whether I am a Veteran, active duty service member or family member receiving care at Lovell Federal Health Care, I need a seamless online experience. 
  - Top task buttons and other links should direct me to the appropriate Veteran or Department of Defense portal or page.  
  - I can complete my top tasks and identify the information which is relevant to me.
  - I want to feel that this page is designed for me and I can trust the information. 

### Undesired User Outcomes
  - An individual viewing a Lovell facility or system page is confused about whether or not that facility serves him/her. 
  - A Veteran, active duty service member or family member is given the wrong information or misdirected to the wrong portal or online experience. 

### Desired Business Outcomes
- Existing Teamsite pages can be replaced with modernized pages on VA.gov
