# Stakeholder interview - Design feedback session - Palo Alto, CA

**Date:** September 23, 2021

**Methodology:** Video interview over Teamsite

**[Link to UXPin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/20fd05cf8e86ce628f0c813166424d0a6ca38bfd#/pages/142038860/simulate/sitemap)**

## Important Take-aways:

### Use Case that validates/invalidates new schedule design:

INVALIDATES:

Palo Alto brings healthcare to underserved Veterans within its catchment area. Today we can't easily support their use case and make it easy for Veterans to learn about these mobile services. 

For this calendar year Palo Alto travels to 206 sites, “stops”, 49 of them are unique locations, meaning they do 'repeat visits' to those 49 locations.  If they don’t get much turnout at a particular location, then they may not return to it and/or try new locations. eg. this year they added 10 new locations over last year.  

5+ of the unique locations could be in “San Jose” alone so those 5 would show up as “Mobile clinic - Jan Jose, CA” with the current design iteration, indistinguishable, in the left nav but all would have unique addresses.

They also travel to and support events (like flu clinics, marine muster corp events) but felt that there was a distinction between what they offer at events and the health care services offered on the 206 stops because they **go to** the Veterans at VFWs, homeless shelters, etc. and within the single visit they can register, enroll, conduct a health history and see Veterans for their first health care appt. 

Their services are “walk-in”, not scheduled.

### Risks

- Long unusable left nav, e.g. 46 "stops", 
- Indistinguishable locations: e.g. 5 of them look like the same location, "Mobile clinic - San Jose, CA"
- Unsustainable workload produced by having to create and maintain 46 pages with fluctuating schedules

### Pain points:

- Unsustainable workload for webmaster

### Opportunities:

- Data input and separation of duties; Dr. Lighthouse has an admin that could supply/edit schedule changes. 
      - Could an outside admin feed the schedule data via a spreadsheet or other means of keeping data clean? 
- Search by service: When a Veteran searches for 'Flu vaccinations' how might we connect the event with the location from Google or Facility Locator? 

### Other notes:

#### Interviewees:
- Andrea Ritz - webmaster
- Dr. Jean Lighthall - Staff physician
- Laura Huctheson - PAO, Directors office

#### Location: Palo Alto, CA, staff is spread out among the catchment area

## Meeting notes:

Intros:

**Dr. Jean Lighthall** - I’m a physician and I direct the medical outreach program here at the  Palo Alto VA, and I we’re a small group, 2 MDs and 2 RNs 2 health techs and we have an outreach coordinator for the facility but does alot of medical outreach < that position is currently vacant. And then we have an outreach specialist with the business office who does help support our team. So, a pretty small group. 

We have 2 MMUs, the facility, that we primarily use for medical outreach. Our focus is not being the continuity of care, the GMC/primary care providers, for the patients, but we do, and this was [decided] early on, the facility preference, which has worked very well, so we do a couple things, a couple areas of focus:

1. We go into areas and find Veterans that are not yet enrolled in VA healthcare and are eligible, enroll, and a medical provider is able to see them for a medical evaluation, and history and physical and make appropriate referrals and get them signed up for.. Get them an appt with the closest GMC through a medical clinic provider. So that’s one big piece of what we do.

2. Another big piece is access to care for Veterans who are already established with a GMC provider, so just extending that care, because its difficult to get it, because [for example] transportation, distance, we have a pretty large catchment area. So we also have a large homeless population. 

      - 2.1. That’s another area of focus so, some of our sites are... we have a number of Veterans who are homeless and due to their challenges they end up seeing us more because we’re better located than their GMC at their CBOC. 
      - 2.2. And we also go to homeless shelters. So the different types of places we go to… Homeless shelters, VFWs, American Legions, Veterans clubs, community centers, colleges, senior centers, there are alot of libraries in our area that are already connected to the Veterans so we go there, we do some other events like Pow wows and stand downs so just a variety of events throughout our catchment area

3. **Laura H:** Also used to deploy in emergencies. So us in California, its alot of wildfires so MMUs get deployed for that as well. Dr: And sometimes the clinics will have power outages because they’re concerned about fires and we’ll deploy MMUs to those events and other times we’ve helped. Other times we’ve deployed when Veterans have been devastated by fires and have lost their homes and their medication and teams have gone out to support those Veterans.

##### Outreach and Enrolling, is that planned, done on a regular basis or periodically?

Both, some sites we may go to every few months, we may on a regular basis or try one place and not get a good turn out and not go back. We have other sites that are once a month regularly or we have a few that are once a week. We also go about 20 different colleges, just with the thought that there are Veterans, even if there is a CBOC nearby, just with the colleges just have very busy lives and may never get there. So, that’s been a great resource. 

##### In cases where they’re not enrolled, are you able to see them in the same day?

Yes, everything. So our health tech or our business specialist whoever is with us, and then we’re able to see them for the medical and history evaluation, and get referrals, whether they need to see mental health, need labs or x rays, or see a specialist, we’re able to get that going, and then if there are ways that care gets impacted, we’re able to bridge that gap, so what I mean is if they  if they are not able to get in to see their primary care provider, we may see them a couple times before they are able to get in to see their new primary care provider. 

##### Does this type of “event” have a name?

It's usually called, we have through the public affairs office, we have a standard flyer, and its usually just “Palo Alto Medical Outreach” is coming this day and at this time. 

##### This is open to any Veteran? Is this also Caretakers? Who’s eligible?

Just eligible Veterans, except for COVID vaccinations, when the save the lives act came through, spouses and caretakers, we could provide to. Otherwise, just eligible Veterans.

##### And do you offer this throughout your whole catchment area?

Yes, so traveling to the hosting sites, see the map behind me? I’m a very visual person so I just pieced together our catchment area, and I have dots on the map for everywhere we go. Fortunately, our team is geographically spread so we’re able to cover the area.

##### Hosting sites

In the parking lot of a VFW or homeless shelter, and sometimes we don’t use the vans if we’re at a hosting site, which we have a weekly site in Santa Cruz, there’s really no where to park in downtown Santa Cruz, but the Veterans memorial building, they have a Veteran’s Service Day every Wednesday, we’re part of that, they lets us park there, they have reserved rooms that we can use and we’re able to store some equipment. If it would help you I can show you our monthly schedule, I would be happy to share with you.

##### MMU Schedule for “Bertha” and “Zeus”

So this is internal, we’d love have something for Veterans to access, but anyone in our VA can access this Sharepoint site. But this just shows, our MMUs are Bertha and Zeus, and its color coded. So, the Modesto Salvation Army is a homeless site, Santa Cruz has a large number of homeless Veterans, libraries, oh, we also go to Veteran’s court, maple street - we’re also doing surveillance and covid testing - so this is a homeless shelter so we’re doing some testing because there was a positive, here’s Powow, Manteca VFW (we’re doing flu vaccines now so any of the sites with FLU [preceding the name] we’re doing flu vaccines), SJSU is San Jose State University,

##### Half Moon Bay is a library ([website](https://smcl.org/veterans-connect/))

We usually have, we’re just ramping up our pre covid face to face sites, we usually have this month we have 30 events, prior to that we have about 40. So we’re just ramping up.

Yeah, and just looking at the sites here, Gilroy is down south of here, Angel’s camp is in the sierra foothills, King city is about 100 miles south of here. So pretty much spread out through our catchment area.

How would this calendar translate into a website in an ideal world? Facility page vs an events page?
Laura: I think what’s hard,a brink and mortar has a fixed address. Events… I don’t know that I consider what we do an event. Its a service that we provide. Sometimes we tag them to events. Here’s a rough example. We were doing really big Marine Corp Musters, and I know that when the outreach team would support those, that is an event. You know we had over 900 marines ending their IRR, come through the facility. You know, see providers, get enrolled if they weren’t enrolled, we had a presentation on our services. That’s really what I consider an event. I mean, the outreach, when an MMU goes out, I don’t consider it an event, I mean it's a mobile service. We’re going to the Veteran. They are not coming to us. I’ll start sharing my screen. 

[Laura shares screen with Palo Alto pulled up]

Laura: Dr. Lighthouse you may not be aware, VA is on this modernization… across the VA so every VA site is going to this new page, and its trying to standardize as much as possible, and its going to be more mobile friendly. And if the pages look the same, its not going to be very hard to navigate if they change systems. So Reno looks just like this because they are live.

[I point out locations page and talk about current problem]


##### Me: Currently Bertha and Zeus would have a page and they could each have a schedule. 

Laura: I don’t think that would work well here. I think what would make the most sense is if it listed the phone number. And I don’t know what number that is.

Dr Lighthouse: that’s my extension. Now I understand the problem. If you punch in ‘find VA care’
There’s a site you can put your zip code in, like for monterey, my number comes in as the first choice. They think they are calling a clinic, but they are calling my office extension. 

And then there are not clinical hours, they are there sun up sun down. There’s no consistency there.

Dr: part of the hours are commute time

##### [I show new “schedule” section. Explain every stop would need a page]

Laura: what would it look like if you had multiple? Because we have soooo many. They would click it and see when the next time it would be there is? 

[I explain left nav based on location and a Vet find what’s close to them]


##### Do the services vary from place to place?

Services  most are with medical providers and health techs, sometimes we have sites without medical providers. Site may not be a good choice for med providers like a yellow ribbon event where Vets are not going to be wanting to see a medical provider.

##### I suggest blue ribbon and flu clinic as an event. We look at events pages and point out their limitations (no parking) and that enroll and appt medical outreach would fall under a facility page.

Dr.: I’m wondering if it would work to do mobile clinic and it be of a specific area, and the Veteran who clicked on that area, they could see the times that they’ll be at that particular area. Like Modesto junior college this day, 

Laura: would each city have its own page or location?

##### Me: Yes, every unique location would have to have a unique page

Andrea: So that would be a lot of editing because the schedule could change so I’d have to go in there.

Dr: yes, I think the worse thing that we could do is have a site on there and then it turned out that we’re not there.

Laura: So, I just wonder, um, if there’s a ways for it to be listed, we have a mobile clinic, this is what it does, and as far as what it does as for events, this is where we post where they’ll be. But if there’s regular ones, I wonder Andrea, is it easy for you to change if an event changes? Because I don’t think it would be helpful to have all of these different mobile clinics and locations given that, I mean we have 5 or 6 sites in San Jose alone. I’d hate for it to day San Jose, CA, San Jose, CA, San Jose, CA and have to click on each to see, ok this is the college. I mean you may even have 5 different colleges, I know you say right now it needs to be separate but I’m wondering if a city can have multiple locations so that its the city that gets the page vs the VFW that gets the page.

I think we’re going to have build different versions, because you’re right it would be confusing to see the city repeated, maybe in the short term, is zip code better

Andrea: you know, as a Veteran, I go to the website, I know there’s a mobile clinic so I just click on the mobile clinic link and then I can see the schedule, so I think the way you show it here is probably the best because its a one-stop shop, because they can look at the mobile clinic and then they can look up th schedule. I don’t think we should put it under events because it would be disconnected. But, and then I would have to go in maybe once a week, and verify the schedule and update it. It would not be like other locations. It wouldn’t be static. It would require alot of editing on our part. But i think that would probably make the most sense. 

Dr: I’m wondering, I actually have an admin person now, um that works half time with me and half time on another program. I’m not sure if that person could help with the updates or at least be responsible for giving you the updates?

Laura: they could give us the updates. We would have to talk about who has ownership to make changes to the website. Yeah we can talk about that offline.

Andrea: and then maybe we wouldn’t have a location, we could have “location varies”. See the schedule below for locations. And then the schedule would show the individual dates and locations.

##### [I say that could be tricky, andrea asks if location is locked down for changes. I ask if shes run into issues with that?

Andrea: no, its just I know there are certain parts that I can’t put alot of information because it's template based and I only have like a line or two to put information. I don’t know if this is free text or template based.

I say rich text would be an option

Andrea: that would work for us

Dr: So to give you an idea for scope,I just looked this us, for fiscal year 21, the number of what we call events (or services) was over 206, with 49 unique sites, so meaning we went to some of those sites more than once, and 10 new sites. And other years we were higher than that since we’re just ramping up due to Covid.

##### [I explain how we work and how we have to justify the need for design changes/”deviations”]

Laura: can you, when you request for a deviation, Dr and Andrea feel free to weigh in, can we have, since we have 2 mobile, and maybe I should ask Dr., do we use the MMUs interchangeably? Or are sometimes both used on the same day? 

Dr. sometimes, quite frequently, used on the same day, 

Laura: so then maybe my suggestion would be, mobile clinic, zeus, it would be a combination, where it has this information here, but a combination with the events, like could we instead of a separate events page there, could we have it on here (cursors roughly unders schedule) So you click on the mobile clinic and maybe not see the location but see where is it going to go.  So what we’re essentially changing is like the calendar like Dr lighthall shared. That they’ve got their own calendar shared of where, when and what time but maybe is there a way to merge that.

##### [I explain google search va health care near me, travel scenario and why search by location]
Me: You said they can be used interchangeably and fitted equally?

Dr. Yes, both have the same equipment and exam rooms and satellite and wifi capabilities. 

Me: What else gives you pause about these pages. You mentioned having these pages but not being there. Let's imagine an emergency scenario. You have your schedule but get deployed for a wildfire.

Dr: um, we usually get pretty creative, so if its a site, that we bring in the MMU to a VFW, that MMU is needed for a power outage of a wildfire, then we would look at, we try very hard not to cancel an event, especially one that we anticipate a turnout, or regardless, because we don’t want to turn a veteran away who’s coming to see us, then we would ask the VFW is we could use a room inside the building. Or we could potentially set up tables and a couple popups that we could use that we’re looking to get walls to make them into tents. So we’re pretty good at being flexible at thinking outside the box at keeping the event as scheduled.

##### [so MMU goes to emergency but staff goes to scheduled location?]

Dr: yeah. I guess if it would be an example, like a wildfire, we did go to a couple sites where, there were relief centers set up for the camping areas for individual areas for people that had been displaced. In those cases it would be both the van and the staff. They don’t come up that often, fingers crossed.


##### [scheduled services, are Veterans scheduling in advance?]

Dr. No, all with just a couple exceptions are all walk-in. So we don’t know who’s coming. We used to when we were visiting colleges, earlier on in the pandemic, but in general all of ours are walkin, no appts so we don’t know who’s coming ahead of time.

##### [anything else we should take into consideration]

Dr. in my view, it's just the number of sites and how to make it most accessible to Veterans. I know you all are much better than me.

##### [I mention services and tied to taxonomy, are the services that you offer, are they represented and if not what changes would you need to see, eg telehealth opportunities with covid]

Andrea: its going to be a challenge for Veterans, and you said its not going to be up next week when we go live? We will keep it down for now?

 [I explain how we will be open to webmaster and PAO feedback]

Dr. would it be possible to, maybe not link to sharepoint, but to have a separate calendar to link to? For the mobile medical vans and be more veteran friendly for the information that they need to know rather than the information that we need to know, like point of contact, if that was in the website, that could be something that my admin person could maintain. When they’re going on the site they could see where the palo alto van was going that month. I don’t know if that makes sese

Laura: i had another idea for the search function, like you were saying when a Veteran Googles to find the closest, but could we instead, I don’t know how many Veterans would do a search or know what a mobile clinic is, or what services are offered there. So, could we instead do the  search by the service instead. For example, if they put in, and I don’t know where they could search, but if they put in “Flu”, the pop up would be, flu clinic schedules, and then if the outreach team, and I don’t know if its in the background somewhere, the outreach team had, had a flu fair or an offering, they would see both, and they could see what’s closest to them. So that they’re looking, and that’s why I kind of got stuck on this page, [refers to health system health services] otherwise, I don’t know how many people would be doing a search for that or would know what mobile clinics do, 

[we look at facility locator and talk about how service and location are related in this product. Laura searches and sees a problem]
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4960080/136814327-dba4082e-0839-4753-8e6d-baabe1dd2917.png)

It's interesting that this happened, because when I put in VA urgent care and san jose [actually entered 95116], it takes you to not even a site that’s in Palo Alto, it skips even our ER. 

[user conflates urgent and emergency]

Michelle: we know mapping is not perfect, part of the modernization is getting that mapping done. It may be that urgent care isn’t mapped to that correctly. Are you looking for ER or urgent? Does that change things?

Dr. yeah and the other problem is, our urgent care is same day clinic, so 
   
Laura: so I’ll just give my father as an example, because he is a Veteran and had to call in urgent care, not emergency, and they directed him to the Palo Alto ER. So, I guess I just want to make sure, whether its the mapping, or what the physical call centers are doing, matches. And I don’t know where we’d put that kind of feedback. I mean that’s specifically what our call center staff did when he called the nurse advice line.  And it was urgent care, not emergent. 

Sorry, I know we’re sort of deviating from…

Michelle: I would also follow up with Stan. I’m curious was the VA that the call center sent him to a community..

Laura: no, it was the VA Palo Alto hospital.  

Dr. And then in terms of searching monterey and searching my extension, something that will get changed when we roll out the changes?

##### [We correct that the problem is on the facility page and coming from VAST]
