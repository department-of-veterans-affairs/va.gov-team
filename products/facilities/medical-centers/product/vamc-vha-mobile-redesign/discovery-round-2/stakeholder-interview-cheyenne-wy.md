**Date:** Sept-17-2021

**Methodology:** Video interview over Teamsite

**[Link to UXPin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/20fd05cf8e86ce628f0c813166424d0a6ca38bfd#/pages/142038860/simulate/sitemap)**

## Important Take-aways:

### Use Case that validates/invalidates new schedule design:

VALIDATES:

“I would need to know on the website if i can put it on the website on a schedule, say show up 1x a month, go up and come down. This is going to be in Torrington on Sept 21st, if you’re interested please call this phone number. At midnight the 22nd that goes down automatically, or I put in the Oct date. Can I go in and schedule these snippets similar to what I do in Facebook? Take one down and put one up. That would be ideal.”

### Risks
- Current services don't map perfectly 
  > "Health services - I’m curious how much cardiology we would actually do at the mobile clinic, same as hematology/oncology."

### Pain points:
 - He is the only PAO, too many responsibilities - hoping they get a webmaster soon 
 - Maintaining websites for 3 mobile, 2 brick and mortar clinics is alot
   > "In all honesty, this is probably the first time I’m looking at this page (upgraded) and that’s part of the frustration I think with the new website. Especially with the one-man, one-person shops. We are tasked in so many different directions locally and nationally always takes a back seat. We’ve been talking about this for over a year now and I’ve had access but I have not had…. My focus has not been this. " 
 - Getting info from Telehealth in order to publicize services
 - Prefers to learn by doing, put off Drupal because it took him “7.5 years to learn Teamsite”. Videos and PPTS don’t help him.

### Opportunities:
- Future potential recruiting for Vets who’ve used Mobile clinics: Sam has access to and ability to segment Veterans that have email and that are assigned to mobile clinics. He’d be willing to send them an email if it can come from him since they trust he won’t spam
    - Email: total reach 33k 
    - Facebook: total page likes 3.4k, post likes 1.5k

### Other notes:
- Need to fix: colon between hours and minutes
- Need to fix: unecessary capitalization of a.m./p.m.

## Meeting notes 


#### Interviewee: 
Samuel E House - Public Affairs Specialist

#### Location:
Cheyenne VA Medical Center, (Cheyenne, WY)

#### Setting:
Office in a converted 1934 home attached to Telehealth dept. 



##### Pain points:
Getting info from Telehealth to publicize - “have to pull info from them” Says often he’ll hear from Vets, “Hey, I got this letter...”, doesn’t understand why he find out this way


##### Where do these letters come from?
“Produced in Mobile Telehealth, the building right next to us, and they are sent out from there. They are doing a lot better today than a couple years ago” They would close down a clinic due to weather and not let me know. They are doing a little better at trying to remember me, but it has not been easy.


##### Are you the only one who updates the website?
Yes. So, under Teamsite, it's taken me seven and a half years to figure out Teamsite. I can do it, I feel really good about it. Yesterday was the first time that I really had any comfort in Drupal.


##### Tell me more:
I’ll give you an example, everything was pulled over, which is great. On the existing site, I didn’t have pictures of our mobile clinic. I’ve been trying to get those pictures forever. You know, just show me where it is, so that when people drive by they can be like “Oh, that’s what you mean…” So that’s what’s on the website. I finally got everyone, everything except for one. Um, I think it is the Torrington clinic that I don’t have. But I do have pictures of those. But how do I go about getting those pictures up there. That’s a whole other thing. I’m not comfortable getting those pictures up. Now that we do, at the VISN, there’s a VISN webmaster, that’s been helping get things in. I don’t know where he lives. I know he’s never been to Cheyenne and really doesn’t have that involvements.


##### What’s that breakdown between the role of a PAO and a webmaster:
So the whole VISN thing… we’ll get to that… a PAO is responsible for absolutely everything in the realm of public affairs, so that includes, internal public affairs media and external media, that includes social media, um communicating with the media itself, with the Veteran

What’s interesting is some facilities have a full staff. And smaller facilities, and Cheyenne really is a small facility, there’s only one of me, currently but we are working on getting another one. We’re webmaster, social media masters, communicators, anytime someone wants to send a postcard out, I did not only design it but I send it out to 25,000 people, or I coordinate it. Our volunteer services helps out too, so that’s some of the things that a Public Affairs officer has traditionally done. Now VISN 19 about 1 year ago developed a public affairs hub at the VISN but they weren’t in Denver, they were in Salt Lake and their focus was Salt Lake. If we had questions, we could reach out and ask for help. There’s a rumor that that’s going to go back to be centralized in Denver and away from Salt Lake in the next couple of weeks. So we should be able to get more assets. I mean there are 27 public affairs people who work at the VISN and there’s 1 of me. And so 27 people were working on Salt Lake and there’s one of me. So if you take a look at Salt Lake’s website, their media capability, its beautiful. Mine would be too if I had 27 people. But now there are a couple webmasters at the VISN. 1 will focu on the intranet, one on the internet. 


##### Using Drupal, invisible coding problem
So, to give you an example, I got my account and my training for Drupal, and then I got sidetracked. One of the first things I tried to do was change the points of contact for our voluntary services. Seems simple, just a type in, and it seems pretty easy but it wouldn’t populate. I couldn’t figure out why. As it turns out, I copy and pasting and there was hidden code. I had no idea, I contacted James at the VISN and he was able to figure it out. That’s what he was seeing, turns out you have to type it in. 

So, yeah, and there yesterday I was able to put up a modified document and that was pretty easy. I’m a hand-on kind of guy. I need to … all the training in the world, over Powerpoints and videos doesn’t mean anything. I need to be able to work it. That was important to me. 

As we’re talking, I’m looking at the Torrington Mobile Clinic. 

[Shares screen and proceeds to make edit/suggestions]

So one of things, I would put
Add colon in #s under hours, hates big A big M
Health services - I’m curious how much cardiology we would actually do at the mobile clinic, same as hematology/oncology.

##### Goes on to say: 
“we do mental health and “primary care” primarily at our mobile clinic. In all honesty, this is probably the first time I’m looking at this page (upgraded) and that’s part of the frustration I think with the new website. Especially with the one-man, one-person shops. We are tasked in so many different directions locally and nationally always takes a back seat. We’ve been talking about this for over a year now and I’ve had access but I have not had…. My focus has not been this. 

##### How is the 1 vs 27 PAOs determined?
So it comes down to emphasis within the executive leadership and funding. Every medical center has to determine, they have a certain amount of money and disseminate it. Public Affairs brings money in, we do that through our outreach, at one point I had counted 57 people I brought in and every Veteran brings in a certain amount of money and I figured out my impact. When it comes to the next fiscal year, they have to determine, do they want to buy another PAO or buy another doctor. We don’t make nearly enough as doctors. We are going to get another PAO. We’ve gone through the hiring process and I think I found the right person.When i go on vacation, I take my phone.  

So it comes down to size, although Sheridan is smaller than Cheyenne and they’ve had 2 PAOs for over a year. Grand Junction has had a couple of PAOs in terms of the 27 the person in charge of that program was able to manipulate is a bad word. She was able to get the funding and show the need. Good on her. 

In my previous job, in the WY military PA office, we had 4 POAs who worked in an office and had 1/20th of the size of what I’m responsible for. I do:

- stories 
- Newsletters

##### What is your job breakdown? 
It's changed. During covid I do more over the phone. I use to do outreach, eg. talking to Vets while shots are given.
Now telephone Town Halls replace in person outreach, I’m able to reach usually about 1,300 people who will sign on at some point. At the end there’s still 500 people. vs 5 people at a community event which use to be successful. 500 is exciting.. 
- 40% external communication
- 10 with media
- 10 social media
- 10 web (intranet will be added)
- 20 internal comms
- Other duties - meetings, my office I do videos, photography, patient experience officer is in this office, myHealthyVet coordinator is in this building, then they’re not there  I’m answering questions.

[I share screen]

Me: Is this accurate?

Thought shared: 

- It’s correct other than as of yesterday we stopped all face to face mobile clinics through the end of the year. How do I go in and represent closure?
- Do I talk to my facility master planner?

[I explain facility status and he thinks this should work]

- “Limited services and hours” would work
- We still want our Vets to call our main phone

Biggest issue is Veterans having their blood drawn, Scott and Izzy would have been the ones. Typically, a Veteran would come in on a Monday and have his blood drawn and come in for an appt on Tuesday, to meet with their primary care provider (virtually in the mobile clinic), is my understanding of how our Vets would use the mobile clinic. When they go in for a primary care appt they almost always have to have their blood drawn first. Vet calls to schedule their appt, the scheduler would tell them to come in on Mon at 10a for a blood draw and then have you come in to meet with your primary care at 2p

[I suggest prepare for your visit]
Aside from primary care, will staff go to areas outside Torrington, Laramie and Wheatland.

Yes, but it's not necessarily these folks. Example, every year Flu shots offered at Pine Bluffs Senior Center to Vets, 1-2 nurses plus an admin person will go. Will be like a drive-thru but at Pine Bluffs
Open to any/all Vets in the area whenever they set up somewhere. 
Pine Bluff is always very accommodating

##### How is it done?
With COVID that has not been well received with our culture. Ideally, if its coordinated through me, I’ll call these people and let them know there’s this service available and come on out. We did it with a flu clinic in the western extremely rural, very small town. We tried to get it in their local newsletters and emails and it was not very successful. 

##### What does that mean, response rate?
Yeah, if you get 1-2 people show up after spending 6 hours driving you have to look at the ROI and you see there’s a pharmacy down the place it might be better to encourage them to get the local

##### Anything more medical done with MMUs? eg audiology, how would you want to publicize
Gives three real examples
1. Audiology
2. Optometry - I think we have an optometry van, but they haven’t told me yet, going back to that communication problem with 
3. Telemedicine - I don’t know what their schedule is. I believe they went to Wheatland and they set up and that was the first time they used the van and was successful for them. I would need to know on the website if i can put it on the website on a schedule, say show up 1x a month, go up and come down. This is going to be in Torrington on Sept 21st, if you’re interested please call this phone number. At midnight the 22nd that goes down automatically, or I put in the Oct, can i go in and schedule these snippets similar to what I do in Facebook, take one down and put one up. That would be ideal.
I have 3 mobile health and two brick and mortar health clinics. It becomes very time intensive, that’s where having a webmaster, would be awesome. 

##### I share Casper, WY mockup for feedback on schedule section
Oh, I like that. Yeah. 
What would be the challenge with this for you?
How do I get people to look at it? That’s going to be a challenge #1.  It would be cool to find out how many people have email that use a mobile clinic. They may have email but not have provided one. If they do, then they have some knowledge of the internet. If they don’t, then getting them online will be difficult.

##### How does social media fit into this. You mentioned FB.
What I can tell you with FB is, I can look at how many people actually follow me on FB. Let me look at insights real quick. I’m not sure if that's going to be the… ok. Post reach of about 1450 people, what I cannot tell you, total page like 3,400K, my email distribution is 33K. I reach more people through email. Email is just like FB and any really any social media, I can go through and my Google account and I don’t look at 95% of the emails that come through, but I can say my reach is 33K people. 
I can look at the people and count [Veterans] those with email that are assigned to a mobile clinic. And from there deduce how many people would have some computer knowledge and be able to use a website.

##### I ask about his help recruiting Vets 
I would want to, because my Veterans trust me, they know me, I would lose credibility, if emails came from someone else. I’m not going to spam you, I try to be open and honest. I sign with my name and email address. So that would be the only stipulation.

##### Do you have any questions for me? Any other issues you’re having.
What’s really interesting is our demographic, the demographic of Wyoming. We’re a different breed than most people [half grinning]. That maybe we would not be the most representative of the nation and the way other people use...I can’t answer. I know the people [here] are very conservative. They live in their small communities because they don’t want to be around other people.
