# Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
The Lovell Federal Facility services both VA beneficiaries as well as DoD/TRICARE beneficiaries.
However, the unauthenticated top tasks for these beneficiaries are accomplished in separate locations, making the experience confusing. Additionally, there is content that is specific to each type of location that needs to be separated for clarity and conciseness.
Veterans are already familiar with the modernized location design, however, the split between the VA beneficiaries locations and content, and the DoD/TRICARE beneficiaries locations and content will be a new experience for them.

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Examples of common research methods include: 
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
- Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research
- Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design 
- Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release

Additional resources:

### Location
Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)

If remote, include your preferred video conferencing software. Choice of: Zoom, GoTo Meeting; WebEx.

If in person, include:
- Location
- Point of contact
- Equipment used for research

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions
How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 
Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
