# VAMC CMS Help Desk Findings

### Overview

A comprehensive analysis of four months' worth of help desk data was conducted to identify recurring issues and provide actionable recommendations for improving user experience. The key issues identified and corresponding recommendations are as follows:

---

## 1. Inconsistent Order of Complex Tasks

### Problem:

Users find the process of performing complex tasks, such as adding health services and staff members, confusing due to an unclear order of operations.

### Recommendation:

- **Develop Comprehensive Knowledge Base (KB) Articles:** Create individual KB articles outlining the step-by-step process for complex tasks with detailed screenshots. This article should highlight the order of operations (e.g., adding to VAMC first, then to the facility) to prevent context switching.
- **Inline Process Improvements:** Explore options to allow the addition of new staff/health services directly on the relevant page without requiring a separate node.

---

## 2. Missing Information for Archiving/Replacing Banners

### Problem:

The process for archiving or replacing banners lacks clear instructions.

### Recommendation:

- **Update or Create a KB Article:** Include detailed instructions on archiving/removing banners from the CMS, and clarify the removal process within the app.
- **Timed Removal Feature:** Consider implementing a feature to automatically remove banners after a set period (e.g., one week).
- **Banner Limit Enforcement:** Ensure users cannot launch more than one banner simultaneously by implementing a system block.

---

## 3. Missing Information for Adding Videos/PDFs

### Problem:

The multi-step process for adding videos and PDFs is unclear to users.

### Recommendation:

- **Detailed KB Article:** Develop a KB article that outlines the steps for uploading videos (including the YouTube upload process) and PDFs, providing clear contact information for support if issues arise.
- **Process Streamlining:** Identify ways to simplify the PDF upload process to reduce the number of steps required.

---

## 4. Missing Information for Initiating Facility Changes

### Problem:

Users lack clear instructions on initiating facility setup, closure, or combined opening/closing procedures.

### Recommendation:

- **Standardize Facility Change Process:** Align on an updated process to ensure the CMS team is informed of incoming facility changes. Provide a checklist of required steps and documents.
- **Communication Lead:** Designate the CMS team to lead communications with VAST for facility changes.

---

## 5. Difficulty Finding Social Media/Spotlight Edit Process

### Problem:

Users struggle to locate instructions for editing social media and spotlight content.

### Recommendation:

- **Specific KB Article:** Update the existing KB or create a new one specifically addressing the social media and spotlight edit process.

---

## 6. Confusing Menu Link Management

### Problem:

Managing menu links (adding, enabling, reordering, disabling) is difficult and highly requested.

### Recommendation:

- **Dedicated KB Articles:** Provide unique KB articles for each menu link management option, including examples and clear instructions.
- **User Empowerment:** Consider allowing users to perform some adjustments, such as reordering programs alphabetically.

---

## 7. Menu Link/Breadcrumb/URL Alignment

### Problem:

Renaming a page often results in misalignment of the URL, breadcrumbs, and menu name.

### Recommendation:

- **Alignment Service:** Offer URL, breadcrumb, and menu link alignment as part of all name change requests.

---

## 8. Limited Phone Number Editing

### Problem:

Users are unsure which phone numbers they can edit themselves, need CMS team assistance, or require VAST edits.

### Recommendation:

- **Clarity on Phone Number Edits:** Provide clear guidelines on phone number editing options. Consider expanding editability based on feasibility and permissions.

---

## 9. Broken Links & Duplicate Pages

### Problem:

Users frequently encounter broken links and duplicate pages.

### Recommendation:

- **User-Friendly Tools:** Provide tools for identifying and fixing broken links and managing duplicates.
- **Automation:** Consider automating link removal processes when facilities close and notify users when attempting to create duplicate links.

---

## 10. Image Upload Issues

### Problem:

Uploading images requires workarounds due to known CMS issues.

### Recommendation:

- **Improved Image Upload Process:** Implement a user-friendly image upload process and address the existing CMS issue. Consider using a third-party image tool template to streamline image processing.

---

## 11. Access/Permission Confusion

### Problem:

Users lack clarity on access permissions and require training on the content management process.

### Recommendation:

- **Permission Clarity:** Display the permission level of an editor directly on their profile page and include the required permission levels in every KB article.
- **Training & Requests:** Provide instructions on how to request higher-level permissions.

---

## 12. External Team Involvement (Analytics & Feedback/Forms)

### Problem:

Users are unsure which team handles analytics and feedback/forms requests, leading to misplaced inquiries to the CMS help desk.

### Recommendation:

- **Internal Documentation Update:** Update internal documentation to direct website managers to the appropriate team (VHA Digital Media) for these requests.

---

## 13. Processing Times Take Too Long

### Problem:

Users are unsure about the duration required for specific publishing processes.

### Recommendation:

- **Publishing Time Transparency:** Clearly state the expected publishing times at the beginning of all KB articles and provide immediate feedback on how long it will take for the node to be live.

---

## 14. Difficult Knowledge Base Organization

### Problem:

The current organization of the knowledge base makes it difficult to find specific areas of change.

### Recommendation:

- **1:1 Information Architecture (IA):** Organize the KB with a 1:1 IA, such as VAMC system homepage, Services & Locations, News & Events, About, or deeper. Users think in terms of changing pages, not how it's structured in the CMS.

---

## 15. Lack of Goal-Oriented Articles

### Problem:

Some articles highlight how to do things without tying them to a specific action, such as creating a staff profile without context.

### Recommendation:

- **Goal-Focused Articles:** Ensure all articles are centered around a clear goal, like adding a staff profile to the leadership page.

---

## 16. Technical Terminology Confusion

### Problem:

Unfamiliarity with technical terms like "list," which causes confusion.

### Recommendation:

- **User-Friendly Terminology:** Use common terms like "page" instead of technical terms to make the KB more accessible.

---

### Conclusion

By addressing these issues through the proposed recommendations, the user experience can be significantly improved, leading to increased efficiency and satisfaction among users. The implementation of clear, detailed knowledge base articles and process improvements will ensure users can navigate the CMS with ease and confidence.
