# Enhancing the Editor's Experience on VAMC Pages (2024 Research)

## Project Overview

This research aims to uncover inefficiencies, identify unmet needs, and address pain points faced by PAOs/VAMC editors in editing VAMC pages. By understanding their challenges and perspectives, we can propose effective solutions to enhance the overall editing experience and improve the quality and accessibility of Veteran-facing content on VAMC pages.

## Design Question

How might we improve the editor’s experience when they edit VAMC pages?

## Research Questions

1. How can we **streamline the process** of editing VAMC pages to enhance the editor's efficiency and effectiveness?
    - **Sample Questions**
        1. In what ways does the current system or platform for updating facility information hinder PAOs/VAMC editors from providing comprehensive and timely information to the Veteran/beneficiary population?
        2. What strategies or tools do PAOs/VAMC editors believe would be most effective in addressing the challenges they face in communicating with the Veteran/beneficiary population and providing them with the information they need?
2. How can we **identify and prioritize enhancements** to the editor's workflow that would  improve the quality and timeliness of Veteran-facing content on VAMC pages?
    - **Sample Questions**
        1. Are there any specific services or programs that the Veteran/beneficiary population frequently inquire about or express interest in, but that are not currently offered or adequately communicated by PAOs/VAMC editors?
        2. How do PAOs/VAMC editors currently gauge the effectiveness of the information they provide to the Veteran/beneficiary population, and what obstacles do they face in obtaining feedback or insights from this audience?
3. What **specific pain points** do editors currently face when editing VAMC pages, and how can we address these challenges to create a more user-friendly experience?
    - **Sample Questions**
        1. Are there specific types of information or updates that PAOs/VAMC editors frequently receive requests for but struggle to add to their pages due to technical limitations or lack of resources?
        2. Are there certain categories of facility information that are particularly challenging for PAOs/VAMC editors to update or maintain accurately?

## Overview of VAMC pages

VAMC websites are comprehensive facility pages designed to meet the needs of Veterans, their families, and caregivers. The pages provide the location details needed to prepare a Veteran to visit and easy access to top tasks and digital health tools. They are powered by a custom Drupal content management system (CMS). Content is differentiated across levels of governance - VHA national, VAMC system and VAMC local facility.

## Next Steps

### Access Existing Research

- [x]  Access CMS Help Desk reports
- [X]  Clean up CMS Help Desk reports
- [x]  Review live examples pages
- [X]  Access CMS
- [x]  Review editor top tasks via [CMS content list](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content?title=&type=All&moderation_state=All&owner=All)

### Data Analysis

- [ ]  Analyze CMS Help Desk reports
