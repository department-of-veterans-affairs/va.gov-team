# CMS Image Uploader | Usability Tests

### **Name:** Pilot

**Date:** Aug 23, 2024  
**Role/Title:** Delivery Manager  
Warm-up Questions \- 5 minutes

* Could you tell me a little about your role at the VA and how often you use the CMS to upload images?  
  * Works for Bronx on VAMC. She is uploading images pretty often. They want to put out a lot of news/press releases and events.  
  * She uses Drupal the most out of her group.  
* What types of images do you typically upload? (e.g., event photos, profile pictures, facilities images)   
  * Varying photo sizes and resolutions for press releases (in-person photos that they’ve taken)  
  * Events \- more cropping and editing  
  * Often uses canva to keep resolution high   
* Can you describe your general workflow when uploading an image?  
  * Drupal feels clunky- it’s trying to automate things but it’s not doing the right thing. Not super helpful.  
* Do you find yourself editing/cropping the image before you upload it?  
  * She is editing and cropping before even getting to Drupal because it’s clunky.  
* Do you typically use images already stored in the media library, or do you upload new images frequently?   
  * News releases \- uses new images  
  * Events- sometimes reuses photos. Example: recurring coffee chat events

**First Task:** \[Current System Observation\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event \[this can be adapted to another example if that’s what they most frequently build\] and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along.   
  * Name, times, and dates  
  * Typically a coffee chat event is recurring  
  * Listing  
  * Pushing to the national outreach calendar: she doesn’t usually do this  
  * Net new image: selects a file that is usually saved on her desktop  
  * She just uses description like a caption that she thinks get surface to viewers/readers  
  * She isn’t totally sure what Section is  
  * Completes Alt Text so people using assistive technology can understand what the image is showing  
  * Cropping gives her the most difficulty  
    * Trial and error to see which crop looks the best for her scenario  
* Description vs Alt Text  
  * Alt text for assistive technology to read out a description of the image that they would be seeing  
  * Description: feels more like a caption. There’s already an event text box so she uses that for event details but description is for the media that is being uploaded.  
* For cropping, is this experience what you’re expecting?  
  * It’s difficult to crop exactly what she wants  
* She prefers Save and select so she has more control: more autonomy to put the image where she wants.  
  * Different use cases: inserting images within text vs images at the top of a page.  
  * She is wondering what SELECT means in Save and Select. It’s not entirely clear to her.  
* On new release, the image would just insert where the cursor is.  
* On news, the image would just be the event page.  
* After Saving, now wondering what the difference between Save and Select and Save and Insert actually means- wants to be able to prescribe WHERE the image goes.  
* Preview  
  * Didn’t see the small gray text  
  * System did not actually crop the image for you. Doesn’t seem cropped here in the preview.

**Second Task:** \[Prototype Feedback\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you have started to create a new event for Veterans. You've entered the date and which VA location it will be listed in already. Now it's time to upload an image, show me how you would do that...   
* Media Library  
  * Name, date, and time  
  * Points out the upload image vs media library. Likes the option right there.  
    * Wondering if there are stock photos in the media library or just previously uploaded images?  
  * Really likes that she can move around the image herself to decide what to crop.   
  * Like that the crop isn’t a choice  
  * Likes that you can remove the image and get jumped back to the media library  
  * Realized that the alt-text was pre populated from when the image was initially added to the library  
  * Stated that light gray text over white is tricky to notice.  
  * Hard to see the X on the image preview  
  * Doesn’t have to think during this experience- this is what she expects from a modern system. It doesn’t feel clunky\!  
  * She is quick in her work and this makes it a lot easier.   
* Uploading New Image  
  * LIke that the system isn’t giving her choices she doesn’t need.   
  * Really clear.  
  * Needed to add alt-text instead of being pre populated  
  * Didn’t notice there was not an image description  
  * She likes that she isn’t shown options she doesn’t need. Cuts down on time.   
  * Cropping stage is a lot more usable. Gives her more guidance for what type of image would look best on these pages: landscape vs portrait  
  * Save and Upload is a lot more clear than the current Save and Select/Insert buttons

When participant is finished with the task

* What stands out to you about the new design?   
  * Looked how she would expect it to look compared to other digital tools.   
  * Feels confident that her other colleagues could easily be trained and pick up these processes  
* Are there any improvements you'd like to see in the prototype?   
  * The forced ratios: confused why certain pages only let you do certain crops  
  * Would like the flexibility to add any type of aspect ratio  
    * Would allow her to be more creative with the images she uses

Drupal CMS Questions \- 5-10 minutes

* Are there types of information which VAMC editors want to add or need to communicate to the Veteran/beneficiary population they serve which they are currently unable to do?  
  * A point of contact for certain events/press releases. She wants to be able to route people to more specific contacts based on different needs.

**Date:** Sep 9, 2024  
Warm-up Questions \- 5 minutes

* Could you tell me a little about your role at the VA and how often you use the CMS to upload images?  
  * VHA Digital Media within VHA Communications. Helps manage Drupal VAMC websites for hospitals across the nation  
  * Doesn’t upload images often \- a few times a year  
    * Usually a campaign landing page recently   
* Can you describe your general workflow when uploading an image?  
  * Usually will get the image from a customer and save it to his desktop and then go through the steps in Drupal \- upload to media library and then add to campaigns  
* Do you find yourself editing/cropping the image before you upload it?  
  * He edits or crops some of images before uploading- if the image is too large or doesn’t fit  
* Do you typically use images already stored in the media library, or do you upload new images frequently?   
  * Always new images, never reuses them  
* He has not had to upload an event image before

**First Task:** \[Current System Observation\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event \[this can be adapted to another example if that’s what they most frequently build\] and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along.   
  * He went to images first Content \> Home \> Add Media Item \> Add Image  
  * Renamed a Photo on his desktop- typically the name corresponds to what the photo is  
  * Description: family photo \- description corresponds to what the photo is. Supposed to have maybe a bit more info than just the name  
    * Naturally he just puts a description in. Didn’t realize it wasn’t a required field  
    * Unsure where the description actually shows up  
  * Add photo from desktop  
    * Opened Alt Text additional info  
    * There are Section 508 requirements for alt text so he opens up the helper text as a reminder to make sure he uses appropriate phrases  
    * Got the red error message which was super helpful- shouldn’t say “photo of”  
  * Crop image section- he would click through to see which crop looks the best  
    * For this one, he didn’t think he needed to crop it so he didn’t select an aspect ratio  
  * Determines the section  
  * Adds a Revision Log  
  * Hits Save  
  * Goes to Content \> searches for the campaign  
  * Goes into media library  
  * Searches by section and name  
  * Selects the photo and it inserts exactly where he needs it  
* He didn’t realize the 1:1 hero Image aspect ratio- he didn’t think it wasn’t his choice  
* He does both: goes to media library first to upload new image vs going to the campaign page and adding a new image from there  
* What he liked:  
  * He likes the ability to drag and drop  
  * If he has to crop it, he likes that there are options to see what will look best  
* What he didn’t like:  
  * Not really a response from him on this  
* Comparing this process to social media experience  
  * He thinks this is a similar process  
* Save and select vs. Save and insert  
  * Assumed they were the same- didn’t know what the difference was

**Second Task:** \[Prototype Feedback\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you have started to create a new event for Veterans. You've entered the date and which VA location it will be listed in already. Now it's time to upload an image, show me how you would do that...   
  * Hit Upload Image  
  * Would drag and drop over the upload button  
  * Didn’t say much about the crop, was trying to play around with it  
  * Went right to the fields he needed to fill out \> Hit Save  
* He didn’t notice the x on the photo right away  
* He understood the difference between Upload and Media Library   
  * He would have searched through the photos rather than searching by name  
* He said he wishes he had a different option for cropping. Bummed that he could only get the 7:2 aspect ratio \- “You’re stuck with this aspect”  
  * Didn’t realize that there was a mandated aspect ratio  
  * He thinks it is good that it imposes the mandate ratio but just doesn’t like certain things only let you do certain aspect ratios  
  * The faster you can get through the steps the better so it cuts down on choices to make which can be good for speed.  
* What stands out in the new design  
  * The automatic aspect ratio  
  * Keeping the drag and drop is a plus for him  
  * More comfortable going directly to campaign vs media library first  
  * He definitely likes that it forces the ratio if there is a mandate  
  * He is focused on time so also likes that he doesn’t have to spend time thinking about a description  
* Anything more efficient?  
  * Aspect ratio- you don’t have to figure it out anymore since it’s automatic  
* Was finding your image in the media library any easier or harder?  
  * Didn’t respond to this  
*  He didn’t realize description was removed initially \- glad to see less steps  
  * He knows alt text is different than description and that made total sense to him  
* What else would he like to see to make it faster or more efficient  
  * Can the computer choose the best place to crop for him? Like a recommended part of the photo to crop.  
* He would prefer the proposed flow  
* If he could only choose one thing to change \- forced aspect ratio  
* Michelle’s question: I’m wondering how often he uploads the image and then immediately uses it vs uploading it in one session and then returning to use it later  
  * Usually immediately. Going through the whole process at one time  
* Amanda’s question: Is there feedback he would like to share that he's heard from others around image uploading?  
  * He can’t quite remember but it has come up. He thinks it was about the cropping. That seems like that was the thing that was frustrating people

**Amanda’s Notes:**  
3 Takeaways 

1. Uses alt text drop down as a reminder, “helpful reminders”, had to edit alt text to remove “Photo of”  
2. Used photo upload and crop outside of a particular product experience, interesting that cropping was available here  
3. Did not notice that Description was removed  
   1. liked it once it was pointed out

Raw Notes:

* Talk through of current experience:  
  * Recently had to create a campaign landing page  
  * uploads images a few times a year  
  * picks image crop ratio that fits best situation  
  * does not reuse images in the media library, one time use  
* Logged into current CMS \- Walk through of current experience  
  * Content \> Add new media \> Img  
    * Used photo upload and crop outside of a particular product experience, interesting that cropping was available here  
  * Photo name \- picks something that corresponds to photo  
    * same for description, entered it w/o realizing it was not required  
    * Alt text, opened drop down help text

  * Then, went to edit a campaign landing page  
    * deleted img to re-add same image  
    * searched for pre added image  
    * CLP help text states 1:1 aspect ratio so assumes cropping is automatic  
    * likes drag and drop image upload  
  * Save and select or Save and insert  
    * unsure of difference, seems the same and both are not needed  
* New prototype testing  
  * Select image from media library  
    * didn’t realize this was a search  
  * Events, only allows 7:2 ratio  
    * wish he could have the entire image  
    * “stuck with this aspect”  
  * Did not notice that Description was removed  
    * liked it once it was pointed out  
  * Like that it forces you to use the only crop ratio that is available, making any decisioning faster  
    * but also would like several crop options  
    * multiple photos  
* Additional feedback  
  * “the faster you can do these things the better“  
  * would be nice it the computer recommended the best crop positioning  
  * missing from CMS: (anything)  
    * would like to see more than 1 image for stories  
  * Other editors complain about

**First Task:** \[Current System Observation\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event \[this can be adapted to another example if that’s what they most frequently build\] and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along.

  * Adds the details of the event  
  * Clicks add Media button \> drags and drops

  * Writes a description  
  * Section: she wishes she could do a search instead of a scroll because it’s a big list  
  * Doesn’t know what to do for cropping so skips it  
    * This is her frustration  
    * She knows there are expectations of sizing but it doesn’t tell her what they are  
    * She doesn’t want to crop, she just wants to adjust her image outside of the system to the exact size that is required. She often does that before uploading it to the media library  
  * Save and insert: Immediately goes to event page  
  * Save and select: Feels redundant. She doesn’t even know why someone would do that. Adds an extra step.  
* Biggest complaint with current system:  
  * No specific specific size requirements listed 

**Second Task:** \[Prototype Feedback\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you have started to create a new event for Veterans. You've entered the date and which VA location it will be listed in already. Now it's time to upload an image, show me how you would do that...   
  * She realizes there are two buttons and knows exactly what each one should do \- upload vs media library  
  * She doesn’t reuse images often so she clicks Upload Image  
  * Wasn’t sure if others could reuse her images after upload   
  * She loves the Event Image bullet points: it tells her the exact size dimensions   
  * Save and upload \- she thinks that’s great.  
* Really excited that it gives her an opportunity to match the proportions it needs to be  
* She wants to write down the actual dimensions so she can adjust her image before uploading  
* She is always confused by the cropping selections in the current flow so she really likes that it automatically shows you the cropping. She wants to know what it is going to look like before it is uploaded  
* She didn’t realize Description wasn’t there \- she doesn’t even know what it’s used for anyways  
* Didn’t see the X on the photo  
* You don’t get to see what the final photo looks like in the current flow so she likes that it shows in the new flow.  
* Overall, she likes how it looks\!  
* Which flow do you like better?  
  * She likes the new workflow better: she can see what the image looks like before she finalizes her event/project and she LOVES the proposed dimensions. Super happy with that.  
    * She has heard this similar feedback from other folks  
    * Likes that the user can determine what gets cropped \- dragging it to pertinent parts of the photo  
* Is there anything in the current Drupal CMS that you feel is missing?  
  * Very templated which can be restricting  
  * Sometimes it’s hard to add images \- finds workarounds  
  * Had to find the page she wants to edit  
    * She doesn’t know which one to select and needs to look at page type. Hard to find the specific page to edit.   
      * Nodes. Takes a lot of digging to figure out what to edit on a page  
    * System page first and then select service  
  * She is super open to provide more feedback to us if we need to

  * Alt text  
    * added “flyer for....”  
    * no error message (could probably add this to current UX)

Warm-up Questions \- 5 minutes

* Could you tell me a little about your role at the VA and how often you use the CMS to upload images?  
  * Work with the CMS pretty extensively  
  * Copy editor on CAIA \- a lot of static pages on va.gov- pages that you don’t have to be authenticated for  
  * They don’t work a ton with images typically  
  * Works across lots of product teams and business lines  
* What types of images do you typically upload? (e.g., event photos, profile pictures, facilities images)   
  * Photos for instructional content- recently it’s for a step by step walkthrough page to show steps people needs to take- advising people on how to sign in and verify their account  
* Do you find yourself editing/cropping the image before you upload it?  
  * Yes, they had to crop and process and resize  them for consistency sake before uploading them. This was the heaviest lift.  
* Do you typically use images already stored in the media library, or do you upload new images frequently?   
  * As she’s uploading images she might test a different size. It’s usually at the end that she reviews photo consistency.

**First Task:** \[Current System Observation\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event \[this can be adapted to another example if that’s what they most frequently build\] and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along.   
  * Opens up the page she was working on. Step by Step template  
  * She goes to the media library several times to adjust image size or alt text  
  * They were aiming for a consistent width with all of their photos  
    * She still wishes the images could have a higher resolution  
  * Inputs page title  
  * Creates a step  
  * Clicks add media  
  * Upload image from desktop one at a time  
  * Didn’t change name  
  * Added description  
  * Section: annoying to scroll through for her  
    * Sometimes the list would jump back up  
  * Copy and pasted description into alt text  
    * Tries to make alt text a little bit more descriptive  
    * She doesn’t have high confidence in how she was filling this out  
    * Frustrated with alt text error message. She used “Image of” and it flagged it but it had a different meaning “Step 1 \- upload an image of your ID”  
  * She didn’t know how to use cropping in a way to get consistency with all of the images  
    * She wanted to resize things, not necessarily crop  
    * She didn’t even explore cropping  
    * She used Canva to do all of the cropping outside  
      * She said she also struggled with that too \- they started with a word doc to adjust by inches  
      * Uploaded them all to canva, adjusted the inches, matching it with the pixels  
    * Ultimately, she skips cropping altogether  
  * She didn’t save the page we jumped out of and didn’t realize it so she had to start a new page  
  * She never unchecks Reusable box  
  * Save and select vs Save and insert  
    * She didn’t know the difference, she just went with the blue one: Save and select  
* Overall experience  
  * Outside mess of problems with consistent width, this wasn’t horrible  
* In the current flow when she removed the image, alt text gets removed too. That was frustrating for her because she was just reuploading the same image, just resized. It wasn’t actually a different image.

**Second Task:** \[Prototype Feedback\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you have started to create a new event for Veterans. You've entered the date and which VA location it will be listed in already. Now it's time to upload an image, show me how you would do that...   
  * Clicks upload image  
  * Noticed the forced aspect ratio  
  * Asked what she would do if she saved and uploaded but didn’t like after the fact  
    * She said she would back to the media library to readjust it  
    * If there was an edit icon, she would like to press that  
    * Interested that she would just reupload vs editing existing in media library  
  * Filled out the other necessary fields  
* She said she noticed the X but was hesitant because she doesn’t feel like she needed to scrap everything, just wanted to adjust a couple things  
  * She just wants to be able to go one step back.  
* What stands out?  
  * Fewer options- good in certain situations but maybe not ideal in all situations  
  * Having the one image ratio for certain templated spots is great.  
  * It’s helpful to see what is going to get cropped out- having that preview is critical. Still wants to see preview of how it looks live on page  
* Missed the recommended image size bullets  
  * She would probably just try what she had first and learn through visual cues  
* Do you have your image prepared before clicking Upload Image?  
  * Ideally she would have everything ready but it’s hard to know before uploading and previewing. Naturally there will always be readjustments.  
* Didn’t realize Description was missing. She thinks that’s nice. Saves her time.  
* Any additional improvements she would liked to see:  
  * Keep alt text if she removes the image  
* Called out 1/1 image uploaded text  
  * She was wondering if she could upload more? Confused by that text  
  * If she can’t upload more images, she doesn’t even want to see 1/1 image uploaded  
* Magic Wand question for step by step page  
  * Not deleting alt text when she removes image  
  * Being able to see the full size of the image would make things easier  
  * Ability to resize, not just crop  
  * Wants Drupal to tell her what the size of the image she uploaded was  
    * If she could adjust it in Drupal, even better  
* What was helpful for her in Canva  
  * Custom size: width, height, units.  
* Is there anything in the current Drupal CMS that you feel is missing?  
  * Checking links is horrible  
    * In preview mode links don’t work so you have to look at things in View mode and it’s harder than it should be

**Marisa’s Notes**  
Usability Session \- CMS Image Uploader  
Editor (L.B.)  
Facilitator: David Pearl (IIR Team)  
Observer: Megan Commons, Marisa Dominguez

3 takeaways

- Editor spends 5+mins preparing images within professional photography software (Lightroom/Photoshop) \- She has a photographer background.  
- Interested in caption field being available for all photo-use; she is manufacturing captions within photoshop  
  - Creating inaccessible images that are not able to be scanned by a keyboard reader  
- She did not have interest in additional functionality outside of caption-capability

Running notes

- Everyday user, Public Affair Specialist, photographer background  
- Creates events, stories, news releases, health services, outdated content, detail pages  
- Shared link as an example: [https://www.va.gov/greater-los-angeles-health-care/stories/](https://www.va.gov/greater-los-angeles-health-care/stories/)  
- Detail pages does not have captions area below image  
- She is manufacturing it within photoshop, not helpful and not easy to keep it consistent.   
- Workflow: Starts with Section on right-panel, and then goes back to top-left to fill out empty fields.   
- Happy with caption count \- she has larger captions  
- Does not feel like it is challenging to upload images. Neither do her coworkers.   
- Supports coworker with cropping because of her comfortability  
- Save and Select or Save and Insert – one works, one doesn’t.   
- Difficulty \= easy  
- Start of prototype share: straightforward but flyers, are 8.5x11  
  - She is not a fan of the auto cropping, due to her background  
  - She uses the event flyer content and drops it into the event type posting  
  - She is concerned about 508 compliance and using digital media vs printed media (pdfs)  
- Story text \- she is unable to add a hyperlink and would like to have this functionality  
- Spends less than 10 mins, she has template files that make it simple  
- Lightroom she uses for image editing  
- She does not use the Media Library for batch editing of image titles, alt text, or captions

Quotes

- I can get the job done, either way (in reference to current vs proposed proto)  
- I’m not looking for more functionality (with image uploader)  
- I’m looking to share to social media \- linking to our stories  
- It would be nice if SECTION was defaulted to the SECTION they are assigned \- I can scroll to it but it would be nice if it was pre-selected (paraphrased)  
- We always pick the original \- (because of the pre-work)  
- We really don’t reuse images, that much (so that checkbox at the base is not relevant)  
    
- Extra:  
  - Unable to edit VA Police page \- they want to add local information, forcing her to create an additional page and now she has two VA Police pages. Not ideal.

**First Task:** \[Current System Observation\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event \[this can be adapted to another example if that’s what they most frequently build\] and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along.   
  * Already had an event open  
  * She gets sent a few resources to work from: graphics, potential photos, details  
  * She creates so many different sizes of the same things to fit FB, Instagram, and the website.  
  * Once she creates the image in Adobe she drag and drops

**Second Task:** \[Prototype Feedback\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you have started to create a new event for Veterans. You've entered the date and which VA location it will be listed in already. Now it's time to upload an image, show me how you would do that...

  * Input the needs details in the fields

  * She looks at the preview a lot to gauge sizing and looks the way she wants.   
  * She adjusts sizing outside before uploading  
  * She often takes the photos as well so she know exactly how to capture things  
  * How would she have photos the same width on a page?  
    * She tried doing it in drupal guessing. Ultimately, did not know.  
    * She saw that is recommends 1000px wide to take up full content area  
      * She would assume she needs to do that before the image even gets to Drupal  
      * She would love to be able to resize right in Drupal if that was an option available to her.  
    * Said that it would be helpful to have the photo pixel size of the image she uploaded posted somewhere  
  * Are there situations where she doesn’t want a photo taking up the whole width?  
    * She says maybe, wasn’t quite sure. She doesn’t want a photo to distract from the content on the page  
    * She would like options \- have it be the complete width, have it take up a certain percentage of the width, etc. She would prefer flexibility and choices.  
  * She pointed out the photo she used as an example if 5100 pixels wide although the text says it needs to be at least 1000 pixels so it SHOULD fill up the width of the content but it doesn’t.  
* We noticed that she made captions for her photos in details pages with the content just above the photos.

Drupal CMS Questions \- 5-10 minutes

* Is there anything in the current Drupal CMS that you feel is missing?  
  * If a program wants a new page on their site, they get everything ready to go on a page, she always has the actual website open to imagine where it will fall in the nav. It is not intuitive and clear. It’s not easy to find what you need on a page to change. A detail page for a service, the front page should be linked somehow. Hard to find what you’re looking for for things you’ve already done. She has spent way too much time finding things she needs.  
    * Detail pages within Facility Health service page. The basic info for that program is not easy to find.  
    * She goes into the knowledge base and looks up stuff all of the time.

Warm-up Questions \- 5 minutes

    * Photographer in medical media- share a file with him on OneDrive, he downloads them to his computer and then he uploads them at the time he is publishing the story \- Save and insert (“Save and select is useless”)  
* Can you describe your general workflow when uploading an image?  
* Do you select the images or do you receive them?  
* Do you find yourself editing/cropping the image before you upload it?  
  * Occasionally he does. Teams Site needs to be a very specific aspect ratio.

* Do you typically use images already stored in the media library, or do you upload new images frequently?   
  * He rarely wants to reuse images. Never looks at past photos to utilize. The content he’s publishing doesn’t support the use case to reuse images.  
    * MAYBE he looks at the Military’s media library. Never used the media library within Drupal. 

**First Task:** \[Current System Observation\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event \[this can be adapted to another example if that’s what they most frequently build\] and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along.   
  * Content \> Story  
  * We writes everything in a word doc first and then starts creating the Story  
  * Add info to necessary fields  
  * Confused as to why he has to select Section on the Story page \- why can’t it auto populate?  
  * He wants First sentence to be 450 characters instead of 300\. Feels restrictive.  
  * Pastes the content from word doc, formatting doesn’t stick so he then reformats everything  
    * If he saved his word docs as RTFs and will the formatting stick?   
    * Wants safelinks  
  * Clicks Add media  
  * Select files  
  * Only clicks Original format for cropping  
  * Adds caption in Story

**Second Task:** \[Prototype Feedback\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you have started to create a new event for Veterans. You've entered the date and which VA location it will be listed in already. Now it's time to upload an image, show me how you would do that...   
  * Clicks upload image  
  * Unsure what recommended image size means at the top: is it going to auto crop or is it a requirement before uploading?  
    * He would want it to be a notice that there is a max size and his image will be resized to those dimensions automatically  
    * Supporting GIF would be nice  
    * File Size is important  
    * Recommended seems to be the wrong word: does the user need to take an action based on this bullet?  
      * It’s not clear what will happen to his image when he uploads it  
  * He wants to see an example of the aspect ratio even before uploading the image- doesn’t want to wait to see that  
  * Loves the masking and movement on the crop image feature- “hell yeah”  
  * Adds the necessary fields  
  * Save and Upload- likes that there isn’t two options  
* Having the preset aspect ratio is excellent  
* He doesn’t know whether he can resize the photo  
* He really wants to upload the event flier for the event. And have it be 8.5x11.  
* Was the new design more efficient?  
  * Yes, because steps were reduced  
* He wants the ability to choose thumbnails and different aspect ratios for other content- wants to make sure it’s not restrictive everywhere.  
  * Too tiny, doesn’t draw interest if thumbnails can’t be customized: he wants to zoom and crop more  
* He has used Paint to resize images or add borders to them so they meet size requirements  
  * He doesn’t want to ask Medical Media to crop, resize the image they send him.  
  * He wouldn’t use Paint if he can zoom in and out  
* He wants more carousel image options

Usability Session \- CMS Image Uploader  
Editor (M.C.)  
Facilitator: David Pearl (IIR Team)  
Observer: Erika Washburn, Steve Rancour

3 takeaways

- Limitations on image use and knowing what the system will do with the image is something that actively makes more work for him  
- There are lots of redundant inputs and confusing directions  
- Media library seems to be not useful or used

Running notes

- Joined public affairs 5 years after joining VA  
- Has worked with Drupal outside the VA  
  - Stood it up himself for a semiconductor company  
  - Shocked of the small box the VA was stuck inside of  
- Media relations, press releases  
- Uploads a lot fewer images than he wishes he could  
- Can’t upload more than 1 image for news releases  
- Tried uploading an animation  
  - Didn’t work when it was uploaded  
- Wants to be able to put images within pages for better UI experience  
- No flexibility of path management for end users that he’s used to within the VA Drupal  
- “Not designed with the user in mind”  
- Would use images a lot more if he could

General workflow of images

- Highest level of complexity at his facility  
- Has a photographer that doesn’t work inside the site  
- He gets the image from the photographer  
- Finds the grayed out buttons useless (Save and insert)

Cropping

- Does more cropping in team site  
- Wishes there was a wysiwyg option for cropping  
- Always uses the original size and doesn’t use any of the options for sizing  
- Not worth the time for number of people visiting the internal site (has data) to crop and do anything other than the original size

Media Library

- Wasn’t positive what it was by name and had to have it described  
- Not worth the time for looking for old images in the media library  
  - Working on new content only  
- Only time looking for old photos is when finding images in military database for vets in their fatigues  
- Never expects to find photos from other facilities

1st task Stories

- Flow  
  - Log in \> VA Northeast Ohio health care \> Content Menu hover \> Add Content \> Story  
- Flagged the wrong capitalization for the facility  
  - Health care should be capitalized  
- Will have MS document ready to go and approved before creating Story  
- Puts in Title/Author/Story section  
- Wonders why the Section isn’t auto selected when there’s only one option  
  - Confused by the dashes and other options in the dropdown  
- Frustrated with the 350 character limit on the first sentence  
  - Wants at least 450  
  - Needs to put the entire facility’s name in the first sentence, which is long (VA Northwest Ohio health care)

- Frustrated by safe links  
  - Called out that newer people miss that the link in their email is a safe link and breaks the link in the story  
- Has to pick 1 image from the usual 6 he gets, which is frustrating to him  
- Not clear on what the description box does in the image upload  
- Frustrated that he needs to re-select section when he uploads the image because he already selected it before  
- He always uses the original size of the image  
- Saw save and select button (primary blue button) and save and insert (gray secondary)  
  - He thinks that the gray button that “actually does things” is disabled  
- Wishes the description in the image upload would go into the caption field automatically  
  - Causes extra work

2nd task Events prototype

- Doesn’t usually do anything with events  
  - Different job description for creating events  
- Thinks the “where should the event be listed” is where the event is located  
- Wonders if image size is recommended size or will crop  
- Wants max height and width and will tell him what it will be cropped to  
- Wants a tool to crop instead of him needing to crop manually  
- Supporting gifs is something he wishes for  
- “Recommended is the wrong word” for size  
- Not clear if his time will be wasted by what size text says  
- Wants to seen an example image to know what the image will look like  
  - Not sure if first number is height or width and “I have worked in this field for a long time and I still have a hard time remembering”  
- Wants to be able to see image in size of crop and is happy when he finds it “Hell yeah”  
- “Save and upload, oh my god, thank you\!” in terms of the save and upload button  
- In prototype, not sure if image size or placement can be changed  
- “Want to use what I already got” in terms of the images he has to upload  
- Cleaner because reduced steps  
- Don’t know if same glee will happen if this exactly went into tool  
- “Can I set a separate thumbnail image because they don’t need to be the same”  
  - Would communicate more if able to choose part of image because they can become too small to see details  
    - Zoom in on face in image  
- Wanted to be able to add single top image with multiple images (carousel)  
- Adds artificial white margins using paint to make images square instead of rectangle  
- Always wanting to not make more work for images  
- “If I can zoom in and out” new tool would support cropping edge of images  
- Uses paint instead of creating work order to have VA Digital Media do it  
- “Let us do it at the point of publishing” in terms of editing images  
- “You’re in the cloud, why not give us the tools to do it?”

Warm-up Questions \- 5 minutes

* Could you tell me a little about your role at the VA and how often you use the CMS to upload images?  
  * SP Administrator and Website Administrator. Secondary Graphic Artist.  
* What types of images do you typically upload? (e.g., event photos, profile pictures, facilities images)   
  * Not very often. They have always thought fewer images, the better  
  * They were told that Drupal should be uncluttered and text-centric.  
  * Sometimes he does images for News Stories, Events, Press Releases, minor page images (VA logo)  
* Can you describe your general workflow when uploading an image?  
  * Any of the logos he uploads come from Tier 1 SP site  
  * Photos come from their Public Affairs team. He edits for dead space and color corrections. Also uploads fliers that can be downloaded as pdfs or .pngs.  
  * For fliers, posters, pdfs, he uploads on details pages the most  
* Do you select the images or do you receive them?  
* Do you find yourself editing/cropping the image before you upload it?  
  * He uses photoshop 30 hrs a week. His primary focus is the SP development which is a lot more graphics. Also creates fliers, posters for the Public Affairs team.  
  * He does use the cropping tool in Drupal \- he would prefer actual measurements instead of ratio sizing. He wants 1750x250 instead of 7:2 aspect ratio- a combo of both could be great for him.  
* How does he handle accessibility with text in images?  
  * He tries to be super specific and thorough in his alt text  
* Do you typically use images already stored in the media library, or do you upload new images frequently?   
  * He almost never uses the media library. If he does, he only wants to look at images he has uploaded in the past.

**First Task:** \[Current System Observation\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event \[this can be adapted to another example if that’s what they most frequently build\] and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along.   
  * Content \> Events  
  * Clicks Add Image  
  * Section \- scrolls for a while to find the correct one  
  * Calls out the crop- he doesn’t think it’s super helpful because he just needs to adjust in photoshop usually- he just goes with Original  
  * He knows that even if he chose a different crop, when publishing the Event, he knows the image will be auto cropped to 7:2.  
    * He views the page after it’s published, then he realizes it has been cropped so he has to go back and edit.  
      * He can edit and reupload right after but it will go live in about an hour in the order it’s been uploaded  
  * He wants to be able to search for drop downs with big lists- sections, where the event should be listed, etc.  
    * Every other option he sees is “in his way”  
    * If he can only edit certain things, only show what he can edit.  
* It’s not easy to delete a page- he did us a favor and actually published our test so was trying to figure out how to take it down

**Second Task:** \[Prototype Feedback\] \- 15 minutes

* Prompt: Imagine you have started to create a new event for Veterans. You've entered the date and which VA location it will be listed in already. Now it's time to upload an image, show me how you would do that...   
  * Clicks Upload  
  * Adds image  
  * Adds necessary fields  
  * Clicks Save and Upload  
* He said it was “nice and easy”  
  * He likes that he knows the size he has to deal with  
  * He likes the two different options to search the library   
    * He often doesn’t think about the media library after he’s uploaded an image  
  * He likes the instant remove “X” and that it shows the preview with the actual dimensions  
* He really likes no crop on his images so he would resize his image in photoshop and reupload.  
* He just really wants pixel and measurement over ratio listings \- didn’t notice the text/bullets until the image was already uploaded.  
  * He wants the bullets in the actual Event Image box so he can prepare his image in photoshop appropriately.  
* He didn’t notice Description was removed \- “that doesn’t bother me in the least”  
  * The file name and/or alt-text already tells him what the picture is  
* He didn’t notice Reusable check mark was removed  
  * He assumes anything he uploads could be reused and stored in the media library  
  * He only cares about images he uploads \- he would not want other people’s images that are in the media library  
* Section: have this auto populate based on selections made previously or just the sections he can work in?

Drupal CMS Questions \- 5-10 minutes

* Is there anything in the current Drupal CMS that you feel is missing?  
  * Deleting a page is not easy  
  * Really hard to parent pages to get the Nav the way they want \- parenting is limited.   
  * Limited allowance for detail pages for services

User Session \- CMS Image Uploader  
Editor (C.L.)  
Facilitator: David Pearl (IIR Team)  
Observer: Megan Commons, Marisa Dominguez  
[Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/OjptXN3dzYqJHDQb8zV2eb/CMS-Research?page-id=246%3A8&node-id=254-1068&node-type=SECTION&viewport=634%2C286%2C0.06&t=lmt3azvtpxKnpA9A-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=254%3A1068&show-proto-sidebar=1)

 3 takeaways

- Image cropping ratios are not helpful, he goes with original more often than not  
  - Unable to preview until the server refreshes (content build)  
- He would like to see the image requirements up front and center to support his photoshop collab work  
- List of sections \- displaying all of the sections are not helpful  
  - Editor only needs to see the sections they are aligned with, not the entirety

Running notes

- Content build delay allows the editor to continue to modify before the build starts  
- Image upload “...the process is easy”  
  - Image ratio vs pixels  
  - Prefers pixel measurement over ratio settings  
- “It’s not easy to delete a page”  
- He is the sole content creator for his section  
  - He receives content from his coworkers  
  - He is the uploader

**Prototype Portion**

- Likes recommended image size and file size  
  - How does this work for responsiveness/mobile?  
- “That’s nice and easy”  
  - i know the size I have to deal with  
  - Drupal saves the last location of uploaded image \- preloads his image folder  
  - Instant remove \- X in corner, likes the ability to remove quickly  
- Image cropping \- is that something the editors are avoiding because they do not want their images to be cropped  
  - Do they understand why we are cropping?  
    - Do we know why we crop?  
  - Place requirements up front for image  
    - He works alongside photoshop to make modifications, as needed

Additional thoughts

- Content type for additional services does not allow the editor to add extra links or resources, forcing him to use a different content type, ultimately placing the page under a parent that is not desired.   
  - See zoom video for context  
  - Facility Health Service vs Detail Page  
    - Detail Page houses more functionality  
    - Facility Health Service is extremely limited
