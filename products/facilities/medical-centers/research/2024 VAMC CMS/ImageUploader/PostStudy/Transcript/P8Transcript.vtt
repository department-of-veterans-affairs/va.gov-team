1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.819
David: And yeah, now that it's recording I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.390
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yes, that's fine.

3
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.210
David: Fantastic.

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.523
David: Okay, so now let's just jump into it.

5
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.860
David: could you tell me a little bit about your role at the Va.

6
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:32.560
VHAALTLEMKEC: I am there. The Jamesy Van Zant, sharepoint mot or administrator and website, administrator and secondary, graphic artist.

7
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.179
David: Got it got it? And how often are you uploading photos or images to the Cms.

8
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.449
VHAALTLEMKEC: Fair or not very often. We've always been under the impression that the fewer imagery uploaded the better.

9
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.033
David: Okay, yeah. Could you tell me more about that?

10
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.210
VHAALTLEMKEC: When I took over working, and we transferred from team site to drupal.

11
00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:05.640
VHAALTLEMKEC: We were told that the system is laid out the way it is.

12
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.390
VHAALTLEMKEC: There's very specific things that we are allowed to change.

13
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.889
VHAALTLEMKEC: and it should be kept as uncluttered and predominantly. Text

14
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.020
VHAALTLEMKEC: laden or text

15
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.690
VHAALTLEMKEC: centric is the better word I want.

16
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.340
David: Heccentric

17
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.539
David: gotcha. When you do upload images, what are you ever uploading images for?

18
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.170
VHAALTLEMKEC: Every so often I'll upload images for news stories.

19
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.910
VHAALTLEMKEC: Events.

20
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.369
VHAALTLEMKEC: sometimes press or press release

21
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.000
VHAALTLEMKEC: or minor page images so like a little low, or one of the Va Logos, or something like that.

22
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.773
David: Gotcha and

23
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.990
David: Could you describe your general workflow when you're uploading an image?

24
00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:06.050
David: Like, for example, where you get the images from? Are you doing any editing that kind of thing?

25
00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:16.979
VHAALTLEMKEC: Any of the any of the images I upload usually come from the if if they're logo designs for the Va, they're from the tier one site.

26
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.959
VHAALTLEMKEC: the sharepoint site that we have.

27
00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:32.769
VHAALTLEMKEC: I know how the Va is on, you know, Logos, and everyone making up their own little designs. I gotta keep stopping my teams over here from creating things it's like, no, you can't do that.

28
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:47.780
VHAALTLEMKEC: Photos and stuff like that are taken from our our public Affairs department and a lot of times I'll just be editing for dead space and color corrections.

29
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:55.020
VHAALTLEMKEC: And sometimes we'll upload graphics of flyers and things like that that can be

30
00:02:55.691 --> 00:02:58.698
VHAALTLEMKEC: downloaded as a Pdf or a

31
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.409
VHAALTLEMKEC: Png file. So.

32
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.870
David: So, yeah, just a couple of things there.

33
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.060
David: 1st question on. That is

34
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.099
David: what what

35
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.930
David: you said. You get rid of white space or things like that. What tools do you typically use? Photoshop

36
00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.320
David: Photoshop? Okay? And about how often, how how much time do you spend?

37
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.500
David: Kind of.

38
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.729
VHAALTLEMKEC: I'm on. I'm on Photoshop on average.

39
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.580
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, 30 HA week.

40
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.710
David: 30 HA week. Okay?

41
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.210
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, I'm a i'm my primary is

42
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:42.810
VHAALTLEMKEC: the sharepoint development where I do a lot more graphics there, because we're a little bit more leeway there.

43
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.649
VHAALTLEMKEC: and secondary I do graphic arts for my

44
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:58.090
VHAALTLEMKEC: Public Affairs office. So I do. Flyers, posters, things like that. So I'm I'm always working in in Photoshop.

45
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.159
David: Gotcha. Okay?

46
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.460
David: And it's

47
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.406
David: so one thing that I'm I'm pretty familiar with with

48
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.170
David: uploading things like events or stories is that there's always specific ratios that are required

49
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.470
David: when you're bringing photos into those

50
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:26.550
David: like. When you're creating pages or things with those, do you ever use the cropping tools and things that are.

51
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.959
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yes, I know.

52
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.820
David: Calls, or like.

53
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.410
VHAALTLEMKEC: Do.

54
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.140
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, in. I do use the cropping tools in both drupal

55
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:46.600
VHAALTLEMKEC: and in our system. What I would prefer this is just me. I would prefer actual measurements, as in instead of ratio sizing

56
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.500
VHAALTLEMKEC: cause like a 7 to one ratio to me is just.

57
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.058
VHAALTLEMKEC: I'm like, I gotta really think that through, instead of saying, You know x by y.

58
00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.930
David: Got it. So my, maybe I more ideally

59
00:05:01.251 --> 00:05:05.680
David: and I. I'm just saying this because I have a little graphic background. But you correct me if I'm wrong.

60
00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.050
David: So it'd be like you'd want

61
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.310
David: to see 1750 by 500

62
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.500
David: to me.

63
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.159
David: Make your template in like

64
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.649
David: Photoshop that right? Something like that.

65
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.209
VHAALTLEMKEC: Exactly. Yeah.

66
00:05:20.134 --> 00:05:24.690
VHAALTLEMKEC: yeah. I mean, I know the 7 to one ratio is.

67
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.770
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know, 7 pixels to one pixel.

68
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:34.246
VHAALTLEMKEC: But it's like, still, that's more math than my brain wants to deal with.

69
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.500
David: So, having kind of like an ideal ratio

70
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.970
David: would be helpful for you.

71
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:40.720
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yes.

72
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.170
David: And where would that?

73
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.330
David: Oh, go ahead!

74
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:55.560
VHAALTLEMKEC: You know. When you upload the image, you know, and it gives you the rate it gives you the ratio listing and the crop or like. When you upload for events.

75
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.150
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know, you'll upload the file, and it'll say this, you know, this is limited to a 7 by

76
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.760
VHAALTLEMKEC: one, or ratio, or something by 2. Ratio.

77
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.650
David: Yeah.

78
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:19.280
VHAALTLEMKEC: It would be great if it would say, like 7 by 2 ratio or 3, you know, 1,800 by 600 pixels, you know, or something like that. Just the addition.

79
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.200
David: We edition, and the combination would be helpful for you.

80
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:25.269
VHAALTLEMKEC: That would be awesome.

81
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:35.360
David: Okay, that's fantastic to hear. My other question for you is you mentioned uploading Pdfs and things like that? Flyers?

82
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.039
David: Where do you find yourself most often uploading those.

83
00:06:40.558 --> 00:06:42.230
David: What? What content? Types.

84
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.000
VHAALTLEMKEC: Detail pages.

85
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.450
David: Detail pages.

86
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:53.849
VHAALTLEMKEC: And there's another thing, because I just did a page for that for our women's, health organis or woman's health department.

87
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.089
VHAALTLEMKEC: and they had like.

88
00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.339
VHAALTLEMKEC: I think it was 15

89
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.619
VHAALTLEMKEC: or 18 Pdfs. They wanted to upload.

90
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:12.952
VHAALTLEMKEC: You know. It's it's all good information that's very useful, and it's, you know, good place for it to be, you know, one spot.

91
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.910
VHAALTLEMKEC: but we're limited to a

92
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.240
VHAALTLEMKEC: straight in line

93
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.960
VHAALTLEMKEC: list of those documents.

94
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.850
VHAALTLEMKEC: It would be nice if there was an ability to

95
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.939
VHAALTLEMKEC: like tile them

96
00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.600
VHAALTLEMKEC: tired of.

97
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.259
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah. Cause when you

98
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.050
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know, 18 documents will take up.

99
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.340
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know, a good

100
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.719
VHAALTLEMKEC: half scroll or something, whereas if I was able to tile it straight across, it wouldn't take up.

101
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.579
VHAALTLEMKEC: You wouldn't have to scroll like 3 times to get to the bottom if that makes sense.

102
00:07:48.580 --> 00:08:00.699
David: Yeah, yeah, you'd rather, instead of going all the whole list down, you could really organize it in a way that would work for you, and I'm curious with events and things like that. Do you find yourself ever

103
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:18.929
David: taking flyer bits? And and are you cause? Because for events right, you'll get like a flyer or something, and like there's like a ha! Do you translate those to that banner size? Are you finding another way to upload them. How? How do you kind of decide what to do with those.

104
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.640
VHAALTLEMKEC: I I usually

105
00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.210
VHAALTLEMKEC: I'll usually take the design that we've come up with for the flyer or poster

106
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:37.960
VHAALTLEMKEC: and compress and redesign to match that banner size and then use the the text box that's provided with the the events

107
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.359
VHAALTLEMKEC: posting to add the text information that would be found on the flyer.

108
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.939
David: Got it? And how do you kind of balance

109
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.810
David: text and an image with accessibility? How do you find yourself doing that?

110
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.589
VHAALTLEMKEC: That's that's 1 of the hard ones. Accessibility

111
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.869
VHAALTLEMKEC: is a big thing around here, especially we have a couple of visually impaired

112
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.179
VHAALTLEMKEC: veterans that really use our website. So

113
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:14.180
VHAALTLEMKEC: I just, I just try to make sure that whenever I'm putting in the Alt texts for the images

114
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:19.159
VHAALTLEMKEC: I try to make. I mean, if it's if it's a text image, you know, it's like

115
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.400
VHAALTLEMKEC: enrollment fair.

116
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:28.160
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know. I will actually describe the imagery and then put in the text enrollment, fare with it.

117
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:28.990
David: So.

118
00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:29.700
VHAALTLEMKEC: You know.

119
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:37.859
VHAALTLEMKEC: blue gray background with us, you know, with an American flag overlaid with the text enrollment fair. Something like that.

120
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.210
David: Over overlay with the text enrollment fair. Yeah.

121
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.280
David: Got it?

122
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:51.299
David: Okay. So I'd like to jump into our 1st task. I, if if you could

123
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:59.809
David: log into drupal and share with me how you kind of upload an image to an event.

124
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:04.149
David: I think that would be a really great place to start.

125
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.870
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, I'm just a heartbeat.

126
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.376
VHAALTLEMKEC: Nothing important.

127
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.210
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay.

128
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.809
VHAALTLEMKEC: okay, let me get to.

129
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.721
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, that's Monday. Okay, every so often we get those notices like technical problem, wait, what.

130
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.443
David: Oh no!

131
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.530
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah.

132
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.120
VHAALTLEMKEC: And

133
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.490
VHAALTLEMKEC: okay. So let's see.

134
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.340
VHAALTLEMKEC: I don't usually use

135
00:10:55.390 --> 00:10:58.789
VHAALTLEMKEC: zoom. So how do we share the imagery?

136
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.179
David: Oh, yeah, there's like a green share button.

137
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.400
VHAALTLEMKEC: Sure, I see it down here at the bottom. Okay, screen 2

138
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.080
VHAALTLEMKEC: and share.

139
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:15.619
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay, can you see me? Okay, yeah.

140
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.240
David: Yep.

141
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.989
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay, perfect. So, for example, if we were gonna do an event

142
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.290
VHAALTLEMKEC: content, events.

143
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.290
David: Yes.

144
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.990
VHAALTLEMKEC: Give it a second to catch up.

145
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.860
VHAALTLEMKEC: So

146
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:31.990
VHAALTLEMKEC: yeah.

147
00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.680
VHAALTLEMKEC: and I love that it spell checks me.

148
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.010
David: Yeah, that's so helpful.

149
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.959
VHAALTLEMKEC: Alright. So whatever day

150
00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.510
VHAALTLEMKEC: event image.

151
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:07.480
VHAALTLEMKEC: So I've already got a few of these. So like we did the drive through clinic shot.

152
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.620
VHAALTLEMKEC: But basically, all I do is I select the file

153
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.620
VHAALTLEMKEC: provided it opens anything up there we go.

154
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.530
VHAALTLEMKEC: Let's see.

155
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.279
VHAALTLEMKEC: let's go with that best.

156
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:37.700
VHAALTLEMKEC: So open.

157
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.679
VHAALTLEMKEC: Then I would put the description in here.

158
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.839
VHAALTLEMKEC: Not not gonna write it right now. But

159
00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.790
VHAALTLEMKEC: there we go. Here's where.

160
00:12:50.284 --> 00:12:54.980
David: What kind of description would you put in there? You don't have to write it, but you can just.

161
00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:01.163
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, most of the time I would put in for a description. It would be

162
00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.130
VHAALTLEMKEC: graphic, graphic.

163
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.530
VHAALTLEMKEC: graphic title for Vetfest summer, 2024.

164
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.640
David: Got it.

165
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:15.390
VHAALTLEMKEC: And then for the alternative text for this one, it would be something along the line of

166
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.559
VHAALTLEMKEC: illustration of dog tag with gold star

167
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.620
VHAALTLEMKEC: overlaid text. Summer 2024 vet. Fest.

168
00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:33.960
David: Got it. So they're just what's what would you use to mark the difference between description and all text if you had to describe it to a new editor.

169
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:38.830
VHAALTLEMKEC: To be honest for me. There isn't that much of a difference.

170
00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:45.809
VHAALTLEMKEC: except that in this case the description is what shows up in the media library.

171
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.410
VHAALTLEMKEC: Whereas the alternate text isn't what shows up in the media library.

172
00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:57.180
David: Now, do you often find yourself looking for images in that media library?

173
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.130
VHAALTLEMKEC: No, I almost never use it.

174
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.409
David: You almost never.

175
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:04.029
VHAALTLEMKEC: Except to find my own pictures that I've uploaded before.

176
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:10.770
David: Got it. So you're interested in the pictures you've uploaded? Are you ever using pictures? Anyone else has uploaded.

177
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:20.469
VHAALTLEMKEC: I've kind of looked through them. I just haven't most of the time when I'm uploading images. It's very specific to our facility

178
00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:27.009
VHAALTLEMKEC: and the stories that we're posting. So most of the photos out there, unless I need like

179
00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.360
VHAALTLEMKEC: a graphic of

180
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:38.600
VHAALTLEMKEC: oh, one of the Va, you know, tier one Logos. Someone's already uploaded it, you know. Usually you can find those pretty quick.

181
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.400
David: Got it.

182
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:43.250
David: Okay, great and then.

183
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.129
VHAALTLEMKEC: But here's where we run into the this is where I would like to see the.

184
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.560
David: Yeah, before we get to that. If you scroll up just a bit.

185
00:14:52.166 --> 00:14:55.023
David: could we go through the section?

186
00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.450
VHAALTLEMKEC: So select section who will manage this.

187
00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:02.370
VHAALTLEMKEC: I always take it down to

188
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:08.920
VHAALTLEMKEC: vision for Altoona va altoona health care cause. That's me.

189
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:09.960
David: That's you.

190
00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.050
David: Yeah.

191
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.440
VHAALTLEMKEC: And.

192
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.969
David: Yep, yeah. You already told us what you'd input it.

193
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.400
VHAALTLEMKEC: So we just put that. And then

194
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.490
VHAALTLEMKEC: the since this is a 7 2,

195
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:32.999
VHAALTLEMKEC: this is where I would like to see. I'd like to see the great, the numbers, because I can go back into the Graphic

196
00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.660
VHAALTLEMKEC: in Photoshop and re-edit it to match.

197
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:43.799
VHAALTLEMKEC: Because I can't get this. You won't be able to get this square into this square. You know what I mean.

198
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.110
David: Hmm!

199
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.079
David: And what would happen if you picked the 2 by 3, for example.

200
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:53.610
David: or 3 by.

201
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.829
VHAALTLEMKEC: Let me see which. 1, 3 by 2. Nope.

202
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.920
VHAALTLEMKEC: usually go with original.

203
00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.219
David: You normally go through. Okay.

204
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:07.349
VHAALTLEMKEC: But because you go with the original.

205
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.519
VHAALTLEMKEC: do a save and insert

206
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.720
VHAALTLEMKEC: it's still not going to.

207
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.930
VHAALTLEMKEC: It won't cut. When you

208
00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:20.669
VHAALTLEMKEC: publish the event.

209
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.000
VHAALTLEMKEC: it's still gonna be cut off.

210
00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.590
David: Got it.

211
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.450
VHAALTLEMKEC: It's still gonna do.

212
00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:28.050
David: The 7 by 2.

213
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.100
VHAALTLEMKEC: Because it's limited to a 7 by 2 exactly.

214
00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.499
David: Okay? And has that happened to you before.

215
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.150
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yes, so I've just gone in, edited the event

216
00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:39.810
VHAALTLEMKEC: and

217
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.509
VHAALTLEMKEC: redesign the the banner piece.

218
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.790
David: Okay. But there was a point once where you

219
00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:56.299
David: uploaded an image you selected like original or or 2 by 3, 3 by 2, and then uploaded it. You thought it was going to be good.

220
00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:57.720
David: and then.

221
00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.226
VHAALTLEMKEC: It wasn't.

222
00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.770
David: When do you find out? It wasn't what happened like, how do you.

223
00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:03.530
VHAALTLEMKEC: Winner.

224
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.580
VHAALTLEMKEC: Well, usually, when you get to the publish setting.

225
00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.479
David: Yes.

226
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.080
VHAALTLEMKEC: Have you have to

227
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:12.930
VHAALTLEMKEC: let me go ahead and

228
00:17:16.675 --> 00:17:17.720
VHAALTLEMKEC: teaser

229
00:17:18.690 --> 00:17:20.349
VHAALTLEMKEC: don't need that.

230
00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:25.069
VHAALTLEMKEC: Nope out of the a

231
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.200
VHAALTLEMKEC: yeah.

232
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:35.429
VHAALTLEMKEC: And so we'll go to published

233
00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:41.960
VHAALTLEMKEC: now you have to save. Oh, Crud.

234
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.249
VHAALTLEMKEC: let's go with today

235
00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.320
VHAALTLEMKEC: at

236
00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.500
VHAALTLEMKEC: 5

237
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.360
VHAALTLEMKEC: and 6

238
00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.850
VHAALTLEMKEC: a at

239
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:56.030
VHAALTLEMKEC: 7.

240
00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.440
VHAALTLEMKEC: That's

241
00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.310
VHAALTLEMKEC: alright. So let's do it.

242
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.370
David: Yeah. Cool.

243
00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:06.350
David: Sorry.

244
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.179
VHAALTLEMKEC: Like the value. That's okay.

245
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.810
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, let's see.

246
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.150
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, I'll tune up.

247
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.209
VHAALTLEMKEC: I'm doing Erie, Chicago.

248
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.069
VHAALTLEMKEC: There we are.

249
00:18:30.371 --> 00:18:32.459
VHAALTLEMKEC: everything. Oh, go ahead.

250
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.500
David: I'm just curious. Were you trying to type it in

251
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.869
David: just now? I've been.

252
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:43.491
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, I just I went to hit Altuna. I type Altoona. And then it, I forgot, doesn't do that.

253
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.209
David: That. Would that be something that would make that process easier for you

254
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.949
David: to be able to type that in.

255
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.620
VHAALTLEMKEC: It would, because

256
00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:54.750
VHAALTLEMKEC: you can see how many there are.

257
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.290
VHAALTLEMKEC: And if you know, like we have Wilkes bear.

258
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:03.359
VHAALTLEMKEC: I have to go through, you know it's quicker for me to tell type in wil.

259
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:04.790
David: Yeah, to.

260
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.380
VHAALTLEMKEC: To scroll the line.

261
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.450
David: Do you find yourself

262
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:15.479
David: going in? Besides the Altoona and the Wilkes bear one?

263
00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.499
David: Do you go into many other.

264
00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:22.070
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, we we have a catchment of 5 Cbocs.

265
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:24.180
David: So you have 5. Okay?

266
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:26.160
David: And then what about rest?

267
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.809
David: The ones in? I.

268
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:32.059
VHAALTLEMKEC: Don't even. I don't even see those. Those aren't. Those don't belong to me.

269
00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:33.710
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, okay, well.

270
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:40.309
VHAALTLEMKEC: Alaska, I don't have to worry about Albany. I don't have to worry about. None of those

271
00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:43.720
VHAALTLEMKEC: have anything to do with me whatsoever.

272
00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:47.769
David: Got it. And how do you feel about seeing all those options.

273
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.899
VHAALTLEMKEC: They're basically in my way.

274
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:53.709
David: They're in your way.

275
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:59.920
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, I mean, if if, since I'm logged in under my login

276
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.499
VHAALTLEMKEC: and I can only edit

277
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.950
VHAALTLEMKEC: Altoona.

278
00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.781
VHAALTLEMKEC: I don't. I don't feel I really need to see Birmingham.

279
00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:20.589
David: Yeah, could you do me a favor on the right section? There's something that says section. And could you open that? Could you expand that option? Yeah.

280
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.589
VHAALTLEMKEC: That one's only Altoona health care.

281
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.080
David: So that's the only one you can work in.

282
00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:27.170
VHAALTLEMKEC: That's the only one I can work in.

283
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.050
David: Okay.

284
00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.790
David: thank you.

285
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:34.260
VHAALTLEMKEC: No problem.

286
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.619
VHAALTLEMKEC: So then, when we save

287
00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.979
VHAALTLEMKEC: okay, so now that we've saved it.

288
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.139
VHAALTLEMKEC: We can preview.

289
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:47.600
VHAALTLEMKEC: and you'll see

290
00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.210
VHAALTLEMKEC: the barracks cut apart.

291
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.469
VHAALTLEMKEC: and that's how you. That's how you know it's cut.

292
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.699
VHAALTLEMKEC: So then I have to go

293
00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:08.980
VHAALTLEMKEC: back to the page. I have to edit it, and, you know, modify, and since it takes the server about an hour to load.

294
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:14.930
VHAALTLEMKEC: so I put this together. It won't be live on my page until

295
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.240
VHAALTLEMKEC: probably an hour from now.

296
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:29.259
David: So ex. Explain to me what happened. How does that get into in the way of your workflow? Do you have to wait an hour to re upload it.

297
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.839
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, no, I can. I can edit and re upload it right now.

298
00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:41.450
VHAALTLEMKEC: but it until and then it will go live in the order. It's been uploaded, so

299
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.590
VHAALTLEMKEC: it'll

300
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.380
VHAALTLEMKEC: let's say it usually takes about an hour.

301
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:51.040
VHAALTLEMKEC: So if I edited it if I put it together

302
00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:52.300
VHAALTLEMKEC: 1, 30,

303
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.739
VHAALTLEMKEC: and I found out. It's gonna be, you know, oop, I need to fix something.

304
00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:08.809
VHAALTLEMKEC: Then I re I go back in, edit it and re upload it it. And it's 6, you know. It's 1, 35. It's now going to go live. 5 min later.

305
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:12.859
VHAALTLEMKEC: It'll always take the latest timestamp.

306
00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.739
David: Got it? Got it?

307
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:24.320
David: Well, okay, how was that experience for you in general? That whole process of uploading the image.

308
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:30.969
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, the process is easy, like, I said. The only the only thing I run into is

309
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:39.980
VHAALTLEMKEC: decoding in my dyslexic little head, the ratios versus pixels, so.

310
00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.240
David: Got it. Got it.

311
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:47.039
VHAALTLEMKEC: And that's really my biggest issue with the with with the system is, I would prefer

312
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.979
VHAALTLEMKEC: a pixel, a pixel, or measurement

313
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:53.600
VHAALTLEMKEC: over ratio listings.

314
00:22:54.670 --> 00:23:03.190
David: Got it. So I'm gonna let's move on to our next tab. Here. I'm gonna share with you a link on chat

315
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:05.009
David: of a prototype.

316
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.990
David: Nope, let's

317
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.230
David: usually.

318
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:08.630
VHAALTLEMKEC: Let me!

319
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:09.040
David: Yeah.

320
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.900
VHAALTLEMKEC: Go ahead and delete the

321
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:14.800
VHAALTLEMKEC: oh, yes, the one we just put up before it goes flying.

322
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.580
David: Yeah, and I appreciate you. Just kind of.

323
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.110
VHAALTLEMKEC: Not a problem.

324
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:19.790
David: Going through that process. I.

325
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.470
VHAALTLEMKEC: Edit.

326
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.230
VHAALTLEMKEC: Let's see.

327
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:35.790
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh.

328
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.669
VHAALTLEMKEC: okay, there's a there's something we could run into. It's not easy to delete a page.

329
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.190
David: It's not easy to delete a page.

330
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.950
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah.

331
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.609
VHAALTLEMKEC: I usually don't have to delete one. So that's kind of weird

332
00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:00.460
VHAALTLEMKEC: enrollment fair.

333
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.590
VHAALTLEMKEC: Just edit

334
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.890
VHAALTLEMKEC: saved.

335
00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:09.890
VHAALTLEMKEC: Huh?

336
00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:19.560
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay?

337
00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:22.810
VHAALTLEMKEC: So we got that.

338
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:33.600
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, I can leave it locked for a little while, so I'll have to

339
00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:35.660
VHAALTLEMKEC: figure out Delete

340
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:41.391
VHAALTLEMKEC: later on, so we can get back to the go back, go back to what we were doing.

341
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:42.780
David: Got it.

342
00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.632
VHAALTLEMKEC: If I leave it, if I leave it locked, it won't publish.

343
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:54.850
David: Okay. So I just shared with you a big Mo link. If you could open it and share your screen, that would be fantastic.

344
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.039
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay, to let me share up chat, chat. Okay?

345
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.390
David: Great! Yes.

346
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:19.300
VHAALTLEMKEC: Alrighty!

347
00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.220
David: Alrighty. So

348
00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:30.450
David: here is a prototype, and it's a potential redesign of the image upload system. It's for events.

349
00:25:30.805 --> 00:25:36.179
David: And I'd like you to imagine that you've started to create a new event for veterans

350
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.590
David: you've entered in the date

351
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.580
David: and which Va location? The event will be listed at

352
00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.609
David: now it's time to upload the image.

353
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.370
David: so please show me how you would do that.

354
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:59.010
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay. So if it's 1 of our events, I would made already have a graphic available. So I would go ahead, hit upload image.

355
00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:06.780
VHAALTLEMKEC: Then I would select the image I wanted to use.

356
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:10.659
VHAALTLEMKEC: Use that one.

357
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.560
VHAALTLEMKEC: and oh, that's pretty well framed up, that's good.

358
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.800
VHAALTLEMKEC: and continue

359
00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.980
VHAALTLEMKEC: so

360
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:24.960
VHAALTLEMKEC: there!

361
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.630
VHAALTLEMKEC: I like that

362
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.470
VHAALTLEMKEC: I like.

363
00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:35.050
VHAALTLEMKEC: I like. I like the the recommended image size and file size. That is wonderful right there.

364
00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:44.069
VHAALTLEMKEC: Because then, if if I'm not in, if I wanted this to be adjusted. I could run into Photoshop in a minute.

365
00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.049
VHAALTLEMKEC: readjust it and take care of that.

366
00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.320
VHAALTLEMKEC: and then we would enter our alternative text

367
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:54.090
VHAALTLEMKEC: and.

368
00:26:54.630 --> 00:27:00.179
David: Oh, yeah, if you just click there, it should fill it out. It won't automatically fill like that. But

369
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.919
David: yeah, just to kind of simulate.

370
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:02.560
VHAALTLEMKEC: Gotcha

371
00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.350
VHAALTLEMKEC: perfect.

372
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:07.389
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay? Section

373
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.439
VHAALTLEMKEC: and save and upload.

374
00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.370
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, that's nice and easy.

375
00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:17.909
David: That's nice and easy. What about it? Makes it nice and easy.

376
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:19.740
David: Well.

377
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.630
VHAALTLEMKEC: Step by step. It's

378
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.570
VHAALTLEMKEC: number one I know the size that I have to deal with.

379
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.170
VHAALTLEMKEC: So that's the 1st thing that's good.

380
00:27:27.672 --> 00:27:30.330
VHAALTLEMKEC: It gave me the option. It went right.

381
00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:36.190
VHAALTLEMKEC: I'm assuming this is set up to go directly to one of your image folders.

382
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:39.220
VHAALTLEMKEC: So

383
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.250
VHAALTLEMKEC: hope I lost your audio, brother.

384
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:46.709
David: Yes, yes, it would go. It would open up the same way that you would have open.

385
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:47.500
VHAALTLEMKEC: So

386
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.920
VHAALTLEMKEC: if I if cause I usually for

387
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:57.699
VHAALTLEMKEC: events, I have a a standard image folder I use.

388
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:04.179
VHAALTLEMKEC: So all my images go into this events folder, and usually when I open, when I

389
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.579
VHAALTLEMKEC: click on upload, it just opens that events folder.

390
00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:09.999
VHAALTLEMKEC: So my graphics are already there.

391
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.050
David: Your graphics are.

392
00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:11.750
VHAALTLEMKEC: I did.

393
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:16.220
VHAALTLEMKEC: I did like the option that that it had a button right next to it

394
00:28:16.450 --> 00:28:17.880
VHAALTLEMKEC: to search the

395
00:28:18.606 --> 00:28:21.030
VHAALTLEMKEC: like, or the library.

396
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.399
VHAALTLEMKEC: Or the so

397
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:32.150
VHAALTLEMKEC: usually I don't even think of that until after I've uploaded the image. And I'm actually in the content library.

398
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.010
David: Got it.

399
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.500
VHAALTLEMKEC: So that's that's a good

400
00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.240
VHAALTLEMKEC: addition. I like that.

401
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:44.860
VHAALTLEMKEC: So yeah, that's I like. And I also like the

402
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.810
VHAALTLEMKEC: instant remove. That's good, too.

403
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.520
VHAALTLEMKEC: in case we need to change it up real quick.

404
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:57.050
David: Yeah. So say, you notice that it wasn't cropped exactly how you'd like it.

405
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.150
David: What would you.

406
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:02.670
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, I would just. I would pull the file.

407
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.090
VHAALTLEMKEC: Then I would

408
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:11.549
VHAALTLEMKEC: probably reopen it in Photoshop, adjust the image, and then re upload it.

409
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:23.370
David: Okay. And when you would be uploading it. So I'm curious. Just like how Photoshop works. You would. You would make your adjustments in Photoshop, you would bring it in here.

410
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:26.740
David: and then the frame would just kind of

411
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.790
David: match. What you're being what you're uploading

412
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.230
David: is that how.

413
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.490
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay? So

414
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:35.350
VHAALTLEMKEC: if we upload the image.

415
00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:39.709
VHAALTLEMKEC: yeah. And I see, this frame is this like, here.

416
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:41.489
VHAALTLEMKEC: I know that

417
00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.569
VHAALTLEMKEC: I want.

418
00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.959
VHAALTLEMKEC: I would like more of the lamp.

419
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.540
VHAALTLEMKEC: I want it higher.

420
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.899
VHAALTLEMKEC: I want more space between their heads and the top of the bar type thing.

421
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.130
VHAALTLEMKEC: I would go back into my image and adjust it. So the fret. The image stopped

422
00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.360
VHAALTLEMKEC: right along this line

423
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:03.649
VHAALTLEMKEC: and stopped along this line.

424
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:06.560
VHAALTLEMKEC: Would force this to fill

425
00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.599
VHAALTLEMKEC: this square with the image I want.

426
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:15.859
David: Got it. Got it. So yeah, the image you'd be uploading wouldn't need cropping.

427
00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:17.250
VHAALTLEMKEC: Right.

428
00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.209
David: Got it. Yeah.

429
00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.010
David: Is it helpful to have the cropping

430
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.470
David: built in.

431
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.250
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yes, when when I have an image that

432
00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.510
VHAALTLEMKEC: neat that

433
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.870
VHAALTLEMKEC: can be adjusted for cropping.

434
00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:37.717
VHAALTLEMKEC: it does help. So, you know, if we were doing

435
00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:44.859
VHAALTLEMKEC: like a gradient swirl, just pretty colors swooping across the page.

436
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.129
VHAALTLEMKEC: That would be great because I could move the picture around and go right there. It's good.

437
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:55.399
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know that sort of thing cause those are usually, you know, huge.

438
00:30:55.850 --> 00:31:00.810
VHAALTLEMKEC: They're designed to be enormously big and crappable. So

439
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:04.090
VHAALTLEMKEC: that's what this would be great is great for.

440
00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:11.580
VHAALTLEMKEC: But when you have a set image that is a specific size, a specific design.

441
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:20.420
VHAALTLEMKEC: you generally have to make sure you know what your banner size is going to be before you upload the image.

442
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.880
David: Hmm!

443
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:23.699
David: Got it.

444
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.550
VHAALTLEMKEC: So.

445
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.239
VHAALTLEMKEC: having this

446
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.880
VHAALTLEMKEC: this event, image recommended premium, you know that sort of thing.

447
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.530
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, let's there we go! There we go.

448
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.850
VHAALTLEMKEC: having that

449
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:40.140
VHAALTLEMKEC: here

450
00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.769
VHAALTLEMKEC: in the event. Image box.

451
00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:45.320
VHAALTLEMKEC: Better.

452
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.650
David: Before you're

453
00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:52.620
David: while you're preparing your image, you have that information.

454
00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.030
VHAALTLEMKEC: Exactly.

455
00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.969
David: Got it, got it? Okay, so it could be moved out.

456
00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:04.119
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah. So if it said, event image recommended size, you know x or

457
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.190
VHAALTLEMKEC: x pixels by y pixels

458
00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.770
VHAALTLEMKEC: no more than 10 MB. Jpeg, gif png

459
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:13.810
VHAALTLEMKEC: right here.

460
00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:23.329
VHAALTLEMKEC: or actually, you know, like, in this box where the photo is, you could have it. And then when you upload the photo, it's just gone, but that would be perfect.

461
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.549
VHAALTLEMKEC: That would be.

462
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:27.729
VHAALTLEMKEC: That would be. I'd get to this point and go.

463
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:36.750
VHAALTLEMKEC: Crud! Is that it? Yep, that image is good to go, you know, because I usually have Photoshop open with the image I've been editing. Still, there.

464
00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.230
David: Got it. Got it? Got it?

465
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:43.869
David: Okay, yeah, thank you so much for sharing that. Let's see.

466
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:45.020
VHAALTLEMKEC: No no problem.

467
00:32:45.276 --> 00:32:52.719
David: If you go ahead and click X, and let's walk through that process one more time. Over the image. Sorry. There's a lot of X's on the screen.

468
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.280
VHAALTLEMKEC: Right? Right? And I'm sorry. Yeah, I was like, okay.

469
00:32:56.665 --> 00:32:57.690
David: So

470
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.469
David: here we have upload image. Let's go ahead and click on that one again.

471
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:02.400
VHAALTLEMKEC: Dry.

472
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.869
David: I'm curious about a couple of things. 1st off.

473
00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:12.270
David: One thing that's no longer here, and I'm not sure if you noticed it

474
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.079
David: is, that description is no longer here.

475
00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:20.142
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, okay. I thought something was missing. I just didn't catch what was missing.

476
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.960
David: So what what do you think about that.

477
00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.909
VHAALTLEMKEC: That doesn't bother me in the least.

478
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.579
David: That doesn't bother you in the least. That description.

479
00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.099
VHAALTLEMKEC: No, no, because

480
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.720
VHAALTLEMKEC: if people are smart

481
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.629
VHAALTLEMKEC: which I really wish they would be the file name

482
00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:45.939
VHAALTLEMKEC: is going to tell me generally what the picture is, and the alternative text is going to generally tell me what the picture is.

483
00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.090
David: So the combination of the 2 is sufficient.

484
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.890
VHAALTLEMKEC: Usually. Yes.

485
00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.169
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know, unless you get people who like to upload.

486
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.240
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know.

487
00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:07.889
VHAALTLEMKEC: Img underscore 0 0 1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 3 dot jpeg, you know, like, Oh, come on! Couldn't you take 2 seconds to name the photo?

488
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.790
David: Yeah, I see that I've been guilty of that in my past.

489
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:19.030
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, we all we all have, which is also another reason. I don't hunt through the

490
00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:24.540
VHAALTLEMKEC: media library because there are a lot of people that do upload

491
00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.495
VHAALTLEMKEC: that.

492
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:32.110
David: Oh, interesting. So yeah, we can talk about that in a second. The media library.

493
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:40.200
David: I'm also curious. One other thing that has been removed. Here is the. There's like there used to be a button in there.

494
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:46.319
David: a little checkmark that says, this image can be reusable for the media library.

495
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:51.138
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, that's I'm good with that being removed because

496
00:34:52.409 --> 00:35:00.879
VHAALTLEMKEC: I assumed anything that went into the media library was going to be reused because it belongs to Va. National, anyway.

497
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.819
David: Got it. Got it.

498
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:14.070
VHAALTLEMKEC: You. You most likely. You know Birmingham is not going to use a file of our director giving an award to one of our nurses.

499
00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:15.210
David: Yeah.

500
00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:18.029
VHAALTLEMKEC: Do fine, you know. It's not like it's.

501
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:21.400
David: They do. It's fine. They probably won't.

502
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.470
VHAALTLEMKEC: Exactly

503
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.199
VHAALTLEMKEC: because they're gonna have.

504
00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:26.980
VHAALTLEMKEC: It's it's very rare that you know, different

505
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.750
VHAALTLEMKEC: facilities need images from the other facility.

506
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.740
VHAALTLEMKEC: because most of the stuff we're putting out is

507
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.210
VHAALTLEMKEC: directly related to the facility we're in.

508
00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:44.849
David: So. I'm curious when you upload images and you're using your media library. It's typically

509
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:50.099
David: only images. You only really care about the images that you have uploaded.

510
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.430
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah. It's very rare that I need anything else from

511
00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:56.120
VHAALTLEMKEC: anywhere else.

512
00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:02.090
David: And what about your beyond you? What about like other people who are working with Altoona?

513
00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.590
David: When do you ever use it?

514
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.180
VHAALTLEMKEC: I I am. I am the Altoona Guy.

515
00:36:13.764 --> 00:36:19.610
David: Okay, got it. So no, you're not looking to other

516
00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:24.279
David: people in your section for those images. It's it's you.

517
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.220
David: So.

518
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:31.569
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah. Well, like the images that come are are sent to me from my facility.

519
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.190
VHAALTLEMKEC: There's something

520
00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:36.859
VHAALTLEMKEC: yeah. So like, we have a

521
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:52.010
VHAALTLEMKEC: oh, 10 year, or nurses getting a 10 year recognition PIN, and you know for that they'll send me a picture of, you know, my director giving that, you know, congratulating nurse so and so, and giving her her full.

522
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:53.910
VHAALTLEMKEC: her PIN and her.

523
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:55.919
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know, plaque and stuff.

524
00:36:56.340 --> 00:37:00.219
VHAALTLEMKEC: And then that will be. That will probably be a news story. We post.

525
00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:05.539
David: And what about recurring events or things like that, where you need the same.

526
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:08.670
VHAALTLEMKEC: Same ground. Oh, same.

527
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:13.119
VHAALTLEMKEC: we really don't have a lot of occur reoccurring events. We.

528
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.549
VHAALTLEMKEC: our our facility tries to theme things.

529
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:22.482
VHAALTLEMKEC: So when we have a recruitment fair or an you know,

530
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.160
VHAALTLEMKEC: enrollment fare.

531
00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:32.369
VHAALTLEMKEC: We're going to have like fall enrollment, and you know they'll have a theme, for you know, because we're going to hold it at the

532
00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:35.420
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know the Altoona Curve baseball

533
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.700
VHAALTLEMKEC: diamond. So you know it'll be baseball and fall themed.

534
00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.930
VHAALTLEMKEC: The next one will be

535
00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:47.369
VHAALTLEMKEC: at the fun run that happens every year, and you know spring or whatever so.

536
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.590
David: Right?

537
00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:54.329
David: Okay. So reuse is not as common. You are

538
00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.369
David: the only person who's using it.

539
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.010
David: I see.

540
00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.920
David: Okay, fantastic.

541
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.590
David: and let's see here.

542
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:09.850
David: I think the file name is the same. The Alt text is the same per section.

543
00:38:10.713 --> 00:38:23.129
David: One thing I'm curious about it's not really shown here. But ideally, it this version could have. It is really just focusing on the sections that you're part of.

544
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:26.569
David: or even considering the section that

545
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.250
David: you input right before, where the event will be listed in.

546
00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.439
David: Would that be something.

547
00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:33.940
VHAALTLEMKEC: Be perfect.

548
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:34.770
David: For you.

549
00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:35.960
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah.

550
00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:43.490
VHAALTLEMKEC: yeah, if it was just the department, it well and mainly because once again, I can't post to anyone else's stuff.

551
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:49.069
VHAALTLEMKEC: So you know, seeing, you know, for lack of a term. Birmingham again.

552
00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:50.240
David: Yeah, Birmingham.

553
00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:56.229
VHAALTLEMKEC: Is it going to make a difference? Because I select Birming. If I accidentally select Birmingham.

554
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:01.250
VHAALTLEMKEC: it's just gonna give me an error message going. You can't upload this.

555
00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:02.260
David: Got it.

556
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.539
VHAALTLEMKEC: But I gotta go back and they go. Okay. I'll tuna, you know.

557
00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:13.390
David: Afternoon. So if the section only had the sections you could work in that would be beneficial for you. Yep.

558
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:15.070
VHAALTLEMKEC: Or if it preloaded them.

559
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:18.460
David: Or preloaded them. Yeah. Got got it?

560
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:19.440
VHAALTLEMKEC: Because.

561
00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.320
David: You were. What if you were part of multiple sections.

562
00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:33.920
VHAALTLEMKEC: Well, that's okay. So that's that's a good point. Because we do have 5 different Cbocs. But a lot of times our events are held at different

563
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:36.519
VHAALTLEMKEC: times for each Cboc.

564
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:42.059
VHAALTLEMKEC: So we would. Ha! I'd have to make a different event for each one.

565
00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.290
David: Got it.

566
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:50.050
VHAALTLEMKEC: So, for example, we just had an enrollment fair at James E. Van Zant.

567
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:55.480
VHAALTLEMKEC: Well, not an aroma for a drive through flu clinic last Saturday.

568
00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:56.610
VHAALTLEMKEC: but

569
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:58.749
VHAALTLEMKEC: our State college

570
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.209
VHAALTLEMKEC: Cboc, is having the exact same event.

571
00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:04.300
VHAALTLEMKEC: But it's this Saturday.

572
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:06.050
David: Got it.

573
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:10.240
VHAALTLEMKEC: So I'm using there. There's a point where I would. You reuse the logo.

574
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.159
David: I see what you're saying.

575
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:19.290
VHAALTLEMKEC: I've already made the drive through Logo, so I'm just going to use it for each one of the Cboc's.

576
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.100
David: Got it. Got it.

577
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:25.719
VHAALTLEMKEC: Because they're just all the same exact event. They're just on different dates and times.

578
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.100
David: Different dates and times.

579
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:28.230
David: Yeah.

580
00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:31.450
David: So my other question for you is

581
00:40:32.098 --> 00:40:43.259
David: there on the original one that you've gone through. You had 2 options at the end of including all the Alt text section. That kind of thing there was, save and insert

582
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:44.800
David: and save and select.

583
00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:46.790
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah.

584
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.720
VHAALTLEMKEC: say I, I

585
00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:57.960
VHAALTLEMKEC: always say I always save in it, or which whichever one automatically loads it.

586
00:41:00.388 --> 00:41:05.170
David: The one that you click, and then the images on your page.

587
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:06.160
VHAALTLEMKEC: Right

588
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:08.375
VHAALTLEMKEC: cause.

589
00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:20.730
VHAALTLEMKEC: If I need to go to the media library, I can go to the media library, but most of the time I know the image that I'm working with, and I just need to get it up. So there's no reason to

590
00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:36.345
VHAALTLEMKEC: save and select. Be brought to the media library, where it shows me that I've checked off the photo that I've already been working on and then upload, you know. So the whole idea of save and upload is just fine.

591
00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:39.150
David: And upload is fine. Ha, yeah, okay.

592
00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:41.390
David: okay. Great. Great.

593
00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:48.910
David: Okay. Well, I have a couple last questions for you as we're wrapping up.

594
00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:51.939
David: and I think you you touched on this a bit

595
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.440
David: beyond

596
00:41:53.650 --> 00:41:56.119
David: events and image uploading.

597
00:41:56.450 --> 00:42:00.410
David: Are there any other aspects of drupal cms that could

598
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:07.609
David: be made a little bit easier, or cause you a little bit more frustration than you'd like them to.

599
00:42:09.023 --> 00:42:13.790
VHAALTLEMKEC: There's a couple of things for example, if I may.

600
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.949
David: Yeah. Please show me whatever is easiest.

601
00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:19.238
VHAALTLEMKEC: So I just remembered

602
00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:21.210
VHAALTLEMKEC: enrollment fair

603
00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:24.070
VHAALTLEMKEC: how you get rid of a page.

604
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:27.739
David: Yeah. Deleting a page, we heard that one was.

605
00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.219
VHAALTLEMKEC: So you have to go back down here

606
00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:32.430
VHAALTLEMKEC: and archive.

607
00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.390
David: You have to archive it. Okay, yep.

608
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:38.760
VHAALTLEMKEC: And now it's gone.

609
00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.489
VHAALTLEMKEC: Once it saves

610
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.639
VHAALTLEMKEC: provided takes. There we go. Now it's

611
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.080
VHAALTLEMKEC: now it's gone. It's archived, it's off my screen.

612
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.120
VHAALTLEMKEC: Got it. So we're good there. The other thing is.

613
00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:59.490
VHAALTLEMKEC: when we are a lot of my groups want

614
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:07.610
VHAALTLEMKEC: what we call informational pages or

615
00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.339
VHAALTLEMKEC: more detail, but

616
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:14.339
VHAALTLEMKEC: they're not qualified as detail pages for some reason.

617
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.400
VHAALTLEMKEC: So for health services.

618
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.550
VHAALTLEMKEC: women's health.

619
00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:22.449
VHAALTLEMKEC: So we got our link here to women's health.

620
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:26.310
VHAALTLEMKEC: Okay? So this is all the information

621
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:32.310
VHAALTLEMKEC: they wanted and see like, this is the long list that could have been broken into 2 groups if you wanted

622
00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:35.200
VHAALTLEMKEC: But

623
00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.520
VHAALTLEMKEC: and they're gonna they have more to add.

624
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.499
VHAALTLEMKEC: But you notice where it's showing up over here.

625
00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:42.420
David: Programs.

626
00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.520
VHAALTLEMKEC: Right

627
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:48.420
VHAALTLEMKEC: it shouldn't be there. But the only way I've got to go back in and clean it.

628
00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.340
VHAALTLEMKEC: because the only way to add content like that

629
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.739
VHAALTLEMKEC: is, I can go to Vma detail page.

630
00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:58.880
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah, rich

631
00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:04.250
VHAALTLEMKEC: gives me a detail, but the only place I can parent it to

632
00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:06.750
VHAALTLEMKEC: I can't

633
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.099
VHAALTLEMKEC: not turn off the menu link.

634
00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:12.849
VHAALTLEMKEC: I have to

635
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.209
VHAALTLEMKEC: parent it to something.

636
00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:20.310
VHAALTLEMKEC: and it's only I can't select anything except this down here

637
00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.219
VHAALTLEMKEC: programs and below.

638
00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:27.929
VHAALTLEMKEC: So if I want to be able to add links.

639
00:44:28.918 --> 00:44:35.890
VHAALTLEMKEC: have the ability to add extra content like, upload those files and stuff.

640
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:38.980
VHAALTLEMKEC: It has to be a detail page.

641
00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.500
VHAALTLEMKEC: It can't be

642
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.790
VHAALTLEMKEC: hang on a second

643
00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.840
VHAALTLEMKEC: if I go to up here.

644
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:51.420
VHAALTLEMKEC: Media content

645
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.600
VHAALTLEMKEC: health service.

646
00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:58.769
VHAALTLEMKEC: See? We got facility, health service and system health service.

647
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:03.149
VHAALTLEMKEC: I want to add.

648
00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.180
VHAALTLEMKEC: I want to add a health service page.

649
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.720
VHAALTLEMKEC: I don't get all the extra.

650
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:14.259
VHAALTLEMKEC: I only get to tell them

651
00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:16.900
VHAALTLEMKEC: it belongs to.

652
00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:20.080
VHAALTLEMKEC: you know, gynecology.

653
00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:23.390
VHAALTLEMKEC: And here's the form. Here's the text. I can't link

654
00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.819
VHAALTLEMKEC: extra files or anything like that.

655
00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:36.910
VHAALTLEMKEC: So you get very limited allowance for detail pages

656
00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.170
VHAALTLEMKEC: for services.

657
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.820
VHAALTLEMKEC: So, for example, if you go to our pharmacy.

658
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:47.930
VHAALTLEMKEC: Sorry.

659
00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:53.860
VHAALTLEMKEC: Nope, that's not where I want to go. Health services.

660
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.030
VHAALTLEMKEC: We go to

661
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:57.890
VHAALTLEMKEC: pharmacy.

662
00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.759
VHAALTLEMKEC: We have a pharmacy and addition.

663
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.680
VHAALTLEMKEC: but it is literally

664
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.429
VHAALTLEMKEC: oh, no, this one. I actually did

665
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.760
VHAALTLEMKEC: the same upload that I did before. I just haven't. I just cleaned it off the

666
00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:13.740
VHAALTLEMKEC: the other page. Let's see.

667
00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:17.130
VHAALTLEMKEC: we have another one here somewhere.

668
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:20.999
VHAALTLEMKEC: Nope, I don't think we do, actually.

669
00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.590
VHAALTLEMKEC: yeah, no, I think we're just. Those are the few

670
00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:38.089
VHAALTLEMKEC: we've wanted to do a lot of detail pages like the ones I've built, but because there isn't the ability to really add on

671
00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:42.719
VHAALTLEMKEC: without making a bunch of extra work to get it off the programs. Page

672
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:45.319
VHAALTLEMKEC: people haven't been using it.

673
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.700
VHAALTLEMKEC: Does that make sense.

674
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:58.160
David: The page is not where you so so just to clarify pharmacy is a health service, and you're able to have a link

675
00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:00.819
David: where that pharmacy lives

676
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:07.990
David: kind of as a trial for health services, but the women's health one you're not able to add in your link.

677
00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:09.140
David: so it won't.

678
00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:09.770
VHAALTLEMKEC: Yeah it

679
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:13.340
VHAALTLEMKEC: to to use so health services.

680
00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:18.240
VHAALTLEMKEC: we can add links to these little descriptions.

681
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:19.450
David: Yes.

682
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:20.160
VHAALTLEMKEC: Guy.

683
00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.010
VHAALTLEMKEC: Now.

684
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:27.639
VHAALTLEMKEC: I built both of these pharmacy and gynecology

685
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:34.739
VHAALTLEMKEC: on the same style, on the same design pharmacy had, or what used to be under programs as well.

686
00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:38.510
VHAALTLEMKEC: If you clicked on programs you would get it used to be

687
00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.759
VHAALTLEMKEC: pharmacy. Daisy Award B. Award.

688
00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:42.500
David: Got it.

689
00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.300
VHAALTLEMKEC: Because

690
00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:47.759
VHAALTLEMKEC: it has. I have to use that template

691
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:51.260
VHAALTLEMKEC: to get the ability

692
00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:53.730
VHAALTLEMKEC: to upload

693
00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:55.780
VHAALTLEMKEC: files.

694
00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.090
VHAALTLEMKEC: So for health, serve for women's health services.

695
00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:05.559
VHAALTLEMKEC: To be able to add these resources. I have to use the

696
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:08.680
VHAALTLEMKEC: detail page.

697
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:15.849
David: Oh, okay, so you would prefer that the facilities, health services

698
00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:17.610
David: have the same

699
00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.040
David: complexity and options that detail.

700
00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.849
VHAALTLEMKEC: Detail page did exactly.

701
00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:25.930
David: Because you were forced to

702
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.090
David: pick a detail page because you had all these links.

703
00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:36.119
VHAALTLEMKEC: Right, because the more they have more so you have the Facility Health Service.

704
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.100
David: Yes.

705
00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:42.470
VHAALTLEMKEC: When you build it. This is just literally the little bit that pops up

706
00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:44.420
VHAALTLEMKEC: on that dropdown.

707
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.700
David: Right.

708
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.760
VHAALTLEMKEC: You know. So it's that's all that is.

709
00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.170
VHAALTLEMKEC: Then

710
00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:52.460
VHAALTLEMKEC: you have

711
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.090
VHAALTLEMKEC: the system health service.

712
00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:04.579
VHAALTLEMKEC: That is what you can make. If you wanted to add a ta, or add a link in the dropdown

713
00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:07.169
VHAALTLEMKEC: to give you more information.

714
00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:10.420
David: And that's where you put those links. These are the.

715
00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:14.470
VHAALTLEMKEC: This is where I would like to put the links, but I don't have the option.

716
00:49:15.110 --> 00:49:16.270
David: I see.

717
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:22.680
VHAALTLEMKEC: The only option I have is to put in a paragraph, and up to 6 bullet points.

718
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:24.700
David: Got it.

719
00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:30.810
VHAALTLEMKEC: Whereas I would like to be able to create an entire detail page

720
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:35.140
VHAALTLEMKEC: for that, because when you do build a detail page

721
00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:40.749
VHAALTLEMKEC: or just have this option, added the detail page

722
00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.100
VHAALTLEMKEC: you

723
00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.059
VHAALTLEMKEC: get to select my Altoona

724
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.200
VHAALTLEMKEC: system.

725
00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:51.570
VHAALTLEMKEC: I get to select Altoona again

726
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:56.779
VHAALTLEMKEC: down here. It's going to provide a menu link. I can't turn that off.

727
00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.990
VHAALTLEMKEC: and I can tell the link, you know.

728
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.679
VHAALTLEMKEC: whatever I wanted to call it.

729
00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:09.770
VHAALTLEMKEC: But the only place I'm allowed to put it, is programs

730
00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:14.439
VHAALTLEMKEC: under under any of the program lines under research

731
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:15.890
VHAALTLEMKEC: which is disabled

732
00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.050
VHAALTLEMKEC: jobs and careers.

733
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:21.990
VHAALTLEMKEC: volunteer donate or doing business.

734
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.190
VHAALTLEMKEC: I can't put it under health care.

735
00:50:29.550 --> 00:50:31.290
David: Got it. Okay?

736
00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:45.140
David: Well, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me today. I know we're right at time. I did want to open it up to my Notetaker Observer. If there's any additional questions anyone has

737
00:50:45.591 --> 00:50:47.450
David: feel free to ask them

738
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:48.690
David: now.

739
00:50:50.056 --> 00:50:51.239
Megan Commons: None from my end.

740
00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:54.490
Megan Commons: Yeah.

741
00:50:54.490 --> 00:50:58.480
Marisa: No, no questions for me either, David. Thank you, Chris, for for your time today.

742
00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:00.869
VHAALTLEMKEC: Oh, I'm happy to do it! Not a problem.

743
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:05.400
David: Great? Well, and do you have any questions for me as we wrap up.

744
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:09.369
VHAALTLEMKEC: No, no, actually, this was very productive. I appreciate it.

745
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:25.670
David: Yeah, it was super productive. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time today to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful for making Vagov easier for veterans and editors alike to use. So thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

746
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.060
VHAALTLEMKEC: Alright! Thanks a lot. You, too.
