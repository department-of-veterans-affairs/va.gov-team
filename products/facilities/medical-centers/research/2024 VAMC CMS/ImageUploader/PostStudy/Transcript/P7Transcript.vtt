1
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.080
David: And

2
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:10.190
David: yeah, I've started the recording. And I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.240
michael compeau: I am happy with that. Yeah.

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.920
David: Great, great, great, great, great.

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:24.139
David: Okay, Michael. So my 1st question for you is, could you tell me a little bit about your role at the Va. And how often you're using drupal cms to upload images.

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.430
michael compeau: Okay.

7
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.139
michael compeau: I joined public affairs in the Va. 5 years after I joined the Va.

8
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:45.779
michael compeau: After 30 years in private industry, doing everything from marketing for palm pilot software to marketing for mobile construction software

9
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.890
michael compeau: to

10
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.840
michael compeau: helping do marketing and sales for

11
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.173
michael compeau: semiconductors and

12
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:24.590
michael compeau: basically databases for a united way organization. So I've done a lot of different things right? So I came into the Va. And I've worked with drupal on the outside the semiconductor firm. I stood up an entire site within drupal and worked within drupal for another semiconductor resource site. So I was familiar.

13
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.750
michael compeau: And

14
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:30.140
michael compeau: then quickly shocked at the

15
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.280
michael compeau: tiny box that we were put into at the Va, so yeah, Erica, that's for you. So I

16
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.090
michael compeau: spend, maybe

17
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:58.080
michael compeau: I would guess I upload images no more in my role which is media relations. So I'm doing news releases press releases media advisories and stories. Va stories. Okay.

18
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:16.060
michael compeau: typically, I will sometimes be called upon because of my editor status to update health services in various sections of the whole network. So I might be changing Cboc hours. I might be updating dialysis related information. In some cases. So

19
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.619
michael compeau: I've got lots of comments about that. But that's not our scope today. So images.

20
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.248
michael compeau: I upload a lot less than I'd like to. How about we start there.

21
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.000
David: Tell me more about that.

22
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.970
michael compeau: Well, because I can't upload an image with a news release.

23
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.399
michael compeau: Really? Well, I can do one, I think, one.

24
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.660
michael compeau: as I recall.

25
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.210
michael compeau: So there are instances where it might be nice to have some flexibility. With that.

26
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.719
michael compeau: I have tried in one instance for a story, to upload an animation.

27
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.389
michael compeau: because I can't do a quick carousel of 2 images. So I made a a

28
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:08.098
michael compeau: animation, and the animation didn't work once it was uploaded. So those are the things I've experienced. Basically related to lockdown issues with

29
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.460
michael compeau: the templates. I would like to put images

30
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:21.136
michael compeau: in and amongst the information on pages so that we can portray information in a more

31
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:49.800
michael compeau: better ui ux experience for our customers, because I come from the commercial industry and actually managing visitor. Path through websites towards a e-commerce goal, and we do not with drupal have any capability or understanding and flexibility to do that kind of path management for visitors with the

32
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.660
michael compeau: Klugey

33
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.140
michael compeau: structure we've been given which has basically been designed to

34
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:00.334
michael compeau: create

35
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:10.829
michael compeau: a professional directory like pages of information, all formatted the same. So that it's easy.

36
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.222
michael compeau: you know, for

37
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.089
michael compeau: us ourselves to manage.

38
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.050
michael compeau: It's not designed with the user in mind. And it's my biggest problem with how we have gone about this up to this point.

39
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.329
michael compeau: so I'll shut up. Now about that.

40
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.020
David: So.

41
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.230
michael compeau: I would I would use images a heck of a lot more if I could, in a lot more places.

42
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:37.718
David: Yeah. So let's talk about stories. For like one example, when you're getting when you're working on a story,

43
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:47.429
David: could you describe the general workflow when you're uploading an image like where the image is coming from, and then, if you go through.

44
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:56.520
michael compeau: Well, we have a medical media department. We are a tier one, a facility. So we're at the highest level of complexity, and probably the most number of people within public affairs.

45
00:04:56.886 --> 00:05:05.299
michael compeau: Who are responsible here at this facility for drupal. I know that may not be the case everywhere, but here. It's in public affairs, domain.

46
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.510
michael compeau: And so

47
00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:30.299
michael compeau: I have a photographer in medical media. He does not touch the website. He does not touch drupal. He will share a file with me on onedrive or folder. I mean on onedrive. I will download those images to my computer, because that's the only way it works. God help us! And then I will upload those

48
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.329
michael compeau: at the time I'm I'm publishing the story.

49
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.370
michael compeau: Okay, so I will upload those as a

50
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.580
michael compeau: as a save and insert

51
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.090
michael compeau: option.

52
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:48.430
michael compeau: because the other dark button next to the grayed out save and insert, doesn't work, so I don't use it because it's broken.

53
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.750
David: They've been select.

54
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.340
michael compeau: Yeah, that doesn't work.

55
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.400
michael compeau: That's useless. Take it off. If if it's not going to do anything, get rid of it.

56
00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:06.480
David: Cool, cool. Okay? And then tell me about preparing the image. Do you find yourself ever doing cropping or things like that before?

57
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:14.019
michael compeau: the occasions in which I'm doing annoying needless cropping

58
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:22.160
michael compeau: really mostly relates to issues, not with drupal with, but with team site because of key staff.

59
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.250
David: Okay.

60
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:45.490
michael compeau: And where they have to be a very certain aspect ratio and a very certain and I know there's open source tools that could easily do all of that for us, and allow us a whizzy wig. Repositioning of images. It would be nice to see something like that. I I almost always upload the image as original format.

61
00:06:45.880 --> 00:07:02.803
michael compeau: So I select that I'm not using one of the other 15 options, for you know this many pixels by this many pixels or 4 by 3 aspect. I'm not doing that. I'm just using original format the way it comes out of the camera. That's plenty good for me. We need to get the image up and and

62
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:12.989
michael compeau: there's few enough people that see it, anyway, on the actual internal page. If we look at visitors. It's not worth too much extra time if it's not easy.

63
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.520
David: Got it.

64
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:15.660
David: My

65
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:23.729
David: correct me if I'm wrong. It. The staff profiles, those are all one by one, like squares. Is that correct?

66
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.030
michael compeau: No.

67
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.170
michael compeau: no.

68
00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.299
David: Files. No, okay.

69
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.310
David: yeah. So

70
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:44.365
David: we'll get into that. But in a Co. In a second I have one more question for you. Do you ever use images from the media library? Or do you typically upload new ones?

71
00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.310
michael compeau: Now I'm going to ask you to define Media library.

72
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.789
David: Yes, so the media library is

73
00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:58.790
David: all the images that have been uploaded. So perhaps you've uploaded an image of like

74
00:07:59.908 --> 00:08:03.130
David: for a story, and you want to reuse it.

75
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:08.830
michael compeau: Oh, okay, I have seen that I'm adding text so that I could find it.

76
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.750
michael compeau: I am

77
00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.510
michael compeau: rarely ever assuming that it's worth my time to look

78
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:38.129
michael compeau: for an image because I'm doing new things. New news release new stories, new events happening around our local Va new region. So I'm not looking for historical past postings. To then utilize. The only time I would look for something from the past to maybe utilize would be when I go to

79
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.370
michael compeau: divos, or whatever the heck the military site is called with all the images.

80
00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.700
michael compeau: You don't even know what I'm talking about.

81
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.390
David: Really, I know.

82
00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.510
michael compeau: Okay. So this is important to know about, because

83
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.590
michael compeau: because

84
00:08:50.960 --> 00:09:04.670
michael compeau: when I'm looking for pictures of maybe a doctor who had served in the service, and I'm looking for an image of them in fatigues. Or what have you? Then I will go to the military's public Affairs website, which

85
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:12.959
michael compeau: is a full repository of all the various armed service branches and all the images that all the public affairs officers have uploaded

86
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:29.100
michael compeau: and utilize, or maybe not utilized, but upload it. So they're all available. So then, because they're disciplined about data entry and metadata, I can put in their rank, and I can put in their service, and I can put in their last name, and I can find pictures of individuals there.

87
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:35.370
michael compeau: I've never used the provision for the quote unquote media library within drupal.

88
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.660
michael compeau: because

89
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:43.500
michael compeau: I'm never in a used case where I expect to be able to find something from somewhere else

90
00:09:43.710 --> 00:10:04.220
michael compeau: like another. Va. Why am I ever gonna look for somebody's photo of a person on another Va. Unless they're coming here as a director, in which case we're gonna take a new picture of them as they arrive here in our medical media group. Right? And so I will utilize that picture. So I think the use case for that library

91
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.390
michael compeau: is you're going to find is very low.

92
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:08.720
David: Got it very well.

93
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.819
michael compeau: Rarely utilized.

94
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.370
David: Okay.

95
00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.240
David: so let's go on to our 1st task.

96
00:10:15.738 --> 00:10:30.810
David: So what I was hoping we could do and let me know if you need help with. This is to open your Cms log in and share your screen, and we're going to go through the process of uploading a story

97
00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:31.770
David: or.

98
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:37.359
michael compeau: So I should have some way to actually share. Oh, I see. Now, okay, yep, there it is.

99
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.750
michael compeau: Okay. Let's do this.

100
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:43.879
michael compeau: Can everyone see.

101
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.000
David: Yep, that looks good.

102
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:47.650
michael compeau: Alright. So

103
00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:55.489
michael compeau: I'm gonna go here to my link, which you see is right at the top, where I can find it quickly. Yep.

104
00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.809
michael compeau: it's gonna take me in here.

105
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:09.409
michael compeau: And at this point I'm going to not go to the outreach hub, because that's other different public affairs. People that have responsibility for that.

106
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:13.639
michael compeau: I'm responsible for the Va. Northeast Ohio healthcare.

107
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:21.360
michael compeau: and it always annoys me that you that there's different capitalization in there, and healthcare isn't capitalized and

108
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:31.700
michael compeau: northeast. Ohio is okay. So now I'm at my list where the most recent things that I did, for example, the news release this morning. You can see that that's

109
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.280
michael compeau: at the top. Everyone seeing this.

110
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.100
David: Yup, I'll see you back.

111
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.550
michael compeau: Alright. So you said a new story.

112
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:44.629
David: Well, whatever you find yourself doing the most that's.

113
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:45.659
michael compeau: Okay. Well, either one.

114
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:46.210
David: So.

115
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:52.570
michael compeau: It's gonna be almost the same exact process, because I'm going to go here to content. I assume you can see the cascading menus.

116
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:58.340
michael compeau: And then I'm going to either choose a new news release or I'm going to go down to New Story.

117
00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.539
michael compeau: or I might be adding a staff profile because we do hire

118
00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:15.360
michael compeau: not much anymore. But we do hire new people from time to time that need a new profile, or they get promoted to a level where they need a staff profile. So if I go in there and hit new story, for example.

119
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:17.120
David: Yeah, let's start with story.

120
00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.820
michael compeau: Now I'm going to wait for it to respond.

121
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.499
michael compeau: and I come here

122
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:38.389
michael compeau: now before I even do this. Of course I'm going to have a Microsoft word document that I've already written, and it's been reviewed by my supervisor

123
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:44.409
michael compeau: or the Pao, or whoever needs to review it, or all of the many people that need to review it.

124
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.050
michael compeau: So that will

125
00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.930
michael compeau: be done before I get here. Okay.

126
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.030
David: Got it.

127
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.370
michael compeau: So

128
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.250
michael compeau: I'll put in the title

129
00:12:57.718 --> 00:13:04.000
michael compeau: The author. Now that I've created a profile for myself that can be brought up.

130
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:11.910
michael compeau: this is obviously going to be a story into the story section, because that's the way we do things correctly.

131
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:34.369
michael compeau: And I have to make sure that I remember to check Va. Northeast Ohio healthcare over here, because somehow it's not automatic, even though that's who I'm associated with in the login. I've always wondered why that was not programmatically taken care of. And instead, I have to choose. Maybe it's because of this strange left to right outreach or mainstream thing here.

132
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:48.349
michael compeau: then I'm gonna slap the the lead in here the 1st sentence hopefully. This gives me enough characters for the 1st sentence. It often does not, particularly in news releases, and that frustrates the hell out of me.

133
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.769
michael compeau: I would like that to be 450 characters.

134
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.210
michael compeau: because there are times when

135
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.129
michael compeau: the 1st sentence has to include our whole name.

136
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:06.559
michael compeau: In fact, every time Va. Northeast Ohio healthcare system, how many characters is that a lot?

137
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.569
michael compeau: Then I have to start talking about content.

138
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.360
michael compeau: so that 300 character limit can be a real restriction

139
00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:28.519
michael compeau: in getting something to make sense. And my only option, if I can't cover it right, is to reword that entire 1st sentence and then paste the the story the way I want it, including the original 1st sentence down below.

140
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.250
David: Got it. Got it.

141
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:35.329
michael compeau: So I'm doing more work, because this 300 character limit is

142
00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:40.820
michael compeau: hard and fast and inflexible and doesn't understand different content.

143
00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.240
michael compeau: I see.

144
00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:45.909
michael compeau: So they'll paste that in here.

145
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:46.660
David: Okay.

146
00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:57.049
michael compeau: And then I'm gonna go down here and I'm gonna paste the main content in there.

147
00:14:57.445 --> 00:15:05.629
michael compeau: And all the rich formatting for Microsoft word that I paste in there is gonna disappear. And then I'm gonna remember to curse

148
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:17.450
michael compeau: at drupal again, because now I have to reformat it all because it wasn't utilizing the schema for Microsoft words storage of rich text.

149
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.119
michael compeau: Or I suppose I could save

150
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:31.739
michael compeau: the file as a rich text, file an Rtf file and copy and paste, and then I hope you're going to tell me. Oh, yeah, then that'll paste. In fine, Mike, or you're gonna frustrate me and say, no, it'll still paste in as plain text.

151
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.609
David: I wish I could tell you. I don't know.

152
00:15:35.750 --> 00:16:01.889
michael compeau: So that's a good thing to know, because that would help a work product is to basically allow me to save it as an Rtf. Knowing then that I could paste it and not lose formatting, because I'll have bullets, I'll have indents, you know. You want indented bullets. Well, once you get this and you paste it in there. The only way to to suddenly try to change the indenting is to drive into source.

153
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.219
michael compeau: which we have very little flexibility given in there for HTML editing, anyway.

154
00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:07.970
David: But.

155
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:11.020
michael compeau: So. So that's what I do.

156
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:24.069
michael compeau: So I would paste it in there. Then I'd have to reformat it all by looking back at my word document and making sure, I echoed. All of that. Look at the links and make sure all the links are still fully

157
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.275
michael compeau: have full integrity.

158
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:42.300
michael compeau: and haven't been fouled up by the Va. Let's obscure your link so it won't work machinations that it does if you paste into email, or, for example, stuff like that. You're looking like you don't know what I'm talking about.

159
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.120
David: I don't think I do exactly, but.

160
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.210
michael compeau: Okay, so.

161
00:16:46.655 --> 00:16:47.099
David: Idea.

162
00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.460
michael compeau: So like.

163
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:53.500
michael compeau: Let me give you a good example right here. Can you still see my screen? Now.

164
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.280
David: Yes.

165
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:56.059
michael compeau: My email from you.

166
00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.420
David: This. This, I I don't see my, your email from.

167
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.240
David: Well, yeah, I see the drupal contact management system.

168
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:08.629
michael compeau: Yeah, that's what that's what I'm talking about. So now look here, when I hover over that.

169
00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:14.720
michael compeau: do you see? Original URL? Right there in the pop up. Okay. Now look at the lower left.

170
00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:19.050
michael compeau: Look at the the toolbar area, whatever down at the bottom

171
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:26.390
michael compeau: it says, Https, Colon, slash! Slash! Gcc, 0 2 dot safe links dot protection.

172
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.569
michael compeau: Okay.

173
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:32.210
michael compeau: that's what the Va does to Urls whenever it gets a chance.

174
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.419
michael compeau: It obscures them.

175
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:42.779
michael compeau: And if you happen to be so green as to copy a link from an email like this and paste it

176
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:45.009
michael compeau: into drupal.

177
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.120
michael compeau: You get a unknown link

178
00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:54.069
michael compeau: because it won't convert it back to the real original. URL. You see in this, pop up. Okay.

179
00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.009
David: I see it's adding in that whole safe link, protection.

180
00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.930
michael compeau: Yes.

181
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:01.850
David: And ideally.

182
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:05.240
michael compeau: So if I copy that hyperlink right

183
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.320
michael compeau: then.

184
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.910
michael compeau: If I copy that hyperlink.

185
00:18:11.586 --> 00:18:14.949
michael compeau: Let's see, let's show me. Show me the damn link.

186
00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.490
michael compeau: paste this plain text. Yeah, see, it's pasting that bad link.

187
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:22.580
michael compeau: Right?

188
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:26.959
michael compeau: That that is what it's using to try and make the link.

189
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.220
David: I see I see what you're saying.

190
00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:35.560
michael compeau: That's a problem, because it makes more bad links, and it makes for a workflow. That

191
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:44.239
michael compeau: means there's a more, a greater chance for error. I don't know if there's a way to head that off of the pass programmatically, but I know this takes time

192
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.449
michael compeau: cleaning up these kind of unsafe links.

193
00:18:48.186 --> 00:18:49.180
michael compeau: Takes time

194
00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.050
michael compeau: or unworking quote, unquote, safe link

195
00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:56.200
michael compeau: is probably a more accurate way to put it.

196
00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.113
David: Yeah, well, thank you for sharing that.

197
00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:05.510
David: yeah, I'll yeah. We're we're we're definitely taking notes on on what you're sharing.

198
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:11.730
michael compeau: Okay. So once that's all done, then I'll go down here, and if I have

199
00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:27.550
michael compeau: 6 images that have been sent to me by the photographer that actually are really helpful to tell a story altogether. I go oh, damn! And then I curse drupal again for a couple of seconds, and then I pick one image, because that's all I can really do.

200
00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:30.409
David: So you you're normal.

201
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:31.320
michael compeau: Only.

202
00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.930
michael compeau: yeah.

203
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:41.310
michael compeau: for stories. Like, let's say, we have a 100 year old veteran who celebrates a birthday party.

204
00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:49.039
michael compeau: If if on social media. I'm going to post 7 images. Why shouldn't I be able to post 7 images here?

205
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:59.799
michael compeau: If we've taken 7 images and taken the time to send a photographer. Why can't our story here include 7 images.

206
00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.250
David: Yeah.

207
00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.099
michael compeau: So those are the questions I ask myself.

208
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.949
michael compeau: And then, yeah, once I go out here, then and I'm gonna select.

209
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.440
michael compeau: Let's say I go to pictures

210
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.480
michael compeau: and

211
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.850
michael compeau: let's see here.

212
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.779
michael compeau: I'm going to take an image. And I'm going to upload that

213
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:29.690
michael compeau: hopefully.

214
00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.948
michael compeau: Okay, there we finally go.

215
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:55.059
michael compeau: I'll type in a description or quote unquote caption. It's not clear what's being done with this description, I think. It would be good to actually have a label that more clearly describes how that's going to be used, or how it might be used, whether it's for search made metadata from your library, or whatever. It would be good to have a better explanation of that.

216
00:20:55.612 --> 00:21:16.780
michael compeau: Obviously the need to have to go in here when I've already selected back behind out there that it's for Va. Northeast Ohio stories. The fact that I have to then go in here and find Va. Northeast Ohio seems needlessly redundant, especially when we have a list of you know, 700 locations.

217
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:18.590
michael compeau: That's

218
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.740
michael compeau: that's

219
00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:24.429
michael compeau: that's an engineer's decision. That is not a usability decision.

220
00:21:25.135 --> 00:21:34.790
michael compeau: It's nice that we've got a place for alternative text, because that keeps us 508 compliant. And then, as I said before, for crop image, I'm always going down here to original

221
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.050
michael compeau: always

222
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:37.219
michael compeau: every time.

223
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:44.419
michael compeau: and then, as I said before, save and select, is useless, so we use, save and insert, even though it's grayed out.

224
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.150
michael compeau: I don't know who decided that this should be blue, and this should be

225
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.489
michael compeau: gray when this is the one that actually makes things happen

226
00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.930
michael compeau: alright. And then

227
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:21.409
michael compeau: at this point we should be all

228
00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.139
michael compeau: done right, so I can hit, save, and insert again.

229
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.920
michael compeau: because the Alt text made me

230
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.000
michael compeau: finish it.

231
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:38.440
michael compeau: But then it should come back here, we'll show the little media there.

232
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:44.150
michael compeau: We will realize that the description I type for that photo is not going to appear in the caption.

233
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.200
michael compeau: which is disappointing, but would have helped save work.

234
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.969
michael compeau: And then I type another caption.

235
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:10.269
michael compeau: and down here I can decide whether it's feature or not whether it's going to be in a certain order or not, and then select.

236
00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:13.749
michael compeau: You know how I'm going to put it in review.

237
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:24.920
David: That's perfect, and you don't know. You don't need to continue on further. I think we're ready to jump on to our second task. Now.

238
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.020
michael compeau: Okay.

239
00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:26.370
David: With the.

240
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.369
michael compeau: Out of here.

241
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:39.279
David: Perfect. Well, thank you so much for walking me through that really, really fantastic feedback. I'm gonna go and jump. Have are you familiar with events, pages, and creating events.

242
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.530
michael compeau: Sure. Yeah.

243
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.290
David: Okay, great. Great. So.

244
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:53.370
michael compeau: We don't usually use those because those are done by the outreach coordinators, which is a different job description. Typically.

245
00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:55.520
David: Got it.

246
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.510
David: But.

247
00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:59.209
michael compeau: We get asked to fix them.

248
00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.239
David: You get asked to fix them. Okay? So you're familiar with them enough?

249
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:05.410
David: We have a an example of

250
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:11.930
David: It's a prototype. It's a potential redesign of the image upload system. It

251
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:24.540
David: will mimic for the most part, the functionality that you're seeing in your stories. But this is just the one that we've created. So I went ahead and shared with you a link on zoom.

252
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.060
michael compeau: All right, let me close this out and stop sharing.

253
00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:36.240
michael compeau: okay, I see it here.

254
00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.399
David: So, yeah, and reshare your screen. That would be fantastic.

255
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.420
michael compeau: Yeah, we'll do. Once I get it going.

256
00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:43.670
David: Perfect, perfect.

257
00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:49.480
michael compeau: Alright.

258
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.770
michael compeau: And

259
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.840
michael compeau: is that it?

260
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.079
michael compeau: No, that's not it. Whoops.

261
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.641
michael compeau: that must be it. Okay.

262
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:08.350
michael compeau: okay, you should be seeing it now.

263
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.950
David: Yes, fantastic. Okay, so

264
00:25:12.424 --> 00:25:25.870
David: now, I'm showing you a potential redesign of the image upload system. This is 1st for events, but at the same time. That that current flow of the image should be very similar out.

265
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:32.239
michael compeau: So this this same bottom half of the window is is able to be lifted and put into the other tools.

266
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.169
David: Exactly. It'll be on like like you can imagine it for stories or for anything else as well. But.

267
00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:37.910
michael compeau: Sure.

268
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.670
David: Prototype. We just have events.

269
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:52.279
David: so now I'd like you to imagine that you start to create a new event for veterans. You've already entered in the date and time which location it's going to be happening at. And now it's time to upload the image.

270
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:54.820
David: But please show me how you would do that.

271
00:25:55.190 --> 00:26:03.059
michael compeau: One thing to note locations, for these events aren't restricted to Va. Facility locations.

272
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:05.380
David: Gotcha.

273
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:06.470
michael compeau: So

274
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.590
michael compeau: just to make that

275
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.670
michael compeau: comment, because

276
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:15.020
michael compeau: sometimes they're at

277
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:30.410
michael compeau: other locations and not so I don't know, cause I haven't. I haven't seen the rest of this page to know whether I have to choose from one of the existing facilities like I did for assigning my story, or whether you let me just type in an address.

278
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:37.159
michael compeau: But it's something for you to think about. You're gonna want to allow people, if it's not from an existing facility

279
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:44.649
michael compeau: to be able to type in an a name of a place. Maybe it's going to be at the football hall of Fame in Akron, Ohio.

280
00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.040
michael compeau: Then I want to be able.

281
00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.410
David: Yeah.

282
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.890
michael compeau: Add in, and the address.

283
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:55.889
David: I think I misspoke the event will be listed on. We we entered in where the event will be listed, I believe. Lower on.

284
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:07.119
michael compeau: That's what you mean. All right. Okay. I wanted to make sure, because I wasn't sure. All right. So once I get to this point you've given me control. So I can actually click on this. Is that right?

285
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:14.530
David: Yes, you can click on it. It's a prototype, so like you can't exactly do everything. But we'll talk about them.

286
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.389
michael compeau: Okay. And this recommended image size.

287
00:27:18.923 --> 00:27:28.740
michael compeau: Does that mean that I have to have modified my image to that size first? st Or is it, warning me that it's going to be cropping to

288
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.990
michael compeau: similarly configured number of megapixels.

289
00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:36.799
David: I'm not sure. What. What do you think.

290
00:27:38.928 --> 00:27:41.071
michael compeau: You're good. Good, good answer.

291
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:46.139
michael compeau: I would like it to simply be advising me that that the maximum

292
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:55.210
michael compeau: vertical number of pixels is this the maximum width is, or X is going to be this and that.

293
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:59.509
michael compeau: My image will be resized to this automatically.

294
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.440
David: Gotcha.

295
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:07.769
michael compeau: That's what I'd like and expect to happen that if 500 is the maximum in one direction that

296
00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:14.630
michael compeau: the the tool will handle resizing that to fit the aspect ratio provided.

297
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:28.969
michael compeau: After all, you're allowing 10 MB. That's going to be far bigger than that, to begin with. So that's why I would expect that. And because the tools we're using to generate these images make images way bigger than

298
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:39.120
michael compeau: than those parameters. And so it doesn't make sense to ask someone to go through another step before they're using a tool based in the cloud where all this heavy lifting could be done for me.

299
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:47.499
David: Yeah, so I'm curious. Is that are those bullets useful for you? What would make those bullets more useful for you?

300
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.389
michael compeau: You've got the supported file types here.

301
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.890
michael compeau: supporting gif would be helpful.

302
00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:06.929
michael compeau: You're young, so I'll translate.

303
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.640
michael compeau: You. Call it Gif. You're wrong, but that's okay.

304
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.209
michael compeau: But if it supported Gif, that would be helpful.

305
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:14.060
David: Okay.

306
00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:16.870
michael compeau: and

307
00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:25.620
michael compeau: The the size is really important to know, because there can be circumstances where you're getting something much bigger than that

308
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:33.229
michael compeau: but recommended seems to be the wrong word, because I don't know looking at that, whether recommended means

309
00:29:33.639 --> 00:29:36.359
michael compeau: I need to do something or I don't.

310
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:42.979
michael compeau: Does that mean you're going to size at this? Does it mean that it that the image

311
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:48.050
michael compeau: size with 2 different numbers there? X and Y is actually

312
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:52.939
michael compeau: the at the one aspect ratio that's allowed. I can't upload square.

313
00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.609
michael compeau: or is it going to be 500 by 500 pixels? If I upload square.

314
00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:58.049
David: Got it.

315
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:03.499
michael compeau: Unclear to me? Or is it 1,750 by 1,750? If I upload square?

316
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:05.360
michael compeau: Or do I have a choice?

317
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.350
David: So it's not. It's not incredibly clear what will happen to your image.

318
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.050
michael compeau: Yes.

319
00:30:12.050 --> 00:30:12.680
David: When you upload it.

320
00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:20.009
michael compeau: Or whether I'll waste time if I try and upload it without changing its size first, st and I don't even know other than

321
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:25.650
michael compeau: I am assuming the maximum dimension, because it doesn't say their maximum dimension is

322
00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:27.080
michael compeau: this, by this

323
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:35.710
David: So just and you're so it sounds like you're you don't often upload events, but one of the parameters

324
00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.330
David: is that it

325
00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:41.039
David: must be a 7 by 2 aspect, ratio.

326
00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.870
michael compeau: 7 by 2,

327
00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.489
michael compeau: 7 by 2.

328
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.350
michael compeau: So it's a banner.

329
00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:49.869
David: Like a banner. Yes.

330
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.299
michael compeau: Show me an example of that banner on this page

331
00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:56.559
michael compeau: in the proper aspect ratio.

332
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.680
michael compeau: and put the bullets inside it

333
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.609
michael compeau: and say, example, image.

334
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:05.960
michael compeau: because.

335
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.840
michael compeau: as I'm looking at 1750 by 500,

336
00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:16.880
michael compeau: I've done this for years, and I can't tell you which of those 2 dimensions is the up and down, and which is the side to side by just looking at that can't remember.

337
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:18.170
David: Yeah.

338
00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:19.760
David: Yeah.

339
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.360
David: Okay, feel free to keep going.

340
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:46.699
michael compeau: Room. There, put put the example, banner right for me, and show me this is 1750. By 500 your image will be cropped to this size. If that's what's gonna happen. Or make sure that your content fits within this. And ideally, I would be able to upload anything and a mask of the exact size that you want, an aspect ratio, a mask of that size is going to show up over the photo

341
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:56.679
michael compeau: and allow me to position it up, down, left, right, whatever, until what I want to see shows up, or I can resize it. Until it fits

342
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.109
michael compeau: within. You know that parameter.

343
00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:06.720
David: Please click the upload image button. Let's see what happens.

344
00:32:08.830 --> 00:32:16.040
michael compeau: Alright. So you've got an example. Well, that is, that's a good start. Now. I can't move anything so.

345
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:22.149
David: Yeah. And that's just because it's a prototype, unfortunately, but like, ideally, yeah, I was excited for you to click that.

346
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:25.273
michael compeau: You're on right track. Right? Hell, yeah.

347
00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.519
David: We're aligned there.

348
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.910
michael compeau: Yeah, no, that's absolutely yup

349
00:32:31.676 --> 00:32:33.070
michael compeau: alternative text.

350
00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:34.490
michael compeau: And

351
00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.430
michael compeau: okay, good

352
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.340
michael compeau: and save and upload. Oh, my God, thank you.

353
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.029
michael compeau: Very clear.

354
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.890
michael compeau: No, that's that's very nice.

355
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:55.873
michael compeau: very nice, having the preset aspect ratio, and that it just goes to that excellent

356
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:57.540
michael compeau: yeah.

357
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:03.879
David: Okay, so what stands out to you about this new design.

358
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:13.259
michael compeau: I don't know whether I can resize the photo, or will be able to to only use a portion of that

359
00:33:14.034 --> 00:33:14.770
michael compeau: image.

360
00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:22.570
michael compeau: But here's the deal. Usually when I want to upload something related to event. What I really want to upload is the flyer

361
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:34.079
michael compeau: that was created by our medical media team. That is, 8 and a half by 11. That has all the information on it already done. So I'm not creating yet another image just for this place.

362
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.399
michael compeau: I want to be able to use what I've already got.

363
00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.500
michael compeau: so I'd like to be able to upload

364
00:33:41.530 --> 00:34:00.479
michael compeau: the flyer thing. Now, if you want to make me do a preview of that flyer, and you're going to give me a ski goggle view of just a part of that image that I can position as you were showing in your tool, and then you can click on it, and it brings up the whole image. Win.

365
00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.780
David: Got it, so

366
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:08.510
David: did the new features in this

367
00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.690
David: help you upload the image more efficiently

368
00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.929
David: in this new design.

369
00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:18.087
michael compeau: It was cleaner cause you reduced steps, and you already know that.

370
00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:20.788
michael compeau: so that was good.

371
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.119
michael compeau: because of the things I already mentioned.

372
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.969
michael compeau: I don't know if I have that same

373
00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.679
michael compeau: glee.

374
00:34:31.017 --> 00:34:37.920
michael compeau: When you roll out the tool, if I don't know for sure what else happens, and if you were to take and lift this

375
00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:44.229
michael compeau: directly into, for example, pasting for stories or news releases for image support.

376
00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:45.610
michael compeau: then

377
00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:48.710
michael compeau: I would want to know.

378
00:34:48.810 --> 00:35:14.559
michael compeau: Do I have a choice of aspect ratios for that image. Do I have the ability to choose a thumbnail, which is maybe a part of the image, and then, when the whole story is clicked on after the preview page, because you know, the preview page and drupal's got the little lead with the headline, and you could put a thumbnail image next to that, that thumbnail doesn't have to be the same as the other image. It could be especially section portion, just like you crop this one

379
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:21.849
michael compeau: right? In order to lead to this, the thumbnail could be a section. And then, when I go to the actual story the whole picture loads.

380
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:32.819
michael compeau: and it shows me that I have options for the in the carousel to see up to the other 20 images that I uploaded also with your new tool that you're going to create

381
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:34.050
michael compeau: this week

382
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:35.550
michael compeau: tomorrow.

383
00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.660
David: So you'd like just to reiterate

384
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:40.230
David: just the

385
00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.160
David: so it

386
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.770
David: for this on the stories pages, the stories that you are always working on.

387
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:52.014
David: you'd you'd like to be able to like kind of crop into that

388
00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.710
David: the thumbnail.

389
00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:59.619
David: Identify what you want your thumbnail to look like and also be able to upload other imagery, imagery.

390
00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:03.430
michael compeau: Yeah, let me let me give you an example. This is still sharing right.

391
00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:04.290
David: Yep. Yep.

392
00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:06.440
michael compeau: All right. So let's have a look at this

393
00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.580
michael compeau: in stories. Here.

394
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:16.350
michael compeau: let's look at this right here. This is where this issue came up Secretary Mcdonough, and it's visit Cleveland.

395
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:17.630
michael compeau: Alright.

396
00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:24.630
michael compeau: This is specifically the image that had been made to be a rotating with 2 images.

397
00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.899
michael compeau: Okay? And only the 1st one ever shows up.

398
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.190
David: Got it.

399
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.550
michael compeau: Okay.

400
00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:45.269
michael compeau: what I might like is back on this page to have just a view of the veteran itself zoomed in. So you can see what's going on there, instead of the whole entire image

401
00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:46.550
michael compeau: sunk down.

402
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:54.839
michael compeau: There are times when it would communicate more and be a better usability aspect for me to select

403
00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:04.510
michael compeau: a portion of an image, because otherwise it gets too tiny. You can't see what's going on here. It can't do its job in drawing interest

404
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:06.809
michael compeau: and helping create more clicks

405
00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:08.620
michael compeau: if it is not

406
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.870
michael compeau: appearing to be more salient.

407
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:17.789
michael compeau: and I can do that if you can give me the ability to to zoom in for the thumbnail.

408
00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:24.090
David: So cause these thumbnails. They look all pretty standard size.

409
00:37:24.090 --> 00:37:24.610
michael compeau: Yeah.

410
00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.969
David: That aspect ratio would be the same.

411
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.840
David: But you're saying being able to like zoom into someone's face, or like

412
00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:38.190
David: make that aspect ratio a little bit like more cropped around the things that.

413
00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:52.789
michael compeau: I'm not. I'm not saying that I think like here. This this image just is a different size. So that's why the thumbnail is different, right? But you notice that's because there's a white edge over here. There's white margins.

414
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:55.100
michael compeau: because artificially, I did that.

415
00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:05.240
David: And tell me about you artificially doing that. How? What process did you use to add in those late margins.

416
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:10.160
michael compeau: I pasted the image I had into paint and drug it into the middle.

417
00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.809
David: You drag it into the middle.

418
00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:15.750
michael compeau: Left to right for the size that I needed it to be.

419
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.969
David: And what size did you need it to be? And.

420
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.639
michael compeau: Oh, I don't remember. I.

421
00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.360
David: Or how did you find out what size you needed it to be?

422
00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.550
michael compeau: Oh, that

423
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:31.049
michael compeau: That I think in this case was dictated by

424
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:40.910
michael compeau: no, not in that case, but in this case it was dictated by its use. I think, in social media or something like that.

425
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.950
michael compeau: So we're always looking to reduce

426
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:48.529
michael compeau: effort right? And not have to touch an image

427
00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:59.400
michael compeau: in new ways, nor rely on medical media. Nobody wants to create a work order saying, crop off the left and right of this image and send it back. Nobody wants to do that.

428
00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:11.859
michael compeau: The medical media is busy enough with a, you know, 4 days deep in work without me asking for them to crop something. So that's why, having these tools at the point of

429
00:39:12.415 --> 00:39:22.654
michael compeau: the point of care, if I can say that right here at the point of editing is the right place for those, because these are not sophisticated.

430
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.100
michael compeau: things that have to be thought out. They just have to be.

431
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:32.360
David: Now would would the tool that we were just looking at in the redesigned version

432
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:35.790
David: been able to support you, cutting off that left and right.

433
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.630
michael compeau: Yes, if I can zoom in and out.

434
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.269
David: If you can zoom in and out.

435
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:44.310
michael compeau: Yeah, yeah, that sounds like that would be exactly correct. Yup.

436
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.040
David: Fantastic.

437
00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:54.030
michael compeau: Like. In this case we had to do layering to try and get the idea across, because again, we didn't have option of a Carousel

438
00:39:54.500 --> 00:40:06.249
michael compeau: would have liked to have had a variety of different photos, but the only way we could collapse the idea down to communicate anything was in in with one image was to do this kind of

439
00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.910
michael compeau: layering over.

440
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:09.300
michael compeau: So

441
00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:16.209
michael compeau: I know this is not what you're working on right now, but I'm never gonna miss a chance to tell you so.

442
00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:21.590
David: Yeah, I'm I'm curious. Who's are you doing that? Layering also in paint?

443
00:40:22.516 --> 00:40:32.280
michael compeau: No, no, that was done by the actual medical media people. I'm telling you did it in paint because it was me doing it. I I was not going to fill out a work order for somebody else.

444
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.170
David: I see. Yeah, got it.

445
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:40.750
michael compeau: And and even though I've got a license to the adobe creatives, cloud and have experience

446
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.030
michael compeau: 15 years working with Photoshop, but

447
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:50.039
michael compeau: it takes longer to load the app than it does to get done. What you need to get done.

448
00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.999
David: Got it got it so.

449
00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:08.280
michael compeau: It makes sense to have again. You've got all this great power of being in the cloud with these tools that are open source in drupal for being able to do this manipulation. Just give us access to the tools. Let us do it at the point of publishing.

450
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:14.489
michael compeau: It makes way more sense than to have a part of a pre publishing workflow upstream, back upstream.

451
00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.590
David: Great, great. So

452
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:23.029
David: Think that we're we're we're just at time here.

453
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.540
David: I wanted to ask if you have

454
00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:28.789
David: any questions for me.

455
00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:40.510
michael compeau: I have lots of questions, none that you're going to be able to answer. So I'm not going to embarrass you by asking them.

456
00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:51.930
David: Yeah, I appreciate. But I am an independent researcher. So we're working with site wide. But I don't think I can answer very specific questions.

457
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:58.990
michael compeau: Yeah, no problem. I mean. So I I hope I've given you like the key user stories here.

458
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:14.730
David: Yes, no, I so appreciate the thoughtfulness of your feedback. I would like to invite any other questions if our observers or notetakers had any questions they'd like to ask at this time.

459
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.939
michael compeau: Anybody still at your desk?

460
00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.350
Megan Commons: Still here, but no questions for me.

461
00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:27.910
Steve Rancour (he/him): No questions.

462
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:38.649
Erika Washburn: No questions, Michael, but you've given me a lot to think about. I've already started writing some notes down, because I know this is about image uploader. But you've given us a lot of feedback on other items. So I'm going to take these back to

463
00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.380
Erika Washburn: my colleague as well, so we can.

464
00:42:40.380 --> 00:43:01.509
michael compeau: I I appreciate the opportunity to tell you about this. Well, I mean, like, I said, I worked in the software biz, so I get it, and I know it's hard sitting in your office somewhere else, not using the tools every day, or in that actual workflow to know what the pain points are. So I appreciate you asking and and doing this work.

465
00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:07.129
David: Great. Well, thank you so much, Michael, and I hope you have a great rest of your day.

466
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:09.120
michael compeau: Yeah. Take care. Thanks. Guys.
