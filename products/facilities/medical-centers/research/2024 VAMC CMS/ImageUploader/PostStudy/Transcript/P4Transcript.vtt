00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.159
VHACLEWahlJ: Experience and

2
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.849
VHACLEWahlJ: and and hope that I can.

3
00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.419
VHACLEWahlJ: you know, add any

4
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.090
VHACLEWahlJ: you know, side notes, or anything that maybe could help the future work with triple.

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.330
David: Fantastic, fantastic, and just to confirm, you are comfortable if I record the screen and audio today.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:28.669
David: Yes, okay, great, great. So it's all started. So could you tell me a little bit about your role at the Va. And how often you're using Cms to upload images.

7
00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.980
VHACLEWahlJ: My role at the Va. I've worked here

8
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:41.169
VHACLEWahlJ: about a year now, and my role is in public affairs where I work with external releases

9
00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:52.560
VHACLEWahlJ: including website, management, social media management and any any anything that's going out to the public facing products. So that that involves our

10
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.130
VHACLEWahlJ: our Va northeast Ohio healthcare system

11
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.970
VHACLEWahlJ: website that involves any kind of releases that we do as far as news releases with the public.

12
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.710
VHACLEWahlJ: And

13
00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:12.262
VHACLEWahlJ: that. That's kind of the All all inclusive, what we do, just any, anything external to our external stakeholders. We're working with them, and we and we're using them. We want to communicate with them

14
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:24.130
VHACLEWahlJ: via our drupal as well as our social media, where we we merge those 2 together. So we can funnel people to the website for more information. And you know, so it's kind of a mixture of just anything

15
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:40.010
VHACLEWahlJ: that's external to the the Medical Center itself. Just the communication we want to get to to a reliable source for people to to land on, and to find their path to where they need to get support and the opportunities we provide here with the veterans.

16
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.590
David: Gotcha gotcha.

17
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.354
David: Now, what kind of

18
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.519
David: when you're on? va.gov, what ex?

19
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.590
David: When are you uploading images? For what kinds of content types.

20
00:01:54.572 --> 00:02:06.077
VHACLEWahlJ: We'll work with it. For if it is a news release, typically, there's photos or images that we want to go with that release like, if there is some kind of award, or there's some kind of

21
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.379
VHACLEWahlJ: new thing that our research department came along, because we also have 2 research departments here.

22
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.750
David: It, knows.

23
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.421
VHACLEWahlJ: East Ohio, where that we we work with them, too. They they fall under us under the Va. So

24
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.159
VHACLEWahlJ: It's just a help of visual illustration and and support to that story from that perspective.

25
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:40.600
VHACLEWahlJ: And then, again, too, on on the the static pages, the web pages where we want to include a a photo of some. Maybe it's a maybe like for the research, like they'll they'll have a lot of hands or different new products that you know, you can explain in a

26
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.830
VHACLEWahlJ: in text, but it's gonna help the audience understand through through photos. And maybe maybe sometimes

27
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.470
VHACLEWahlJ: more than one photo might be beneficial to that story, or that to that, that page where people can.

28
00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.399
VHACLEWahlJ: you know, just visually see and understand, especially for different types of learners out there that that can go onto this page and may maybe they can.

29
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:15.780
VHACLEWahlJ: Maybe that. Would that help them understand the product a little better? Maybe that will communicate a little better. So the individual side. That's another part of what we do. We're on both both sides of that. With the external releases.

30
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.709
David: Gotcha gotcha. Okay? So when you have external releases or like news, or something like that.

31
00:03:25.144 --> 00:03:26.800
David: do you find yourself

32
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.440
David: like

33
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.390
David: picking the images that are going, are you? Is someone sharing the images that need to be uploaded to you.

34
00:03:38.021 --> 00:03:43.890
VHACLEWahlJ: Both sides as far as if it is a specific branch like if it is

35
00:03:44.806 --> 00:03:47.833
VHACLEWahlJ: depend depending where it's coming from it, you know.

36
00:03:48.924 --> 00:04:02.099
VHACLEWahlJ: We. I don't own anything in research. We don't control any of that stuff we we might have. We have a medical media team who has photography here, so they might work with us on that aspect. So we have a controlled image imagery from that perspective.

37
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.490
VHACLEWahlJ: however, sometimes they there is an existing product photo that we might use.

38
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.299
VHACLEWahlJ: But typically on external release. If it's something that's newsworthy that we're putting out, we will. We will

39
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.370
VHACLEWahlJ: have more control in that photo.

40
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.000
VHACLEWahlJ: And and.

41
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.639
David: You find your.

42
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.880
VHACLEWahlJ: With a story.

43
00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.850
David: Do you find yourself like cropping the images or editing these images before you're uploading them? Or do you kind of just take it at as

44
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.840
David: as it is.

45
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:41.789
VHACLEWahlJ: No, if if I'm putting something out there because I'm sometimes the end before it goes out, the more of the last approval area cause. That's more. My my role here, too, is also to ensure

46
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:51.950
VHACLEWahlJ: through this line that it's come through of of from medical media to photography, from the the client itself that it fits and it still describes

47
00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:59.390
VHACLEWahlJ: wouldn't need to describe, because I I notice sometimes in triple things will get cut off, and there's like a a little bit lack of control.

48
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.200
VHACLEWahlJ: as far as how it will display on the other side.

49
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.240
VHACLEWahlJ: So

50
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.889
VHACLEWahlJ: i i i i do what I can to maybe make it fit the mold that

51
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.050
VHACLEWahlJ: drupal cms provides for us.

52
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.360
VHACLEWahlJ: But I'll do that with other other sites, too, as far as if it is a social media site like

53
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:31.200
VHACLEWahlJ: we. There's a couple of different ways. We'll need to crop things, too, that might not come out as the photographer originally intended it. But as long as it has

54
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.250
VHACLEWahlJ: the product in there that we need

55
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.669
VHACLEWahlJ: and the communication tools with it's

56
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.389
VHACLEWahlJ: that's what we do, too. We're just doing like a fine tune to make sure that it makes sense what's going out there as far as imagery side.

57
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.890
David: Got it. Got it?

58
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:55.620
David: Okay? So let's go ahead and jump into our 1st pass. Could you please open your Cms and log in

59
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.860
David: and then share your screen. The next prompt will be

60
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.850
David: having you kind of create a new page.

61
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.867
David: if if you're familiar with events, events would be a good one.

62
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.200
David: and just kind of watching your workflow as you go through that.

63
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.150
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay, let me.

64
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.039
VHACLEWahlJ: It's been a while since I use zoom. Let me make sure I got it right.

65
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.689
David: Yeah, I heard. Yeah, everyone we're talking to is more familiar with teams, I believe. Right?

66
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.300
VHACLEWahlJ: Yeah, they at at this place. My, my last place we use. Zoom.

67
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.780
VHACLEWahlJ: no, it's something

68
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.529
VHACLEWahlJ: actually before that, it was Google. But Google's restricted. Here zoom is. I I guess Zoom is working because I'm on on the site.

69
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.300
David: But.

70
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.820
VHACLEWahlJ: Everything is is through

71
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:51.109
VHACLEWahlJ: teams. Now, yeah, the that's what's kind of took on the monopoly as far as any communication tools here.

72
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.269
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay, screen. 2.

73
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.130
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay, it should be.

74
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.980
VHACLEWahlJ: Wait, that's you guys.

75
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.923
VHACLEWahlJ: these screens back together here?

76
00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.840
VHACLEWahlJ: no, that's on it.

77
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.330
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay.

78
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.210
VHACLEWahlJ: said.

79
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.269
VHACLEWahlJ: is, is it? Is it displaying? Right? Are you able to.

80
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.310
David: I'm not seeing anything yet.

81
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.760
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay. 2. Okay. Share.

82
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.489
VHACLEWahlJ: I had to click the share button. Here we go.

83
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:20.220
David: Oh, got it

84
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.010
David: perfect!

85
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.860
VHACLEWahlJ: So now I'm in dripple. These are these are my sections.

86
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.370
VHACLEWahlJ: We can go up to

87
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.810
VHACLEWahlJ: wait. Where's

88
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.949
VHACLEWahlJ: we might?

89
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:37.260
VHACLEWahlJ: Oh.

90
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.580
VHACLEWahlJ: okay, sir, yeah.

91
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.130
VHACLEWahlJ: Content.

92
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:58.859
David: So yeah, of these, you're you. Which ones are you using the most, making the most of.

93
00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.039
VHACLEWahlJ: well, we

94
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:03.400
VHACLEWahlJ: we've we've

95
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:11.160
VHACLEWahlJ: just recently I I made a whole new page. But if if it's just a page itself, if there's a specific page.

96
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.340
VHACLEWahlJ: I'll I'll go to that. But if it's an event.

97
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.739
VHACLEWahlJ: or if there's a story like a news release.

98
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:24.599
VHACLEWahlJ: We can go through there and populate the dialog boxes through throughout that. But.

99
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:32.949
David: Yeah, what? What do you most commonly use? What is more, more news releases more events.

100
00:08:34.859 --> 00:08:52.709
VHACLEWahlJ: I guess it would be news news release right now. Events we've we've already established those and kind of there's there. There shouldn't be anything specifically new popping up just yet. Th. Those are typically for outreach group who who go out and have

101
00:08:53.349 --> 00:08:59.109
VHACLEWahlJ: you know, appreciation days or awareness days at different locations around our

102
00:08:59.349 --> 00:09:01.089
VHACLEWahlJ: or area of operations.

103
00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:02.269
VHACLEWahlJ: They don't.

104
00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:11.529
David: So yeah, if we can do news releases, that's that's fine. What? I'm really curious about a news release is how you upload a photo.

105
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.310
David: Yeah.

106
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.500
David: I'm using.

107
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:21.520
VHACLEWahlJ: should be okay. Let me slow it down here for a moment. There's should be A

108
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.150
VHACLEWahlJ: and

109
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.410
VHACLEWahlJ: media.

110
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:39.800
VHACLEWahlJ: So we'll put the text of the file of the story in here, and then you can also add a Pdf file in there. So then, opening up a media library, add

111
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.280
VHACLEWahlJ: drop files here. Select a file.

112
00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.440
VHACLEWahlJ: me see if I can find him.

113
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.100
VHACLEWahlJ: Photo.

114
00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:54.839
VHACLEWahlJ: We have

115
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.070
VHACLEWahlJ: to see if I have

116
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.899
VHACLEWahlJ: 1, 2, 3.

117
00:10:25.063 --> 00:10:26.669
VHACLEWahlJ: Let's see.

118
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.930
VHACLEWahlJ: Cancel.

119
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.490
VHACLEWahlJ: Wow

120
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.820
VHACLEWahlJ: and media.

121
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:53.760
VHACLEWahlJ: So

122
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.930
VHACLEWahlJ: image

123
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.570
VHACLEWahlJ: slide file.

124
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.730
VHACLEWahlJ: I'll just do this one. It's fine.

125
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:31.990
VHACLEWahlJ: So

126
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:37.669
VHACLEWahlJ: this is just a file from a recent event they had in the

127
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.419
VHACLEWahlJ: in the Medical Center for wellness.

128
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.840
VHACLEWahlJ: Oh, no.

129
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.989
VHACLEWahlJ: And when that's uploading I just go down to

130
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.690
VHACLEWahlJ: are specific.

131
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.560
VHACLEWahlJ: Vision 10.

132
00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.399
VHACLEWahlJ: That's it. There's in 10

133
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:00.770
VHACLEWahlJ: northeast Ohio.

134
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.079
VHACLEWahlJ: Apply that.

135
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.139
VHACLEWahlJ: The Internet's slow here. So.

136
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.170
David: So are you

137
00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.439
David: uploading multiple images? Is that weird.

138
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.260
VHACLEWahlJ: No, it's it's 1 image.

139
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.960
David: Oh, it's 1 image. Okay.

140
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.730
VHACLEWahlJ: One jp, the the Internet is really slow.

141
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.720
David: Got it.

142
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.390
VHACLEWahlJ: I had to restart the computer a few times.

143
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:40.810
VHACLEWahlJ: even though I I do actually have a graphics computer. But but it still like struggles here. So

144
00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:50.080
VHACLEWahlJ: okay.

145
00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.819
VHACLEWahlJ: on this again. Section

146
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.870
VHACLEWahlJ: back to

147
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.430
VHACLEWahlJ: Vision 10. This is, this is where it's a little

148
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:13.200
VHACLEWahlJ: gets old, too. If you're doing a lot of things. Not not too bad. But you just want to make sure that you have everything

149
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.029
VHACLEWahlJ: attributed to the the correct healthcare system.

150
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:20.800
VHACLEWahlJ: yeah.

151
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.860
VHACLEWahlJ: Oh, sorry

152
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:27.970
VHACLEWahlJ: people.

153
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.880
VHACLEWahlJ: then I believe it gives you different ways to to crop the image

154
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.270
VHACLEWahlJ: here. So if if there wouldn't be a need to.

155
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.379
David: Have you ever used these before.

156
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.460
VHACLEWahlJ: I have

157
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:53.529
VHACLEWahlJ: to to control in at some aspect. So maybe I don't want the hand in there, or.

158
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:02.100
David: And which which of these typically is the ones you pick

159
00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.920
David: her.

160
00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.699
VHACLEWahlJ: Would use it.

161
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.139
VHACLEWahlJ: From from my

162
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:16.899
VHACLEWahlJ: experience I've only seen that you can, only you can only use one photo. So if there is a like this. This photo.

163
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.660
VHACLEWahlJ: which might tell a little bit of the story, may not tell all the story. Maybe there's another

164
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.220
VHACLEWahlJ: a member that should be in there

165
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.260
VHACLEWahlJ: that

166
00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.940
VHACLEWahlJ: an instructor or somebody.

167
00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:32.060
VHACLEWahlJ: It would be nice to have more than one

168
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.740
VHACLEWahlJ: photo available.

169
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.649
VHACLEWahlJ: This is free form.

170
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.820
David: Yeah, typically, which of these crop settings do you pick.

171
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:48.209
VHACLEWahlJ: Usually a 5 by 7 or 4 by. I guess it's not a 3 by 2.

172
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.969
VHACLEWahlJ: That would be just like a standard

173
00:14:53.995 --> 00:14:55.360
VHACLEWahlJ: generic photo like

174
00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.550
VHACLEWahlJ: horizontal photo that

175
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:03.189
VHACLEWahlJ: would fit seems to fit the format on drupal. The best.

176
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.400
David: Okay?

177
00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.829
David: And then what's the difference between save and select and save and insert.

178
00:15:15.391 --> 00:15:18.279
VHACLEWahlJ: Save and insert. We'll we'll put it into

179
00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.190
VHACLEWahlJ: the story that you're using right now. Say, I think

180
00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.720
VHACLEWahlJ: if I'm if I'm getting this right now, like it's been a while since

181
00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.849
VHACLEWahlJ: I've done. I didn't do the story last time, but

182
00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.670
VHACLEWahlJ: it's

183
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:43.090
VHACLEWahlJ: insert the way I understand it should just insert into the story, then

184
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.330
VHACLEWahlJ: select it

185
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:50.810
VHACLEWahlJ: you can. You can go back, and you, you can add me like this will store into a like a database

186
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.160
VHACLEWahlJ: that you can go back and and select later.

187
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.320
VHACLEWahlJ: so it would be

188
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:00.179
VHACLEWahlJ: down here. So now I could go back and

189
00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.040
VHACLEWahlJ: selected, or

190
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.160
VHACLEWahlJ: please.

191
00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.170
David: Got it.

192
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:25.770
David: Okay? Great. So overall. How was that experience for you of adding some media.

193
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.480
VHACLEWahlJ: which it, it seems

194
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:33.019
VHACLEWahlJ: to me, since

195
00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.690
VHACLEWahlJ: I've only worked with Cms since since I've been at this

196
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:38.380
VHACLEWahlJ: location. But

197
00:16:39.012 --> 00:16:42.950
VHACLEWahlJ: they they have it laid out to protect.

198
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:47.580
VHACLEWahlJ: you know, as restrictive as it can be to help protect

199
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:54.290
VHACLEWahlJ: and organize on probably a a larger scale. This content that goes through so that they can

200
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:59.701
VHACLEWahlJ: come through the audits. It's it's what my opinion is. I think it's slow a little bit. I wish there was a way to

201
00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.759
VHACLEWahlJ: like, since I'm always

202
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.990
VHACLEWahlJ: posting from

203
00:17:04.706 --> 00:17:06.890
VHACLEWahlJ: va northeast highway vision 10.

204
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.950
VHACLEWahlJ: I wish there was a way just to kind of make that a default setting as opposed to

205
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:16.619
VHACLEWahlJ: adding a photo and scrolling down through multiple different locations.

206
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:30.999
VHACLEWahlJ: If for each each time I want to do something, regardless of how many times. I do this a day or week, or something. I wish, though, if there were a way to expedite that, just to make a default setting for ourselves, and maybe I'm not familiar with that, too.

207
00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:38.369
VHACLEWahlJ: I I wouldn't say that I'm an expert with this setting, but I've I've worked with multiple settings

208
00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:45.618
VHACLEWahlJ: over a quiet of time between radio stations, between advertising locations and stuff. So

209
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.310
VHACLEWahlJ: it's just kind of a way of finding

210
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.079
VHACLEWahlJ: the the content you need and what you need to accomplish.

211
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:56.780
David: Yeah.

212
00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.000
David: Okay, well, thank you.

213
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.090
VHACLEWahlJ: I just I just see it.

214
00:18:02.777 --> 00:18:07.532
David: I was gonna move us on to our next. But, please if there's anything else you'd like to share

215
00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:10.680
VHACLEWahlJ: No.

216
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.550
David: Okay, great. So going on to the next part of our

217
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.730
David: session. I just shared with you a link

218
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.549
David: in zoom chat. So if you go ahead and click that

219
00:18:23.178 --> 00:18:25.070
David: it'll pull up a prototype

220
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.960
David: which we're currently working on.

221
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:51.679
VHACLEWahlJ: Hold on.

222
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:54.819
VHACLEWahlJ: maybe on 3 different screens here. So.

223
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.920
David: Oh, yeah, no, no worries. Take your time.

224
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.960
VHACLEWahlJ: Future.

225
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:24.680
VHACLEWahlJ: one moment.

226
00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.540
VHACLEWahlJ: Pew.

227
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:42.370
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay.

228
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.580
David: Okay, perfect, perfect.

229
00:19:54.978 --> 00:19:59.900
David: And I do have one quick question for you. Before we jump into this

230
00:20:00.545 --> 00:20:06.940
David: when you're receiving images from folks that you need to upload for news releases or things like that.

231
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:15.279
David: Do you ever find yourself like editing them or readjusting their sizing? And like Canva Photoshop things like that.

232
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.589
VHACLEWahlJ: Typically, we don't have canva here. But Photoshop.

233
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.770
David: Photoshop.

234
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:22.670
VHACLEWahlJ: Yes.

235
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:27.460
VHACLEWahlJ: a lot of times I'll edit I because I do at times.

236
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:36.989
VHACLEWahlJ: And this has happened even beyond this location, have to edit something that's coming from a field to somebody who's not maybe proficient in

237
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:53.620
VHACLEWahlJ: photography or or understanding of communications in general, like, it's just somebody with a cell phone, they click. They were at a location. They have content that we want to share. But maybe they have a big negative space over here, or they have exit signs up here, or they they have just ambiguous

238
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.329
VHACLEWahlJ: things that shouldn't be that take away or detract from

239
00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.700
VHACLEWahlJ: what we need to say. So, yeah, crop is

240
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.480
VHACLEWahlJ: often used before I do any release here.

241
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:13.610
David: Got it, got it? And have you ever used the built in tools in drupal to do any of that cropping? Or is it typically

242
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.790
David: in Photoshop or elsewhere.

243
00:21:19.470 --> 00:21:22.170
VHACLEWahlJ: My comfort level is probably Photoshop

244
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.050
VHACLEWahlJ: because I

245
00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.070
VHACLEWahlJ: my my career started out in design. And I've kind of I've

246
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.409
VHACLEWahlJ: I've kept up that proficiency. But

247
00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.700
VHACLEWahlJ: as as I've come over to the government side, I

248
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:40.810
VHACLEWahlJ: I've I've seen various levels of proficiency in

249
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:41.865
VHACLEWahlJ: in

250
00:21:42.550 --> 00:22:05.309
VHACLEWahlJ: this field, so I can understand why they have an easy tool in drupal. So I if if I'm in a hurry, though, I would still be able to use crop like like you saw me earlier whenever I was maybe restructuring the content. There, I I could do that, and a lot of times I'll I'll run out of time, too, because there's so much, so many things

251
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.659
VHACLEWahlJ: they are coming in from different angles that need to go out. So

252
00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.302
VHACLEWahlJ: my preferred way would be Photoshop. But

253
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:21.269
VHACLEWahlJ: If there's an easy tool, I would definitely use that because some of the adobe programs are a little more elaborate and and extensive where

254
00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:31.459
VHACLEWahlJ: the the newer tools like like Campbell or express you can. You can do extremely quick edits. So if there's something similar to that, that would

255
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:34.049
VHACLEWahlJ: that that's still beneficial.

256
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.707
David: Great. Okay? Well, thank you for sharing that.

257
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:44.540
David: If you go on the left nav, you'll see proposed flow as one of the options.

258
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:48.530
David: perfect.

259
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:58.541
David: And this is for events. But the the way images kind of work is is quite similar through events. News releases stories. So

260
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.530
David: I'd like you to imagine that you're creating a new page for an upcoming event.

261
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.171
David: and you have already included your

262
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:16.199
David: date for the event, the location that it's happening. And now it's time to upload an image.

263
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.489
David: and I'd like you to show me how you might do that.

264
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:26.469
VHACLEWahlJ: It looks like you have all the content above. So the upload image

265
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.820
VHACLEWahlJ: recommended

266
00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:31.259
VHACLEWahlJ: same content.

267
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.020
VHACLEWahlJ: This is.

268
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:40.420
VHACLEWahlJ: or Vince.

269
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.739
VHACLEWahlJ: I guess there's no

270
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:44.770
VHACLEWahlJ: and.

271
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.339
David: Doing cake.

272
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.130
VHACLEWahlJ: Keep that.

273
00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:56.669
David: Yes, and the prototype you're not. You would be able to like, move it up and down and crop it in real life. But this is a prototype. So we're not really able to do that. Okay, but yes.

274
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.860
VHACLEWahlJ: save a blonde.

275
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.270
David: So.

276
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.449
VHACLEWahlJ: I guess you can publish this to the National. They did have us

277
00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:31.460
VHACLEWahlJ: published a series of events earlier this year. That's what how we had populated events, driven things, but.

278
00:24:32.115 --> 00:24:36.570
David: So, how was that experience of just uploading the image.

279
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:45.160
VHACLEWahlJ: It was nice when I don't know if this will work on anything else but just clicking on.

280
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.469
VHACLEWahlJ: It's it's not even just the image, but also that any caption information.

281
00:24:51.590 --> 00:25:04.510
VHACLEWahlJ: Again, if there's a way to expedite some of that, some of that content. But yes, having less less buttons, and because I think you like you asked me before, and there was a bit of confusion about what does this mean versus this meeting? And

282
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.290
VHACLEWahlJ: and I I feel that I have some.

283
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:14.750
VHACLEWahlJ: some cognitive ability to understand graphics and Gui interfaces. But even for myself, coming in here like there's

284
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:24.250
VHACLEWahlJ: it, it could. You could use improvement and simplifying that one button save, publish. You're done that. That was a benefit in this.

285
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:25.920
VHACLEWahlJ: In this scenario.

286
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:35.559
David: Got it, got it. So, comparing this version to the current one that you're using for uploading images.

287
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.819
David: what what do you like about this version?

288
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:45.720
David: What if anything? Oh.

289
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:47.940
VHACLEWahlJ: We're just

290
00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.280
VHACLEWahlJ: with few fewer, like

291
00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.419
VHACLEWahlJ: the ability to

292
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.759
VHACLEWahlJ: to click on something and have it populate.

293
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:05.350
VHACLEWahlJ: I don't. I don't know if like. The Alt text had filled itself. If that was pre.

294
00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:12.600
David: Yeah, it automatically filled just because it just stimulate like you typing it in.

295
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:20.189
David: But you're saying that if it kind of automatically, just like, saw the picture, and recommended the alt text that would save you time.

296
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:36.279
VHACLEWahlJ: Definitely, because I mean, that's requirement, the 508 requirement on everything we do. And that's what we get audited on. So so some of the things you know with the current. AI, if you if you've seen any other programs, they they it can.

297
00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:46.870
VHACLEWahlJ: you know, have a baseline, like a picture of a group of people in a setting, or 3 people sent you could write it. It could just at least have some pre

298
00:26:48.170 --> 00:27:01.459
VHACLEWahlJ: pre completed text at some level, that if you again, if there's a way to expedite any of that, if it could, if you had AI interface or something that could just kind of be aware of the content of the photo. You could still go back and edit it, but

299
00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.509
VHACLEWahlJ: that would that would again help expedite the situation.

300
00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:12.369
David: Absolutely. Is there anything else besides that autocomplete that you like about this version

301
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:14.169
David: or this auto suggest?

302
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.070
David: And does.

303
00:27:17.865 --> 00:27:18.430
VHACLEWahlJ: Less

304
00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.580
VHACLEWahlJ: dialog boxes.

305
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.230
David: Supposedly.

306
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.655
VHACLEWahlJ: That

307
00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:27.160
David: And then I I mean more specifically around that image uploader.

308
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.520
VHACLEWahlJ: But well, there's only one

309
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:36.059
VHACLEWahlJ: one option as far as how that image is going to display on, on there!

310
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.650
David: Yeah.

311
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:40.679
VHACLEWahlJ: So I I

312
00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.069
VHACLEWahlJ: if if that if that's the scenario

313
00:27:46.419 --> 00:28:02.899
VHACLEWahlJ: like again, like I know, if if I go on social media, if I go on Facebook and want to share the Instagram at the same time with some of the the way they have it. I do have to have it formatted in a certain way, so it will display correctly on both. So

314
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:16.980
VHACLEWahlJ: sometimes Instagram is favored in in their kind of more boxy style, square style photos opposed to how the photographer might send it to me, so it will need to be cropped sometimes. But

315
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:20.610
David: Yeah, are you familiar with the

316
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:28.599
David: like? When you upload an image to events, there are size requirements and ratios. In order for event images.

317
00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.130
VHACLEWahlJ: Yeah. Philip.

318
00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.620
David: Through it. Yeah.

319
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:32.460
David: So.

320
00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:47.410
VHACLEWahlJ: And I have had some somewhere. There's like a group photos where it was, I guess, a little bit ambiguous, and some of the top, like the higher people in the group, got their head cut off, and it was just really difficult to to merge them into, to fit in there and

321
00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.130
VHACLEWahlJ: display correctly.

322
00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:49.480
David: Sorry.

323
00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:53.259
VHACLEWahlJ: Without. I mean, I didn't do any alteration on that photo, but it was

324
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.289
VHACLEWahlJ: sometimes that that could be, and that was an out of control photo. That was a group of.

325
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.970
VHACLEWahlJ: you know, people at a specific event, and it was

326
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:09.039
VHACLEWahlJ: some milestone they had achieved. And so I I we I don't believe we had a photographer there, so I used that photo. But

327
00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.260
David: Yeah.

328
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.652
VHACLEWahlJ: I guess if if this were to be implemented we we could

329
00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.160
VHACLEWahlJ: we could do that kind of awareness as best we could, and

330
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:24.850
VHACLEWahlJ: and I can see a bigger picture where we want to have a uniformity throughout

331
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:29.609
VHACLEWahlJ: the whole, the whole website like, so when people come to us, they.

332
00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:35.379
VHACLEWahlJ: They recognize the the and feel comfortable with the the layout, so I can see that.

333
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.610
David: Yeah, yeah.

334
00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:44.499
David: Now, are there any features in this updated version that you find confusing or unnecessary?

335
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:56.619
David: And more specifically around the image uploader?

336
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.020
David: When.

337
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:03.650
VHACLEWahlJ: No, it I mean it was

338
00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.189
VHACLEWahlJ: direct. It would just.

339
00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:08.909
VHACLEWahlJ: I mean, it does have a lot less

340
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:16.990
VHACLEWahlJ: of those dialogue boxes as far as for cropping like this way, this way, this way, this way. If maybe if there was just a

341
00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.280
VHACLEWahlJ: there was a free form.

342
00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.800
VHACLEWahlJ: I don't know that that might get messy, too, because people always

343
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:34.210
VHACLEWahlJ: you know not. Not everyone has an understanding of the graphics. So I suppose that the way this creates it

344
00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:37.950
VHACLEWahlJ: has a little more control, because.

345
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:46.560
VHACLEWahlJ: being on the other side, even though I'm more hands on in this in this role here, I've I've had even people who work for me who

346
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:57.279
VHACLEWahlJ: don't quite grasp it, but they not that they need to to do their job, but it just helps keep it clean and keep it looking professional at some level. So

347
00:30:57.533 --> 00:31:18.316
VHACLEWahlJ: I can understand if there were like fewer. Just like if you've been to the in and out, Burger, or you've been to some places where they have a real small menu like you can get 1, 2, or 3, and it it helps reduce versus if you're going to some place like the cheesecake factory, and they have a thousand things on the menu, and it's just overwhelmingly too too much. And for someone who's not familiar with this kind of.

348
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.586
VHACLEWahlJ: you know.

349
00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:25.773
VHACLEWahlJ: graphic interface it. It can be too much for them. It can cause confusion. It can cause.

350
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.900
VHACLEWahlJ: a a lot of

351
00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:37.429
VHACLEWahlJ: just a delay delay, and and that that's has a ripple effect across the board when you're trying to get a lot of content out and and trying to run an office so.

352
00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.649
VHACLEWahlJ: Having a a fewer selections like this. This is how we work.

353
00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.969
VHACLEWahlJ: I can see that that is a benefit.

354
00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.420
VHACLEWahlJ: I mean, if

355
00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:49.130
VHACLEWahlJ: maybe if there's a different version than just this

356
00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:52.850
VHACLEWahlJ: 7 by 2 version or something, typically maybe a.

357
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:57.803
VHACLEWahlJ: And unless there's statistics to prove that this is this is the best way. But,

358
00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:05.799
VHACLEWahlJ: I don't. I don't have any research on on that aspect, but I like the the idea of having

359
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:08.339
VHACLEWahlJ: a little bit less.

360
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:25.520
VHACLEWahlJ: a little bit less. Options like you said, like you mentioned in canva adobe express, or some online quick editor for people, or even all the apps. Now, too, that everyone can go on. You don't have to have any kind of graphics knowledge to go on and crop crop something because they've simplified it so much, and.

361
00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:26.660
David: And.

362
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.870
VHACLEWahlJ: That that I think that will help.

363
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.240
VHACLEWahlJ: And if the end product comes out looking professional.

364
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:46.639
David: Yeah, I do have a couple last questions for you. Do you ever find yourself using the media library and reusing images that you've already uploaded? Or do you find the majority of the images you're using are new

365
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.140
David: constantly.

366
00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:55.399
VHACLEWahlJ: I. I don't use the media library. I typically even when I'm creating something myself, I typically

367
00:32:55.510 --> 00:33:00.329
VHACLEWahlJ: have updated press content that that comes out it. It would be rare that

368
00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:05.880
VHACLEWahlJ: I think I would spend more time going back to try to find something specific

369
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.140
VHACLEWahlJ: and be then then

370
00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:15.169
VHACLEWahlJ: oh, especially through gerbil. Anyways, you know, if if it's some kind of external content that

371
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.360
VHACLEWahlJ: I'm I'm

372
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:23.379
VHACLEWahlJ: making for a social media make, we can use adobe stock or something, but and sometimes that's a little bit easier, but not

373
00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:29.869
VHACLEWahlJ: it. It'd be rare that I would, and I again. I I wouldn't eliminate it, but I I wouldn't.

374
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.080
VHACLEWahlJ: I have never used it. So that's what I.

375
00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.640
David: Yeah, no. Just curious.

376
00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:41.790
David: The other thing. I'm wondering. Could you go ahead and click that little X on the image? And I'd want to kind of just

377
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.950
David: walk through this upload image flow one more time.

378
00:33:46.846 --> 00:33:50.409
David: Yeah, if you click the blue upload image button.

379
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:55.243
David: So here on this page 1st of all.

380
00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.310
David: what do you think about that? Like those 3 bullets at the top?

381
00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:02.359
David: Are they useful for you?

382
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.790
David: Do you notice them?

383
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:11.380
VHACLEWahlJ: Hey?

384
00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:18.820
VHACLEWahlJ: I didn't notice them. I went straight. I mean, you have the bold blue and upload image, and that's what I'm looking for.

385
00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:19.739
David: Yeah.

386
00:34:20.005 --> 00:34:22.129
VHACLEWahlJ: Maybe they don't need to be at the

387
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:26.036
VHACLEWahlJ: top. Maybe if there was like a smaller version down here.

388
00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:30.739
VHACLEWahlJ: Jpeg, I don't know if there's a difference between Jpeg and Jpeg. But

389
00:34:30.859 --> 00:34:31.489
VHACLEWahlJ: just a small.

390
00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:38.337
David: Yeah, I learned, yeah, I learned to like this week that there is a difference. But I it's great that.

391
00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:39.579
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay. I've.

392
00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.650
David: That either. Yeah, I agree. That's a

393
00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.130
David: money on him.

394
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:54.810
David: Okay, got it? And then the other thing is one thing I'm not sure, if you've noticed also, is description has now been removed from this version.

395
00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.820
David: What do you think about that?

396
00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:03.050
VHACLEWahlJ: Well.

397
00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:12.360
David: And if you'd like a if you'd like to like kind of recall, if you click on the left version on the left map, the current flow you'll be able to

398
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:14.979
David: be. Oh, yeah, you could also do this way.

399
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.890
David: uploading.

400
00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:23.060
VHACLEWahlJ: Me see if it.

401
00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.480
VHACLEWahlJ: This one, I remember, took

402
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:42.300
VHACLEWahlJ: takes you through a few.

403
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.629
David: Oh, it might take yeah, sometime to upload.

404
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.460
VHACLEWahlJ: And tape.

405
00:35:59.272 --> 00:36:02.230
David: No worries. Take your time. That's

406
00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:03.810
David: Internet.

407
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.022
VHACLEWahlJ: Yeah, I guess

408
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:19.389
VHACLEWahlJ: so. It it did say that it allows gifs at one time, and I believe we tried to gif, but it it uploaded a gif because I think the it was another PA specialist who wanted to have

409
00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:25.450
VHACLEWahlJ: 2 photos rotate through. But it didn't. When when it went to that

410
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:30.119
VHACLEWahlJ: external side. It it didn't actually move. It stayed at one photo.

411
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.955
David: Oh, that's interesting. We'll definitely note that

412
00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.819
David: for our devs. But so just don't upload properly

413
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:38.909
David: our end when it.

414
00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:39.830
VHACLEWahlJ: It.

415
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.450
VHACLEWahlJ: He, he!

416
00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:44.370
VHACLEWahlJ: Because he was trying to get around the one photo and and

417
00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:51.590
VHACLEWahlJ: yeah, it seemed like it was working on our side, but not whenever it displayed on the external side.

418
00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:54.569
David: Oh, okay, yeah, we'll definitely note that.

419
00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.849
David: So yeah, in this version, as you can see.

420
00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:03.590
David: there's description. And there's no longer description in in this

421
00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.730
David: version.

422
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:07.900
VHACLEWahlJ: I mean

423
00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:13.910
VHACLEWahlJ: i i i guess it, it determined. If

424
00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:18.639
VHACLEWahlJ: it depends on like, if if there's a specific caption information you want to put on there

425
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.600
VHACLEWahlJ: from like I worked with

426
00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.629
VHACLEWahlJ: the the defense visual information.

427
00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.320
VHACLEWahlJ: distribution hub, and they

428
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:32.159
VHACLEWahlJ: I mean, if there's a story. They also had a caption with it

429
00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:38.860
VHACLEWahlJ: to maybe clarify what was in the photo that maybe a story wouldn't

430
00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.240
VHACLEWahlJ: include, or

431
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.329
VHACLEWahlJ: maybe to clarify a specific

432
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:57.149
VHACLEWahlJ: piece or person in that photo like this is Dr. Smith and a left, and Dr. Whoever in right? So maybe that that would

433
00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.317
VHACLEWahlJ: be a loss at that point. But

434
00:38:02.907 --> 00:38:05.209
VHACLEWahlJ: That's where I would. I would see maybe

435
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.780
VHACLEWahlJ: maybe negative on the lack of the description part.

436
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:14.080
VHACLEWahlJ: But, I I don't know how it's archived, like everything we archive there was.

437
00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:22.260
VHACLEWahlJ: you know, to be archived for future, for historical reference. But may maybe my understanding here, as far as on

438
00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.099
VHACLEWahlJ: just on our

439
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:27.450
VHACLEWahlJ: va.gov sites. I don't know how

440
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:32.800
VHACLEWahlJ: actually, I don't know of any archival unit that they use here on

441
00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:37.060
VHACLEWahlJ: on the the Va. Side. I've I've since I've been here. I've

442
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:40.540
VHACLEWahlJ: I have the content that I've created or used, but

443
00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:44.030
VHACLEWahlJ: where where it goes from there I I don't know. I don't know.

444
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.779
VHACLEWahlJ: So I'm missing that that aspect. So

445
00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.524
VHACLEWahlJ: if it doesn't matter.

446
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:59.289
VHACLEWahlJ: then May, maybe they don't need it. But that that would be one of the questions that would come up in my mind, because when we ever we did any story or for

447
00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:09.639
VHACLEWahlJ: anything in the military they, they always the stories came along with a image or video that had somewhat of a description or caption

448
00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.789
VHACLEWahlJ: with with that

449
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.099
VHACLEWahlJ: that imagery, that media.

450
00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.789
David: Got it. Got it?

451
00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:25.610
David: Okay? So kind of like, after clicking back and forth between this version and the current version.

452
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:30.260
David: what stands out to you about this new design.

453
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.918
VHACLEWahlJ: Well, this this one seems like it.

454
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.660
VHACLEWahlJ: more to the point

455
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:51.009
VHACLEWahlJ: to to okay. I mean, I just want to get this imagery dropped off and get it. Go get it attached, get get it to go with the event, or whatever I need it to go

456
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.739
VHACLEWahlJ: and then save and upload with this one.

457
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.499
VHACLEWahlJ: 1st it went into one

458
00:39:55.850 --> 00:40:03.430
VHACLEWahlJ: one dialogue area, where I selected a photo, and it had me name it. But then I had to go back and come back and rename it again.

459
00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:06.399
VHACLEWahlJ: And I think I think it's just picking the

460
00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.550
VHACLEWahlJ: the name of the the file itself

461
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.650
VHACLEWahlJ: description.

462
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:16.400
VHACLEWahlJ: This, this is the part I don't like is finding where it should go.

463
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.280
VHACLEWahlJ: and

464
00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.140
VHACLEWahlJ: octex.

465
00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:22.519
VHACLEWahlJ: and then

466
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:26.970
VHACLEWahlJ: see. I think people might get

467
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:34.970
VHACLEWahlJ: confused on this, too, who don't regularly work, because not not every PA specialist who who are on their public affairs. Officer

468
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:36.620
VHACLEWahlJ: understands all this

469
00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.060
VHACLEWahlJ: irregardless because

470
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:54.109
VHACLEWahlJ: our job is is kind of very wide ranging. We're we're not just doing that one thing. So they just want to get the story out. They want. They want to direct news agencies to come back and maybe use it. Even that we send that we send out press releases. But it's

471
00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:58.669
VHACLEWahlJ: it is kind of a standing location where people can come back and review our stories.

472
00:40:58.850 --> 00:40:59.910
VHACLEWahlJ: Got it.

473
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:06.300
David: Okay? Well, I have one last question for you.

474
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.000
David: and this is

475
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:14.960
David: a little bit less about specifically images, more about drupal Cms. As a whole.

476
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:23.940
David: Is there anything in the current drupal cms that you feel is missing, or could be updated to make your life easier?

477
00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:37.430
David: And this is for future projects that we may consider so if there's anything that you'd like to have improved or you're currently finding, frustrating. Now is the time to share those.

478
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:38.125
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay,

479
00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:41.420
VHACLEWahlJ: maybe

480
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:47.510
VHACLEWahlJ: the way we had content. Like, like, for example, we had a research site, that who had more of a rogue

481
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:53.769
VHACLEWahlJ: site that I mean, it was it was this like a Wix Wix site that they they built to help

482
00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.680
VHACLEWahlJ: people who wanted to

483
00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:01.520
VHACLEWahlJ: be part of their research team or had ideas, different things. But we needed to move that under

484
00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:04.020
VHACLEWahlJ: drupal

485
00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:05.100
VHACLEWahlJ: and

486
00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:13.130
VHACLEWahlJ: so it would. So it fall under the Va website. But some of their content, like you said wasn't in the library. So we.

487
00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.249
VHACLEWahlJ: because I was struggling with how to get

488
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.669
VHACLEWahlJ: content. That's not specifically Va directives

489
00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:25.359
VHACLEWahlJ: into a site. So if there was a way to mass.

490
00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:27.699
VHACLEWahlJ: bring over everything

491
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:34.410
VHACLEWahlJ: and attach it and organize that a little better like if you've used like the whizzy wig editor sometimes, or

492
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:40.700
VHACLEWahlJ: or like like Wix or Squarespace, or a website developer like that, where? Where it's

493
00:42:41.439 --> 00:42:45.660
VHACLEWahlJ: a little more fluid again, I I do see

494
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.671
VHACLEWahlJ: why they're keeping things restricted. But

495
00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.959
VHACLEWahlJ: I'm just struggling with

496
00:42:54.190 --> 00:43:16.229
VHACLEWahlJ: when creating the site itself. If I'm not just going back and editing some words, but creating a site from scratch I struggled with how like the visual, what is this looking like? Because it was very slow, like I could go back save the draft, save that, publish it, or whatever, and see what it will look like. But it's very monotonous, this, these steps are so slow. If if there was a way to

497
00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.040
VHACLEWahlJ: to expedite that

498
00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.250
David: Yeah.

499
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.890
David: anything. Else.

500
00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:26.860
David: I.

501
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:27.780
VHACLEWahlJ: I guess, just

502
00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.050
VHACLEWahlJ: in general.

503
00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:34.630
VHACLEWahlJ: Yeah, May. Maybe I'm talking about the the user interface as well, too, because it

504
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.510
VHACLEWahlJ: it.

505
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.640
VHACLEWahlJ: even though I've gone to the knowledge base and different things I've

506
00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:49.640
VHACLEWahlJ: It's it just seems like it's very restrictive on what you can do. But I I see both sides of that I just was.

507
00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.300
VHACLEWahlJ: There's a little cleaner way that we could add some things.

508
00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.500
VHACLEWahlJ: I I'm not. I'm not being specific enough for you, but.

509
00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:01.250
David: Well, what kind of things would you want to be able to add that you're currently not able to add.

510
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.570
David: if.

511
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:11.340
VHACLEWahlJ: Me see if I can.

512
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.389
VHACLEWahlJ: which is

513
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:22.590
VHACLEWahlJ: recent.

514
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:30.100
VHACLEWahlJ: This was one I made recently

515
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.959
VHACLEWahlJ: on my page. They they had quite a few.

516
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:58.059
VHACLEWahlJ: It just gets really in depth, in depth in here, like of layers and layers and layers of of their their content. Because it was. It's actually a pretty big site, but trying to fit it on onto the

517
00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:59.650
VHACLEWahlJ: under the site.

518
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.219
David: oh, I see, there's like 20, something

519
00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:08.028
David: content. This bit, oh, 100, something 100.

520
00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:14.769
VHACLEWahlJ: So yeah, this. This was a big, big job that, but it but it was. It was very.

521
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:23.079
VHACLEWahlJ: And some of them were like just adding, adding a file.

522
00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.690
VHACLEWahlJ: content.

523
00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:26.610
VHACLEWahlJ: mission.

524
00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:28.645
VHACLEWahlJ: and

525
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:31.270
VHACLEWahlJ: what ways to

526
00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.489
VHACLEWahlJ: to add. Add these

527
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.930
VHACLEWahlJ: these links to to different places. If if there was

528
00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:46.400
VHACLEWahlJ: like, I had to upload. What I'm saying is like I had to upload this Pdf file.

529
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.830
VHACLEWahlJ: and I ended up. Just

530
00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.289
VHACLEWahlJ: put in them

531
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:51.130
VHACLEWahlJ: all down here.

532
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.310
VHACLEWahlJ: and then

533
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.369
VHACLEWahlJ: then I couldn't

534
00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.270
VHACLEWahlJ: actually find where

535
00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:03.819
VHACLEWahlJ: where that that HTML would would be at, or if I another place I was building

536
00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.529
VHACLEWahlJ: a link of just sops. The standard operating procedures.

537
00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.599
VHACLEWahlJ: So it's it's already just

538
00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:20.879
VHACLEWahlJ: hard to see. Where was this?

539
00:46:21.170 --> 00:46:23.549
VHACLEWahlJ: Okay, yeah, like this one. So I had to go back

540
00:46:23.570 --> 00:46:25.399
VHACLEWahlJ: and then write like a quick

541
00:46:26.443 --> 00:46:27.669
VHACLEWahlJ: Html code

542
00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:35.239
VHACLEWahlJ: into each of these dialog boxes. So then it, when it would display that people could just go up to here and then click, and then, and

543
00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.889
VHACLEWahlJ: it had a controlled

544
00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.450
VHACLEWahlJ: location. It was cleaner. But

545
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.169
VHACLEWahlJ: for me to get this

546
00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:54.750
VHACLEWahlJ: get this link. I didn't know where to find it other than to upload the the Pdf. Or wherever this this link was to here, wait till it publish, then click on that link at the bottom and then copy copy

547
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.020
VHACLEWahlJ: up in here in the

548
00:46:57.460 --> 00:46:58.730
VHACLEWahlJ: the HTML.

549
00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:00.029
David: Got it.

550
00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.130
VHACLEWahlJ: Site. Then go back, create this code.
