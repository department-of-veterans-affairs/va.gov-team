1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.170
VHAWWWWONDRL: I'll try not to be too annoying.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:08.200
David: No, no, I appreciate you being on here, and just to confirm, I have your permission to record.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.100
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yes.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:16.609
David: Perfect. So yeah, I just started the recording fantastic. And now we're just gonna jump into this process.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.829
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay, so let me real quick here.

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.290
VHAWWWWONDRL: I'm going to go look for a file right here that I might be able to use.

7
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:44.329
VHAWWWWONDRL: okay, so I do have an image. Okay. So what I would do is, I'm you know, I'm going to go up here. I'm going to go to add content. And I'm going to do an event.

8
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.110
VHAWWWWONDRL: and I've got an image. I don't know if it's going to even fit or not. But I'm going to do an event and here we go. So I'm going to do.

9
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.830
David: Yeah, and you, okay, fantastic.

10
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.540
VHAWWWWONDRL: What?

11
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.839
David: You. You don't have to go like with the date and the time, and and those things.

12
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.280
VHAWWWWONDRL: Well, that's because I have an event to post.

13
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.640
David: Oh, you haven't! Oh, perfect!

14
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:21.179
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yes. So that's why I was thinking, I'll just do something right now. And so let's see, start time. It's gonna be 3 30 pm. And the end time is gonna be 3, 34, 30,

15
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.570
VHAWWWWONDRL: 5,

16
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.469
VHAWWWWONDRL: 30 pm. And the time zone is going to be pacific.

17
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.029
VHAWWWWONDRL: What? Here we go. Oh, Los Angeles, okay. So I gotta make sure I get it in the right Va.

18
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.149
David: Got it. Got it.

19
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.270
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay. So

20
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.499
VHAWWWWONDRL: then my event image, let me just go here.

21
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.229
VHAWWWWONDRL: And so I'm just. I don't know if this is going to fit or not fit, but it is ready to go.

22
00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:03.540
VHAWWWWONDRL: So I have my image. And so it's just going to be a flyer for Town hall event.

23
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.220
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay. And I gotta select

24
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.370
VHAWWWWONDRL: this right here.

25
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.310
David: Yeah. And as you're kind of going through this, what are you? What are you thinking like while you're going through these sections?

26
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.120
David: Well.

27
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.150
David: is it? Is it quick, easy? Could it be easier.

28
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:38.450
VHAWWWWONDRL: I. You know I don't really have anything. I mean it. It is. It's functional. So I don't have anything that I can really think of. I think the only thing I would say is like right here. I wish I could do a search

29
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:47.989
VHAWWWWONDRL: instead of having to scroll. If I could just type in Walla Walla or something, it would jump right down to me. That's 1 thing. It's like, I gotta scroll all the way through this list.

30
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.580
David: Yeah.

31
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.100
VHAWWWWONDRL: Get to my Va.

32
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.310
David: I know absolutely.

33
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.083
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yeah.

34
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:10.160
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay. So now I here, I don't know what to do. I don't know. Does it? Tell me somewhere here what I'm supposed to be doing with this image. It doesn't tell me what size it needs to be.

35
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:26.479
VHAWWWWONDRL: And this this is one of my frustrations is when I go into any of these areas to upload an image. I don't really know what's the expectation of that specific area. So that goes back to my statement of the fact that if we're going to be doing events

36
00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:43.450
VHAWWWWONDRL: you know, you want an image is the size. And then because if you want the whole image to show it needs to be this size, and whether it's an image with lots of text on it like this one, or if it's going to be something different. I would design my images in the other program to fit the specific purpose.

37
00:03:43.450 --> 00:04:06.640
VHAWWWWONDRL: So like in the old system, we would have on the on the main page. When you did a story or an event, it would tell you that your little snapshot image needed to be, you know, whatever 125 by by 1, 15, or whatever it is, and then I would create that image and have it ready to go. And then, when I got to the actual event or the story.

38
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:20.850
VHAWWWWONDRL: it would say that image needs to be 250 by 250, you know pixels or whatever, and then I would get that image created so that I could upload them, and they dropped in, and they looked perfect here. I don't know what to do.

39
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.080
David: Yeah. No.

40
00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.819
VHAWWWWONDRL: I have no idea. So usually I just leave it alone, and I just do save and insert.

41
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.659
David: So what's the difference between, save and insert and save and select? Why did you pick that one.

42
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:46.079
VHAWWWWONDRL: Save and insert means. It immediately jumps me back to this page, and I'm already here. If I do save and insert it uploads the image, and then it asks me, do I save and upload? Then it asks me, do I want to insert it? So I just skip a step.

43
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.579
David: Step. Is there any situation where you would not skip that step.

44
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:59.479
VHAWWWWONDRL: I. You know, I don't even know what that other one would be for, because it's just an extra step for me. Okay, so yeah.

45
00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:15.692
David: Okay and fantastic. I don't need you to fill out the rest of it. I was really just concerned on that image uploading section, or if you went through it, Amanda would be very excited to see, but with our little amounts of time I'd love to do our next section.

46
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.160
David: so I'm gonna go ahead and share with you an

47
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:39.390
David: updated version that we're working on right now. This is just the prototype. So things aren't gonna exactly work as you'd expect like, but it's for the most part kind of showing that experience. So let me go ahead and share that right now in chat

48
00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:40.659
David: year.

49
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.959
David: Oh, I gotta send it to you. Okay.

50
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.259
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, chat. Okay, let me go to chat here. Okay, do I click on this.

51
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.779
David: Yeah, feel free, and then it should open up the prototype.

52
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.065
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay.

53
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.839
David: Okay? And then on the left navigation there's proposed flow.

54
00:06:07.228 --> 00:06:10.291
David: If you go like, all the way to the left sidebar

55
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.800
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, right here. Okay. Click on, proposed Flow. Yes. Okay.

56
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.690
VHAWWWWONDRL: Alright.

57
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.719
David: And I'd like you to kind of so let me just

58
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.750
David: pull this bit up.

59
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.180
David: So imagine that you've already started to create a new event for veterans.

60
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.360
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay.

61
00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.260
David: The date.

62
00:06:30.881 --> 00:06:39.110
David: You've entered in the location for this. You could imagine you're instead of Walla Walla, it's Bronx. But basically.

63
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.630
VHAWWWWONDRL: Right.

64
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.330
David: And

65
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:49.750
David: What I'd like you to do now is now it's time to upload that image, so I'd like to for you to show me how you would go ahead and do that.

66
00:06:51.735 --> 00:06:54.290
VHAWWWWONDRL: So is this working right here? Okay.

67
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.820
David: Everything should be clickable. But before oh, actually, if you could.

68
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.520
VHAWWWWONDRL: Sorry.

69
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.980
David: Oh, real quick! No, no, don't get.

70
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.060
VHAWWWWONDRL: Told me to go. No, you.

71
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:15.739
David: I'm jumping right into it, and I love that what I would like you to do as you kind of going through it just before you click on anything. Explain to me what you're thinking, and just kind of give me like a little bit of a narrative as you go. Okay.

72
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:38.910
VHAWWWWONDRL: Alright, so obviously in the the top part I'm putting in all the pertinent information, you know. Selecting the Va. I get to the event image, and I realize that there's 2 buttons there. One is to upload an image, the other one is to select image that you may have already uploaded because there's times you could have uploaded something that you're gonna reuse. And so you're just gonna go to your image library and select it from there.

73
00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:50.229
VHAWWWWONDRL: That type of thing. So most of the time I have a specific image I'm going to be using. But you know, maybe I would have had a just a generic Town Hall

74
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:56.170
VHAWWWWONDRL: image that I use, and it's already been uploaded. So that's that's why I would do select from library.

75
00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:09.646
VHAWWWWONDRL: and maybe there's other, and I haven't seen this by not clicking on it. Maybe there are sample images that I can use. I don't know but I know that when you upload images you have the opportunity to

76
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.230
VHAWWWWONDRL: And I'm trying to remember if and maybe because I

77
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:31.200
VHAWWWWONDRL: I I did that went ahead and inserted it if you can actually tell it, whether you want to use it only for you, or let other people use an image. You know I don't care if people use my image, because if it's something that is universal, go ahead. That just makes it me feel like they like my work.

78
00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:36.740
David: Fantastic. Okay, so let's go ahead and go through that same process you've been doing.

79
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.620
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay. So I'll just take the same image, and I'll just move it over here before.

80
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.069
David: So one thing about this prototype. It can't.

81
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.520
David: The prototype

82
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:53.629
David: can't take drag and drop, but it should take, drag and drop if that makes sense like the way figma works. I can't make it so that.

83
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.490
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay. Now see, this is what I love right here recommended image size.

84
00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.530
David: Oh, okay.

85
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:10.060
VHAWWWWONDRL: So it tells me what my size is. So, therefore, if I have something in particular that I want to everything to fit, that's exactly what I was looking for, so I probably need to do this correct.

86
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.040
David: Yes, and.

87
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:11.930
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay.

88
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.003
David: This is just kind of like a simulation of how it might be.

89
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.229
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay? So then I will just so this is showing me.

90
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.560
VHAWWWWONDRL: okay, drag frame to reposition image cropping. So

91
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.259
VHAWWWWONDRL: how do I drag it? It's not working.

92
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.070
David: Yeah, that's just the limitation of the prototype.

93
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:39.529
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, okay. So let's say that I did it. Okay. So now I'm gonna go here. And then there's the file name. I do alternate text I select where it's gonna go.

94
00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.320
David: You're gonna have to. If you click there, it kind of fills it up for you automatically.

95
00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:50.279
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, there we go. Okay. So I only have one selection right?

96
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.639
VHAWWWWONDRL: And then I save and upload.

97
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:55.209
David: What do you think?

98
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.009
VHAWWWWONDRL: What do I? What do I think about it?

99
00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.999
David: Yeah, about those options. So just to save and upload.

100
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:10.999
VHAWWWWONDRL: I I think that's great. And again I'm I'm real excited. If it's going to give me a an opportunity to make my image match to the

101
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:15.729
VHAWWWWONDRL: per the the proportions that it needs to be.

102
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:24.999
David: Okay. So you went through that real fast, it seemed to me, which is great. So yeah, what? What

103
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.906
David: stood out to you about the new design compared to the

104
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.090
David: one that you're currently using.

105
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:54.859
VHAWWWWONDRL: Well, I mean it. It's a slight variation. Again it it seems similar. But like I said, if it's going to give me recommended image sizes. I'm going to record all that stuff down on a little piece of paper over here so that I'm able to go. Oh, I'm going to do an event, and you know that image needs to be the perspective. I think it said 7 by 2, or something.

106
00:10:54.930 --> 00:11:02.269
VHAWWWWONDRL: but it also gave me the actual dimensions, so I would would love to be able to have that option.

107
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:03.920
David: You'd love that option. Yeah.

108
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:04.870
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, yeah.

109
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.892
David: Tell me a little bit more about so there's a couple of things that

110
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:18.109
David: it! It was doing that. Maybe you noticed 1st of all, when you put the image in it automatically cropped the image.

111
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.760
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yes, right?

112
00:11:20.372 --> 00:11:29.059
David: Compared that to kind of selecting the different options of the one to one, the 7 to by 2, the free form, the square.

113
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:46.850
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yeah, but I always got confused in the old. In the current version. I'm confused by that, because I don't know which one I'm supposed to select, because there's times I've gone through, and I upload something, and my image is like, Oh, God! That's not even what I wanted to show. So I have to back out. And you know, redo the image

114
00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.860
VHAWWWWONDRL: and and move it so that you know I I have what's pertinent. That shows so

115
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:59.549
VHAWWWWONDRL: so there it automatically shows you the cropping. So you know, right away, if you need to make any adjustments.

116
00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:10.159
VHAWWWWONDRL: and whether you can just adjust it by moving it up and down like it, you know, said I was supposed to be able to do, or if I needed to back out and do something to the image off to the side.

117
00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.040
David: Okay? So you're a fan of that, that automatic popping.

118
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.940
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yes, because then, you know, you know what it's gonna look like, because in the current flow you don't know what it looks like.

119
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:26.329
David: Yeah, okay. Another thing I wanted to bring up was, and I'm not sure if you noticed this

120
00:12:26.777 --> 00:12:33.299
David: description. So the current version you have to fill out a description in this version.

121
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.660
David: Description is no longer there.

122
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.429
VHAWWWWONDRL: When you say description. What's the description describing the image.

123
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:45.959
David: Describing the image not help, but description. And I'm wondering how you feel about that adjustment.

124
00:12:46.270 --> 00:13:13.420
VHAWWWWONDRL: Well, I I don't know what the description was used for, unless it is was meant that if you were sharing your image with other people that they would have more information about it. But I don't know. You can look at an image. Go. Oh, okay, there's a cool image, and you can tell by looking at the picture what it is. You may not even need the description. I don't know what it was used for before, you know. I just know that if you have to have alt text, you got to, you know. Put what you think is going to be appropriate for alt text.

125
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.490
David: okay.

126
00:13:17.655 --> 00:13:18.510
David: fantastic.

127
00:13:19.332 --> 00:13:22.499
David: Last thing, I'd like to kind of

128
00:13:23.368 --> 00:13:30.700
David: talk about is just if you if you go ahead and click X again. Right next to that photo that you uploaded

129
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:32.940
David: in the app.

130
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:35.300
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, right? Here. Okay.

131
00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.960
David: Yeah, we're kind of like undoing it.

132
00:13:38.089 --> 00:13:38.810
David: So

133
00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:48.280
David: one other like major change in this version is really splitting up, uploading the image and selecting the image from the media library.

134
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.110
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay.

135
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.640
David: And I'm curious what you think about

136
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.350
David: that update.

137
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.180
VHAWWWWONDRL: Well,

138
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:23.840
VHAWWWWONDRL: I I'm trying to figure out how it is different from the current one, because, like you saw me, I just skip to upload and insert, which I think is the same as uploading the image. And then you have select from media library. So before, when I 1st started using drupal. I go okay, select and up, you know, select, and whatever that was there and then I go. Oh, now I have to insert it. I was ready to insert it in the 1st place.

139
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:30.339
VHAWWWWONDRL: So here you get to choose whether or not you're just going to automatically upload the image, and, you know, be able to adjust it.

140
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:41.280
VHAWWWWONDRL: But like I said again, if if you already had an image that you'd already uploaded, and you know, let's say you did a story. Now you're doing an event, and you you want to go and use that same image.

141
00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:46.500
VHAWWWWONDRL: and you know what's going to be in your library already. So that's how I'm looking at it.

142
00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:59.869
David: Okay, for like, yeah, if it's already an event you want to bring to the story. Got it? Got it? Yeah. And if you do want to remember kind of what it currently is. If you go to the left navigation where you swapped from current to proposed.

143
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.159
David: you'll be able to see that as well.

144
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.580
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yeah, I was just yeah. Okay, so current flow.

145
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.179
VHAWWWWONDRL: So when you add media.

146
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.310
VHAWWWWONDRL: okay, file name.

147
00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:23.790
VHAWWWWONDRL: okay? So so here it's already. It's showing you this is the current one. So there are images that are already there.

148
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:29.479
VHAWWWWONDRL: And then. You can select one of those images, or you can select a file.

149
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.609
VHAWWWWONDRL: and let's say we're going to select this one.

150
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.110
VHAWWWWONDRL: And see here.

151
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.939
David: Oh, yeah, it'll have you. Yeah, right?

152
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:49.620
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay. So there we go and then do this right here and the alt text. So see here, I really have no idea what size. It needs to be.

153
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:55.989
VHAWWWWONDRL: I really don't. So I have all these different ways to crop it. But is it going to do me any good right.

154
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.130
David: Right? Because.

155
00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:06.370
VHAWWWWONDRL: I don't know what it's going to look like in the end. That's why. I'm thinking, with the the proposed flow. You are going to see exactly what it looks like.

156
00:16:07.054 --> 00:16:21.655
VHAWWWWONDRL: When you upload the image. And you know, like I said before, with this proposed one. And you you do an upload. It's telling you right now, recommended image size 1750 by 500. Man. I love that.

157
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.329
VHAWWWWONDRL: Now I can be ready. Yeah.

158
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:31.649
David: Yeah. And then how do you feel about where that image is? So once you upload the image, it just

159
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:32.970
David: at the top.

160
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:37.600
David: and you, you kind of have it. So yeah, if you can, you can go through it just to kind of.

161
00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:45.729
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yeah, and that's I think that's great. And then, you know, you have all your stuff there, and you save and upload.

162
00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.100
VHAWWWWONDRL: Did it work?

163
00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:50.539
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, oh, okay.

164
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:54.701
VHAWWWWONDRL: I've got to finish all that now. I can save and upload and

165
00:16:55.750 --> 00:17:00.910
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, okay, so there! That time it didn't give me the option to adjust it.

166
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.700
VHAWWWWONDRL: Why did that happen.

167
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.859
David: Oh, that might have just been the prototype, but it it should. It.

168
00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:08.269
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay.

169
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.750
David: Have, the.

170
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.409
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yeah, right? No, I I'm i i like how this looks. I.

171
00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.560
David: Oh! Fantastic!

172
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:15.429
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yeah.

173
00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.049
David: Good. That's so good to hear.

174
00:17:17.452 --> 00:17:22.769
David: Just to be more mind. Mindful of your time. Just a couple last questions wrapping up.

175
00:17:24.179 --> 00:17:26.889
David: So yeah, I would say.

176
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:28.839
David: to start.

177
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:30.889
David: what

178
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:34.329
David: of the 2 versions you've seen?

179
00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:41.979
David: What? Which one are you more inclined to use or say that like makes your workflow a little bit more efficient.

180
00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:53.479
VHAWWWWONDRL: Well again. I've already said it more than once. I think I like this new workflow just because I have an opportunity to be able to see what the image looked like before I

181
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.589
VHAWWWWONDRL: finalize my

182
00:17:55.740 --> 00:18:07.229
VHAWWWWONDRL: my event, my project, you know, whatever it is that I'm doing, and like I said, I love the fact that it's giving me the proposed dimensions, so that if I need to back out and do something I can do that.

183
00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:08.260
David: Okay.

184
00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.070
VHAWWWWONDRL: I'm super happy with that.

185
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.440
David: You're super happy with that.

186
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:30.200
VHAWWWWONDRL: And and I wonder if you're going to hear that from other people? I don't know. I just am curious, because we've talked about it on our drupal, open our office hours, and I just said, Why can't you tell us the size of the picture, you know, and I don't know what it is, but that's what I've done for so many years. I want to know, so I can prepare my image.

187
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:33.920
David: Yeah. Have you heard from? You've have you heard this kind of similar

188
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.100
David: feeling from other folks?

189
00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:41.409
VHAWWWWONDRL: I I think I have you know I've mentioned it in the past, and you know they just

190
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:58.009
VHAWWWWONDRL: I mean they couldn't do anything, because you know the current drupal is the way that it is. But I I would be interested. Not that you need to report back to me. But I wonder if you will hear a little bit more of this if people notice that it gives you proposed dimensions and pixels.

191
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.730
David: So that proposed them in the pixel, that is.

192
00:19:02.170 --> 00:19:31.980
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yeah, I love that. And then the fact that you can actually see it cropped before you before you click and finalize it. So that if, like, you said, if you need to adjust it because you want certain things and see, I noticed, just like on Facebook, if you're uploading things on Facebook for an image or something like that. And and you have that that banner that you know for the event thing, that banner sometimes, if your picture is a little bit too big. You want to move it so you can. So it it shows the pertinent information

193
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:45.469
VHAWWWWONDRL: forth. But yeah, because once they open up an event, they can click on it and see the full image. So again you have an opportunity to adjust it so it can say, you know town hall, or you know whatever. And then people will know exactly what it is. But yeah, I think it's great.

194
00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:52.430
David: Oh, that's so great to hear. So yeah, it's 6, or for me, it's 6 o'clock. It's I'm I'm not sure exactly.

195
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:53.847
VHAWWWWONDRL: Wow! 6 o'clock.

196
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.709
David: We're on the 3.rd We're on the hour. Is this the do? Do you still have time, or do you?

197
00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:00.990
David: I want to just be my.

198
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:06.019
VHAWWWWONDRL: A couple of extra minutes. I've just got to get to the store and back by 4 o'clock.

199
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.509
David: To apply.

200
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:08.439
VHAWWWWONDRL: Some shoes for a veteran.

201
00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:16.016
David: Got it. Got it. Okay? Yeah, no, that's very important. I don't want to take too much more of your time.

202
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:27.759
David: I I think that what I'll do is I'll open this up to my observers if they have any questions. And after that I think we can wrap up.

203
00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:29.720
VHAWWWWONDRL: Okay.

204
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:42.239
Amanda: I love. Yeah, I would love to know if there's anything you want to share with us about anything using drupal at all, that we we didn't talk about today that you want to share with us.

205
00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.480
VHAWWWWONDRL: Well.

206
00:20:44.388 --> 00:20:55.840
VHAWWWWONDRL: drupal is very templated, and I think that's great in some cases. But in other cases it can be very restricting. But I understand

207
00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.310
VHAWWWWONDRL: why we need to have something to look similar across the way, and to have things.

208
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:11.000
VHAWWWWONDRL: you know, be consistent. And that type of stuff. One of the other things relating to images. They're

209
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:21.370
VHAWWWWONDRL: Sometimes it's really hard to add images. I'm trying to think of an example. But like I said, because these these templates are so

210
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:48.785
VHAWWWWONDRL: restrictive. I say it that way that sometimes I just have to find workarounds. You know that type of stuff, and you know, I'm a computer nerd. So I play around and stuff like that. But I I do appreciate the fact that you know, I just open up templated pages, and then I'm able to drop stuff in there. And so that's pretty cool. And there's a pretty darn good selection of of different types of templates for me to be able to accomplish what I'm doing.

211
00:21:49.090 --> 00:22:12.199
VHAWWWWONDRL: I know it's not like real web design. But again, I I think it's important that all of our Va pages look alike, and you go to the same location on every Va website, and you'll be able to find this information and not in the older system. People would put things in different places, and you would go to their web page and go, okay, where is this? But on our

212
00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.249
VHAWWWWONDRL: sites, you know it's it is

213
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:23.192
VHAWWWWONDRL: every Va. If you're looking for a specific topic or something, this is where it's going to be. And so I like that.

214
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.060
VHAWWWWONDRL: Sometimes I like a little bit more free flow. But

215
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.225
VHAWWWWONDRL: I I know that I've had issues with images in the past.

216
00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:34.099
VHAWWWWONDRL: I'm just trying to think what else. But

217
00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.062
VHAWWWWONDRL: but in the end, you know.

218
00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.370
VHAWWWWONDRL: I guess one of the other things is that

219
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:41.719
VHAWWWWONDRL: the

220
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:59.199
VHAWWWWONDRL: the different types of pages. You've got your service, page. You've got your what is it? I'm trying to remember what it's called here. I need to get over here to my drupal page so that I can see. Oh, where'd I put drupal? Where was it?

221
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.869
VHAWWWWONDRL: Which one was I working in?

222
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.450
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, maybe I closed it. I don't know

223
00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:16.410
VHAWWWWONDRL: Let me let me just open it back up again. I guess I've got my little saved link here. Nope, gosh! Darn it.

224
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.469
VHAWWWWONDRL: I'm clicking around too fast.

225
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:24.080
VHAWWWWONDRL: Oh, I'm having that same problem again, getting logged in.

226
00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.520
VHAWWWWONDRL: How no fun is that

227
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:35.532
VHAWWWWONDRL: I must have closed my page. Okay, I've been having some login issues, and I've been working with the drupal help desk. But you know, when you have

228
00:23:36.580 --> 00:24:02.390
VHAWWWWONDRL: you have a facility page, and then you have a there's like several different pages. And sometimes when I'm going and trying to edit a page, I don't know exactly which one to select, and I have to look at the types of pages it is. And is it a service level or facility level as opposed to? I don't know what the other one is. And sometimes I'm bouncing around because I'm trying to find a specific

229
00:24:02.761 --> 00:24:05.469
VHAWWWWONDRL: page and stuff like that. Does that make sense.

230
00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:16.599
Amanda: Yeah, I think I know what you're getting at like. I don't know if it says it. I don't know if it reads this way to you. But we call them like nodes. So sometimes, okay, I think that's what you're talking about, like.

231
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.100
VHAWWWWONDRL: Right.

232
00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.969
Amanda: Hard to find which

233
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:29.440
Amanda: section or node that you need to edit rather than just picking like I want to edit content on this particular page you actually have to hunt down.

234
00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:54.440
VHAWWWWONDRL: Yeah, and I actually have to open up the website. And I have to look and see where it is. Because I I will look at the URL, and it'll tell me exactly where to go. Look for it, you know. Stuff like that. I like the search feature when I'm looking for something in particular, like profiles. I can type profiles and boom. I can bring up all my profiles if I need to update a profile page, you know, for an employee or something like that. But what I was talking about is, you know, you create

235
00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:09.430
VHAWWWWONDRL: create a page. And and maybe this, you know, like for radiology. I gotta. I gotta have a radiology and I gotta select a certain level. And then I gotta go to the system and facility. That's what is. You have a system page, and you have a a

236
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:34.389
VHAWWWWONDRL: facility page, and I have to remember one is big and one is small because I gotta do the big 1 first, st and you know, bring radiology in to my my list of services, and then I go in, and then I then I select the page to add it, and you know you have to kind of understand that flow, and I've helped a few people trying to like. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to get this service on my page.

237
00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:52.659
VHAWWWWONDRL: and I'm able to say, Okay, break it down. This is how you do it. You've got to get your system page in there, 1st on your major list, and then you go in and you go in and you select the service and that type of thing, and and it's it is what it is. You just have to learn the quirks and the nuances, and then you can bounce around and do just about anything

238
00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.440
VHAWWWWONDRL: that make sense.

243
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.089
Megan Commons: Tim. Tim had to drop off. Yeah.

244
