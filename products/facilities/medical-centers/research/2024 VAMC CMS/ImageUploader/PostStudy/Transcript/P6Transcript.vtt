26
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.830
Anna Mills: several times a week. I've several times today I've been on it.

Anna Mills: So a lot of the

29
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.470

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.410
Anna Mills: Yeah.

39
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:56.789
David: Fantastic. And I'm very curious about those event pages. For the images. Are you selecting the images yourself.

40
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.729
David: or do you receive them?

41
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:15.460
Anna Mills: Well, the only that's like that's 1 of the things is when you go to like to create an event. The only image that you can put on. There is the event. You know. Have a like an event banner kind of thing up at top.

42
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.260
David: Yeah.

43
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.017
Anna Mills: That's the only

44
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.290
Anna Mills: image you could put on. There.

45
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.180
Anna Mills: So.

46
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.830
Anna Mills: Yes.

47
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.359
Anna Mills: I do. I'm I'm the one that picks those things out.

48
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.600
Anna Mills: I'm also the one that makes them.

49
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.449
David: You may, what and when you say, make them you, what are you referring to?

50
00:03:37.306 --> 00:03:38.360
Anna Mills: In adobe.

51
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.262
David: You make them. Okay, you're you're you're making them in adobe

52
00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.827
Anna Mills: Kind of have like a template for

53
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.230
Anna Mills: for these, you know, for the events, and then just changing like titles. And you know, stuff like that.

54
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.690
Anna Mills: This is all it is is

55
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:07.629
Anna Mills: all the banner is is you know what the event is like we're having next week. We're having, you know, it's pow mia recognition day.

56
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.170
Anna Mills: So we're having events.

57
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.440
Anna Mills: So that one just that's all it says is, you know.

58
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.820
Anna Mills: national pow mia recognition day with like our logo, and seal and stuff.

59
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.269
David: Got it. There's.

60
00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.879
Anna Mills: Not.

61
00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.659
Anna Mills: That's pretty much all you can do in that. It's a 7 7 by 2 ratio.

62
00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:29.089
Anna Mills: so there's not much room to do much else with it.

63
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.210
David: Ideally. What would you like to be doing with it?

64
00:04:34.592 --> 00:04:39.017
Anna Mills: So for the the events. It would be nice if

65
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.510
Anna Mills: if

66
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:54.639
Anna Mills: I think the header is fine like having that header on there, you know it's fine, because, you know, when they go on the page. And it's you know it's big. Everyone sees it, you know that part's great.

67
00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:04.360
Anna Mills: but having an option, for just like when you're building like a page. And you have the different options for like a photo, or, you know.

68
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.890
Anna Mills: like links, or whatever. It would be nice to to be able to have those things

69
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.259
Anna Mills: have those things in there sometimes are, especially for more information.

70
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:28.660
Anna Mills: sometimes for like for our, we have a homeless veteran program happening next Thursday.

71
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.660
Anna Mills: and

72
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.700
Anna Mills: we recently they were on the news with it. Well, I want to put that in. You know what I mean. Like, I want to put that picture in there

73
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.500
Anna Mills: of that like, add to it.

74
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:54.169
Anna Mills: and, you know, put that link to the story in there. So people can get more information and understand further, like what it is and who they should share it with, and all those types of things, but the events are really

75
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:55.950
Anna Mills: they're not

76
00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.434
Anna Mills: There's not a lot to it. When you know when you go on that page.

77
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.179
Anna Mills: it would be nice.

78
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.940
David: Yeah. So for that one photo that you are uploading.

79
00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:20.013
David: Are you? You said you're just reusing. You have a template in like adobe

80
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.960
David: illustrator, Photoshop.

81
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:35.690
Anna Mills: I mean I I did it. I did part. I mean I did it. It's like illustrator, but I also sometimes go to adobe express. If I'm in a hurry.

82
00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.240
David: Yeah.

83
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.306
Anna Mills: No, not very fancy.

84
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.780
Anna Mills: no.

85
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.189
David: yeah. And you're you're making the banner yourself.

86
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:53.159
David: The size requirements are those things that are already like inputted in your adobe files? Or are you

87
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.740
David: cropping it

88
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:56.840
David: within the

89
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.310
David: drupal cms.

90
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.289
Anna Mills: So. No, no, I'm not cropping it

91
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.540
Anna Mills: at all.

92
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.510
Anna Mills: The when you put it in drupal. It says it will automatically crop to a 7

93
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:21.599
Anna Mills: 7, you know, 7, 2 ratio. So when I make it, I've I've that's why I have that template to work off of, and it's a 7, you know, 7 to 2 ratio set up already. That's why I just

94
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:29.519
Anna Mills: sometimes I'll duplicate it, and you know, so I have the original file. But duplicate it, and then

95
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.000
Anna Mills: just change, you know. Change the duplicated file

96
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.790
Anna Mills: to whatever it is needed.

97
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.439
David: Okay. And do you ever find yourself using the media library to

98
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.019
David: for for anything.

99
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:54.039
Anna Mills: Ever, and I always I know it asks every time you put a photo in there, you know. Can something be reused?

100
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.060
Anna Mills: And I say no

101
00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:05.489
Anna Mills: one. All of all the files like this that like say these, you know the banners for the events

102
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:12.500
Anna Mills: they are. I mean it has our our logo on it. So it's not just like the Va logo. It's

103
00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.000
Anna Mills: Lexiton, va healthcare system. So if someone else used it.

104
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.549
David: It wouldn't make any sense.

105
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:27.679
Anna Mills: No, not at all. And then, you know, there's very few places where

106
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.440
Anna Mills: I can share those photos now.

107
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.613
Anna Mills: the like the Va. Has, you know, a certain amount of

108
00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:43.969
Anna Mills: You know, there's there's rules about the the photos that we take of people, you know, staff included

109
00:08:44.535 --> 00:08:46.909
Anna Mills: and how they can be used.

110
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.729
Anna Mills: So if someone signs a consent form

111
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.060
Anna Mills: for us to use

112
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:59.260
Anna Mills: for a specific story or a, you know, specific page on our Internet.

113
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.079
Anna Mills: I can't give other people permission to use it because they didn't.

114
00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.580
Anna Mills: Does, you know, does does that make sense.

115
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:11.910
David: Yeah, no, that makes complete sense, because it's not for that specific purpose. It's it's.

116
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:12.230
Anna Mills: Yeah.

117
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:17.050
David: 4 year, 4 year story, 4 year detail page, whatever. But it's not.

118
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.070
Anna Mills: Yeah, so it's.

119
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.560
David: And exist.

120
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:30.282
Anna Mills: Might be an excellent photo, but if if someone wanted to use it for something that's not for that, you know not that purpose, not, you know, whatever. Then?

121
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.440
Anna Mills: you know we would be breaking what we had consent for so.

122
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.430
David: Got it.

123
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:43.560
Anna Mills: Yeah. So sometimes I I just I. So I don't put my photos in there. And it's just

124
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.008
Anna Mills: when you go in there. And you look at the photos?

125
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:52.749
Anna Mills: I mean, I haven't really found anything that I thought you know I'd want to use. I guess.

126
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.370
David: Got it, got it.

127
00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.909
David: So going moving, moving along here to our 1st task.

128
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.479
David: I was hoping you could open your Cms log in, and we could kind of walk through

129
00:10:08.353 --> 00:10:09.400
David: an event

130
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.140
David: creation.

131
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.929
David: on your screen share.

132
00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:16.319
Anna Mills: You said an event.

133
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:23.580
David: An event. Yeah, okay, so we'll go. We'll we'll make. I kind of want to watch your workflow while creating an event.

134
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:27.936
David: and we can talk about it. As we complete the task.

135
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.800
Anna Mills: Okay.

136
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.690
Anna Mills: share. My screen

137
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.460
Anna Mills: test.

138
00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.670
David: Good. Okay, yeah. We're already in an event.

139
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:51.515
Anna Mills: Yeah, to be fair was our. I was in I was already in here when you guys when we started this.

140
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.959
David: Perfect. So what I

141
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.930
David: we don't have to do all the top

142
00:10:58.258 --> 00:11:02.440
David: name and date and time. If we just scroll down just a bit.

143
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:06.350
David: Just kind of walk me through how you upload an image

144
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.320
David: where the image is coming from that process.

145
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.640
Anna Mills: Okay, so you know.

146
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.850
Anna Mills: add Media, I

147
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:23.020
Anna Mills: here, you know how Lexington does it. We have. We use the leaf

148
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:24.069
Anna Mills: and

149
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:34.619
Anna Mills: It's just a system where people ask us to advertise or print, or whatever all the different public affairs things. So they'll have an event.

150
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.319
Anna Mills: you know that they have coming up.

151
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.830
Anna Mills: and

152
00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:42.729
Anna Mills: one of them was

153
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.910
Anna Mills: the most recent request that I got was this, pow.

154
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.510
Anna Mills: you know, MIA event?

155
00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.790
David: And you're you. You receive it

156
00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:59.770
David: like a word document like you just showed me. That's how you're receiving it from leave.

157
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:06.990
Anna Mills: Sometimes. Yes, they don't. They don't design the things, and even if they did.

158
00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:08.146
Anna Mills: they don't.

159
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.310
Anna Mills: you know, like

160
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.690
Anna Mills: the

161
00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:20.350
Anna Mills: graphics and stuff. I don't know where they get some of these things, so I

162
00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.279
Anna Mills: I don't use them because

163
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:33.919
Anna Mills: I don't know for a while if that makes sense but so what I'll do if you know, I was actually in adobe earlier.

164
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:35.480
Anna Mills: And

165
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.959
Anna Mills: I went through and created, you know, the Facebook post.

166
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.669
Anna Mills: you know Facebook, Instagram post size.

167
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.210
Anna Mills: the Facebook event size.

168
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:52.190
Anna Mills: which is different than our size. So I'm creating, like all these different size graphics of the same exact thing.

169
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:54.500
Anna Mills: And then

170
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.840
Anna Mills: I you know I have.

171
00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:03.630
Anna Mills: I have a folder for like marketing type stuff, and

172
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.460
Anna Mills: I just I just drop it in here.

173
00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.289
Anna Mills: that's all I do.

174
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.570
Anna Mills: So

175
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:24.660
Anna Mills: And I name it. You know this one that I'm going to put it on. There is, you know it? Says Pow MIA day drupal event, you know. So I know it's for

176
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.080
Anna Mills: like this.

177
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.930
David: Okay.

178
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.570
Anna Mills: And yeah.

179
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:42.029
Anna Mills: and usually I just I mean, I just write out what it is. You know, pow.

180
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.110
Anna Mills: MIA, you know event banner.

181
00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.680
Anna Mills: and then I find me

182
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:06.240
Anna Mills: and then it's once again. It's just the pow you know, mia

183
00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.170
Anna Mills: mission

184
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.950
Anna Mills: events.

185
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.370
Anna Mills: huge banner.

186
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:24.309
Anna Mills: And then, even though I know it automatically corrects to 7, too. I always you know what I mean. Just so I can see it to make sure it looks good.

187
00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:25.720
Anna Mills: I like that part.

188
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.509
Anna Mills: and then I unclick it.

189
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.790
Anna Mills: and then I always just save and insert.

190
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.539
David: What's the difference between select and insert?

191
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:41.530
Anna Mills: So when I've done save and select sometimes it doesn't show up.

192
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.840
David: Hmm.

193
00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.399
Anna Mills: It's like I have to go back and find it.

194
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.857
Anna Mills: but when I do save it and inserts it's there, so

195
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:00.800
Anna Mills: I don't know. But that was my, that's been my experience.

196
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:07.289
David: Your experience. Okay? And before we click, save and insert just a couple of other questions as so, going

197
00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.800
David: above a little bit, what might happen if

198
00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.920
David: you did? 3 by 2,

199
00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.150
David: as your crop size.

200
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:23.139
Anna Mills: It doesn't. It doesn't change the size of my image. It just shows what would

201
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.820
Anna Mills: you know what I mean? I can choose what part to show it.

202
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:31.789
David: And and if you were to

203
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.409
David: have like click this and save an insert.

204
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:37.250
David: what do you think would happen.

205
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.489
Anna Mills: This it. This is, that's all that would show up right there.

206
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.600
Anna Mills: I think.

207
00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:49.438
Anna Mills: but it does say that.

208
00:15:50.340 --> 00:16:01.019
Anna Mills: you know it automatically crops to 7 2. So I don't know. It could just make this, you know, 7 2 like make that part big, but I'm not sure.

209
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.780
David: Got it.

210
00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.650
David: and then scrolling up a little bit more.

211
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:09.270
David: What's the difference?

212
00:16:09.908 --> 00:16:13.190
David: Between the description and the alternative text?

213
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:21.499
Anna Mills: So the alternative text is the 508 compliance part. So screen readers are going to.

214
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:26.313
Anna Mills: This is what the screen readers will pick up for people who have visual

215
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:31.409
Anna Mills: You know, disabilities. The description

216
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.030
Anna Mills: I have no idea. I mean I don't. You don't see it. I don't see it on the page.

217
00:16:37.588 --> 00:16:44.459
Anna Mills: But this is not. This is not what shows up for the screen readers. So

218
00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:51.289
Anna Mills: I make sure that the alternative text, and in this part the description is not required.

219
00:16:51.828 --> 00:16:56.359
Anna Mills: But this one, I make sure, is very clear about what it is.

220
00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.189
David: Since it's not required. I'm curious why you fill it out.

221
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:02.080
David: Why do you build this up?

222
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:03.520
Anna Mills: I don't.

223
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:13.000
Anna Mills: I don't know, because it's a blank box, and I like to put stuff there, and I mean have it. I guess.

224
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.220
David: Got it. Got it?

225
00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.020
David: Okay?

226
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.050
David: Well,

227
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.951
David: yeah, go ahead, and we can close this out.

228
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:30.210
David: I have another task for us now where I'm going to go ahead and share with you a link.

229
00:17:32.007 --> 00:17:34.869
David: It's gonna be a prototype link.

230
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:41.739
David: So that means everything will work, you know, exactly as expected, but for the most part it should

231
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:48.520
David: mimic what you're used to. So I'm going ahead and sending it in the Zoom chat.

232
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.090
Anna Mills: Okay.

233
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.240
David: Working

234
00:18:24.167 --> 00:18:31.110
David: and then let's go to the in the left nav sidebar. There's proposed Flow. Let's click on that one.

235
00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:32.270
Anna Mills: Okay.

236
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.240
David: Okay?

237
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:35.700
David: So

238
00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:40.880
David: now, I'm showing you a potential redesign of the image upload system.

239
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:45.059
David: Imagine you have started to create a new event for veterans.

240
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.470
David: You've entered in your date and time.

241
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:50.509
David: and now it's time to upload. An image.

242
00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:52.460
David: Please show me how you would do that.

243
00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:04.912
David: And yeah, unfortunately, you're not able to drag and drop in this. But

244
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.909
David: you were you. You were moving your mouse to do that. Is that all right?

245
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:09.840
Anna Mills: Yeah.

246
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.190
David: Okay, perfect.

247
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.901
Anna Mills: I'm using what's available there because

248
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.750
David: Yeah, that's perfect. That's perfect.

249
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.870
Anna Mills: But yeah, I would. I would normally probably drag and and drop it.

250
00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:25.249
Anna Mills: It's just easier. It's just easier.

251
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:26.790
David: Yeah, perfect. Yeah.

252
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:31.218
Anna Mills: When you have, you know, when you have all the you know so much going on.

253
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:39.710
David: And ideally, this would be able to like, move up and down like as as expected.

254
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.410
Anna Mills: All right.

255
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.970
David: Yeah. Well, tell me what you're thinking as you click that.

256
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.300
Anna Mills: Yeah, I mean, it's good.

257
00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.470
Anna Mills: If

258
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.896
Anna Mills: the alternative text, yeah, I mean, that's good. And then

259
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.800
David: Yeah. And again, this prototype

260
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:14.439
David: is, yeah, like simulating you, typing it in.

261
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.580
Anna Mills: Yeah.

262
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.080
Anna Mills: okay.

263
00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.640
David: But tell me about that experience.

264
00:20:33.791 --> 00:20:39.088
Anna Mills: I like it a lot better. It it I do. It looks a lot cleaner and

265
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:43.580
Anna Mills: I guess.

266
00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:49.090
Anna Mills: Well, I guess one thing. I I don't think I

267
00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.040
Anna Mills: I saw.

268
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.140
Anna Mills: or I remember. Did it ask if you wanted to save it in the.

269
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:05.749
Anna Mills: you know, like it normally does like save the, you know, for everyone else to use. Does it add.

270
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:08.639
David: It did. It did not ask that.

271
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:16.150
Anna Mills: Okay, so we're not going to do that. Any like is that going to be taken away? Or does it automatically save for other people's use?

272
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.999
David: What do you think should happen.

273
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.439
Anna Mills: no, I don't think that we should. I don't think

274
00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:30.670
Anna Mills: I don't think it makes sense.

275
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:44.910
Anna Mills: for I mean some programs, sure national programs, you know, if it's like adobe stock footage, or something like that. But once again, if I have a picture of an even an employee.

276
00:21:45.180 --> 00:22:05.800
Anna Mills: but especially like a veteran or their family members. And I've said, I'm going to use these photos for this story or this thing on our, you know, intranet social media blah blah. But then they find themselves, you know, on like California's Internet page.

277
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.230
Anna Mills: But that wasn't on their consent.

278
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:09.440
Anna Mills: I don't.

279
00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.020
Anna Mills: I wouldn't like it if it was me.

280
00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:19.979
David: Sure. And but and I'm curious. What about reusage

281
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:21.690
David: for you

282
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.190
David: like, for example, if there's a monthly

283
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.090
David: coffee chat

284
00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:33.120
David: and you have a banner that always is for every event. Monthly coffee, chat.

285
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.269
Anna Mills: Well, I mean, I have like for our files that we that you know that we have here.

286
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:50.419
Anna Mills: you know, have them.

287
00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:59.850
Anna Mills: I guess, broken down and saved. And you know what I mean in a way where it's easier for me. It's easy for me to to just grab it. I know where it's at.

288
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.720
Anna Mills: Everybody in our department knows where it's at.

289
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.360
Anna Mills: There's no mistaking it.

290
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:10.719
David: So you're not looking to the media library for that. You have your own internal system for

291
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:13.920
David: categorizing your images, keeping them, having them ready.

292
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.520
Anna Mills: Yeah, I don't ever have it on the the media library.

293
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.860
David: Okay?

294
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.710
David: so what stands out to you about this new design?

295
00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:30.330
Anna Mills: It's it's less of the the.

296
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:38.889
Anna Mills: The way it was before was a little bit more clunky. I guess I can just upload an image. I don't have to worry, you know. Can go either. Go.

297
00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.560
Anna Mills: I like it separated the upload image, and then you know the search

298
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:45.949
Anna Mills: and the media content.

299
00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:51.920
Anna Mills: And then when you get into the upload image, that description is taken off there. Because why do we need it?

300
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.498
Anna Mills: I like that a lot. It looks a lot better.

301
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.110
Anna Mills: you know. We'll save some time.

302
00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:02.520
David: Time

303
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:04.439
David: and tell me about that.

304
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.779
David: the page, the cropping page.

305
00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.420
David: you

306
00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:14.222
David: and we can go back if if

307
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:26.289
Anna Mills: Now. So for this one, because it's it's, you know, this 7 to 2 ratio. It automatically went to that.

308
00:24:27.193 --> 00:24:28.740
Anna Mills: That that's

309
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.170
Anna Mills: I like that better

310
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:37.280
Anna Mills: if it's only going to be a 7 to 2 ratio and nothing else.

311
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.999
Anna Mills: Why do we have, you know, for the old one? Why do we need all those listed?

312
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:44.610
Anna Mills: So?

313
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.240
Anna Mills: yeah, no. I like that.

314
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.500
Anna Mills: Only have the thing that's available.

315
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:57.676
Anna Mills: Then nobody accidentally clicks the wrong thing, because that probably happens. And then also,

316
00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:04.089
Anna Mills: you just get to preview it. You don't have to select it, you know, to preview it.

317
00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:06.130
David: Yeah.

318
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:06.960
Anna Mills: Yeah.

319
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.590
David: And

320
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.290
David: are there any features

321
00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:15.599
David: in this that you found may be confusing or unnecessary?

322
00:25:19.182 --> 00:25:21.019
Anna Mills: For for this!

323
00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:24.270
David: Yes.

324
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.240
David: but there's.

325
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.190
David: Proposed, flow.

326
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.319
Anna Mills: I don't think so. No.

327
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.150
David: Are there any improvements you'd like to see prototype.

328
00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:41.379
Anna Mills: No, I mean, this is great

329
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:47.259
Anna Mills: taking away things that we that we don't need and simplifying it. It's just, you know, that

330
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.589
Anna Mills: that is great.

331
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.970
David: That's great.

332
00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.610
David: Okay?

333
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.430
David: now.

334
00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:03.369
David: you like. So my goal really is to make sure that you have the easiest possible experience uploading an image

335
00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:06.020
David: if you had a magic wand.

336
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:12.970
David: and you can make the perfect image uploader that works for you. That makes your life easier. That saves you time.

337
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.210
David: What might.

338
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.599
David: what features might that include?

339
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.570
Anna Mills: hmm!

340
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:39.850
Anna Mills: Don't I mean I

341
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:41.170
Anna Mills: I

342
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:50.210
Anna Mills: I like it just the way it is. I like, as long as you know, doing the upload part, you know. Fine, but

343
00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:55.230
Anna Mills: The like drag, you know. I prefer like the drag and drop.

344
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:56.809
Anna Mills: I like that better.

345
00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:59.892
Anna Mills: So as long as that stays around.

346
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.569
Anna Mills: it's it's easier.

347
00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:03.790
David: It's easier.

348
00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:04.900
Anna Mills: For me anyways.

349
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.660
David: Got it. Got it? Okay?

350
00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:11.399
David: Yes, I promise you we will not take away the drag and drop.

351
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:19.510
David: Yes, don't don't worry about the drag and drop, cause that is, yeah. Such a good feature. I.

352
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.854
Anna Mills: Do you like the

353
00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:28.470
Anna Mills: You know how? When you put that in, there it goes, and it shows you exactly like what this you know, the 7

354
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.279
Anna Mills: 7 2 ratio like it only shows that because that's the only one that's available.

355
00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:40.079
Anna Mills: It's a little confusing, because the event page is not the only page that has

356
00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:45.419
Anna Mills: only one will will only show one size of photo

357
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:48.650
Anna Mills: But

358
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.379
Anna Mills: you know in my head.

359
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:59.310
Anna Mills: I'm not. I'm not trying to be rude, but in my head, why are they there? If I can't use them, just have the ones I can use.

360
00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.090
David: Other ones I can use.

361
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:05.462
Anna Mills: Yeah, if it's not a feature for this specific

362
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:15.480
Anna Mills: you know creation, the, you know, the create create event. Then if it's not a feature that can be used on these types of pages, then, you know, but

363
00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.040
Anna Mills: don't have them on. There.

364
00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:19.759
David: Got it.

365
00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:25.269
David: Now I'm curious, because it sounds like you're working on pages. Besides, events.

366
00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.920
David: like detail pages and things like that.

367
00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:32.075
David: Maybe you could walk me through

368
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.580
David: one of your other pages that involves uploading

369
00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:36.900
David: images.

370
00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.270
Anna Mills: Okay.

371
00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.069
Anna Mills: should I close this out.

372
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.069
David: Yeah, you can close this one out.

373
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.490
Anna Mills: Okay.

374
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:47.720
Anna Mills: so

375
00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:56.560
Anna Mills: do do. I'm trying to think of the last one I created.

376
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.149
Anna Mills: We'll just go to

377
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:06.150
Anna Mills: my home page and see.

378
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:11.439
Anna Mills: See, I have was in here today.

379
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:14.839
David: Got it? Got it?

380
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.370
David: Okay? It's not.

381
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:28.789
Anna Mills: So our optometry Residency program

382
00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.690
Anna Mills: uploaded this. It's a photo of our campus.

383
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.089
David: Got it.

384
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.290
Anna Mills: Oh, and

385
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.000
Anna Mills: this photo

386
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:48.699
Anna Mills: stuff there's that's stuff like that.

387
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.300
David: Sure. And when you're building these pages.

388
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.450
David: are you? How are you

389
00:29:57.310 --> 00:30:05.859
David: kind of uploading these images and keeping track of the site like it actually, could you press preview for me for a second big preview button.

390
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:17.079
Anna Mills: And what I do when I'm creating a page like this.

391
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.009
Anna Mills: and I'm uploading these images. I am

392
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:30.489
Anna Mills: I do this. I look at the preview a lot

393
00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.439
Anna Mills: to make sure that it's not. You know that it's sizing.

394
00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:42.980
Anna Mills: you know, looking the way that I want it, no matter how you choose the crop, or whatever I want to make sure it looks right, you know.

395
00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.220
David: Right.

396
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.520
Anna Mills: So.

397
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.500
David: And are you editing? The width of these images.

398
00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.170
David: like in your Photoshop.

399
00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.819
David: are in your illustrator.

400
00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.960
Anna Mills: Yeah, I I do. If I do, if I need to. I

401
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:14.589
Anna Mills: I did not take this photo. The program actually did. But usually we are taking photos, and, you know, trying to take

402
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.890
Anna Mills: intentional photos. So

403
00:31:17.358 --> 00:31:29.309
Anna Mills: you know, you don't have to. We're not having to to crop them. If I'm taking a photo specifically for the Internet, you know what I mean. Like, I'm trying to make sure that I'm taking exactly what we need.

404
00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.090
David: But I'm curious.

405
00:31:33.212 --> 00:31:38.000
David: You see how this image is kind of like the full width of the

406
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.940
David: of the section.

407
00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:47.219
David: How might you make the image of the campus that full would if you wanted to do that.

408
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.599
Anna Mills: How would I?

409
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.590
David: Yes.

410
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.140
Anna Mills: Dude.

411
00:32:27.490 --> 00:32:29.186
Anna Mills: I guess I would.

412
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.330
Anna Mills: if I can do this.

413
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.039
Anna Mills: I don't know if I can do this here

414
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:41.140
Anna Mills: Nope don't want to do that.

415
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.230
Anna Mills: I don't know.

416
00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.680
Anna Mills: Let me see.

417
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.330
Anna Mills: Okay.

418
00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:15.689
Anna Mills: yeah. I mean, it says to fill up to, to fill up the full available width of you know the content area.

419
00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.259
Anna Mills: But you know, from adding

420
00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.730
Anna Mills: media.

421
00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.120
Anna Mills: let's see

422
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.350
Anna Mills: do, do.

423
00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:43.069
Anna Mills: Don't mind my folders.

424
00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:48.970
Anna Mills: building thoughtful Southeasley

425
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.950
Anna Mills: so

426
00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.520
Anna Mills: open.

427
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:59.409
Anna Mills: I mean, I think it is just what it is. I don't think that there's a way. I guess I could crop.

428
00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.730
Anna Mills: you know, to make it.

429
00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:07.430
Anna Mills: but that's just cropping it. That's not really sizing it.

430
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.669
Anna Mills: right? So we have to

431
00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.260
Anna Mills: do that beforehand

432
00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:15.530
Anna Mills: before we put it in here.

433
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:17.510
Anna Mills: And

434
00:34:18.870 --> 00:34:23.163
Anna Mills: probably it would. That would probably be nice to, you know, to to change.

435
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.929
Anna Mills: that's

436
00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:26.340
Anna Mills: a lot of.

437
00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:31.149
Anna Mills: I guess. Work on the front end, you know, to be able to put things in here.

438
00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:35.860
Anna Mills: but yeah.

439
00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:38.880
Anna Mills: I know that even on some of our

440
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:43.189
Anna Mills: on some of the other systems that I work on.

441
00:34:44.800 --> 00:35:00.900
Anna Mills: yeah, it has to be, you know, it has to be a certain size, just like, you know, the 7 by 2 for the events, you know, just like that. But you can choose if it's going to be so many like so many pixels across, like, how big it is, how big it shows on the screen.

442
00:35:01.423 --> 00:35:05.069
Anna Mills: But yeah, we don't have. I don't. I guess we don't have that option here.

443
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:06.769
David: Got it.

444
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.870
Anna Mills: So.

445
00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:14.059
David: So what might make this experience easier is kind. You're you're saying.

446
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.270
David: the ability to manipulate the size.

447
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.810
Anna Mills: Yes, so

448
00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.490
Anna Mills: that that would be helpful.

449
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.420
David: Got it.

450
00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:32.170
David: Okay? And do you know, is there anywhere that you can tell how big the image you're uploading

451
00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.399
David: is at this moment.

452
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.780
David: So I know we talked about that 1,000 pixels.

453
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.029
Anna Mills: Yeah,

454
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.330
Anna Mills: is. Yeah. So if I looked at this picture that I'm you know, doing specifically.

455
00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:58.780
Anna Mills: I can go into the the properties of it, but it doesn't show me like here on the screen, or anything doesn't show me what it is.

456
00:35:59.020 --> 00:35:59.760
Anna Mills: Would that be?

457
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.570
David: I mean, that would be helpful for you.

458
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.949
Anna Mills: Yes, to know what it is. Yes.

459
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:09.180
Anna Mills: especially if like on the page that you know I'm showing.

460
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:13.320
Anna Mills: If you know I have this picture, and it's of the facility.

461
00:36:13.959 --> 00:36:21.140
Anna Mills: You know, and it's as small as it is. But the picture further down the page of the people is

462
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:24.260
Anna Mills: you know, a little bit bigger.

463
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.560
Anna Mills: actually a lot bigger. But

464
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.970
Anna Mills: But

465
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:37.429
Anna Mills: you know I what did it say to fill up the full page? It had to be a thousand

466
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.550
Anna Mills: pixels across.

467
00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.230
David: Yeah, how do you feel about that language?

468
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.670
Anna Mills: It's I mean, it's not bad.

469
00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:49.910
Anna Mills: but

470
00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:00.429
Anna Mills: I mean, because I mean we deal we deal with. You know those sizes all the time

471
00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.130
Anna Mills: when you open any adobe.

472
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:20.980
Anna Mills: you know, you know new document, even if it's in express it, it goes by Pixel. If you go by, you know if you want to change it to inches or something. You have to make, you know, to do that, but it shows up in pixels, so I don't think the pixel part is a problem.

473
00:37:21.686 --> 00:37:29.420
Anna Mills: But it, you know. It says, to fill up the full available width of the content area on all screens.

474
00:37:31.634 --> 00:37:34.119
David: Would there be any situations where

475
00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:37.490
David: you wouldn't want to have a full sized image.

476
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.250
Anna Mills: yeah.

477
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.510
Anna Mills: I mean, maybe

478
00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:49.990
Anna Mills: I

479
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:09.129
Anna Mills: I you know, I don't think that like the photo that's on like, I'm going to go back after this conversation, and and, you know, fix the photo that's here of those residents.

480
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:11.480
Anna Mills: because it doesn't need to be that big.

481
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:17.900
Anna Mills: And if that was the across the you know the screen, you know completely.

482
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:22.810
Anna Mills: Then that would you know what I mean like? That's it doesn't need to be that big.

483
00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:24.140
Anna Mills: It's

484
00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.780
Anna Mills: I think it detracts from the information that's on the screen.

485
00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:30.059
David: The tracks from the information on the screen.

486
00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:35.480
David: Got it so what would a good if there was like one standard size?

487
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.640
David: Should there be one standard size. Should you have the option.

488
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.130
Anna Mills: No, we should have options.

489
00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:45.760
Anna Mills: cause you know.

490
00:38:50.480 --> 00:39:04.989
Anna Mills: there's I have another page that I did, that I have all of like a pictures, and it's like all of our different facilities. You know it has. You know, we have. We have 2 main campuses, and then we have 4 community clinics, and it's

491
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:07.580
Anna Mills: I think it's at least

492
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:14.379
Anna Mills: you know, 8 or 8 or 900 pixels. You know what I mean. So it's it's a larger.

493
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.910
Anna Mills: It's a larger photo.

494
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.625
Anna Mills: But

495
00:39:18.830 --> 00:39:19.480
Anna Mills: the

496
00:39:22.770 --> 00:39:32.609
Anna Mills: when you look at when you look at a when I look at you know this photo that I was just uploading

497
00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:44.579
Anna Mills: when I go into properties of it. It says the width is, you know, 5,100 pixels.

498
00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:48.840
David: Hmm.

499
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.169
Anna Mills: So I don't know how it got from

500
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:59.199
Anna Mills: from from that to you know what we see

501
00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.670
Anna Mills: here.

502
00:40:02.930 --> 00:40:06.919
David: So this is 5,100 pixels, but it's not showing up

503
00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.500
David: as far away.

504
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.180
Anna Mills: No, it's not.

505
00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.420
Anna Mills: And that's in here.

506
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.940
David: Yeah.

507
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.359
David: we'll definitely make a note of this. It's it's interesting.

508
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.680
David: Yeah.

509
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.420
David: okay.

510
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:33.099
David: well, I really appreciate you taking the time to chat with us today? I just have a couple other questions. These are a little bit more

511
00:40:34.293 --> 00:40:36.000
David: drupal overall.

512
00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.830
David: so is there anything in the current drupal cms

513
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.720
David: and not just sticking with like images now.

514
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:52.919
David: but like anything else in your daily workflow that you feel is missing, or could be improved. To make your workflow a little easier.

515
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.415
Anna Mills: yes,

516
00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.600
Anna Mills: I think that.

517
00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.360
Anna Mills: So

518
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:28.399
Anna Mills: so when I when I when say, there's a program that doesn't have a page on our Internet. They want a new page, you know. Fine. We get all the information from them. Make sure everything's accurate, you know, if there's photos or whatever we get everything ready, and then we come in here.

519
00:41:29.168 --> 00:41:32.680
Anna Mills: What I like to do when I am

520
00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:39.950
Anna Mills: like building, you know, like a new page of, you know, for a program

521
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.249
Anna Mills: is to have

522
00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:45.559
Anna Mills: the actual, not, I know this is a preview, but the actual

523
00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:54.869
Anna Mills: Internet open. So you know. And I'm looking because I have to look and see like what it's going to be under. You know where it's going to go and

524
00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:59.750
Anna Mills: when you create, when you create a page.

525
00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.329
Anna Mills: You know you have to. You know the detail page.

526
00:42:03.778 --> 00:42:11.340
Anna Mills: Like they're not. It doesn't show here. You know what I mean. Like. If I go to health services.

527
00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:17.910
Anna Mills: that's not. I was looking for one. Specifically.

528
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:25.570
Anna Mills: it's not necessarily intuitive how to find

529
00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:32.889
Anna Mills: some of the things that you need to change for a page if I go to the arseously campus.

530
00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:38.839
Anna Mills: and we have here like preparing for your visit.

531
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:41.210
Anna Mills: here.

532
00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.239
Anna Mills: and you know so it's the women veteran healthcare. I've had a lot of problems with this page.

533
00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:48.150
Anna Mills: You know.

534
00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:50.020
Anna Mills: So I go to it.

535
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.260
Anna Mills: But it's just what's on the front.

536
00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:58.100
Anna Mills: you know, on the front of the there's another back page

537
00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.120
Anna Mills: that you know, that has more information.

538
00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:06.940
Anna Mills: But it's not.

539
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.860
Anna Mills: If there's going to be a detail page, you know, for a service.

540
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:23.589
Anna Mills: Then the other page that that the front page takes you to it, you know, and I shouldn't say want to say they should be linked.

541
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:30.209
Anna Mills: But when you are, when when I'm navigating, you know, and I'm using the side here, it's

542
00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:35.609
Anna Mills: it's it's hard to find what you're looking for for things you've already done.

543
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:37.650
Anna Mills: if you have to update them.

544
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.160
Anna Mills: And I think I have spent

545
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:44.180
Anna Mills: way too much time, and maybe it's me, and

546
00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:47.394
Anna Mills: I'm dumb because I couldn't figure it out.

547
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:50.870
Anna Mills: how to find some of these things.

548
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.709
Anna Mills: and I go to search. But

549
00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:55.310
Anna Mills: it's

550
00:43:55.710 --> 00:44:00.090
Anna Mills: it's diff. It's difficult. Sometimes when you're you know, you have to update.

551
00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.399
Anna Mills: it's like 3 different pages, and one of them is hard to find.

552
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.880
Anna Mills: Does that make sense?

553
00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:10.239
Anna Mills: Or did I just ramble on.

554
00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:15.110
David: No, I I think I'm getting it just to reiterate. So we

555
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.270
David: an example might be the health Services page women's health.

556
00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.509
David: veteran women under women's health.

557
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.690
David: It's hard to know where that page lived.

558
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:28.870
David: Is that what

559
00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:30.209
David: you're getting at.

560
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:33.620
Anna Mills: So

561
00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:36.669
Anna Mills: I'm going to open this.

562
00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.309
Anna Mills: This is. This is the detail page.

563
00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:46.350
Anna Mills: you know.

564
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:56.380
Anna Mills: but you don't make you don't just make a detail page. You have to make the Facility Health Service page.

565
00:44:56.820 --> 00:45:03.260
Anna Mills: and it says where it's at. You know, the service location stuff like that, you know, appointments.

566
00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:06.320
Anna Mills: Those 2 pages have to be made

567
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:07.490
Anna Mills: for

568
00:45:08.916 --> 00:45:10.850
Anna Mills: you know, for a program.

569
00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:13.429
Anna Mills: But on the front page.

570
00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.189
Anna Mills: where where I showed you it listed that women's health.

571
00:45:19.907 --> 00:45:21.819
Anna Mills: That's another page.

572
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:23.040
Anna Mills: and

573
00:45:23.410 --> 00:45:25.069
Anna Mills: it doesn't.

574
00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:29.969
Anna Mills: I've had to link that front page to these pages.

575
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:32.940
Anna Mills: It didn't have that set up right away.

576
00:45:33.635 --> 00:45:38.900
Anna Mills: But to link them. These were not easy to find. You know, the

577
00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:43.680
Anna Mills: the health service, the basic information for that program.

578
00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.800
Anna Mills: These are not easy to find for me.

579
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.560
David: They're fine.

580
00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.890
Anna Mills: No, and I go into the knowledge base.

581
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:55.280
Anna Mills: then look up stuff all the time.

582
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.280
David: Got it.

583
00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.460
David: Got it? Well.
