1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.020
David: The cloud great.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.659
David: and I've started recording, I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we speak today.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.470
Megan Zehnder: Yes.

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.920
David: Great, great, great, great.

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.710
David: Okay? So let's just kind of jump into it. Can you tell me a little bit about your role at the Va.

6
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.170
Megan Zehnder: Yes, so I work with the Cms pretty extensively. I am on a content.

7
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:41.859
Megan Zehnder: I'm I work on the Content side as a copy editor. So I work on a lot of the static pages so like any of the pages on Va. Gov. That people don't have to be authenticated to get into. Those are mostly the pages that we work on.

8
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.760
Megan Zehnder: Which

9
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.698
Megan Zehnder: many are on drupal. And

10
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.997
Megan Zehnder: we don't work with a ton of images regularly. On the like core benefit pages and

11
00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.389
Megan Zehnder: resources and support pages that that we often are

12
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.530
Megan Zehnder: creating or editing or updating.

13
00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:04.750
Megan Zehnder: But

14
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.910
Megan Zehnder: yeah, that's a little bit about my

15
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.380
Megan Zehnder: interactions with drupal.

16
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.850
Megan Zehnder: But we work kind of across

17
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:20.650
Megan Zehnder: lots of work with lots of teams, product teams and business lines. Any anything that kind of touches the

18
00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:23.830
Megan Zehnder: content on va.gov.

19
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.719
David: Got it. So you said you don't often work with images, are there

20
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.590
David: when you do work with images. Are there specific pages that you're working on more than others? Or is it kind of whatever comes up.

21
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.060
Megan Zehnder: Yeah. So I would say, it's not. It's like, not our standard. But there are occasionally times like, for instance, in the last week.

22
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.850
Megan Zehnder: when we put together a step by step

23
00:01:50.150 --> 00:02:02.304
Megan Zehnder: process page that was this was in like the resources and support section of the site, which is where there are a lot of like questions and answers. That come up. This particular one was

24
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:14.960
Megan Zehnder: advising people on how to sign in and how to verify their account. And so there were a lot of screenshots involved. And so that was the main way that I was using the

25
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.740
Megan Zehnder: the upload image tool for that one.

26
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.699
Megan Zehnder: but it is a little bit more rare. But but

27
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.440
Megan Zehnder: you know, when we do use it.

28
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.482
Megan Zehnder: it's probably it's usually on pages that

29
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.827
Megan Zehnder: probably, you know, have a lot of traffic or or

30
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.650
Megan Zehnder: for whatever reason.

31
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.599
Megan Zehnder: lend itself to needing imagery.

32
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.980
David: Got it. Got it. So these are. It's not

33
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.069
David: so much on like an event or a story page, or it's more like instructional

34
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.799
David: lots of pictures. Got it. Okay.

35
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.400
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, more.

36
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.010
David: And

37
00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:08.749
David: So generally, when you're receiving an image, or when you're like preparing an image for this, do you find yourself editing and cropping it beforehand or yeah, do you? Yeah.

38
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.180
Megan Zehnder: Yes, yes, so

39
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.160
Megan Zehnder: definitely

40
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.862
Megan Zehnder: cropping, at least in this instance. Last week.

41
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.909
Megan Zehnder: we kind of had to to

42
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.019
Megan Zehnder: crop them and get them and

43
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.020
Megan Zehnder: process them so that to try and get them consistent.

44
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.559
Megan Zehnder: a little bit more new at that process. And you know my background is more in content than I. I

45
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.030
Megan Zehnder: I struggled a bit with that process. But

46
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.560
Megan Zehnder: yes, in the rare instances that I have worked with

47
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.000
Megan Zehnder: images.

48
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.119
Megan Zehnder: I've done the processing and resizing

49
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.329
Megan Zehnder: before uploading.

50
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.740
David: Got it.

51
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.240
David: And that is the main goal for that to have just consistency. Or is there like

52
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.660
David: upload

53
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.800
David: problems or things that you're also trying to avoid

54
00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:02.600
David: sizing. I don't know.

55
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.770
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, it's for consistency.

56
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.590
David: It's for consistency. Got it? Yeah.

57
00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.740
David: okay.

58
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:19.510
David: great and do you find yourself using images from the media library as well? Or are you really just uploading new images as you need them?

59
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.959
Megan Zehnder: So for this instance, I did

60
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.570
Megan Zehnder: go back into the media library because I want it, like.

61
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:48.219
Megan Zehnder: for a couple of reasons, mostly to adjust all the alt text later, or to re upload a different size image because the 1st one didn't work out when I previewed it. So I went back into the media library, not so much to like see what was available, but more to

62
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.520
Megan Zehnder: revisit

63
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.890
Megan Zehnder: images that I already uploaded.

64
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.219
David: Revisit images you've already uploaded, and you mentioned kind of like when it's

65
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.990
David: when you see the image like in the preview. Then, you know it's good or not.

66
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.930
David: is this, this is at at what point in your workflow is this.

67
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.575
Megan Zehnder: So

68
00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.930
Megan Zehnder: this is probably like

69
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.183
Megan Zehnder: kind of in the middle of the workflow, like I, or toward the end, possibly

70
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.980
Megan Zehnder: But

71
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.120
Megan Zehnder: like as I'm uploading images and trying to see

72
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:31.879
Megan Zehnder: how it's looking. I might test a different size to see how that works.

73
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.880
David: But.

74
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:41.839
Megan Zehnder: Maybe, like, for the most part, it's toward the end, when I'm trying to make everything consistent. And I might need to make adjustments to the photo or to the alt text.

75
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.950
Megan Zehnder: like, after everything else is in place.

76
00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.150
David: I see.

77
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.775
David: Okay, great. So we'll jump into our 1st task. Now.

78
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.400
David: if you could open your Cms

79
00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:05.920
David: and share your screen, that would be great and feel free to like log in or anything before you start sharing. If if you, if you want.

80
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.439
Megan Zehnder: Already. In. So let me.

81
00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:07.910
David: Perkin.

82
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.900
Megan Zehnder: Be able to.

83
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.450
David: Receive.

84
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.410
Megan Zehnder: The Cms.

85
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.580
David: Yeah, I see it. That's perfect.

86
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:26.999
David: So I'm really curious about like the page that you said you were kind of working on right now.

87
00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:29.120
David: And

88
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:42.119
David: maybe if you could show me how you you could either go to the original, the one that you're working on and show me kind of there, or if it'd be easier to do a new one, just to kind of see that process.

89
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.590
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, I can. This.

90
00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.909
Megan Zehnder: I can show you the one that I was working on.

91
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.670
David: Step by step, got it.

92
00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.960
Megan Zehnder: Step by step. Yeah, template. And

93
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.320
Megan Zehnder: we added.

94
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.400
Megan Zehnder: do you want to see the preview or the edit mode?

95
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:12.560
David: this I mean, yeah, this is what I'm I'm very interested in, just like this part. So the step by step, you're you're uploading these images to it.

96
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.540
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

97
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.155
Megan Zehnder: And there were

98
00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:26.850
Megan Zehnder: maybe like 2 editors in here, maybe 2 or 3. So at various points we were both adding images.

99
00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.110
Megan Zehnder: So

100
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.739
Megan Zehnder: that's just another

101
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.470
Megan Zehnder: character. But

102
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.479
Megan Zehnder: there were many, and I went back to

103
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.080
Megan Zehnder: The

104
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:47.998
Megan Zehnder: I ended up. Sorry if I was scrolling. I ended up going back into the media library like several times, just to

105
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.860
Megan Zehnder: make sure that

106
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.939
Megan Zehnder: just to adjust the image size or to adjust the Alt text.

107
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:57.870
Megan Zehnder: Hmm.

108
00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.550
David: Huh?

109
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.840
David: So I have

110
00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:05.029
David: a couple of questions for you. The 1st is.

111
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.140
David: and what does consistency

112
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.230
David: mean to you? Is it like the same width size.

113
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.389
David: Is it something.

114
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.460
Megan Zehnder: Announce.

115
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.260
Megan Zehnder: So for this one.

116
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:25.600
Megan Zehnder: we're gonna probably revisit these images, or we're definitely revisiting them because they I'm still not happy with

117
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.850
Megan Zehnder: the resolution. I think it looks really pixelated.

118
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.260
Megan Zehnder: But

119
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.200
Megan Zehnder: or like the v 1, just to get this out because it was a little bit of a time. Crunch! We

120
00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:42.379
Megan Zehnder: just went with these images and

121
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.100
Megan Zehnder: got them all

122
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:45.380
Megan Zehnder: in

123
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.909
Megan Zehnder: The consistency that we were looking for in this instance was like a consistent width.

124
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.920
Megan Zehnder: So I think we were able to generally

125
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.340
Megan Zehnder: achieve that.

126
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.420
Megan Zehnder: But again, like it's this is not perfect. And

127
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.490
Megan Zehnder: ideally.

128
00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:09.644
Megan Zehnder: we would want these to have a better resolution.

129
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.859
Megan Zehnder: I think I don't know. I'm talking with the designer tomorrow to kind of get their perspective on

130
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:17.300
Megan Zehnder: how to

131
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.070
Megan Zehnder: make this better. But.

132
00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.409
David: I see.

133
00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.020
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

134
00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:28.259
David: Okay, that's great. Now, if you go back to that, I think the 1st tab. Yeah.

135
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.290
David: There's 1

136
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.109
David: I was hoping you could just

137
00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:39.020
David: before like not saving it, but kind of walk me through your process of uploading an image. I think there's

138
00:09:39.488 --> 00:09:43.660
David: one or 2 that don't have an image that maybe we could practice on.

139
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.204
Megan Zehnder: Sure.

140
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.730
Megan Zehnder: yeah, I guess I could add it.

141
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.960
Megan Zehnder: or maybe, should I just start? Maybe I'll start a new one. Just so I don't want to get.

142
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.603
David: Oh, yeah, whatever is easier or safer.

143
00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.840
Megan Zehnder: Let me just start a new one, just

144
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.009
Megan Zehnder: in case someone needs to go into that post or something.

145
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.670
David: Absolutely.

146
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.450
Megan Zehnder: next up

147
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.540
Megan Zehnder: and

148
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.290
Megan Zehnder: so

149
00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.109
Megan Zehnder: do you want to see my process, for, like how I resize them.

150
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:40.390
David: You can show that to me I'd be I yeah, I mean, whatever you'd like to show me, I I as you do your typical flow of an image.

151
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:45.130
Megan Zehnder: Okay, it definitely changed as I was working on this post, because

152
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:53.014
Megan Zehnder: at 1st I was just uploading them, kind of like as they were given to me. So.

153
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.390
Megan Zehnder: I had my

154
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.350
Megan Zehnder: sorry. This looks really disorganized because it was

155
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:04.478
Megan Zehnder: a quick process, but

156
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.010
Megan Zehnder: like I had my images that I was given, and then I

157
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.860
Megan Zehnder: added them.

158
00:11:13.927 --> 00:11:16.499
Megan Zehnder: I added description

159
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.900
Megan Zehnder: like

160
00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.780
Megan Zehnder: something like that.

161
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.040
Megan Zehnder: And then

162
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.440
Megan Zehnder: section. This was kind of annoying to scroll through. Why, but

163
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.979
Megan Zehnder: not going there.

164
00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.827
Megan Zehnder: And then I I still I tried to make this a little bit different.

165
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:50.430
David: Yeah, what? I'm curious. What's the difference between the description and the alt text?

166
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.329
Megan Zehnder: Yeah. Well, I tried to.

167
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.679
Megan Zehnder: My, you know, from my understanding.

168
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.149
Megan Zehnder: tried to make all text a little bit more

169
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.395
Megan Zehnder: descriptive.

170
00:12:04.858 --> 00:12:07.719
Megan Zehnder: And use this a little bit more as like

171
00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.069
Megan Zehnder: the title

172
00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:17.630
Megan Zehnder: but I don't have high confidence in how I was filling these out so.

173
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.839
David: And then I'm curious also about the sections.

174
00:12:23.315 --> 00:12:25.590
David: You mentioned. It was a little bit.

175
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.350
David: I think he used the word frustrating or.

176
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:36.259
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, it just was like, I don't know what were the issues. I think that like, I would

177
00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:38.039
Megan Zehnder: try and go down here.

178
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.320
Megan Zehnder: And then sometimes it would flip back up.

179
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.980
Megan Zehnder: not. I don't seem to be having that issue right now.

180
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.059
David: Okay. But there's there's a lot to kind of scroll through.

181
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.589
Megan Zehnder: For me. There is. Yeah, I don't know if everyone has the same view, but it

182
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:55.679
Megan Zehnder: it is a lot. Yeah.

183
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.760
David: Yeah.

184
00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:04.059
David: is this the same? Is this the same view you typically have when you are selecting sections

185
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.699
David: in other places.

186
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:14.109
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, I think it is when we're when we're creating a new page. Then I I'm pretty sure it is. I can go and check. But

187
00:13:15.435 --> 00:13:16.270
Megan Zehnder: yeah.

188
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.449
Megan Zehnder: And then, okay, so

189
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.930
Megan Zehnder: did that

190
00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.910
Megan Zehnder: step one?

191
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.629
Megan Zehnder: Oh, I know something that was really frustrating.

192
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:28.790
Megan Zehnder: was

193
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.880
Megan Zehnder: I so in in the

194
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.660
Megan Zehnder: the image that I was adding like, sometimes I wanted to describe like.

195
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:39.190
Megan Zehnder: step one

196
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.040
Megan Zehnder: upload and upload

197
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:49.509
Megan Zehnder: an image of your Id, because that's what the picture was of, and I I couldn't do it because it had

198
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.230
Megan Zehnder: image of which I understand. Why that

199
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:54.490
Megan Zehnder: like? Why.

200
00:13:54.490 --> 00:14:01.200
David: Oh, that's so interesting. Yeah, cause you're not using it as saying, this is an image of this. You're using it.

201
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.610
Megan Zehnder: Right, exactly so.

202
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.680
David: Yeah.

203
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.049
Megan Zehnder: For me. This was

204
00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.060
Megan Zehnder: this was a problem.

205
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:18.060
Megan Zehnder: but you know I don't know how many times people are uploading images in this way. But I had to like

206
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.799
Megan Zehnder: I don't even know what I ended up doing, but I was like.

207
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.440
Megan Zehnder: upload

208
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:28.479
Megan Zehnder: your id or something. I don't. I don't know how I ended up wording it, but I had to.

209
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.360
Megan Zehnder: I had to really do some some results around that copy.

210
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.210
David: Yeah.

211
00:14:34.072 --> 00:14:36.320
Megan Zehnder: Okay? And then I.

212
00:14:36.726 --> 00:14:42.820
David: So I'm just curious about those cropping options. Are are you using any of those.

213
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:45.240
Megan Zehnder: Oh, are there cropping options.

214
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.839
David: Oh, yeah, no. That that. Okay. Now that.

215
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.659
Megan Zehnder: How do I? Okay, let me go back. And then can I let me

216
00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.289
Megan Zehnder: look in the

217
00:14:56.365 --> 00:14:58.260
Megan Zehnder: go back to the media library?

218
00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:02.299
Megan Zehnder: My gosh, if I miss the crafting options completely.

219
00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:05.420
Megan Zehnder: Okay, media.

220
00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:11.060
Megan Zehnder: so I just did. Okay.

221
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:19.600
Megan Zehnder: Oh, this. Oh, big, these cropping images. Yeah, okay, so I did see these.

222
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:24.910
Megan Zehnder: I didn't know how

223
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:33.289
Megan Zehnder: to use this in a way that would be that would help me get consistency with all the other images, because all the other images

224
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.180
Megan Zehnder: we're coming from

225
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:40.635
Megan Zehnder: slightly different places. Maybe I should have thought about this a little differently. But

226
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.350
Megan Zehnder: yeah.

227
00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:48.130
David: I I hear what you're saying. It's.

228
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:49.680
Megan Zehnder: Was not.

229
00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.549
David: Not allowing you to

230
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:57.030
David: do something that's like consistent. Besides, it's like it's visual

231
00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.649
David: cropping versus.

232
00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:08.790
Megan Zehnder: Resizing right like I couldn't. I needed to resize. I think I it wasn't that I needed to crop. Necessarily, I needed to resize.

233
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.080
David: I see.

234
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.929
Megan Zehnder: So maybe there's a way to do this. But I didn't.

235
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:17.480
Megan Zehnder: I did not.

236
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.909
Megan Zehnder: I did not mess with it. I didn't. I didn't explore it.

237
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.790
Megan Zehnder: Instead, I used

238
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.570
Megan Zehnder: an outside program.

239
00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.250
Megan Zehnder: I just use canva.

240
00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:35.440
David: Canva. Okay? Yeah, I've I've heard that canvas very commonly used. So that's good.

241
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.260
Megan Zehnder: Yeah. And I I'll say that I struggled a lot with that because

242
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.649
Megan Zehnder: because I originally, we like

243
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.610
Megan Zehnder: put these in a word, Doc, and and

244
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.529
Megan Zehnder: tried to make them consistent in the word doc

245
00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:59.030
Megan Zehnder: by adjusting their inches. So like we made all the images

246
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.550
Megan Zehnder: 2 and a half inches, or whatever.

247
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.099
Megan Zehnder: But then, for whatever reason, when we uploaded them in here.

248
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.950
Megan Zehnder: the

249
00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.829
Megan Zehnder: the pixels were all different, so the images displayed

250
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.060
Megan Zehnder: in all different sizes.

251
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:16.450
Megan Zehnder: So

252
00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:26.030
Megan Zehnder: so the adjustment that we made in the word Doc to adjust the the inches did not work. So what I ended up doing was

253
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.169
Megan Zehnder: uploading them all in canva.

254
00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.990
Megan Zehnder: adjusting

255
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.929
Megan Zehnder: the image, sorry, adjusting the inches.

256
00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:43.199
Megan Zehnder: and then like matching that with the pixels and sizing it that way. And I'm probably using this terminology all wrong, because I'm not a designer. But

257
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.510
Megan Zehnder: but there was something about like the inches and pixels

258
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.859
Megan Zehnder: that for whatever reason, the 1st round were not

259
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:55.279
Megan Zehnder: scaling together. And I had to try and like

260
00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.210
Megan Zehnder: figure it out in canva.

261
00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.709
David: Got it. Got it.

262
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:03.850
Megan Zehnder: You may.

263
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.000
David: Okay? And if we scroll down just a bit. So you typically

264
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.039
David: don't select any of these cropping options, you just kind of

265
00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.660
David: go keep going.

266
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:20.909
Megan Zehnder: I I have not. I can imagine, though, if I like, had an image, and I just needed a little part of it. Maybe I would

267
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.960
Megan Zehnder: use this.

268
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.699
Megan Zehnder: But I would say like, this is a little bit not

269
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.009
Megan Zehnder: clear to me like what this part.

270
00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:32.910
Megan Zehnder: what the ratios mean.

271
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.260
David: Okay.

272
00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:38.320
David: and then

273
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:42.729
David: I know we're on kind of like the the image thing itself.

274
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:54.079
David: but if we were back on the page that we were on before, where we were like uploading the image. You had 2 options insert and select and insert.

275
00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.159
David: or save and save and select and save and insert.

276
00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.760
David: and I'm curious.

277
00:18:59.645 --> 00:19:01.789
David: Which one you.

278
00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:07.359
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, let me go back to that page.

279
00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:11.660
Megan Zehnder: hold on

280
00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.360
Megan Zehnder: November

281
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:17.680
Megan Zehnder: test.

282
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:19.400
Megan Zehnder: He's gonna

283
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.260
Megan Zehnder: hmm

284
00:19:25.514 --> 00:19:28.586
Megan Zehnder: know how I got back to that page.

285
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:39.430
Megan Zehnder: Hold on

286
00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:40.840
Megan Zehnder: instead.

287
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.710
David: Oh, maybe didn't! Oh.

288
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.100
Megan Zehnder: Did I not save it?

289
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:49.420
David: Yeah, maybe we didn't save the page.

290
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.010
Megan Zehnder: And then I just exited out of it. Suddenly.

291
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.989
David: There's a

292
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:56.659
David: is it, Champ? I I don't know.

293
00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:00.809
Megan Zehnder: Well, okay, let me go back into this page.

294
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:07.980
Megan Zehnder: and I'll

295
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.970
Megan Zehnder: I can try them.

296
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.050
Megan Zehnder: Okay. So I did my description.

297
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:02.760
Megan Zehnder: It does

298
00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.170
Megan Zehnder: on my.

299
00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.560
Megan Zehnder: I'll text

300
00:21:15.139 --> 00:21:19.940
David: A couple of questions. Actually, do you ever find yourself unchecking the reusable.

301
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.230
Megan Zehnder: I don't.

302
00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:26.250
Megan Zehnder: Okay.

303
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.590
David: And then

304
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.899
David: my other question is, Yeah, what's the difference between save and select and save and insert.

305
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:54.189
Megan Zehnder: I don't know, I guess, save and insert. It goes right into the the post right away. But I did not

306
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:58.510
Megan Zehnder: really. I did not

307
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.709
Megan Zehnder: think about these very intentionally. I just went with the one that was selected.

308
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.940
David: Okay.

309
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.710
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

310
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:08.440
David: Great, great, great, great.

311
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.319
David: Okay, though

312
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.450
David: overall.

313
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.059
David: How? How was that experience for you filling this out.

314
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.870
Megan Zehnder: I mean, outside of, like the

315
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:29.079
Megan Zehnder: massive problems I had with trying to get a consistent

316
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.419
Megan Zehnder: like width or image of my source images.

317
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:38.339
Megan Zehnder: So maybe that's like out of scope, out of scope on a different issue.

318
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.240
Megan Zehnder: This was.

319
00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:47.680
Megan Zehnder: it wasn't like a horrible experience like I was able to go

320
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:49.300
Megan Zehnder: into the

321
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.470
Megan Zehnder: media library

322
00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.053
Megan Zehnder: pretty easily.

323
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.659
Megan Zehnder: and find the image.

324
00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.229
Megan Zehnder: yeah, I wouldn't say that like

325
00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.670
Megan Zehnder: this

326
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.709
Megan Zehnder: felt very useful to me, like in in its current iteration.

327
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.480
Megan Zehnder: it's a cute one.

328
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:19.740
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, you get one.

329
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.710
David: Curious.

330
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:24.520
David: When do you think something like this would be valuable.

331
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.300
David: or could it be.

332
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.255
Megan Zehnder: Yeah,

333
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.560
Megan Zehnder: I guess if you're trying to like

334
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.759
Megan Zehnder: if you have a huge screenshot, and you're like, I just want this part.

335
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:47.010
Megan Zehnder: So I'm gonna

336
00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:48.930
Megan Zehnder: but like, why is it?

337
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.499
Megan Zehnder: Why does it seem like I can

338
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.559
Megan Zehnder: adjust it? But then I can't.

339
00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.369
David: Yeah, I'm not sure about that one.

340
00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:03.120
Megan Zehnder: Yeah. But I guess, like, if you're if you just have a large image and you're trying to.

341
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:06.429
Megan Zehnder: and you don't feel comfortable. And outside

342
00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:10.510
Megan Zehnder: editing software. Then

343
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.960
Megan Zehnder: then they're like, it is

344
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:15.789
Megan Zehnder: nice to have at least some

345
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.539
Megan Zehnder: way to edit the photo in this tool.

346
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.900
David: Yeah.

347
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:21.949
Megan Zehnder: But it is.

348
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.629
Megan Zehnder: It's a little tricky. Oh, I guess. Okay, that's when you do preform.

349
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:27.690
Megan Zehnder: Great. Oh.

350
00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.690
David: Okay. So now.

351
00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:35.200
David: I'm gonna shift us to our next part of this, where I'm gonna send you

352
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.929
David: a prototype that we're working on.

353
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:39.390
Megan Zehnder: Okay.

354
00:24:40.218 --> 00:24:43.280
David: So I'm gonna go ahead and just share it in chat.

355
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:17.980
David: And we're gonna do probably a little bit of pretending here. So the prototype that we have is for events.

356
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.180
David: It's

357
00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:32.010
David: There are the the module for the actual like image uploader is the same. This is just kind of an event. Situation? So there are certain things that are

358
00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.400
David: the same, certain things that are different than your workflow. But yeah, hopefully, we can.

359
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.881
David: And I got through that

360
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:47.640
David: and let's go into the left nav. There's like a proposed flow and a current flow. Let's do the proposed flow.

361
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.790
David: And then what I'd

362
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:57.670
David: like you do is imagine that you've started to create a new event for veterans.

363
00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:00.529
David: Okay, you've entered the date and time.

364
00:26:01.027 --> 00:26:03.600
David: Which va location. It's going to be

365
00:26:03.982 --> 00:26:07.109
David: happening at. And now it's time to upload that image.

366
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.600
David: So yeah, I'd like for you to show me how you would go ahead and do that.

367
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.560
Megan Zehnder: I say, I have my image ready.

368
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:25.920
David: Yeah. And it, it's kind of baked into this. So you can't really drag and drop. But like, if you do the things that you would normally do. You'll see

369
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.709
David: the more problem.

370
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.640
Megan Zehnder: Okay. You want me to keep going.

371
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.279
David: Yep. Yep.

372
00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.080
Megan Zehnder: Nice.

373
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.369
Megan Zehnder: Okay? So all they all have to be the same aspect. Ratio.

374
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:46.710
Megan Zehnder: Okay.

375
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.370
David: And that that's an events, thing.

376
00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:50.730
Megan Zehnder: Okay, so that's

377
00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:52.880
Megan Zehnder: got it. That makes sense. Okay.

378
00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.670
Megan Zehnder: yes.

379
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.539
Megan Zehnder: What would I do if I was like, oh, wait! I actually don't like where that

380
00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:23.640
Megan Zehnder: like, how I edit, how I adjusted that!

381
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.750
Megan Zehnder: Is there

382
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.209
Megan Zehnder: something I can do to

383
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:29.460
Megan Zehnder: go back.

384
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.019
David: Yeah. What do you? What do you think?

385
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.550
David: What would you like.

386
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.019
Megan Zehnder: I guess I would.

387
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.610
Megan Zehnder: maybe finish editing this and go back

388
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:51.269
Megan Zehnder: to the media library to see if I can like readjust that or something.

389
00:27:51.790 --> 00:27:54.930
David: Okay, you would go back to the media library to readjust that.

390
00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:55.800
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

391
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.279
Megan Zehnder: or but if there was like a

392
00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:02.309
Megan Zehnder: little edit icon or something, then I would

393
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.420
Megan Zehnder: click on that to try and get back to the edit screen.

394
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.290
David: Gotcha, and what would happen if you pressed X.

395
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.229
Megan Zehnder: I don't know.

396
00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.909
Megan Zehnder: Oh, and go away. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay.

397
00:28:16.733 --> 00:28:18.860
Megan Zehnder: then I would just re upload it.

398
00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.579
Megan Zehnder: Okay, yeah, that that makes sense.

399
00:28:23.115 --> 00:28:23.970
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

400
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.580
David: Yeah, that part's not gonna work.

401
00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.400
Megan Zehnder: Thank you.

402
00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:30.569
Megan Zehnder: But okay, so I could adjust it. There, continue.

403
00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.180
Megan Zehnder: Add my Alt text.

404
00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.090
Megan Zehnder: adjust, file, name.

405
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.740
Megan Zehnder: and I could remove it here and then.

406
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.739
David: You can click that.

407
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:48.850
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, that feels right?

408
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:03.680
David: Would would

409
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.440
David: editing at this stage.

410
00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:11.530
David: So so I guess. Actually let me take a step back. You

411
00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:15.729
David: seemed a little hesitant, I think, with clicking that X

412
00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.329
David: was. That was that for a reason.

413
00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.070
David: Perfect.

414
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.989
David: or did he not? Did you notice it? Did you notice the act.

415
00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.890
Megan Zehnder: I did notice it, and I.

416
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:28.530
David: Okay.

417
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.770
Megan Zehnder: I think, like my hesitation

418
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.219
Megan Zehnder: in pressing. That was that

419
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:42.140
Megan Zehnder: I wasn't necessarily ready to like, scrap everything and go back and find my image. I just wanted to like. Readjust it again.

420
00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.920
Megan Zehnder: so

421
00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.239
Megan Zehnder: like I just wanted to go one step back versus like

422
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:54.330
Megan Zehnder: 2 or 3. But it wasn't a bad experience I probably like. If I was unhappy with that.

423
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.230
Megan Zehnder: I think

424
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.579
Megan Zehnder: I would probably just start over, and

425
00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.330
Megan Zehnder: you know, whatever.

426
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.920
David: I see, but it would be nicer to just go one step back rather than

427
00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.230
David: the work you put in kind of being.

428
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.890
Megan Zehnder: Right? Yeah, to like find the image and upload it.

429
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.740
David: I see.

430
00:30:12.435 --> 00:30:13.130
Megan Zehnder: But

431
00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:17.350
Megan Zehnder: I think overall it was clean and easy, and

432
00:30:19.472 --> 00:30:22.069
Megan Zehnder: it was a lot less like

433
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.360
Megan Zehnder: there was a lot less that was unclear.

434
00:30:25.954 --> 00:30:31.470
Megan Zehnder: It was a pretty simple process, and I could like adjust it right away.

435
00:30:32.276 --> 00:30:33.859
Megan Zehnder: So I like that part.

436
00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:41.659
David: yeah, what's so yeah, you're kind of getting into this what stands out to you about this newer

437
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.280
David: update design.

438
00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:50.449
Megan Zehnder: I think that there are fewer options which could be good in certain situations, and maybe

439
00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.811
Megan Zehnder: not ideal in all situations.

440
00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:55.880
Megan Zehnder: but like.

441
00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:00.040
Megan Zehnder: I think, having like the one image ratio for

442
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.100
Megan Zehnder: certain templated

443
00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.700
Megan Zehnder: spots is great because

444
00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.050
Megan Zehnder: it just

445
00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.910
Megan Zehnder: it just helps cut out a

446
00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.129
Megan Zehnder: something to think about.

447
00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.179
Megan Zehnder: I don't know. Can I go back to like in the

448
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:26.460
Megan Zehnder: to to just see what my options are if I upload it? And I realize like, oh, this looks way, too

449
00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:27.550
Megan Zehnder: like the.

450
00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:28.230
David: So.

451
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.670
Megan Zehnder: What work for this one.

452
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:34.840
David: Yeah, you can go back. You can use. So I have a current flow which is the exact

453
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:41.839
David: thing for the events right now, or you can go into the Cms and check it out yourself. Whatever is easiest.

454
00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:48.829
Megan Zehnder: Okay, I think I just wanted to go. Yeah, this one. Okay. So okay, so I have this.

455
00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.130
Megan Zehnder: and I select this

456
00:31:53.720 --> 00:32:01.119
Megan Zehnder: So if I have an event that like this, ratio doesn't work, and I need to get like I need to change my

457
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.339
Megan Zehnder: image. I guess I just go back

458
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.614
Megan Zehnder: and

459
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.490
Megan Zehnder: take a new image, and that's what I would do.

460
00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.470
Megan Zehnder: But

461
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.520
Megan Zehnder: I wonder if there should be

462
00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:27.649
Megan Zehnder: Wonder if there's like any text that would be helpful. That's like

463
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.609
Megan Zehnder: what to do if like this.

464
00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:32.719
Megan Zehnder: If the crop

465
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.239
Megan Zehnder: cropping tool doesn't

466
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.380
Megan Zehnder: is cutting off certain parts of your

467
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:41.210
Megan Zehnder: image.

468
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.170
Megan Zehnder: I don't know. Maybe it's intuitive, though, that you just

469
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:52.819
Megan Zehnder: I think what I would do personally is I would just say, Okay, this is not gonna work.

470
00:32:53.260 --> 00:33:00.110
Megan Zehnder: the image. The source image doesn't work for what I need. So I need to go and figure out something else. I need to get a new one.

471
00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:04.199
David: Yeah. If you go ahead and press back.

472
00:33:05.771 --> 00:33:08.338
David: I'm curious if you

473
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:13.260
David: saw those recommended image size the bullets up top.

474
00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:15.370
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, that is

475
00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:20.500
Megan Zehnder: important to have. But I I would probably

476
00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:22.780
Megan Zehnder: like.

477
00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:28.440
Megan Zehnder: try what I have first.st And I and like, learn through the visual.

478
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:32.140
Megan Zehnder: But

479
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:37.859
Megan Zehnder: yeah, so I don't. I don't know that it necessarily needs to be repeated in here.

480
00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:47.530
Megan Zehnder: yeah. So may actually, yeah, maybe. Then I go back and say, Okay.

481
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:52.970
Megan Zehnder: 1954.

482
00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.140
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

483
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.880
David: So I'm wondering

484
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:06.229
David: in your workflow if you, if you go ahead and press, cancel here.

485
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.950
Megan Zehnder: Okay.

486
00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.180
David: Do you have your you? Do you have your image prepared

487
00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.060
David: before you click.

488
00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:17.820
David: add media, upload image, whatever it is.

489
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:23.280
David: Or are you kind of like clicking it, and then slowly gathering your

490
00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:26.639
David: information, gathering your photos.

491
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.620
Megan Zehnder: Well, I think I

492
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:36.599
Megan Zehnder: ideally, I'd have everything ready. But I think there's it's just harder to know how it's gonna look

493
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:42.499
Megan Zehnder: in production until I can upload it and preview it. So there's just naturally going to be

494
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:46.179
Megan Zehnder: some like readjusting at that phase like.

495
00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:47.129
David: You know.

496
00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:48.170
Megan Zehnder: Even if I

497
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:52.379
Megan Zehnder: have all the images, and they're like all the right size.

498
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:59.670
Megan Zehnder: And I upload it. And I'm like, Oh, actually, like, I have the right size, but, like the main thing that I want is up here.

499
00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.849
Megan Zehnder: So I'm gonna need to like rethink that and

500
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.610
Megan Zehnder: resize it, or something.

501
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.130
David: Got it.

502
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:11.089
Megan Zehnder: I think. I think this like is very helpful that it.

503
00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.459
Megan Zehnder: you know it shows what part is going to be seen.

504
00:35:15.045 --> 00:35:17.170
Megan Zehnder: And it's very clear, like

505
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:20.270
Megan Zehnder: what part is not going to be seen. So

506
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:28.170
Megan Zehnder: it's as like someone using this. It's so much more helpful to to get the preview. And

507
00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.499
Megan Zehnder: see, get a, you know. Get a sense of what's going to be cropped

508
00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.170
Megan Zehnder: at this phase rather than like as you're previewing it.

509
00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.260
Megan Zehnder: Oh.

510
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.980
David: Okay. So you are saving

511
00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:45.589
David: like a little bit of a few clicks by not having to like press preview. You're already getting.

512
00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:46.740
Megan Zehnder: Right.

513
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.170
David: That preview. Okay.

514
00:35:49.170 --> 00:35:49.490
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

515
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:52.800
David: And that, and that's and that's helpful for you, and.

516
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.090
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, I think it's really helpful to see

517
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:59.120
Megan Zehnder: what is gonna get cropped out and what what will be

518
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.180
Megan Zehnder: in the

519
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:02.970
Megan Zehnder: in the post or in the page.

520
00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.780
David: Got it. Got it?

521
00:36:05.243 --> 00:36:13.919
David: Now, if you go ahead and click continue. I have a couple of other questions for you. One thing is.

522
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.829
David: I'm not even sure if you noticed that

523
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.490
David: this version removes description.

524
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.650
David: Field.

525
00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.789
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, that is nice.

526
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.760
David: That is nice. You like that.

527
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.999
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, I think that

528
00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:33.779
Megan Zehnder: that saves some time for me to figure out what I'm supposed, how I'm supposed to differentiate them.

529
00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:36.010
Megan Zehnder: Hi.

530
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.960
Megan Zehnder: one thing.

531
00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.250
Megan Zehnder: 2 like

532
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:43.503
Megan Zehnder: this might be a little bit of an aside, but

533
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:52.390
Megan Zehnder: I noticed in the current iteration, when I remove the image, the Alt text also gets removed.

534
00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.990
Megan Zehnder: and that was a little bit of a frustrating point, because

535
00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:03.620
Megan Zehnder: I had to go back and like I had to recreate it each time. If I didn't remember to save in advance.

536
00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.850
Megan Zehnder: because when I remove the image

537
00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:11.440
Megan Zehnder: like sometimes I just replaced it with a different size and

538
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:15.830
Megan Zehnder: and so like the Alt text.

539
00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.610
Megan Zehnder: you know

540
00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:21.410
Megan Zehnder: I want. I wanted it to remain the same.

541
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.140
David: And just.

542
00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.500
Megan Zehnder: If we deleted it once I press remove

543
00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.345
Megan Zehnder: so

544
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:32.720
Megan Zehnder: I don't know. Maybe like, if these 2 settings could stay like, I understand that

545
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:34.360
Megan Zehnder: the different file name. But

546
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:35.730
Megan Zehnder: that was just

547
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.909
Megan Zehnder: something I remembered.

548
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:39.380
David: Yeah.

549
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:49.980
David: yeah, that's interesting. So you'll you typically will enter in just as I'm like on the same page. You'll enter in your all text your section.

550
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:57.639
David: then. But the ish, I guess the difference is in the current version you're leaving. You're saving. You're committing.

551
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.190
David: Yeah? Then you're gonna go see? The preview.

552
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:12.460
Megan Zehnder: Right then I'm gonna go see the preview. And then I typically like multiple times in that last page I was working on, I would actually remove this, and I would re upload a different image that I had processed differently, and

553
00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:17.279
Megan Zehnder: that I wanted to work with. And then I had to like, re-enter everything again

554
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.599
Megan Zehnder: which was annoying. Right.

555
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:32.059
David: I see. Yeah, now, does this process of like having the image here still like that is being cropped and like kind of giving you a more one to one preview. What you'll be seeing does that support

556
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:37.260
David: like your workflow still? Is that making it any easier.

557
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:40.359
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, I think it's really helpful to see

558
00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:46.310
Megan Zehnder: how it's going to be cropped in this way. Yeah, I think this is helpful.

559
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:47.610
David: Great.

560
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.705
David: great, great, great

561
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:59.100
David: so are there any additional improvements or things you'd like to see in this prototype things that would make

562
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.260
David: your life easier

563
00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:03.900
David: when uploading photos or images.

564
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.409
Megan Zehnder: If this was my main.

565
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.400
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, I think like.

566
00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.690
Megan Zehnder: if if

567
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.189
Megan Zehnder: the content types that are working on only allowed for this

568
00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.839
Megan Zehnder: aspect ratio

569
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.850
Megan Zehnder: Then this would be great, and it would feel easy, and it.

570
00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.719
David: Now let's talk about

571
00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:39.140
David: your step by step. Pages. I know this is just it's kind of different.

572
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:40.300
David: But

573
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:42.720
David: what

574
00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.629
David: would you like to see in this, to make your step by step pages

575
00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.149
David: image uploading a little bit easier.

576
00:39:55.790 --> 00:40:02.140
Megan Zehnder: So I think a couple of things also, before I answer, Can I can. I just ask one more thing that I noticed?

577
00:40:02.613 --> 00:40:06.319
Megan Zehnder: So this one out of one image uploaded?

578
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.120
Megan Zehnder: I don't totally know.

579
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:15.169
Megan Zehnder: Like, was there a spot where I could add more than one

580
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.080
Megan Zehnder: you're like? I guess I'm confused by seeing that text

581
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.450
Megan Zehnder: like what it

582
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.399
Megan Zehnder: what it means, cause I I didn't see anywhere in the flow

583
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:26.319
Megan Zehnder: place to add more than one.

584
00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:33.699
David: Yeah, for event images. They require only one image. You can't put 2

585
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.889
David: or anything like that. Other pages might.

586
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.169
David: I think, have

587
00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:46.850
David: several options in a single upload. But what what do you? What do you think?

588
00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:49.609
David: Tell me more about why you're bringing this up? Yeah.

589
00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:53.380
Megan Zehnder: I would just expect to see image uploaded. Checkmark.

590
00:40:53.830 --> 00:40:54.340
Megan Zehnder: Oh.

591
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.060
David: Okay.

592
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.013
Megan Zehnder: I wouldn't.

593
00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.900
Megan Zehnder: I think the one out of one

594
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.620
Megan Zehnder: just

595
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.320
Megan Zehnder: makes me confused about like if there is another

596
00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.670
Megan Zehnder: place to add one or or

597
00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:11.309
Megan Zehnder: like. Why it's

598
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.950
Megan Zehnder: but again, I'm not the

599
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.970
Megan Zehnder: maybe maybe for someone. It is meaningful because they don't know if they're supposed to add one or not.

600
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:23.870
Megan Zehnder: One

601
00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.389
Megan Zehnder: so I don't know how.

602
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.469
David: You don't know how that one of one yeah, where it's.

603
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:31.220
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

604
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:32.510
Megan Zehnder: yeah, right.

605
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:34.560
David: Okay.

606
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.969
Megan Zehnder: For someone else. It would make more sense. But.

607
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:45.010
David: So I'm curious now, like, if you had a magic wand right, you can wave it around and make yourself

608
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.550
David: the perfect

609
00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:48.510
David: image uploader.

610
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.709
David: not for events, but for the work that you're working on.

611
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:52.380
Megan Zehnder: Yeah.

612
00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.240
David: What might you

613
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.620
David: do?

614
00:41:58.770 --> 00:41:59.755
Megan Zehnder: So.

615
00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:04.069
Megan Zehnder: I mean the one I think one minor thing is just

616
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:05.690
Megan Zehnder: not deleting that

617
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:11.580
Megan Zehnder: alternate text. When I remove an image going back into

618
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.529
Megan Zehnder: like the same settings and a

619
00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:18.619
Megan Zehnder: the media library. That's just a minor one.

620
00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.530
Megan Zehnder: I

621
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:26.739
Megan Zehnder: go to the current flow.

622
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.180
Megan Zehnder: So is this.

623
00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.250
Megan Zehnder: this is like.

624
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.919
Megan Zehnder: okay, yeah. This one.

625
00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:18.279
Megan Zehnder: I feel like being able to

626
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:31.410
Megan Zehnder: like. If if I could see the full size, see? I don't. I don't know exactly what what would have made it easier in my.

627
00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.018
Megan Zehnder: The page that I was working on

628
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.959
Megan Zehnder: like what I was looking for is some kind of like visual

629
00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:46.249
Megan Zehnder: drag or drop like I guess I probably didn't go far enough in these

630
00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.210
Megan Zehnder: or like resizing.

631
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:55.010
Megan Zehnder: But what I what was helpful for me in canva

632
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:58.507
Megan Zehnder: in the end was being able to.

633
00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.259
Megan Zehnder: Oh, this is, we're almost done in 2 min.

634
00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:11.210
Megan Zehnder: being able.

635
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.160
David: So I'm.

636
00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:12.940
Megan Zehnder: Okay. Yeah.

637
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.873
David: Yeah, I'm okay. I'm here.

638
00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:16.920
Megan Zehnder: Okay, cool and

639
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.940
Megan Zehnder: no, I'm rambling a bit.

640
00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:28.930
Megan Zehnder: but I just wanted to like pull up what was useful for me in canva. And then.

641
00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:31.529
David: Yeah, no, that'd be great to see.

642
00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:32.200
Megan Zehnder: Okay.

643
00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:37.920
Megan Zehnder: New.

644
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.749
Megan Zehnder: You can see my canva.

645
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:42.130
David: Yes, I can.

646
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:42.940
Megan Zehnder: Okay.

647
00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:48.692
Megan Zehnder: all these pages that I was trying to work on.

648
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:54.150
Megan Zehnder: okay.

649
00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:56.150
Megan Zehnder: So

650
00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:04.129
Megan Zehnder: what I ended up doing was like looking at these inches and pixels, which.

651
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:13.299
Megan Zehnder: like maybe it would be helpful when I uploaded it. If if

652
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:16.140
Megan Zehnder: drupal would tell me like

653
00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:23.130
Megan Zehnder: what the size is and what the what the width is like, either in pixels or inches, or something, so that I can.

654
00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.200
Megan Zehnder: if I can.

655
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:28.590
Megan Zehnder: adjust it

656
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:44.079
Megan Zehnder: in drupal, and I can like see the numbers. Then I can see like, Oh, that is, that number is off like, if I if I saw when I uploaded it like, okay, this is 500 pixels by 1,800, and then the other. The next time I I

657
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:50.670
Megan Zehnder: upload another one it was like 1,800 pixels by 600. Then I could like tell that

658
00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:55.109
Megan Zehnder: some things are off off because one is 501 is 1,800.

659
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.890
Megan Zehnder: So if I had some kind of like

660
00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:59.850
Megan Zehnder: visual cue

661
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:00.980
Megan Zehnder: of

662
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:04.006
Megan Zehnder: the size that was uploading.

663
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:07.840
Megan Zehnder: I think it would be really helpful. And then.

664
00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:09.760
Megan Zehnder: if there was a way

665
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:16.410
Megan Zehnder: to like, adjust it in there and just say, Okay, crop this down. And even if it scales it so it's not like

666
00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:20.559
Megan Zehnder: cutting it off, but then scaling it to.

667
00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:27.080
Megan Zehnder: it's like, no, I actually don't want this to be 2.7. I want I want to be 5 or whatever, and then upload that

668
00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:34.260
Megan Zehnder: that would be really helpful. I you know that that and that's magic. Wand Ish, because

669
00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.800
Megan Zehnder: I know that's like a lot, and we're not a

670
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.706
Megan Zehnder: image editing tool. But

671
00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:53.900
Megan Zehnder: I just felt like I was uploading these, and I had no sense of like how I could even adjust it to to create a consistent like

672
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.850
Megan Zehnder: pixel width size.

673
00:46:57.340 --> 00:46:58.350
Megan Zehnder: So

674
00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.600
Megan Zehnder: anyway, that's what was, that's what was frustrating. But

675
00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.910
Megan Zehnder: it. I eventually

676
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:06.870
Megan Zehnder: figured it out.

677
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:12.609
David: Thank you so much for sharing the canva. I think that's a really helpful

678
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:15.889
David: representation of how you're going through the flow currently and

679
00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.210
David: well, definitely

680
00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.690
David: talk about ways to, you know.

681
00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:24.770
David: bridge that gap a little bit more. We do have a couple of questions from the group.

682
00:47:25.432 --> 00:47:44.820
David: I'll read them out. But yeah, if any of the observers want to like, add, or or clarify anything, feel free to jump in christian asks in your current flow. Are you viewing the node to preview the image as opposed to reviewing the image only in the uploader model model

683
00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:45.860
David: modal.

684
00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.380
Megan Zehnder: Yes. So when I look at the

685
00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.020
Megan Zehnder: the

686
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:55.170
Megan Zehnder: node, I'm doing the standard Cms preview, so that I see all of them

687
00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.980
Megan Zehnder: once they're added.

688
00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.840
Megan Zehnder: is that what you mean?

689
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.080
Megan Zehnder: Okay.

690
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.810
Christian Burk (Omaha, Nebr.): Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Thank you. Appreciate it.

691
00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.800
Megan Zehnder: Yeah, definitely use the preview heavily.

692
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:12.599
David: Perfect and then we have another question from Megan in your current flow.

693
00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:20.199
David: Did you upload images all at once in the media library? Or do you go one by one, as you go through each step.

694
00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:28.209
Megan Zehnder: In this last instance I was.

695
00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:35.479
Megan Zehnder: I did a little bit of both. I started adding them all at once, and then, when I realized

696
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.709
Megan Zehnder: this was not consistent.

697
00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.550
Megan Zehnder: I kind of paused on that approach

698
00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.189
Megan Zehnder: finish, getting all the content that I needed ready. And then

699
00:48:45.935 --> 00:48:51.279
Megan Zehnder: and then just tried to figure out the image issue separately.

700
00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.259
Megan Commons: Yeah. Cause I'm even thinking if you were going one by one like

701
00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:04.109
Megan Commons: uploading them all at once would be even more work. Because then again, okay, let's re upload everything. Now that we got that. And that would, okay, okay.

702
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.059
Megan Zehnder: It was a lot of that.

703
00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:06.800
Megan Commons: I believe it.

704
00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:11.069
Megan Zehnder: I was not efficient, because I was just struggling a lot with the

705
00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:16.234
Megan Zehnder: with my, you know, design ignorance. But it was

706
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:24.309
Megan Zehnder: yeah, I think like after I realized it was not being consistent. Then I tried to just shift my attention

707
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.560
Megan Zehnder: at the end.

708
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:26.800
Megan Commons: Okay.

709
00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.919
Megan Commons: yeah. Did you ever

710
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:38.479
Megan Commons: cause you, you talked about how you go back to the media library to edit things.

711
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.740
Megan Commons: So we're you like back and forth a lot between. Okay media library to edit.

712
00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:49.280
Megan Commons: re upload media library to edit, re upload, like, I guess how. What was

713
00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.210
Megan Commons: kind of the.

714
00:49:51.740 --> 00:50:02.089
Megan Zehnder: Well, okay. So there were 2 editors, so like the 1st editor who added images added them, and they were like all over the place. So then I tried to. I went back

715
00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:14.189
Megan Zehnder: and into the media library and tried to adjust it from there, but I was only adjusting the inches, and it didn't. And I was like, I'm I'm

716
00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:19.630
Megan Zehnder: I kept thinking I was like uploading the same image, but it was like a totally different pixel size.

717
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:20.429
Megan Commons: Yeah, yeah.

718
00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:26.239
Megan Zehnder: I don't know what really speak to that part, but so anyway, that at that

719
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:29.990
Megan Zehnder: point I was going back and forth a lot to try and troubleshoot.

720
00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.219
Megan Zehnder: And then

721
00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:40.029
Megan Zehnder: toward the end, once I figured it out, I just was going back in and re uploading for all of them to try and get them consistent.

722
00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:41.700
Megan Commons: Okay. Cool.

723
00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:44.469
Megan Zehnder: Makes sense. Yeah.

724
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.170
David: Yeah. I'm

725
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:52.259
David: have a couple like 1. 1 more question. If that's okay, are you? Okay on time? Okay?

726
00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.330
Megan Zehnder: Yeah. Totally. Yeah.

727
00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:02.530
David: are there? And then this is this is a question. Beyond, just like events and uploading images.

728
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:06.960
David: Is there anything else within the drupal cms that you'd like

729
00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:10.040
David: to be.

730
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:24.030
David: that that might be like more difficult than it should be, or might cause more frustration that we can keep in our backlog and our list of like. Oh, these are things that we could eventually get to, to make your lives easier as a editors.

731
00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:26.780
Megan Zehnder: Checking links is

732
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:27.970
Megan Zehnder: portable.

733
00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:29.950
David: Gaining, link.

734
00:51:30.816 --> 00:51:31.683
Megan Zehnder: Yes.

735
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:34.360
Megan Zehnder: there's like.

736
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:43.910
Megan Zehnder: I don't know right now. We have these link sees that are making up the flow really hard to check links

737
00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:46.979
Megan Zehnder: in preview mode

738
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:52.820
Megan Zehnder: links don't really work. So then you have to look at it in view mode in the drupal.

739
00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:54.800
Megan Zehnder: and

740
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:57.339
Megan Zehnder: and it's just

741
00:51:58.140 --> 00:51:59.670
Megan Zehnder: harder than it should be.

742
00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:02.180
David: Anything else.

743
00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:15.359
Megan Zehnder: I am sure. Can I? Can I follow up on that.

744
00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:19.200
David: Yeah, like, if there's anything else that comes up, love to

745
00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:28.702
David: hear it. Yeah, we're we're kind of compiling a little bit of a list here, too, like after this, what? What else we could eventually hit. So

746
00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.210
David: yeah, that's.

747
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:30.810
Megan Zehnder: Oh!

748
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:31.910
David: Great.

749
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:35.026
Megan Zehnder: Thanks for letting me share all this. It's really nice to

750
00:52:36.087 --> 00:52:38.119
Megan Zehnder: to like. Explain.

751
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.380
Megan Zehnder: I don't know. Just talk about it, cause it was a

752
00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:47.469
Megan Zehnder: I. I'm so glad that I used the tool and like, and finally got it. That was really

753
00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:51.320
Megan Zehnder: satisfying. But it yeah, and I don't know if any of the

754
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:55.050
Megan Zehnder: problems I went into were helpful at all. But it was helpful for me.

755
00:52:55.050 --> 00:53:03.539
David: Incredibly helpful. Really, really like, appreciate your time, appreciate your thoughtful answers. And yeah, thanks again.
