1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.960
David: Wow.

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:13.500
David: and yeah, after we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. And knowing that, are you again comfortable if I record the screen and audio.

3
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:14.320
Lauren Bolanos: Sure.

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.050
David: Great great.

5
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.160
David: So I've started recording and we can just jump into it.

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.919
David: So could you tell me a little bit more about your role at Va, and how often you're using Cms

7
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.620
David: upload.

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.570
Lauren Bolanos: Every day a public affairs specialist, and I'm on the lead on the web.

9
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.280
David: Okay? And for public affair. What? What kind of like content types are you typically creating on a daily.

10
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:54.189
Lauren Bolanos: So events, stories, news releases updating the health services and then the outdated content and the detail pages.

11
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.101
David: Okay, okay, great. And

12
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:10.859
David: let's talk about event images, because I think that's going to be one of our most relevant ones for today. Can you describe, like your typical workflow and working with an uploading, an image.

13
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:30.779
Lauren Bolanos: Sure. So for the events. I actually, because we are so busy and we have so many events, I actually don't include images. In my workflow. Because we post the flyers to our social media sites. We have Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube.

14
00:01:31.368 --> 00:01:33.641
Lauren Bolanos: We don't post

15
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.769
Lauren Bolanos: the flyers to Youtube, unless obviously, there's some sort of

16
00:01:39.730 --> 00:02:00.269
Lauren Bolanos: special video promotion. But I because they're they are also posted to our sharepoint which is for internal audiences, obviously for there to share externally. So I just for a quicker workflow. Since we have so many events to post, we don't include photos.

17
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.962
David: Oh, okay. Gotcha

18
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.118
David: Then, maybe what about stories?

19
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.545
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, so we do post a lot of stories. It's a priority.

20
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.927
Lauren Bolanos: it was a priority from my supervisor.

21
00:02:18.226 --> 00:02:18.823
Lauren Bolanos: and

22
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.260
Lauren Bolanos: we, we edit them down to the normal size. Honestly, I'm

23
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:36.868
Lauren Bolanos: it's hard enough to just get one image sometimes from people when we're doing this story? so I

24
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.380
Lauren Bolanos: I'm I'm okay with the one image.

25
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.430
David: Okay.

26
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.841
Lauren Bolanos: but and then I edit it crop it for my coworkers, who are

27
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.847
Lauren Bolanos: I maybe need help getting it to the dimensions. But

28
00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.720
David: And what what software do you use for that.

29
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.820
Lauren Bolanos: I use Photoshop.

30
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.950
David: Photoshop.

31
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:14.123
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. Yeah. So I use Photoshop, and I crop it to the dimensions. If and I'll retouch it for them. I have a photography background, if it's like a little dark or something. But

32
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:23.891
Lauren Bolanos: yeah, yeah. And I haven't really had trouble, like, I make sure to crop wide enough, or shoot wide enough that we really haven't had an issue.

33
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.777
Lauren Bolanos: too much with like the dimensions.

34
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.550
Lauren Bolanos: and

35
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.798
Lauren Bolanos: I know, like talking to my team, and we also have concourse who submit stories which is

36
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.159
Lauren Bolanos: contracted communications for our master plan.

37
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.296
Lauren Bolanos: it can be hard just to even get one photo

38
00:03:46.897 --> 00:03:58.039
Lauren Bolanos: for this story. Yeah, cause we do consent forms, we make sure everyone, you know, we. And then sometimes we're asking from photos from the people we interview. And so we're like, you know.

39
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.179
Lauren Bolanos: we're not necessarily getting. We're just.

40
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.010
Lauren Bolanos: We're not necessarily always taking them. Sometimes we're just asking for them.

41
00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.839
Lauren Bolanos: And it can be a challenge.

42
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.640
David: Hold on!

43
00:04:08.745 --> 00:04:09.380
Lauren Bolanos: Sure.

44
00:04:09.676 --> 00:04:12.339
David: No! That makes so much sense. And I'm curious.

45
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:21.239
David: Do you ever use? Are you using the media library when you go through uploading? Or do you kind of just upload the image

46
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.660
David: new every time like a new image every time.

47
00:04:24.922 --> 00:04:27.807
Lauren Bolanos: No, we upload a new image every time for each story.

48
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.730
David: Guy.

49
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.200
Lauren Bolanos: And

50
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.629
Lauren Bolanos: like, I said, if there's like a chat I can drop our

51
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.534
Lauren Bolanos: or link in the chat if you'd like

52
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.120
David: Yeah, so.

53
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.850
Lauren Bolanos: Balls.

54
00:04:40.850 --> 00:05:01.299
David: The next part of what we're working on is I'm I'm I'd like for you to open your Cms. And kind of just share it with me. And we can kind of imagine that you're creating a story page. I'd love to just kind of see your workflow throughout like uploading an image. There.

55
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.400
Lauren Bolanos: Okay, let me.

56
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.720
Lauren Bolanos: Can you see my screen.

57
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.570
David: I can. Yeah.

58
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.219
Lauren Bolanos: Okay, let me log on

59
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.760
Lauren Bolanos: to

60
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.690
Lauren Bolanos: Cms.

61
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.340
David: Great, and I can like pause recording, or something.

62
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.830
Lauren Bolanos: No, no, you're fine, is it? Sharing? My the stories page.

63
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:23.990
David: I see stories. Yeah.

64
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.303
Lauren Bolanos: Okay? Good.

65
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.799
Lauren Bolanos: Then

66
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.700
Lauren Bolanos: here we go.

67
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.560
Lauren Bolanos: So yeah, when it comes to images. I mean, I'm

68
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:44.349
Lauren Bolanos: pretty happy. But I do know that like I have

69
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.858
Lauren Bolanos: had to just like

70
00:05:50.587 --> 00:05:52.139
Lauren Bolanos: Let's see. Pump.

71
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.010
Lauren Bolanos: Well, let me pull up, you guys.

72
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.880
Lauren Bolanos: I see you.

73
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.270
Lauren Bolanos: Okay.

74
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.830
Lauren Bolanos: Sorry. I'm just trying to get back to the Zoom Meeting.

75
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.430
David: Oh, no, no! Take your time.

76
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.696
Lauren Bolanos: There we go. There. You are okay.

77
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.670
Lauren Bolanos: okay. So you can see that my screen with the drupal. Yep.

78
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.980
David: I can see that that's great.

79
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.169
Lauren Bolanos: Okay?

80
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:31.889
Lauren Bolanos: so yeah, I I guess, like, like, I said, like the feature that I would like is, you know how in stories you have this like nice caption.

81
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.720
David: Yeah.

82
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:42.500
Lauren Bolanos: Formatting. I noticed we don't have that in detail pages. So that's like, really my biggest feedback is that I've had to kind of

83
00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:51.864
Lauren Bolanos: kind of make it up in Photoshop, but like it's not the easiest to get consistent fonts.

84
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.729
David: Oh, okay, so.

85
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.119
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, so.

86
00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.640
David: Like if I would.

87
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.029
David: Oh, go ahead. Yeah, please.

88
00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.698
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, let me show you example. So you can see like I did for our history.

89
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.100
Lauren Bolanos: like, I kind of had to. This is part of the image.

90
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.010
Lauren Bolanos: add in.

91
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.420
David: Ireland.

92
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:15.649
Lauren Bolanos: Caption because it didn't have an option to caption an image in a detail page.

93
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:22.740
David: What you're so what you did is you went in Photoshop, and you kind of put like a white bar there, and then you put in there.

94
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.570
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah.

95
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:24.580
David: I see.

96
00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.140
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. So that's like, I said, this is

97
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:33.595
Lauren Bolanos: just, and it works. I got it to work, and it looks pretty consistent.

98
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.299
Lauren Bolanos: but

99
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:43.130
Lauren Bolanos: And then obviously, I would like it to be, even with whatever size image it is. This was.

100
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.450
David: Right.

101
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:49.529
Lauren Bolanos: Small image. Same with this one like it would be weird if the text went over here.

102
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:50.670
David: Right.

103
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:51.270
Lauren Bolanos: I.

104
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.510
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. So that's that's really like my

105
00:07:56.089 --> 00:08:00.559
Lauren Bolanos: I guess. And it's just. And like, I said, there's a workaround. So it's not like.

106
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.030
Lauren Bolanos: It's not

107
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.129
Lauren Bolanos: the worst thing.

108
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.990
David: Anyone.

109
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.900
Lauren Bolanos: But a shop.

110
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:19.259
David: I. I'm curious. How do you and I? It sounds like you have a photo background photography background. But like, kind of keep the consistency with those images as you're uploading them to width.

111
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:30.420
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, it's been that was tough. But I I keep like all of them, open and copy and paste, basically. And then retype.

112
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.440
David: Okay, yeah, yeah, so yeah.

113
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:41.350
Lauren Bolanos: It I? And then I think, like I said, these might be smaller compared to I think the master plan ones.

114
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:49.500
Lauren Bolanos: like this is a little bit bigger, I believe, but it's on a different page. So this is like, not

115
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.630
Lauren Bolanos: I don't. This is a little bit less consistent.

116
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.030
Lauren Bolanos: That's for the

117
00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:02.569
Lauren Bolanos: like, I said, this is for the master plan, so, like our concourse, people requested edits.

118
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.300
David: I see.

119
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:11.539
David: Okay, great. So now, the next part I'd love to kind of

120
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:16.539
David: see is if you could show me something like a story that you're like

121
00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:25.776
David: we could like, start a new story, and then just kind of walk me through how you're doing that, unless there's a story that you already have open.

122
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.659
David: whatever is easiest for you.

123
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.639
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, no, I can start a new one if you want

124
00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:31.890
David: Okay.

125
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:36.040
Lauren Bolanos: So here's a new one. V. Greater Los Angeles.

126
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.020
Lauren Bolanos: So it would be just the title.

127
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.879
Lauren Bolanos: It would be my name.

128
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:51.580
Lauren Bolanos: I listed here for a sentence. This would be like test is a sentence.

129
00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.260
Lauren Bolanos: It's not spelled right.

130
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.150
Lauren Bolanos: So I'll just leave it at test.

131
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.640
David: They're there!

132
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:05.331
Lauren Bolanos: And then same thing here. We copy and paste it in, and then obviously, we have to double and check

133
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.269
David: Yeah. And then this is the bit I'm really interested in this whole image section. So yeah.

134
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.790
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, so we just

135
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.779
Lauren Bolanos: open it up.

136
00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.310
Lauren Bolanos: And

137
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.340
Lauren Bolanos: so I have this photo that I've resized for my next story.

138
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.780
Lauren Bolanos: you guys gave us a nice large word, Count, which I'm very appreciative of.

139
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.720
Lauren Bolanos: I always end up like

140
00:10:45.791 --> 00:10:47.719
Lauren Bolanos: oh, for the caption!

141
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:53.729
Lauren Bolanos: I always end up

142
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.380
Lauren Bolanos: needing more word count

143
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.966
Lauren Bolanos: for things.

144
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.157
David: So just a couple of things as we like before we keep going.

145
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.330
David: I so you copied that like long caption, were you?

146
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.960
David: Where were, where would you paste that normally.

147
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:14.393
Lauren Bolanos: So I normally paste that on the other

148
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:26.760
Lauren Bolanos: like. Sometimes I'll do it under alternative text. But there's a smaller one, so I'll just probably do like PC, MHI group photo

149
00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:33.609
Lauren Bolanos: and then the caption is usually something same thing with this description. PC.

150
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.710
Lauren Bolanos: Image. I group photo, and then, after I upload it.

151
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.760
Lauren Bolanos: original.

152
00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.539
Lauren Bolanos: and then reusable.

153
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:53.420
Lauren Bolanos: see an insert. Here's the caption, and then I just paste it in there, and you guys gave us a really nice long

154
00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.770
Lauren Bolanos: oh, I appreciate the word, Count, thank you. And then.

155
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:07.099
David: So if we go back up, yeah, just kind of the to this image, uploading a couple of questions here. So

156
00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.880
David: overall.

157
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.540
David: are there any parts of this process, or like the step through that.

158
00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.090
David: seem difficult or confusing.

159
00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.069
Lauren Bolanos: Not to me, I mean, but I

160
00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:29.139
Lauren Bolanos: maybe my team no, even my team, as able to who my teammate, who isn't as tech savvy

161
00:12:30.164 --> 00:12:32.499
Lauren Bolanos: post photos after I

162
00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.179
Lauren Bolanos: train them. So.

163
00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:35.435
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah,

164
00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:39.440
David: Do you ever get images that aren't

165
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:41.400
David: in the correct

166
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:47.729
David: format like ratio size or things like that? So you're having to edit them.

167
00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:59.277
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. So about usually just from my team, my coworker, who isn't as doesn't have the photography background that I do. I'll just he'll have me crop a photo

168
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:00.240
David: Conference, room.

169
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:08.188
Lauren Bolanos: But our concourse people know the dimensions, so they send it to us, ready to post without any need for cropping

170
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.829
Lauren Bolanos: And then I obviously crop my own, and then if

171
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:16.890
Lauren Bolanos: my team wants any help with cropping, then I'll do it for them.

172
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:27.960
David: Gotcha gotcha. Okay? And again. Another thing you mentioned. Well, you kind of went through it. Save an insert and save and select.

173
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.300
David: What's the difference between those 2.

174
00:13:31.589 --> 00:13:32.880
Lauren Bolanos: I know saving

175
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.220
Lauren Bolanos: insert is the one

176
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:41.327
Lauren Bolanos: that you use. And then I just I cause I've I've used both, obviously, and one works, and one doesn't.

177
00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:42.330
David: One works, one.

178
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:42.770
Lauren Bolanos: That.

179
00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:43.190
David: Okay.

180
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.450
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah.

181
00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:46.970
David: Okay?

182
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:47.735
David: And

183
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.299
David: I guess. Yeah, overall. How is that

184
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.850
David: an experience for you of uploading that image.

185
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.710
Lauren Bolanos: It was easy.

186
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.650
David: Easy.

187
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.720
David: Okay.

188
00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.635
David: great.

189
00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:06.349
David: Then let's move along to our next part of this session. Which is

190
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:09.289
David: going. I'm going to go ahead and send you a prototype.

191
00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.639
David: and I'll just get you the link here.

192
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.860
David: and I'm sharing it on zoom chat. So.

193
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:22.750
Lauren Bolanos: I'm not going to save this.

194
00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.829
Lauren Bolanos: If we are, we done with this one.

195
00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.959
David: We're done with this one. Yes, you don't need that.

196
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.110
Lauren Bolanos: Do you want me to stop sharing or to keep it open? If you know.

197
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.410
Lauren Bolanos: Anything else.

198
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:36.010
David: Yeah, if you could keep it open for the second part. That would be great, too.

199
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.760
David: And yep, I just sent the link

200
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.979
David: to zoom chat, so if you open it, it should just

201
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.970
Lauren Bolanos: Okay.

202
00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.550
Lauren Bolanos: Okay.

203
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.750
Lauren Bolanos: Here's, oh.

204
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.430
Lauren Bolanos: okay.

205
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.470
David: Great thanks.

206
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.109
Lauren Bolanos: I see the create event.

207
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:05.444
David: Perfect

208
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.660
David: and then, if you could go to the left side and click proposed flow.

209
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.860
Lauren Bolanos: Okay.

210
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:27.222
David: And yeah. So this isn't exactly stories, but you can kind of see like the that module is pretty similar to how you'd see it on stories. I know you said you don't often upload images, but for this kind of

211
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:29.270
David: conversation begin.

212
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.660
David: go into that. So

213
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:32.915
David: I like to.

214
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:40.189
David: Have you imagined that you're start? You've started to create a new event for veterans. You've entered the date

215
00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:47.480
David: which Va. Location it will be listed in already. So that's Bronx health. And now it's time to upload an image.

216
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.410
Lauren Bolanos: Okay.

217
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:50.189
David: Please show me how you would do that.

218
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.220
Lauren Bolanos: So do you want me to go back in here and do an event.

219
00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.910
David: using the prototype.

220
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.280
Lauren Bolanos: The prototype. Okay.

221
00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.690
Lauren Bolanos: so

222
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.290
Lauren Bolanos: let me just go

223
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.580
Lauren Bolanos: upload image.

224
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.370
David: Oh, yeah, there's only one.

225
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.610
Lauren Bolanos: and then

226
00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.160
Lauren Bolanos: continue

227
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.869
Lauren Bolanos: and alternative, text.

228
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.820
Lauren Bolanos: yeah, save and upload.

229
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:37.060
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, I mean, it's straightforward. The problem is like, I, we have like so many fires, and

230
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:45.780
Lauren Bolanos: Gla is very analog. And so everything's like 8 and a half by 11 for flyers.

231
00:16:46.224 --> 00:16:52.135
Lauren Bolanos: Because everyone wants things printed. And we're trying to like push more digital stuff. But

232
00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:58.239
Lauren Bolanos: because of my photography background. It's like a pet peeve of mine. I just don't like

233
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:02.039
Lauren Bolanos: things. Get auto cropped

234
00:17:02.548 --> 00:17:08.049
Lauren Bolanos: if that makes sense, especially like an Instagram like. So we

235
00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.310
Lauren Bolanos: we like.

236
00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:18.199
Lauren Bolanos: I don't know. It's almost we. Just. We just put the information from the flyer just directly into the event description.

237
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:31.180
Lauren Bolanos: And then also there's the whole 5 0 8 compliance thing. So like, I know, like it's easier for screen readers to like, read the event description because they can't really

238
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.609
Lauren Bolanos: read a jpeg, unless, like.

239
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:37.920
Lauren Bolanos: it's just like

240
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.140
Lauren Bolanos: a short alternate text.

241
00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:44.369
Lauren Bolanos: And then there's the whole 5 0 8 compliance.

242
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:50.459
Lauren Bolanos: if it's to attach a Pdf. Which I don't think there's even an option for that.

243
00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:57.680
Lauren Bolanos: Not that. And I would don't want there to be, because then I would have to make those flyers that.

244
00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.100
David: Again.

245
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.246
Lauren Bolanos: And we get so many a day. 5 0 8 compliant

246
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.640
Lauren Bolanos: And that would be a huge burden.

247
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:09.080
David: Yeah, kind of separating

248
00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.120
David: this

249
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.690
David: from events

250
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:16.559
David: and kind of imagining the similar workflow for your story. Uploading image.

251
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.660
David: Does that change?

252
00:18:19.026 --> 00:18:23.779
David: Anything like just like that process of uploading an image and and filling out the.

253
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:36.300
Lauren Bolanos: No, I mean, it's it's a form. It's just easy to do both whether it's an event or story. It's just a personal preference for us to speed up our workflow, not to include an image on the events.

254
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.350
David: 5.

255
00:18:37.922 --> 00:18:54.510
Lauren Bolanos: And then also I could reformat things, or maybe crop things easily, but it might be harder for my coworkers to not crop through some words or something.

256
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.390
David: Got it, got it.

257
00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:03.320
David: So a couple questions. So one is, do you know, if stories has a requirement

258
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.479
David: for like ratio size, ratio.

259
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.670
Lauren Bolanos: Yes, it's

260
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.109
Lauren Bolanos: this. It's like 5, 10 by

261
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:18.270
Lauren Bolanos: something. It's in our leaf system. Wait one second.

262
00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.670
David: Oh, okay.

263
00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:21.490
Lauren Bolanos: I can pull it up.

264
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:29.720
Lauren Bolanos: So when people submit, we have the dimensions.

265
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.570
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, the stories are 1024, by 5, 12.

266
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.847
David: Okay, so that's like a 2 to one ratio.

267
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:41.449
David: okay? So yeah, I'm curious

268
00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:49.830
David: when and I don't. Maybe we can go to the figma file and go to the current. Flow on the left, just to kind of

269
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.079
David: refresh on if you click, add media

270
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.580
David: here

271
00:19:56.432 --> 00:19:59.670
David: select file and then pick an image.

272
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:06.059
David: So yeah, there's this crop image kind of accordion menu

273
00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.580
David: that shows up for event images for stories.

274
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:18.319
David: What about like? So if we're doing a story right now, what would happen if you did? A 3 by 2

275
00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.950
David: or a 7 by 2.

276
00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:22.920
Lauren Bolanos: Honestly.

277
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:29.759
Lauren Bolanos: I don't know. I always choose the original at those dimensions. I guess that's how I was

278
00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:38.740
Lauren Bolanos: trained. But for the person before me. I thought that, like those were the dimensions for stories.

279
00:20:39.138 --> 00:20:41.110
Lauren Bolanos: So I'm not really sure what

280
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:47.609
Lauren Bolanos: I always pick original and make sure it's the dimensions those dimensions.

281
00:20:48.202 --> 00:20:51.099
Lauren Bolanos: I haven't played around with any of this stuff.

282
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.830
David: Got it.

283
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:53.870
David: Okay?

284
00:20:54.140 --> 00:21:06.630
David: And another question I have for you is one thing that is no longer in the proposed prototype is. Description has been taken out. Did you notice that.

285
00:21:09.105 --> 00:21:10.330
Lauren Bolanos: For?

286
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.179
Lauren Bolanos: Not really.

287
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.865
Lauren Bolanos: So, just so, yeah, I

288
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.639
Lauren Bolanos: to me description, and like all text kind of

289
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:29.980
Lauren Bolanos: are like, I put the same thing in both most of the time. So and it is nice to have it like a.

290
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:35.680
Lauren Bolanos: So it in the is it just going to show the file name instead of the description.

291
00:21:37.712 --> 00:21:42.080
David: Where? Where are you? Where? Where does it show the file? Name on.

292
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.190
Lauren Bolanos: So I know, like

293
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:51.862
Lauren Bolanos: we have, like under construction projects, a million things. I'm like scared to open this up for you guys. But

294
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.290
Lauren Bolanos: so like

295
00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.140
Lauren Bolanos: embedded image.

296
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:18.600
Lauren Bolanos: So now the description is here. Is it just going to be like the file name instead.

297
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.600
David: What do you think it should be.

298
00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.279
Lauren Bolanos: the file name is probably fine. I mean, I put the.

299
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:37.929
Lauren Bolanos: this is, okay. Okay, so this is the file name. Now.

300
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.759
Lauren Bolanos: that was, that's interesting.

301
00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.190
Lauren Bolanos: Okay?

302
00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:50.509
Lauren Bolanos: yeah. I mean, if the file name is like has a descriptive file name.

303
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:55.820
Lauren Bolanos: it's just the difference. If there's Dot Png or dot Jpeg at the end of the

304
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.480
Lauren Bolanos: so it

305
00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:00.209
Lauren Bolanos: either way.

306
00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.039
David: Other way. But having is, is having that

307
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.390
David: description or title

308
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:07.920
David: useful for you.

309
00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:18.690
Lauren Bolanos: It can be. Yeah, actually, but I mean, if you have this file name, if you have a descriptive file name.

310
00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:24.760
Lauren Bolanos: or if you have the file name like map one like versus like

311
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:29.367
Lauren Bolanos: construction, advisory sections of Vandergriff. Ave

312
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:37.930
Lauren Bolanos: It can be helpful just to like match the construction advisory with the map

313
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.029
Lauren Bolanos: when I'm removing outdated content.

314
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:43.270
David: I see. Okay.

315
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:48.240
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. But like I said, I copy and paste the title

316
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:51.450
Lauren Bolanos: of the advisory into the

317
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:54.920
Lauren Bolanos: name of the file.

318
00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:09.510
Lauren Bolanos: So, and then I also do the same thing. I put it in the the description, and then I just delete the dot jpeg or dot png from the description. So either way, I make sure it's

319
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.189
Lauren Bolanos: this person's description. I don't know who did. This is not me.

320
00:24:17.562 --> 00:24:24.420
Lauren Bolanos: If you are removing description, then I have to tell my team. Make sure you're the file. Name of the

321
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.700
Lauren Bolanos: image

322
00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:29.650
Lauren Bolanos: is the same as the advisory title.

323
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:32.420
David: Do you so, just to

324
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.659
David: clarify? You will also, though.

325
00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:36.920
David: take that

326
00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:41.390
David: file or that like description, and put that as the alt text.

327
00:24:43.203 --> 00:24:45.770
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, if there's enough room.

328
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.999
David: Because one thing we are.

329
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:51.289
David: we are still requiring alt text always.

330
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.580
David: What if the Alt text throw it up there.

331
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:58.440
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. So I like, I said, I copy and paste this

332
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:06.900
Lauren Bolanos: title into the title, the description and the alt text. Only I just remove the

333
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:21.819
Lauren Bolanos: file name@theendthe.png or dot jpeg, so I put it like everywhere I can, so it's easier to remove outdated content and like, know? Like, if I, you know, removed this one right here.

334
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:27.360
Lauren Bolanos: then it's the same. You know, it goes with this one, basically

335
00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:38.560
Lauren Bolanos: so we have because of our master plan so much construction. It's insane. So this definitely needs to be updated. But to remove the old stuff. But

336
00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:42.690
Lauren Bolanos: it can be a.

337
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.589
Lauren Bolanos: It can be a challenge to remove.

338
00:25:48.056 --> 00:25:54.799
Lauren Bolanos: All the content. Some things have no images, some things have 2 images. And you want to make sure you're deleting

339
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.139
Lauren Bolanos: everything together.

340
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.590
Lauren Bolanos: the images with the advisory.

341
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:03.120
Lauren Bolanos: Otherwise it's just gonna

342
00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.460
Lauren Bolanos: anyway.

343
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:19.625
Lauren Bolanos: this is probably specific. I don't know if other facilities do this. But this is specific to Gla that we have a lot of construction, and we have a construction page we constantly update. So people, we have an external facing

344
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:26.530
Lauren Bolanos: web page for veterans when they come on campus, and they can navigate easier.

345
00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.139
David: Got it. Got it.

346
00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.500
David: though.

347
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:36.460
David: Generally after going through the proposed prototype

348
00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:40.790
David: and the normal one that you're normally going through.

349
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:45.969
David: Is there a preference? Are there things you like about one more than the other?

350
00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:52.120
Lauren Bolanos: no, I mean, I can get the job done either way.

351
00:26:53.934 --> 00:26:56.660
Lauren Bolanos: For the stories, for the events.

352
00:26:57.171 --> 00:27:01.700
Lauren Bolanos: even for the description or lack of a description. There's more than one, you know.

353
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:02.360
David: Yeah.

354
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:03.680
Lauren Bolanos: Can make it work, anyway.

355
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.260
David: Make it work.

356
00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.100
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah.

357
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.730
David: And I'm curious.

358
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.420
David: are there any?

359
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.059
David: So maybe we can go to this question

360
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:23.479
David: ideally. You know, I want to make a an update to this. That makes your job easier. That makes your day to day as

361
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.880
David: seamless as I can cause. I you know it's that's the goal.

362
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:35.269
David: If you had a magic wand. Right? You waved it around, and you made the perfect image uploader for yourself

363
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.729
David: that works just like absolutely perfect.

364
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:41.270
David: What might it include? What features might that include?

365
00:27:42.795 --> 00:27:49.234
Lauren Bolanos: So I'm gonna bring up our stories. Page. So that featured story,

366
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:58.349
Lauren Bolanos: is the dimensions so that you can get this nice like thumbnail. That's consistent. Is that why the dimensions are those dimensions.

367
00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.029
David: I'm not sure.

368
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.190
David: Okay.

369
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.919
Lauren Bolanos: Alright cause. I mean, I do like the fact that

370
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.719
Lauren Bolanos: these thumbnails are consistent.

371
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.999
Lauren Bolanos: and I do like the fact that

372
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:18.260
Lauren Bolanos: this is consistent as well among all of our stories.

373
00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:20.520
Lauren Bolanos: So I guess

374
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:30.799
Lauren Bolanos: I I like how like consistent and clean it looks and like I said, I don't mind cropping like a story, cause that's like

375
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:33.760
Lauren Bolanos: 2 seconds, for, like a story that took like

376
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.403
Lauren Bolanos: 2 months to write or a month to write.

377
00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:37.180
David: Yeah.

378
00:28:38.163 --> 00:28:39.146
Lauren Bolanos: So

379
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.540
Lauren Bolanos: I don't

380
00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.670
Lauren Bolanos: need

381
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:46.760
Lauren Bolanos: more.

382
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.829
Lauren Bolanos: because we already have so much work.

383
00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:50.550
Lauren Bolanos: If that makes sense.

384
00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.340
Lauren Bolanos: I'm not looking for more

385
00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:13.130
Lauren Bolanos: functionality. What we do is with our stories is we link to social media. So if we have more images or video what we do is on our social media sites. We link to our stories. So we use the image.

386
00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.727
Lauren Bolanos: And then we have

387
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:24.009
Lauren Bolanos: like, this was a story. So this is. And this was a real. So we link to our stories

388
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:28.490
Lauren Bolanos: here. This was, oh, this one actually wasn't a story.

389
00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:35.469
Lauren Bolanos: I do know. Yeah, I did a story for this one.

390
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:41.251
Lauren Bolanos: So and then we, we did a Youtube video as well. So we use

391
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.605
Lauren Bolanos: we do multimedia projects. But

392
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.850
Lauren Bolanos: we don't like.

393
00:29:49.080 --> 00:30:00.829
Lauren Bolanos: if we need more photos, we'll put them in our social media. If we need a video to go with our story, we'll put them in our Youtube. I'm not looking for like everything to be

394
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:03.420
Lauren Bolanos: on the website.

395
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:04.990
David: Got it.

396
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:06.260
Lauren Bolanos: That makes sense.

397
00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.470
David: Yeah, no, that makes complete sense.

398
00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:19.380
David: And yeah, you mentioned, yeah, you don't want to add any functionality. You're there's already a whole lot to do? Are there things that.

399
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:21.390
Lauren Bolanos: There are.

400
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:26.329
David: That we can. Are there things like in like those flows that like?

401
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:29.470
David: If they were just like tweaked a little bit.

402
00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:32.850
David: it would be faster for you. You could get.

403
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.390
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. When?

404
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.370
David: But better.

405
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:48.089
Lauren Bolanos: When uploading an image. It would be nice if our healthcare system was saved, I guess, like so when you're adding an image. Here, let's do a story.

406
00:30:49.639 --> 00:30:50.850
Lauren Bolanos: Scrolling

407
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.280
Lauren Bolanos: through.

408
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:54.680
David: Oh, I think I know what you're talking about.

409
00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.140
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah.

410
00:30:55.413 --> 00:30:55.960
David: Was it.

411
00:30:56.482 --> 00:31:02.610
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, so like, when I'm adding an image here, it would be nice, if it kind of like.

412
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:13.520
Lauren Bolanos: if we had like a default or something, we could favor it. So we don't have to scroll to visit 22 gla every time. It would be like so like when we add an image?

413
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.080
Lauren Bolanos: it's this part. Yeah.

414
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:22.665
Lauren Bolanos: I mean, it's like I said, I can scroll. But

415
00:31:23.826 --> 00:31:26.580
Lauren Bolanos: that, that does take time. It would be nice.

416
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.000
David: Specific.

417
00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.166
Lauren Bolanos: Was like saved, or if we had, like an option to save it.

418
00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:31.130
David: Got it

419
00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.769
David: anything else on this page.

420
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:36.874
Lauren Bolanos: Not really not really

421
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:42.709
Lauren Bolanos: but like I said, like I mean, I can scroll. It takes 2 seconds.

422
00:31:43.851 --> 00:31:46.617
Lauren Bolanos: It's not a huge time sock

423
00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.051
David: Yeah, no. I know.

424
00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.810
Lauren Bolanos: But.

425
00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:56.859
David: Anything else. I'm just so curious to see. Like what? Yeah, what what other things I can do to.

426
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.220
Lauren Bolanos: That's.

427
00:31:57.220 --> 00:31:58.740
David: Really make this process

428
00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.919
David: just feel a little bit more simple.

429
00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:07.889
Lauren Bolanos: So, yeah, I guess this is, there's options

430
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.338
Lauren Bolanos: like I said, I usually make sure the photo is

431
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.819
Lauren Bolanos: ready to go before I include it.

432
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:20.490
Lauren Bolanos: So we I we always pick the original.

433
00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:22.090
Lauren Bolanos: and then

434
00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:32.377
Lauren Bolanos: is there. I I guess I really like this is kind of arbitrary where I do, reusable or not, I guess

435
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:39.145
Lauren Bolanos: best practices, for when you should check reusable is something.

436
00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:45.016
Lauren Bolanos: I we really don't reuse like images, though that much so

437
00:32:47.468 --> 00:32:50.400
Lauren Bolanos: That would be the only thing

438
00:32:52.540 --> 00:33:08.009
Lauren Bolanos: I would say I don't know, and this isn't related to images, but word counts for the 1st lead of the story can be an issue, and then you can't link in here. That is not related to images. But that's my biggest pet peeve with stories.

439
00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.660
David: Got it? Yeah.

440
00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.360
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah.

441
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:22.379
Lauren Bolanos: Is that I. Sometimes people have really long 1st sentences, and then sometimes even in our national toolkits. They'll give us like a press, release.

442
00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.990
Lauren Bolanos: or and like

443
00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:29.229
Lauren Bolanos: they'll, they'll want like a link in the 1st sentence.

444
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.440
Lauren Bolanos: and then we can't do that.

445
00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.600
David: Can't do that. Okay.

446
00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.830
David: yeah, yeah.

447
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.369
David: I think you're kind of touching on my next question here.

448
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:41.120
David: Are there?

449
00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:45.690
David: Is there anything else in like just the current drupal cms

450
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.899
David: that you'd like to

451
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.670
David: that you feel is missing, or that you

452
00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:57.800
David: would like to be a little updated. This is more for like future stuff. But like we'd love to kind of like, know what you're thinking. There.

453
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:15.700
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, definitely. So I run into this issue a lot. For the 1st sentence in the lead I run into like, not enough word, count and then and then sometimes somebody will like Link something in the 1st sentence, like

454
00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:25.750
Lauren Bolanos: they'll want to link like like I did a story, for, like the wheelchair games, and then, like, they'll want to link to the National. And the 1st sentence, Webpage.

455
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:29.250
David: How do you typically handle those situations? Currently.

456
00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.319
Lauren Bolanos: I link it in the body. Text.

457
00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:33.580
David: Instead.

458
00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:42.300
Lauren Bolanos: So I don't link the 1st mention. I link like the second, mention. I. It has been an issue in the profiles

459
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:55.450
Lauren Bolanos: for leadership specifically the staff profiles, so I can show you and then I'll just have to repeat the 1st sentence like a short version in the lead, and then a long one in the body text.

460
00:34:55.510 --> 00:35:00.359
Lauren Bolanos: so like under about us for leadership, some people have like

461
00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.810
Lauren Bolanos: this person

462
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:07.260
Lauren Bolanos: has a really long, like an enormous amount of

463
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:11.220
Lauren Bolanos: titles

464
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.170
Lauren Bolanos: and abbreviations.

465
00:35:14.609 --> 00:35:19.159
Lauren Bolanos: So I wasn't able to include all of this in the lead.

466
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.310
Lauren Bolanos: So this is like a shortened lead. And then this is like a double lead.

467
00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:37.689
Lauren Bolanos: so includes everything. So that is the word count issue. So I just duplicate it, which isn't like ideal. Obviously, to have, like Michael Simmons, was appointed twice.

468
00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:38.880
David: Yeah.

469
00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:46.179
Lauren Bolanos: So that's 1 way I get around that and then the other way. I get around. So for news releases

470
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:52.304
Lauren Bolanos: like we got sent like a news release for LGBT that they forwarded us

471
00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:57.820
Lauren Bolanos: and they wanted us to like Link something in this

472
00:35:58.464 --> 00:36:01.060
Lauren Bolanos: and I just I just didn't do it.

473
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.080
Lauren Bolanos: And then.

474
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:11.760
Lauren Bolanos: yeah, so word counts and links in here are like.

475
00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.126
Lauren Bolanos: I guess,

476
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:25.809
Lauren Bolanos: I guess things that cause it's weird like, I don't think the people who are writing are the ones posting like in the national toolkits.

477
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.170
Lauren Bolanos: So they don't know that.

478
00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:38.859
Lauren Bolanos: Or if it's like from an outside source that they're forwarding us. So this was like a not from a va toolkit. This was like from

479
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:42.030
Lauren Bolanos: like the foundation.

480
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:45.679
Lauren Bolanos: the press release that our team sent to us.

481
00:36:46.202 --> 00:36:50.927
Lauren Bolanos: And so they don't realize the constraints that we have.

482
00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:59.199
David: Got it, got it? And is there anything else besides? Word? Count related things that you'd like to highlight.

483
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:03.961
Lauren Bolanos: Yes, this is another issue that I run into

484
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.110
Lauren Bolanos: So under programs, when I'm making a detail page.

485
00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:22.049
Lauren Bolanos: I can only put a new detail page under the programs bar. I can't put it navigation wise like under health services. So like, for example, we had.

486
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.600
Lauren Bolanos: we have, like women's veteran care

487
00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.060
Lauren Bolanos: has a detail page, and the URL is under health services.

488
00:37:32.086 --> 00:37:36.910
Lauren Bolanos: And this is great. But, like other services, want

489
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:44.550
Lauren Bolanos: detail pages, and they're not necessarily like what I would categorize as a program.

490
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:48.770
Lauren Bolanos: For example, our rheumatology wanted like a gout care

491
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:56.229
Lauren Bolanos: page. Because they have, like a lot of websites that they've worked with and they wanted

492
00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:01.180
Lauren Bolanos: to direct people to a Va website instead of a Ucla website.

493
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:13.849
Lauren Bolanos: So, and I don't feel like gout. Care is a program. It's just a disease, one of many that's under rheumatology, which is a health service.

494
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:22.320
Lauren Bolanos: So so unfortunately, because everything was grayed out under health services, I had no choice but to put it under programs.

495
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:29.029
David: Yeah, yeah, I'm I'm familiar with how it's built built right now. So yeah, I see that as.

496
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:30.360
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah.

497
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:33.522
David: You can't. You can't put in a health service unless it's

498
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.670
David: like validated health service that has been like

499
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.160
David: approved.

500
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:54.954
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, it's unless it was already created. Like the women's veteran care, LGBT. Caregivers and homeless veteran care. Those were like already created right. Those are already approved. But if I'm creating a new detail page

501
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:06.290
Lauren Bolanos: it has to go under programs, no matter what. And so this is starting to fill up very quickly, like it's starting to get a little

502
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:10.800
Lauren Bolanos: we're starting to get, you know, we're only gonna get more requests. So.

503
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.130
David: As time goes on.

504
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.280
Lauren Bolanos: and

505
00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:18.578
Lauren Bolanos: like I said some of these like

506
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:25.769
Lauren Bolanos: like my healthy vet like, too, we have like a my healthy vet under health services

507
00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.780
Lauren Bolanos: right like my healthy vet coordinator

508
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:33.300
Lauren Bolanos: like it would make more sense if it had

509
00:39:34.007 --> 00:39:38.570
Lauren Bolanos: health services instead of program. And then like. So

510
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:41.660
Lauren Bolanos: this links to this

511
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.046
Lauren Bolanos: detail. Page

512
00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:47.410
Lauren Bolanos: specific to gla.

513
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.144
Lauren Bolanos: my healthy vet,

514
00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:54.359
Lauren Bolanos: so like it does it for some services, but doesn't do it for all services.

515
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.100
David: Gotcha gotcha.

516
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.589
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. And that woman.

517
00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:59.629
David: Curious. Have you reached out

518
00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.805
David: to

519
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.500
David: the help desk for any adjustments within this.

520
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.530
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah. So I've

521
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:12.387
Lauren Bolanos: asked to double check before I made the gout care page

522
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.649
Lauren Bolanos: to verify the navigation.

523
00:40:16.985 --> 00:40:19.359
Lauren Bolanos: Before I created the page

524
00:40:19.817 --> 00:40:25.809
Lauren Bolanos: and the help desk said that I should reach out to Vha digital media.

525
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:31.860
Lauren Bolanos: and then the Vha digital media. So I brought it up during office hours.

526
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.885
Lauren Bolanos: And

527
00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.705
Lauren Bolanos: yeah, I I said that that's the only place I can put it.

528
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:40.710
David: Hold on!

529
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:42.659
Lauren Bolanos: Is this something we can change.

530
00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.060
David: Gotcha.

531
00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:58.110
Lauren Bolanos: And they. They said that that's the only place because I think, like some people were on the line, not just Vha digital media. I think some people from it, and they verified that the only option was under programs in the office hours. When I asked.

532
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.420
David: Gotcha gotcha. Okay?

533
00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.640
David: Well, thank you so much for sharing all of this information where

534
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:12.450
David: listening and just don't. Yes, I appreciate all the work.

535
00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:18.110
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, I'm happy to help. Thank you guys for listening to feedback

536
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:21.248
Lauren Bolanos: and making the updates. I

537
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.320
Lauren Bolanos: I know it's not easy to

538
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.149
Lauren Bolanos: with so many cooks in the kitchen.

539
00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.578
David: Lots of cooks for sure.

540
00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:36.869
David: Now we have a couple of other questions. I do want to be aware of our time. Are are you okay?

541
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:37.260
Lauren Bolanos: Course.

542
00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:37.680
David: Okay.

543
00:41:37.984 --> 00:41:40.119
Lauren Bolanos: Let me just double check and see.

544
00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:41.830
Lauren Bolanos: Okay?

545
00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:43.550
Lauren Bolanos: And

546
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.130
Lauren Bolanos: okay, nothing urgent.

547
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:50.510
David: Perfect.

548
00:41:51.560 --> 00:42:02.750
David: So yeah, from Marissa. We have 2 questions, and Marissa feel free to also hop in. If you'd like to ask or like clarify anything. But I'll just read them aloud.

549
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:11.980
David: how much time do you typically spend? On pre work with images and photoshop on average, just kind of like from what you have.

550
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:14.329
Lauren Bolanos: Site, or just in general.

551
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:15.300
David: For, like

552
00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:19.160
David: story pages or events, I think.

553
00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:20.570
Marisa: Yes, yeah.

554
00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.169
Marisa: for any kind of work. Yeah, just for any. Any postings you're doing.

555
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.850
Lauren Bolanos: Including like social media, or any of that.

556
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:37.350
Marisa: Well, mostly, for like what you're posting up on drupal. So when you mentioned adding captions? Yeah, like, on average, how many like, how long do you think that takes you?

557
00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.207
Lauren Bolanos: not that long.

558
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:45.500
Lauren Bolanos: maybe like 5 min to open up a previous

559
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:58.449
Lauren Bolanos: stories. Image. So I don't even have to like look up the dimensions. I just like open it up and then throw on another layer, and then I'm done and export it. So it's like

560
00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.790
Lauren Bolanos: if I were to do it right now, like, say.

561
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:10.399
Lauren Bolanos: it would just be. Oh, you know what I think adobe like wants us to log in again, so I don't know if I'm actually gonna be able to

562
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.735
Lauren Bolanos: do it. But

563
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.940
Lauren Bolanos: I might have to log in.

564
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:28.109
Marisa: Oh, yeah, that's okay. It's okay. I just just trying to get an idea of your of the time you spend to get the images ready so that they're so you just click original on that cropping so.

565
00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:36.510
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, I mean, it takes 5 min to open up a previous story image, and then I just copy and paste and make a new layer.

566
00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.519
Lauren Bolanos: so the dimensions are right, and then I export it.

567
00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:40.820
Marisa: Okay.

568
00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.400
Lauren Bolanos: And take that long to crop.

569
00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:49.112
Lauren Bolanos: Got it? Or I can always like open up a new file with the dimensions, and then just copy and paste it over.

570
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:50.650
Marisa: Okay.

571
00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:54.889
David: And the images that you're receiving are there

572
00:43:55.140 --> 00:44:01.370
David: major crops? Do you have to do, or major edits? Or is it typically you just paste it into your template that you've built.

573
00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:04.050
Lauren Bolanos: Really.

574
00:44:06.127 --> 00:44:09.879
Lauren Bolanos: sometimes, if I feel like damage like wasn't like.

575
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:19.509
Lauren Bolanos: This is a personal preference. Most of the time I get good images, but sometimes, if it's like a little dark, I'll put like a little curves on it, and then I'll be done. So it's just like

576
00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.889
Lauren Bolanos: one more extra step that no time.

577
00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.269
David: Got it. Got it.

578
00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:37.621
Lauren Bolanos: And like, I said, we have our workflow set up so that people submit the images at the right size. For our stories, for the website. We really don't

579
00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:40.440
Lauren Bolanos: unless it's a detail page.

580
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:42.280
Lauren Bolanos: Add that many images

581
00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.165
Lauren Bolanos: like we did for the history. But

582
00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:50.450
Lauren Bolanos: like, you can see for my healthy vet. We don't really have that many images.

583
00:44:52.028 --> 00:44:55.141
Lauren Bolanos: We have images for construction. But

584
00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.530
Lauren Bolanos: What is going on with this?

585
00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.889
Lauren Bolanos: But we don't resize them. We just add them in.

586
00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:05.360
Lauren Bolanos: I'm gonna have to

587
00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:07.739
Lauren Bolanos: troubleshoot this page and see what

588
00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:09.520
Lauren Bolanos: my coworker did.

589
00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:15.880
David: One other question.

590
00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.760
Lauren Bolanos: Oh, oh, I do have one

591
00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.509
Lauren Bolanos: thing I forgot to mention.

592
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.840
David: There is.

593
00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:24.640
Lauren Bolanos: So

594
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.316
Lauren Bolanos: I know.

595
00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:29.530
Lauren Bolanos: there was like a

596
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:34.200
Lauren Bolanos: about us. There was like a Va police thing you guys did right here.

597
00:45:36.078 --> 00:45:38.419
Lauren Bolanos: But I can't edit this.

598
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:40.130
Lauren Bolanos: and.

599
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:45.450
David: The police page, I believe, is like consistent on every.

600
00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:48.940
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, like our police

601
00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:54.320
Lauren Bolanos: people wanted have a detail page, and we weren't able to like copy and paste.

602
00:45:54.948 --> 00:46:01.380
Lauren Bolanos: The local information that they wanted. So now I have like 2 Va police pages.

603
00:46:03.350 --> 00:46:03.730
David: No doubt.

604
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.680
Lauren Bolanos: and they like, I said.

605
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.550
Lauren Bolanos: Unfortunately.

606
00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.440
Lauren Bolanos: like

607
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:22.629
Lauren Bolanos: they want information on who to report lost or stolen items to. They want our dispatch

608
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:29.580
Lauren Bolanos: they want who to send complaints to, and who to send vehicle registration to

609
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.979
Lauren Bolanos: and that's local information.

610
00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.540
Lauren Bolanos: And then they wanted

611
00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:39.110
Lauren Bolanos: this description.

612
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.555
Lauren Bolanos: So

613
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:45.460
Lauren Bolanos: I mean

614
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:46.520
Lauren Bolanos: nice.

615
00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:48.319
Lauren Bolanos: So I guess there's 2.

616
00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.340
Lauren Bolanos: There's 2 spots.

617
00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:52.770
David: Uva police.

618
00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.750
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah.

619
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:55.740
Lauren Bolanos: Adam.

620
00:46:55.750 --> 00:47:00.589
Lauren Bolanos: yeah. Cause none of this like has an option to input local information or.

621
00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:04.192
David: Yeah, I, yeah, I don't think it does at the moment.

622
00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:09.099
David: yeah, we'll we'll note that down as as something that is a concern.

623
00:47:09.896 --> 00:47:17.130
David: Last question. Do you ever use media library for batch edits or

624
00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:20.240
David: alt text or captions?

625
00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:25.740
Lauren Bolanos: For batch processing I use lightroom.

626
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.290
David: Lightroom. Okay.

627
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:32.999
David: you're not using the media library to to batch process that. Yeah, you're only using your adobe.

628
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.909
Lauren Bolanos: For all text. I'm using drupal for the alt text function for the web page, and then common look for Pdfs.

629
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.700
Lauren Bolanos: And then what was the other one.

630
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.290
David: Captions. I'll text

631
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.970
David: image titles.

632
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:59.889
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, for captions. Like I said, I would like the option for captioning underneath the image

633
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:04.919
Lauren Bolanos: on detail pages, because I think it looks really nice on the stories page

634
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:14.370
Lauren Bolanos: to have like that, Tiny. I it's very clean but like only if it aligns with the

635
00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:18.970
Lauren Bolanos: image, because sometimes we have lower res smaller images.

636
00:48:19.498 --> 00:48:21.209
Lauren Bolanos: And if it like

637
00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:23.916
Lauren Bolanos: goes past the image.

638
00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:26.300
Lauren Bolanos: it'll look strange.

639
00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:27.700
Lauren Bolanos: Yes.

640
00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:31.240
David: Has to. It has to be the full width of whatever and.

641
00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:37.540
Lauren Bolanos: Yeah, it has to like, go with the width of the image. In case that we have a lower res smaller image.

642
00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.939
David: Got it. Got it?

643
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:44.879
David: Okay? Well, that's all the questions I have. Do you have any questions for me?

644
00:48:45.807 --> 00:48:51.110
Lauren Bolanos: No, no, thank you for doing this. I appreciate your help.

645
00:48:51.310 --> 00:49:06.849
David: Yeah, we really appreciate you taking the time to speak and share your thoughts. Your feedback is really so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works as best as it can for veterans and for editors as well. So thank you again so much, and enjoy the rest of your day.

646
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.239
Lauren Bolanos: You, too, have a good one.
