00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:16.519
David: And then the recordings are going to be used. Just to make sure we've captured all your opinions accurately after we complete the analysis. The recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

2
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.650
David: so I have started recording, and I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio.

3
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.170
Justin Warren: Sure.

4
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.680
David: Great.

5
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:34.368
David: Okay? So now we can actually get into it. So Justin, could you tell me a little bit about your role at the Va,

6
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.670
David: yeah, just to start there.

7
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:53.510
Justin Warren: Sure, I work in office of Vha digital media which is within the office of Vha communications. Our primary role is helping manage the websites for our organization, which include the drupal vamc

8
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.359
Justin Warren: websites for all

9
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.455
Justin Warren: all the hospitals in the nation.

10
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.168
David: Okay, so the Jupal Bamc sites for the whole nation. Okay, that's a that's a lot. And

11
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.809
David: so how often are you really using Cms to do things like uploading images.

12
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.680
Justin Warren: Not

13
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.060
Justin Warren: often.

14
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.679
Justin Warren: I just recently had to do it

15
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.949
Justin Warren: a candid, a campaign landing page. So

16
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.480
Justin Warren: I probably do it

17
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.899
Justin Warren: maybe a few times a year.

18
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.670
David: Okay a few times a year and campaign landing pages is that the the main one that you're typically

19
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.400
David: working on? Is it? Are there other pages that you find yourself uploading images to.

20
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.410
Justin Warren: It's usually a campaign landing page. What I would upload image to.

21
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.609
David: Okay, typically campaign. Great.

22
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.110
David: so could you kind of talk about that general workflow for uploading an image?

23
00:01:53.477 --> 00:01:59.380
David: So yeah, kind of like with, yeah, how how you get the image from start to finish.

24
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.000
Justin Warren: Yeah, usually

25
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.089
Justin Warren: I will get the images from whoever's the customer, whoever's requesting a particular page.

26
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.369
Justin Warren: So I'll have like a set of images of probably 5 or 6 images.

27
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.650
Justin Warren: And typically, I will just save into my desktop and then go through the steps

28
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.550
Justin Warren: and within drupal to

29
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.519
Justin Warren: get it in the live media library and then upload it to the page.

30
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.029
David: And then, typically in that workflow, do you find yourself?

31
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:47.669
David: using? I I'm I'm I'm a little less familiar with the campaign specific uploader. But do you upload the images all to the media library 1st and then grab them? Or it does the campaign page allow you to just upload the images.

32
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.800
David: and they're also going to the media library at that time.

33
00:02:51.765 --> 00:02:55.700
Justin Warren: But if I'm not mistake, you have to upload it to the media library first.st

34
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.490
David: You have to upload to the media library first.st Okay?

35
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:08.589
David: Got it? Got it? So you're receiving the images? Do you find yourself ever editing or cropping those images, or doing adjustments to them before you're uploading them.

36
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.969
Justin Warren: Some of them, because I know there's certain

37
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.859
Justin Warren: dimensions you can choose from. So if depending on what the image is, if it's

38
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.690
Justin Warren: like completely.

39
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.899
Justin Warren: If the image is like too large or it like doesn't fit.

40
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.629
Justin Warren: I may have to

41
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.250
Justin Warren: adjust it, but what I I think what I end up doing is just choosing the right.

42
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.319
Justin Warren: I guess, dimension that are

43
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.599
Justin Warren: within the options. We have

44
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.820
Justin Warren: to kind of make the best fit.

45
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.270
David: Hmm.

46
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.789
David: okay, so are there specific dimensions that the campaign requires you to upload the images in.

47
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:59.150
Justin Warren: No, I think I think it gave me the options, for, like a I can't remember the exact ratios of each one.

48
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.780
Justin Warren: But it gave me some options.

49
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.690
David: Gave you some options. Okay?

50
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:15.979
David: And are you always finding yourself like getting new images and uploading them to the media library? Or are you ever reusing images from the media library that you've already, maybe have uploaded.

51
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.880
Justin Warren: I have not had to reuse anything.

52
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.149
David: Okay.

53
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.219
David: So when you're putting images into the media library, it's really just for that one time.

54
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.030
Justin Warren: Yeah.

55
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.089
David: To get it in there, so you can use it. But you're not referring back to them at at later times.

56
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.650
Justin Warren: No, I haven't had to do that.

57
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.660
David: Okay.

58
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.920
David: great, great, great, great, great.

59
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.100
David: Okay. So

60
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.297
David: kind of getting started.

61
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.999
David: could you please share your screen with me? And we're gonna

62
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:58.460
David: And maybe you can do this after you log in. So it's not all recorded. But I'd love for you to open your cms

63
00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:06.559
David: and from there we're gonna kind of just see you go through that typical workflow of a campaign image

64
00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:08.470
David: uploading a campaign image.

65
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.360
Justin Warren: Gotcha.

66
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.100
David: So yeah, feel free to get on there before you start sharing, or whatever. Maybe you're already on there.

67
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.080
Justin Warren: Got mutes.

68
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.960
Justin Warren: Hmm!

69
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.479
Justin Warren: Access to not

70
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.030
Justin Warren: let me try another browser.

71
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.190
David: Open.

72
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.580
David: and I'm curious. Have you ever uploaded an event?

73
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.950
David: Events, or anything like that

74
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.340
David: familiar with.

75
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.150
Justin Warren: I'm familiar with presence. I have not

76
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.810
Justin Warren: had to upload an event.

77
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:21.900
David: Okay.

78
00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.509
David: And if this isn't

79
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.709
David: working oh, oh, you're right good.

80
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:54.779
David: I do have a plan. B, just in case

81
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.009
David: think we got it.

82
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.800
Justin Warren: Right.

83
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.309
David: Okay, so we're here.

84
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.070
David: so yeah, I would say, for this prompt

85
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.130
David: imagine that you're creating a new campaign.

86
00:07:12.084 --> 00:07:19.579
David: And you'd like to add in a photo. So I'd like you to kind of walk through that process of

87
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:30.000
David: going to the campaign creating a new one. And you can really skip over the bits that are more specific for the campaign. And we can just focus on that photo aspect

88
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.860
David: and feel free to take

89
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:43.109
David: you. I can send you a photo if you have a random photo on your desktop. That's also fine, whatever you'd like. But I'd love just to kind of watch. You kind of go through that process.

90
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.640
Justin Warren: Okay.

91
00:07:53.630 --> 00:08:00.190
David: Okay, so and then, as you're kind of going through this, if you could kind of think aloud. So.

92
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:00.680
Justin Warren: If you're thinking.

93
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:07.559
David: Clicking something, or you're a little confused, just kind of vocalize that, too. It really helps with

94
00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.310
David: this kind of research.

95
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.650
Justin Warren: Gotcha.

96
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:14.870
Justin Warren: So yeah, I usually start with content

97
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.470
Justin Warren: media and media image.

98
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.350
David: Okay.

99
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.770
Justin Warren: Let's see.

100
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.800
Justin Warren: See, I think I got some random photos online

101
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.220
Justin Warren: start.

102
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.360
Justin Warren: So I'm just renaming a random photo.

103
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.720
David: Yeah, sure. Sure.

104
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:05.950
Justin Warren: Description.

105
00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.330
Justin Warren: I.

106
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:10.560
Justin Warren: That's good.

107
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.080
Justin Warren: see

108
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.570
Justin Warren: type the description in type, the name in.

109
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.723
David: Yeah, let's can we take one second and and pause for a second?

110
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:30.697
David: So 1st of all, with the family photo that you entered the for the name category. Could you kind of tell me

111
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.070
David: why you pick that name, and where that name shows up.

112
00:09:37.359 --> 00:09:40.989
Justin Warren: The photo the random photo is is gonna be a picture of my family.

113
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:41.960
David: Okay.

114
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.130
Justin Warren: Mean family photo.

115
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.350
Justin Warren: yeah, typically all the name is gonna correspond to the whatever the picture is.

116
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:54.210
Justin Warren: Then same with the description.

117
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.430
Justin Warren: yeah, I only follow from Christmas, so

118
00:10:03.022 --> 00:10:05.070
Justin Warren: does it. I usually

119
00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.910
Justin Warren: I'm pretty succinct with my words, so I won't. I don't say

120
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.709
Justin Warren: to worry about the character limit.

121
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.339
David: Got it. And then the description,

122
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:19.259
David: do you always find yourself inputting a description?

123
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.580
David: Typically

124
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.699
David: just as it's a non. I I bring this up because it! It doesn't have one of those little red

125
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:32.870
David: asterisk that's next to it.

126
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.500
Justin Warren: I think.

127
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.749
Justin Warren: Naturally, I just put a description in

128
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:42.589
Justin Warren: I didn't even like recognize that it was not a required field.

129
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.020
David: Gotcha? And where does the description

130
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:49.210
David: go, or how is it used.

131
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.380
Justin Warren: Did this

132
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.390
Justin Warren: describe the photo and

133
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.480
Justin Warren: basically give

134
00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:04.839
Justin Warren: more information than the title or the name of the photo.

135
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.570
Justin Warren: I could see an instance where there's

136
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.710
Justin Warren: multiple photos from an event. So you wanna kinda use description to separate it

137
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.130
Justin Warren: separated.

138
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.570
David: Okay?

139
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.579
David: Great. Yeah. Feel free to carry on.

140
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.188
David: Yeah, I'm seeing you clicking on that.

141
00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.530
David: yeah.

142
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.269
David: Could you tell me? Was was that information there useful for you? Are you familiar with that.

143
00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.900
Justin Warren: Yeah, I am familiar, because this is a

144
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.690
Justin Warren: section 5, 0, 8.

145
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.100
Justin Warren: Practice as far as having

146
00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:14.559
Justin Warren: good all text. I use it as a reminder.

147
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:16.139
Justin Warren: They're not.

148
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:21.159
Justin Warren: I have. Sometimes I haven't used an image of a photo of. So I it's good to look at it.

149
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.120
David: Snapcha.

150
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.810
Justin Warren: I use that as a to not use those phrases.

151
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:27.790
Justin Warren: yeah.

152
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.140
Justin Warren: these are always good reminders.

153
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.910
David: So for the crop image, I'm curious about this one.

154
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.480
David: Yes.

155
00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:08.659
David: yeah. Government.

156
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:10.810
Justin Warren: I'm sorry.

157
00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:12.810
David: Oh, no! Feel free. I'm not here.

158
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:16.399
Justin Warren: This is what I was referring to earlier. I can't remember all the ratios. So

159
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.100
Justin Warren: oh, yeah.

160
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:23.462
Justin Warren: did not take my advice. Thank you for the red screen.

161
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.720
Justin Warren: I.

162
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.029
Justin Warren: This is where I was referring to.

163
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.329
Justin Warren: and I'll say it has different like aspect ratios.

164
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.770
Justin Warren: and depending on the photo.

165
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.619
Justin Warren: We may only need certain parts of the photo.

166
00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.160
Justin Warren: So I would like look through to see if any of these aspect ratios work.

167
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.410
Justin Warren: Judging by

168
00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.730
Justin Warren: my photo.

169
00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.499
Justin Warren: it's there. I don't think I need to crop it in this way.

170
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:05.870
David: Okay.

171
00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:09.159
Justin Warren: I. It is something. When I did upload a photo

172
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.810
Justin Warren: that I looked at just to kind of

173
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.859
Justin Warren: see if it would, you know, enhance or help me in any way.

174
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.900
David: So which one will you pick.

175
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.629
Justin Warren: I guess. Do I have to do that.

176
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:36.490
David: Oh, I'm not sure.

177
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.580
David: What do you think?

178
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:44.279
Justin Warren: I I didn't think so. I guess I'll find out once. I say, if it rejects me or not, I don't

179
00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.080
Justin Warren: makes sense.

180
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.760
David: Haven't.

181
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.090
Justin Warren: As far as section.

182
00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.060
Justin Warren: Do you care where I save it to.

183
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:07.079
David: somewhere, you would, wherever you would put your campaigns.

184
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.730
Justin Warren: Yeah.

185
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:13.000
David: And then we don't actually have to go through and press save just because I yeah, this is broad.

186
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:13.890
Justin Warren: Yeah.

187
00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.519
Justin Warren: okay, so yeah, I would

188
00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.660
Justin Warren: choose there and then.

189
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.410
Justin Warren: And I was safe.

190
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.079
David: Got it.

191
00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:32.980
David: Okay?

192
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:36.970
David: So

193
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.780
David: yeah, we would imagine you click, save. And then it would be up in the media library.

194
00:15:43.206 --> 00:15:54.980
David: Now, could we kind of go into that campaign and and really see how you would like get that picture from the media library. So we yeah, let's just pretend the pictures up here.

195
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:55.900
Justin Warren: Okay.

196
00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.249
Justin Warren: so for campaigns.

197
00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:06.340
Justin Warren: see?

198
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.880
Justin Warren: Actually, pull mine up.

199
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.540
Justin Warren: Actually

200
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.220
Justin Warren: working on.

201
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:23.440
David: So

202
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.599
David: yeah, perfect. We see an image here.

203
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.280
David: would we? Would you be

204
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.820
David: comfortable? Kind of like pressing the X and and just re uploading the specific picture.

205
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160
Justin Warren: Yes.

206
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.389
Justin Warren: trying to make sure I can remember where to find.

207
00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:47.210
Justin Warren: That's fine.

208
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.039
Justin Warren: Well, it should still be in the library, so.

209
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.629
David: Okay, perfect. Yeah. Just holding hands. Dot Png. So we don't forget.

210
00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.340
Justin Warren: You know.

211
00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.279
David: Correct that now.

212
00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:06.800
Justin Warren: See.

213
00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.230
Justin Warren: let's filter. So if I want to find this.

214
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.690
Justin Warren: I would search

215
00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:19.180
Justin Warren: campaign landing

216
00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:22.640
Justin Warren: me. So

217
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.839
Justin Warren: let's do that.

218
00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.600
Justin Warren: See if it comes up there it is.

219
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:35.139
David: There it is!

220
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.930
Justin Warren: Yeah.

221
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:42.109
David: Okay, fantastic. Okay, so let's take a second

222
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:47.110
David: here. When you uploaded that image the 1st time. Right?

223
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.120
David: But

224
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:55.760
David: thinking about ratios, I'm reading here, your image will be displayed at a 1 to one aspect. Ratio.

225
00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:02.459
David: Was that an aspect ratio that you set for this description, holding hands image

226
00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:05.900
David: when you uploaded it?

227
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.249
David: Or is it auto doing that? I'm I'm I'm not sure.

228
00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:13.840
Justin Warren: I

229
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.196
Justin Warren: make sure? I answer

230
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:18.730
Justin Warren: brushing.

231
00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:24.450
Justin Warren: I just took the image that was given to me and then just uploaded it.

232
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:32.139
Justin Warren: and I might have. I can't remember. If I had to crop it or not, I might have might have had to.

233
00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.139
David: Got it.

234
00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:38.279
Justin Warren: And I didn't. That that was the extent of it. I didn't do anything to the photo, or

235
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:43.289
Justin Warren: and I think this one to one aspect is set as far as this template is, so

236
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.660
Justin Warren: it wasn't my choice to go one to one, but.

237
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:47.210
David: God.

238
00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.260
Justin Warren: It's a lot of work.

239
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:51.210
David: Got it. Got it?

240
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:52.430
David: Okay?

241
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.629
David: Then one other question. When we're back on that page. So if you clicked X

242
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.339
David: and you were back on that page, and it said, Add or select media.

243
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:17.400
David: do you ever find yourself adding media directly through that kind of mo like pop up, or are you always adding your media to the mail media library first.st

244
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.480
Justin Warren: The

245
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:29.001
Justin Warren: I probably did both, I think, when I was working on this I probably did both. I probably opted in, and some were dropped in and some were

246
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.520
Justin Warren: media library.

247
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.720
David: Got it.

248
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:32.670
David: Okay?

249
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:42.199
David: Fantastic. Okay, so how would you say that overall experience was for you of kind of uploading the picture.

250
00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.000
David: getting it in there making sure the ratios look good.

251
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.020
David: Yeah, what what did you like

252
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.580
David: about that process?

253
00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.830
Justin Warren: I like the the ability to drag and drop.

254
00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.260
Justin Warren: That makes easier like. Well, you know, few less steps.

255
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.630
Justin Warren: Alright.

256
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.190
Justin Warren: If I remember correctly the

257
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:10.989
Justin Warren: if I had to crop it.

258
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.930
Justin Warren: I like the fact it gives you options.

259
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.109
Justin Warren: you know. It makes it pretty. Makes it easier as far as

260
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.040
Justin Warren: trying to

261
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.139
Justin Warren: make it

262
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.120
Justin Warren: work. So you know, it'll fit the template.

263
00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:26.880
David: You'll fit the template.

264
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.100
David: Gotcha

265
00:20:28.632 --> 00:20:33.219
David: what if anything, did you not like so much about the process.

266
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.799
Justin Warren: I don't think there's anything I dislike. If there were. Well, if

267
00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.130
Justin Warren: if there was a situation where

268
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.769
Justin Warren: the photo didn't fit.

269
00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:01.880
Justin Warren: Or it distorted the photo.

270
00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.840
Justin Warren: and that'd be something I would decide.

271
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.820
David: Got it. Yeah.

272
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:17.600
David: kind of thinking about. You know your experience with just the Internet, and like uploading things on other websites.

273
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:18.770
David: Is this

274
00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:28.450
David: similar, or or are very different to say, like uploading a picture to a social media or an email, or something.

275
00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:29.650
Justin Warren: Right.

276
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.920
Justin Warren: I would say it's similar.

277
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.810
Justin Warren: I would say similar. I know.

278
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.600
Justin Warren: you know, with social media is mostly done on phones.

279
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.349
Justin Warren: I don't think that social media you can

280
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.209
Justin Warren: drag and drop.

281
00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:54.070
Justin Warren: maybe, but.

282
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.516
David: You like the drag and drop. That's great.

283
00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.730
Justin Warren: Yeah, a lot of times I'm I'm gonna probably save it on my desktop. The.

284
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:05.500
David: Oh, okay, it's always on your desktop. So like that, drag and drop is really helpful for you.

285
00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:06.230
Justin Warren: Yeah.

286
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:08.100
David: Fantastic

287
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.860
David: alright. Well, thank you. And now let's move on to the next

288
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.580
David: part of this.

289
00:22:15.257 --> 00:22:21.780
David: So I'm going to now share with you a potential redesign of an image upload system.

290
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:36.498
David: just for a little bit of context. It is looking a little bit more like events. But I think, after seeing your campaign page, they're they are very similar. So

291
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.469
David: hopefully, nothing should be too

292
00:22:40.465 --> 00:22:45.870
David: new so I'm gonna go ahead and share a link with you.

293
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.110
David: See, hopefully, this works.

294
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:54.759
David: Wait. Oh, not to wait. You hear me.

295
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.020
David: and I just sent it on zoom chat.

296
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:06.750
Justin Warren: See.

297
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:37.849
David: Fantastic and on the left side, or I, before we even jump into that. This is this is what it currently looks like, and you can see that it's it's pretty similar to the campaign, right like

298
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:40.750
David: where it should be listed. In that image event.

299
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:44.950
David: Section, I think, has a lot of similarities is, that is that all right?

300
00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.290
Justin Warren: Yes.

301
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.450
David: Okay.

302
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.620
David: great. So let's go ahead and click proposed flow in the left side.

303
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.030
Justin Warren: Okay.

304
00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.350
David: And

305
00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:07.586
David: so now let's just go through the prompt. And again you're doing such a great job kind of explaining to me as you're clicking through as you're thinking about it. Just keep that up.

306
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:13.030
David: So imagine that you have started to create a new event for veterans.

307
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:21.130
David: You've entered the date where the location's happening. It's already listed in there, and now it's time to upload an image.

308
00:24:21.570 --> 00:24:24.429
David: So please show me how you would go ahead and do that.

309
00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:30.000
Justin Warren: Okay.

310
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:36.069
David: It was for the some coffee hour event that's being held in New York.

311
00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:38.880
David: That's the kind of context there that we put.

312
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.700
Justin Warren: See, I probably start with upload image.

313
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.379
Justin Warren: and I'd probably drag over.

314
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:49.739
David: They dragged out.

315
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.400
Justin Warren: Yeah.

316
00:24:50.910 --> 00:25:02.730
David: Okay, cool, cool. What? You could. Also, yeah, could you? Kind of yeah, the drag and drop thing. We haven't figured out quite well in prototyping yet. But say, say, you wanted to upload an image.

317
00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.440
Justin Warren: Go back.

318
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.609
Justin Warren: upload an image, I will.

319
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.350
Justin Warren: more likely saving it to my desktop. So.

320
00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:20.959
David: Okay, it would be on your desktop. Sure. Yeah, if you go ahead and click the event image, it should just kind of.

321
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:21.600
Justin Warren: Okay.

322
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.540
David: But in.

323
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:25.820
Justin Warren: Yeah

324
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.360
Justin Warren: refrain.

325
00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:31.949
Justin Warren: I was trying to move it to.

326
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:40.329
David: Yeah, this is the prototype. So certain things won't work exactly as it would in dev. But like, just to kind of give you the idea of like.

327
00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.899
David: alright, you uploaded the picture.

328
00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.000
David: And now, yeah, kind of

329
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:55.580
David: tell me what this like page is doing like what? Based on the context of the the title and the the subtitle. What is this page for?

330
00:25:57.550 --> 00:26:02.560
Justin Warren: This page is for advertising event. I think it was a coffee

331
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.160
Justin Warren: hour.

332
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.220
Justin Warren: you know, a town hall or something like that.

333
00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:12.710
Justin Warren: right? This is to advertise the veterans to get people to show up to that event.

334
00:26:13.596 --> 00:26:16.710
David: And then this, this specific page, we're looking at.

335
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.550
Justin Warren: Oh, this is a

336
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:21.510
Justin Warren: the image

337
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.000
Justin Warren: that will be displayed

338
00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:25.740
Justin Warren: for the event.

339
00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.940
Justin Warren: So this is what people will see like, I think when you click on events, they'll see this. I guess

340
00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.590
Justin Warren: this image

341
00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.669
Justin Warren: to the kind of

342
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.349
Justin Warren: kind of be the

343
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:44.889
Justin Warren: title picture for the event. Some people, yeah, yeah.

344
00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.130
David: Yeah, feel, free to keep going.

345
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:50.610
Justin Warren: In, yeah.

346
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.389
Justin Warren: and add context.

347
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.859
Justin Warren: yeah, the section will be Bronx.

348
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.310
David: Amazing.

349
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.589
Justin Warren: And then you would

350
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.220
Justin Warren: put in your full description of the event.

351
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.270
David: Yeah.

352
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:19.239
David: yeah, so yeah, you just uploaded an image

353
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.600
David: to the event.

354
00:27:21.295 --> 00:27:30.140
David: And you could kind of also imagine it to a campaign. That same exact process. The other process we can do if you go ahead and click X

355
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.760
David: there.

356
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:34.970
David: or sorry the X on the photo.

357
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:35.910
Justin Warren: Oh.

358
00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:36.940
Justin Warren: yeah.

359
00:27:39.271 --> 00:27:49.509
David: I'm curious about this other one select image from media library. What? What do you are? Yeah. What are you expecting? What is the difference between add media and select image from media library.

360
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.670
Justin Warren: Add me to be adding something

361
00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:57.639
Justin Warren: new or something not in the media library. The media library is what's already been

362
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.723
Justin Warren: was already been put into

363
00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.770
Justin Warren: that particular sections. Media library, the images they've used before.

364
00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:05.830
David: Yeah.

365
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.130
David: So

366
00:28:09.038 --> 00:28:22.630
David: here, let's also imagine that you're like looking for a photo the same way you would. Normally, I put in some parameters, because this is a prototypes. But if you click on file name and it should kind of interact with the example.

367
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:30.659
Justin Warren: Select image. Yeah, we'll select from the Bronx

368
00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.389
Justin Warren: the file name.

369
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.790
Justin Warren: Oh, if you were searching so if I was searching for it.

370
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.339
Justin Warren: if I knew what I was looking. The name.

371
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.460
Justin Warren: I think, more probably search through the photos before.

372
00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:57.178
David: Oh, oh, yeah, this is yeah. This is kind of similar to you looking for that holding hands image

373
00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.230
David: from from that, from our.

374
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.380
Justin Warren: I mean.

375
00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.920
Justin Warren: oh, and I'll let you click.

376
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.265
Justin Warren: I'll let you click that.

377
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.240
Justin Warren: Yeah.

378
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.549
Justin Warren: So yeah, I would either search by the file name and apply the filter.

379
00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.790
Justin Warren: But if it's not a lot of photos.

380
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.459
Justin Warren: I would just look at the different photos.

381
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.390
David: You would just go through the photos, got it.

382
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:22.130
Justin Warren: With and then section.

383
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.849
Justin Warren: obviously depend on where you are. You just add your particular medical center

384
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:31.459
Justin Warren: sorting news first.st That's good, too, because cases are recently used one.

385
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.689
Justin Warren: So yeah, after our after I picked the phone, I would just continue.

386
00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:46.089
Justin Warren: crop it. The way I need this particular aspect isn't great for this photo. This particular. I wish we had a different option.

387
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.159
David: Yeah, tell me a little bit more about the different options.

388
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:51.860
Justin Warren: Yeah, like

389
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:59.999
Justin Warren: this photo, you would want the whole, almost the entire image in there. And this is only gonna let you get, you know the 7 2 aspect ratio. So.

390
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.090
David: Yeah. And I'm curious. Why do you think?

391
00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.070
David: Well, yeah.

392
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:13.129
David: thinking about like how, for example, we had the one to one for a campaign

393
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.900
David: event images

394
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.730
David: has the 7 to 2 by 2.

395
00:30:18.258 --> 00:30:26.579
David: So I'm just kind of curious. Why, what's the difference between this experience and the previous like one that we went through

396
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:29.669
David: where we gave you the choices.

397
00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.970
Justin Warren: Well, here, you don't get a choice.

398
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.079
Justin Warren: and you're kind of

399
00:30:36.410 --> 00:30:39.060
Justin Warren: stuck with this particular aspect.

400
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:42.860
Justin Warren: And it worked. It's fine, like with the other photo. It worked.

401
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:45.000
Justin Warren: But this particular photo it won't.

402
00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.299
Justin Warren: And there's

403
00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.090
Justin Warren: there's a lot there's a way to

404
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:55.989
Justin Warren: for the system to adjust the photo itself to kind of make it fit. You just can only take a piece of

405
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.540
Justin Warren: the photo to fit the aspect ratio.

406
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:07.650
David: so if you go ahead and click the photo, it'll just do a little quick recrop for you

407
00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.820
David: kind of show you how how you might be moving.

408
00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:20.610
David: Now, if it says that all event images must have a 7 to 2 aspect ratio. That's kind of like imposed by dev

409
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.800
David: like if we, what would happen if we

410
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:27.380
David: in like a so in like the current version.

411
00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:30.699
David: it also has a 7 to 2 aspect ratio for events.

412
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:36.900
David: What would happen if I was to put in a 1 by one or a square and upload that.

413
00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.380
Justin Warren: You're asking me. What if you.

414
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.250
David: You think would happen? Yeah.

415
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.360
David: or what would you? What would you expect to happen.

416
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:52.890
Justin Warren: If this aspect ratio could be one to one.

417
00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.789
David: If you uploaded a different sized aspect ratio than the required one.

418
00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:02.849
Justin Warren: Oh, it will either cut it off or not.

419
00:32:04.111 --> 00:32:06.920
Justin Warren: Save so you can publish.

420
00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:12.659
Justin Warren: Would do one of those 2, but it wouldn't. You would get the desired outcome. You were probably looking for.

421
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.470
David: Got it. So what do you based on and on kind of like?

422
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:24.079
David: If you uploaded the image with the wrong crop size, it might not work.

423
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.290
David: What do you think about

424
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:34.100
David: this updated version kind of imposing the crop size to ensure that the photo uploads properly.

425
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:42.130
Justin Warren: I think it's good that it will do that, so you can

426
00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.119
Justin Warren: at least go through, get through the steps.

427
00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.549
Justin Warren: I think I have probably more issue with it, only allowing 7, 2.

428
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:52.440
Justin Warren: What

429
00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.030
Justin Warren: if it'll get me through the steps?

430
00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.929
Justin Warren: I think that'll work.

431
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.510
Justin Warren: and that's because most of the time.

432
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.170
Justin Warren: like myself, for when I have to do things, or I'm sure editors that would do this as well as

433
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:09.630
Justin Warren: is

434
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.779
Justin Warren: you being told to put this up

435
00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:18.410
Justin Warren: and to do it now, so the faster you can get through these things the better it is.

436
00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.330
David: I gotcha. Yeah.

437
00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:21.680
David: Okay.

438
00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:27.139
David: great. So yeah, if you go ahead and continue.

439
00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:35.630
Justin Warren: Yeah. So the

440
00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:36.770
Justin Warren: images are

441
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.480
Justin Warren: keeping missions coming.

442
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:47.119
Justin Warren: All text is in there section in there. So I would just save and upload.

443
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:51.319
Justin Warren: Then write my event description.

444
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.410
David: You're done. Yeah.

445
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:54.990
Justin Warren: And be done.

446
00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.609
David: So, yeah, now that we kind of walk through that whole new process, the proposed flow.

447
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.750
David: what stands out to you about that new design?

448
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.720
Justin Warren: I guess when you can move the

449
00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:11.649
Justin Warren: the automatic

450
00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.739
Justin Warren: aspect ratio

451
00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.640
Justin Warren: fitting part. Yeah, I will say that

452
00:34:17.803 --> 00:34:18.970
Justin Warren: participants, huh!

453
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.870
David: Yeah. Is there anything else that stood stood out to you

454
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.110
David: in terms of

455
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.900
David: you know the process.

456
00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:35.990
Justin Warren: think you said

457
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.470
Justin Warren: you can drag and drag a photo over.

458
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.679
Justin Warren: rather open the media library. So

459
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.710
Justin Warren: that's also something that stands out to me. That's that's a big plus

460
00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.190
Justin Warren: funny.

461
00:34:49.120 --> 00:35:01.250
David: So yeah, so with this version, you'll be more comfortable just uploading your images directly and campaign rather than uploading them to media library and then having to come back

462
00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:02.569
David: that right.

463
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:03.410
Justin Warren: Right.

464
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.920
David: Okay.

465
00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:10.539
David: did any of the new features help you upload your images more efficiently.

466
00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.650
Justin Warren: That aspect ratio feature

467
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.140
Justin Warren: like I was saying it would

468
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.270
Justin Warren: rather than

469
00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:23.969
Justin Warren: you manually trying to.

470
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.250
Justin Warren: you know. Figure it out.

471
00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:30.729
Justin Warren: It's the right, is it? Kinda does it for you so it'll save some time.

472
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.480
David: Hello!

473
00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:44.220
David: And then was finding your image any easier or harder, or about the same with with the with the new version compared to the older version.

474
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.090
Justin Warren: By an image within

475
00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:51.750
Justin Warren: the.

476
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:54.570
David: I mean your image that's in the like media library. Yeah.

477
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.400
Justin Warren: I'm not sure cause I don't remember.

478
00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.130
Justin Warren: Wait! What was the old way? Just.

479
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:10.960
David: Oh, yeah, we can do a quick recap if you well, if you go to current flow on the left.

480
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:21.409
David: This is how it is at the moment, and this should be matching with campaign version right now.

481
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:23.099
Justin Warren: So you would add

482
00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:28.209
Justin Warren: also upload them.

483
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:44.719
David: So, yeah, this is the the current process that maybe you should. You're familiar with.

484
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.660
Justin Warren: Description.

485
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.150
Justin Warren: That's politics.

486
00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.090
Justin Warren: then you have to choose which.

487
00:36:59.110 --> 00:36:59.555
Justin Warren: Say

488
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.494
David: Oh, yeah, only only 2 of them were.

489
00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:05.650
Justin Warren: Okay.

490
00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:06.490
David: Yeah.

491
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:11.950
Justin Warren: Alright.

492
00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.579
Justin Warren: I can choose 7, 2, or 2 to one.

493
00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.460
Justin Warren: Is that.

494
00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:20.390
David: You you can. Now the question is.

495
00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.000
David: will it work.

496
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.480
Justin Warren: Gotcha.

497
00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.050
Justin Warren: So okay.

498
00:37:25.050 --> 00:37:29.070
David: So in the current system you're you will have these options.

499
00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:34.510
David: But the question is, for example, with events, the required image ratio is 7 to 2.

500
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.219
Justin Warren: Gotcha. Yeah.

501
00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:37.550
Justin Warren: I see.

502
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.229
David: So just before we click on anything. If you scroll up just a bit.

503
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.120
David: And yeah, I think it's really cool that you have kind of both

504
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:49.789
David: the previous version. And like this version to kind of think about

505
00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:56.939
David: the other big change. I'm not sure if you noticed it was that we actually removed description

506
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.650
David: from the updated.

507
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.500
David: A proposed version.

508
00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.950
Justin Warren: I didn't notice it.

509
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:08.480
Justin Warren: Yeah. And I think it's because I think I mentioned it the 1st time, though

510
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:14.379
Justin Warren: I asked when I was doing it on my own. I guess I guess I assumed it was a

511
00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.689
Justin Warren: required field. So that's why I put something in.

512
00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.179
Justin Warren: But I don't think it's necessary, so I think it's a good thing that it's

513
00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:25.910
Justin Warren: it's removed.

514
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:30.309
Justin Warren: I think the event name, usually the name can help people distinguish

515
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:32.890
Justin Warren: what each funnel is, so.

516
00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:34.780
David: Yeah.

517
00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.179
David: we did keep alt text.

518
00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.030
David: oh.

519
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.960
Justin Warren: This is different.

520
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.220
Justin Warren: Yeah, they have.

521
00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:41.700
David: Yeah, yeah.

522
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.460
David: So

523
00:38:46.420 --> 00:39:01.069
David: yeah, just feel free to go through the rest of the process and kind of coming back to the bottom here. I'm not sure if you've found yourself in this similar like with the similar buttons. But what's the difference between save and select and save and insert.

524
00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:05.820
Justin Warren: Question.

525
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.670
Justin Warren: I assume they're the same.

526
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:15.270
Justin Warren: I would assume they're the same. So.

527
00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:16.310
David: Okay.

528
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.069
Justin Warren: Both are probably not needed.

529
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.129
Justin Warren: I have to sit, save and answer it. Okay.

530
00:39:26.850 --> 00:39:29.330
Justin Warren: just do the description menu down.

531
00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:32.350
Justin Warren: Okay, yeah. I see the differences now.

532
00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:39.830
David: Yeah. So now that you had a little bit more of a compare contrast, experience, is there anything

533
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.890
David: else about the proposed updated version that

534
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.249
David: you like you dislike

535
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.220
Justin Warren: No, I I definitely like

536
00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.829
Justin Warren: that. If 7, 2 is the only ratio that it

537
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.800
Justin Warren: forces you into it, and it makes you choose.

538
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.890
Justin Warren: You know, you can crop based on that ratio.

539
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:02.160
Justin Warren: and I think

540
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.270
Justin Warren: getting rid of the description

541
00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:08.910
Justin Warren: just enough. It's a it's good. It's saves time

542
00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.049
Justin Warren: rather than trying to come up with a description.

543
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:14.370
Justin Warren: So yeah, those

544
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.340
Justin Warren: those 2 aspects stand out

545
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:19.710
Justin Warren: scars.

546
00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:26.509
David: And are there any additional improvements you'd like to see in that proposed version anything else you'd like?

547
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.080
David: Add to it

548
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.169
David: to make it more

549
00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:33.849
David: efficient, faster for you.

550
00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:37.280
Justin Warren: See that one.

551
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:43.149
Justin Warren: I can't think of anything else. I'll make it

552
00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:45.020
Justin Warren: faster.

553
00:40:45.772 --> 00:40:48.850
Justin Warren: I don't know if the if you can

554
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:50.980
Justin Warren: like, when you look

555
00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:54.629
Justin Warren: the proposed aspect ratio.

556
00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.190
Justin Warren: like, you know, unless you slide it, you know, up or down.

557
00:40:58.600 --> 00:40:59.670
Justin Warren: if it

558
00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.769
Justin Warren: to choose the best.

559
00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:03.900
Justin Warren: what what the computer thinks the best.

560
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.850
David: Okay.

561
00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.960
Justin Warren: Part of the image for you that that'd be nice. I don't know.

562
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.710
David: That would be nice. Yeah, maybe.

563
00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:12.349
Justin Warren: I like technology. But

564
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:18.129
Justin Warren: if it's like a recommended aspect, and then, you know, if you didn't like that, you could check

565
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:20.570
Justin Warren: if it didn't get that

566
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.710
Justin Warren: that we.

567
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:25.500
David: And that would save you some time. I see. I see that that's great.

568
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:31.960
David: very great. Okay, so

569
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:35.529
David: overall. And let's go ahead and

570
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.189
David: click back to that proposed flow version. One more time.

571
00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:46.239
David: So would you say, with which

572
00:41:46.770 --> 00:41:51.549
David: flow would you prefer the proposed flow or the the way. It is right now.

573
00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.250
Justin Warren: And proposed.

574
00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.429
David: Okay? And yeah, we kind of went through all of those things. But

575
00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:07.480
David: is there anything else, you know that you'd like to like highlight some things that you really absolutely like. If we if we only had to do one thing to change it.

576
00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.879
Justin Warren: It'd be the

577
00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.849
Justin Warren: the part where you can only choose. 7. The 7 2 aspect.

578
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:17.800
David: Yeah.

579
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.010
David: great.

580
00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.620
David: So in our last few minutes.

581
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:25.480
David: is there anything in the current Cms

582
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.960
David: that you feel is missing?

583
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:33.470
David: And this is beyond, you know, just events, specifically just big picture.

584
00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:35.829
David: Anything that you feel is missing.

585
00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:38.050
Justin Warren: Yeah, the

586
00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:41.090
Justin Warren: I would like to say, flexibility with the size

587
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.369
Justin Warren: of the photos or with the aspect ratios. If there's some more flexibility with that.

588
00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.020
David: More flexibility with it.

589
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.340
Justin Warren: Yeah, if there can be

590
00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:50.710
Justin Warren: perhaps different.

591
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:54.869
Justin Warren: he doesn't. If there could be another aspect ratio.

592
00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:57.930
David: Color. Okay, got it, got it.

593
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:59.840
David: And are there

594
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:09.320
David: any types of information that you find yourself needing to communicate to veterans and beneficiary populations

595
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:12.109
David: that you're currently unable to do.

596
00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.249
Justin Warren: Oh, I may add to the previous question and the option

597
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.479
Justin Warren: for more than one photo.

598
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.040
David: More than one photo.

599
00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:26.030
Justin Warren: So like, maybe we have a

600
00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:31.290
Justin Warren: a title image that shows up, you know, before you click the event. Within the event you can add

601
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.560
Justin Warren: more follows.

602
00:43:35.072 --> 00:43:38.210
Justin Warren: As far as what's missing from the Cms

603
00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.580
Justin Warren: definitely, it doesn't have to be about investment by anything.

604
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:52.910
David: It doesn't have to be about events. It can be about literally anything in your daily cms. Drupal flow.

605
00:43:53.660 --> 00:43:56.709
Justin Warren: Gotcha. I'd like to see more

606
00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:00.559
Justin Warren: using more than one image for stories.

607
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:02.350
David: And.

608
00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.410
Justin Warren: Yeah. That's why

609
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:05.700
Justin Warren: that's a good.

610
00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:16.610
David: Yeah, you you mentioned earlier. Sometimes you'll be sent, you know, 4 or 5 images for a campaign. Are you able to upload all the images you want? Or are you making the call of which to add.

611
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.350
Justin Warren: You're somewhat limited

612
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.850
Justin Warren: with the with the campaign landing page on certain sections, I think, with

613
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.810
Justin Warren: depending on the section you choose, you can upload more than one, but

614
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.249
Justin Warren: I know with like

615
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.940
Justin Warren: you have the hero image, and then you have.

616
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.960
David: Got it.

617
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.820
Justin Warren: Other sections where it's just it. It limits you.

618
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:41.320
Justin Warren: as far as

619
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.489
Justin Warren: I mean the amount of pictures you get.

620
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:47.329
Justin Warren: and then some of the information how you put it in is also limited.

621
00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:54.669
David: Yeah. And my, my last question for you, is there any type of information

622
00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:59.030
David: you know we talked about like uploading images. But are there any other

623
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.850
David: aspects of your day to day workflow that

624
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.029
David: are a little more difficult than you think they should be.

625
00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:28.719
Justin Warren: I would, say

626
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:30.660
Justin Warren: I,

627
00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:37.580
Justin Warren: and maybe it's cause I don't know most efficient way. But when I'm looking for something that I'm working on.

628
00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.330
Justin Warren: I'll wait.

629
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:44.030
Justin Warren: I kind of have to go through

630
00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.600
Justin Warren: like content. I usually do like.

631
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.429
Justin Warren: Wow shall kinda

632
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:51.639
Justin Warren: there's something I'm trying to edit that

633
00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.169
Justin Warren: I usually start

634
00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:55.110
Justin Warren: here.

635
00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:57.860
Justin Warren: and then I'll like search for it.

636
00:45:57.890 --> 00:46:00.640
Justin Warren: I'll be like, Okay, I'm with the campaign landing page.

637
00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:04.749
Justin Warren: and then I'll just search for it, and if I, since I know the name.

638
00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.189
Justin Warren: find it.

639
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.020
Justin Warren: and you know and then I can get to it there

640
00:46:14.130 --> 00:46:17.940
Justin Warren: if there's like. I don't know if there's an easier way to like find

641
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:22.440
Justin Warren: things that I'm working on or just worked on.

642
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:25.460
David: Yeah, you're mostly sentinel. You're mercy.

643
00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:26.950
Justin Warren: Then in less steps.

644
00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.749
David: Yeah, it's no, I don't have to do that.

645
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:36.229
Justin Warren: Yeah, I don't know. That's the because I have access to a lot of stuff, and I have to do it that way, or what. But

646
00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.990
Justin Warren: that's usually how I find stuff I'm trying to work on.

647
00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:40.630
David: Gotcha.

648
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:53.140
David: Yeah. Well, thank you so much for sharing that I will make sure. I mean, we have some great observers and notetakers on here, too, but we're all going to make sure that that's heard. And we're we're writing that down now.

649
00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:57.789
David: I do have a couple other questions from Michelle and Amanda.

650
00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.490
David: I can

651
00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:08.600
David: go through them. And then also, yeah, Michelle, Amanda feel free to pop in to give additional context. If there's anything else you'd like to ask

652
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:20.359
David: I'm wondering how often you upload the image first, st and then immediately use them versus uploading one in one session and returning to use it later.

653
00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:23.110
Justin Warren: It's usually immediately.

654
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.319
David: It's usually immediately

655
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:31.510
David: got it. So if you're uploading an image, it is you're you're going through the whole process at that time.

656
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:32.590
Justin Warren: Yeah.

657
00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.390
David: Okay, great

658
00:47:35.517 --> 00:47:42.509
David: and then, is there any feedback that you've heard from other people around uploading images?

659
00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:43.800
David: Have you?

660
00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:48.660
David: Yeah. Has that ever come up. Are there other things that you know people

661
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.980
David: think about it?

662
00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:56.779
Justin Warren: It has come up. I'm trying to remember also said

663
00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.129
Justin Warren: I think it had to do with the cropping.

664
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:00.980
David: With the cropping.

665
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.459
Justin Warren: Well, and I'm not sure it's because they were trying to.

666
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:05.490
Justin Warren: Maybe like the advantage

667
00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:10.199
Justin Warren: it it only allows one aspect, but it gives you multiple options.

668
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:14.180
Justin Warren: or if the propping was too restrictive in.

669
00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:18.280
Justin Warren: they didn't, their photo didn't fit the particular aspect.

670
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:20.370
Justin Warren: So I think

671
00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.979
Justin Warren: that's what frustrated people

672
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:27.419
Justin Warren: that I've heard that I, if I can remember correctly that that frustrated additive.

673
00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:28.850
David: Gotcha.

674
00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:30.310
David: Great!

675
00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.500
David: Do you have any questions for me?

676
00:48:37.170 --> 00:48:40.399
David: No need. But I just wanted to open it up for you.

677
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.900
Justin Warren: No, no, I don't have anything, nothing.

678
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:50.480
David: Great, great. Well, we are really, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts.

679
00:48:50.852 --> 00:49:08.247
David: With us today, your feedback is so helpful as we continue to make Viagov better for veterans, for people like yourself to make that information more accessible. So again, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us today. Really do appreciate it. And

680
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:15.740
David: yeah, hopefully, some of your some of what we talked about you'll see in, in the, in, the, in the future, so.

681
00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:17.000
Justin Warren: But for.

682
00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:17.690
David: Open up.

683
00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.350
David: great.

684
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.120
Michelle: Justin, yeah.

685
00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:25.230
Justin Warren: Have a good day.

686
00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:26.840
David: You too.
