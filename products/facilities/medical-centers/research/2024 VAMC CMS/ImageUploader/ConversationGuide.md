## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is David and Megan is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience with uploading and managing images on the VA.gov CMS.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

- Could you tell me a little about your role at the VA and how often you use the CMS to upload images? **RQ1**
- What types of images do you typically upload? (e.g., event photos, profile pictures, facilities images) **RQ1**
- Can you describe your general workflow when uploading an image?
    - Do you select the images or do you receive them?
    - Do you find yourself editing/cropping the image before you upload it?
- Do you typically use images already stored in the media library, or do you upload new images frequently? **RQ1**

## **First Task: [Current System Observation] - 15 minutes**

Can you please open your CMS and log in.

- **Prompt:** Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event [this can be adapted to another example if that’s what they most frequently build] and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along. **RQ1, RQ2**
    - *Consider having the participant use a previous image they were sent, if not share the sample image.*
- *Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:*
    - Can you walk me through what you're doing now? **RQ1**
    - What are you thinking about at this moment? **RQ1**
    - Is there anything about this step that seems difficult or confusing? **RQ2**
    - How would you improve this part of the process? **RQ3**
    - **Ask about description!**
    - What is the difference between “Save and insert” and “Save and select” **RQ2**
- *When participant is finished with the task*
    - Overall, how was that experience for you? Why? **RQ2**
- *If the participant mentions using the media library frequently, add this scenario:*
    - Now, let's say you have the event photo already saved in the VA.gov media library. How would you go about finding and inserting that image into your page? **RQ2**
    - *Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:*
        - How easy was it to locate the image you needed in the media library? **RQ2**
        - Were there any difficulties in using an image from the library compared to uploading a new one? **RQ2**

**Things to watch for:**

- What pain points does the participant run into when uploading an image?
- Do users remember the required aspect ratio for event images?
- What do participants think about the description field and how it differs from alt text?
- Do participants hesitate when they see save and select vs. save and insert?
- In what circumstances does a participant use upload media library?

## **Second Task: [Prototype Feedback] - 15 minutes**

Great, now I'd like to show you a potential redesign of the image upload system. 

- **Prompt:** Imagine you have started to create a new event for Veterans. You've entered the date and which VA location it will be listed in already. Now it's time to upload an image, show me how you would do that... **RQ3**
- *Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:*
    - Can you walk me through what you're doing now? **RQ3**
    - What are you thinking about at this moment? **RQ3**
    - Is there anything about this step that seems difficult or confusing? **RQ3**
    - How would you improve this part of the process? **RQ3**
    - Why do you think it’s like that?
- *When participant is finished with the task*
    - What stands out to you about the new design? **RQ3**
    - Did the new features help you upload the image more efficiently? **RQ3**
    - Was it easier to find what you needed compared to the current system? **RQ3**
    - Are there any features you found confusing or unnecessary? **RQ3**
    - Are there any improvements you'd like to see in the prototype? **RQ3**
    - If you had a magic wand, and could wave it and make this the perfect image uploader, what might you change? **RQ3**
- *If the media library was used in the current system scenario, add this scenario:*
    - Now, let's try using the prototype again. Imagine the event photo is already saved in the media library. Can you find and insert the image from the library using the new system?
    - Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:
        - How was your experience finding the event photo in the media library using the prototype? **RQ3**
        - How did the using the prototype compare to the current system? **RQ3**

**Things to watch for:**

- What is the participant’s immediate reaction to the prototype?
- Is it easier or more difficult to navigate?
- Is the copy clear and understandable?

## **Drupal CMS Questions - 5-10 minutes**

- Is there anything in the current Drupal CMS that you feel is missing?
- Are there types of information which VAMC editors want to add or need to communicate to the Veteran/beneficiary population they serve which they are currently `unable` to do?
- What health system or facility information is currently `very difficult` for PAOs to add to their pages?
- Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with the current system or the prototype?
- Any questions for me?

## **Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
