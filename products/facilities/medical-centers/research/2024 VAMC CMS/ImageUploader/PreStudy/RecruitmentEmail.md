## Subject: Help Improve VA.gov Image Uploading (50-minute VA Sitewide Study)

Hi [CMS Editor's Name],

We're conducting a usability study as part of a VA.gov initiative to improve the image uploading experience for Drupal CMS editors. Your valuable feedback is crucial in helping us create a more efficient and user-friendly platform.

We're inviting Drupal CMS editors to participate in a 50-minute remote study focused on the image uploading process.  These will be over a Zoom meeting and you will need to have the ability to share your screen while interacting with Drupal and a digital prototype. 

During the study, you'll:

- Share your current experience uploading images to the CMS (brief interview)
- Test an updated early version of the image uploader and provide feedback

**Your participation directly contributes to enhancing the editor experience that powers VA.gov and the Veterans experience.**

If you're interested in sharing your insights and helping improve VA.gov, please sign up for a time slot on our calendly: https://calendly.com/david-pearl-adhocteam/cms-image-uploader

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,

David Pearl

Senior UX Designer, VA IIR team, on behalf of the VA Office of the CTO
