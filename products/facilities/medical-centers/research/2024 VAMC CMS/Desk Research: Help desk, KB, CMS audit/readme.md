# VAMC CMS Editor Experience

## About this project

Over the past month, I have focused on identifying opportunities to enhance the VAMC editor experience. My approach included taking the VAMC CMS editor training, reviewing the knowledge base, reviewing help desk reports, and consulting with the Help Desk and the Sitewide UX designer. This led to the creation of four main artifacts:

1. **VAMC CMS Help Desk Data Review**: This is a comprehensive analysis of over 1,000 help desk requests spanning four months. The review identifies recurring issues and provides actionable recommendations to improve user experience.

2. **VAMC CMS Knowledge Base Audit**: This report highlights UX research findings and recommendations after exploring the VAMC knowledge base. It includes detailed recommendations, ranging from high to low effort implementations.
