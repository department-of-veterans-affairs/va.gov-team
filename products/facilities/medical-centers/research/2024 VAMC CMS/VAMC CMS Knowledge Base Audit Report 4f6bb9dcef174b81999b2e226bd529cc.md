---

## Audience and Content Relevance

### Findings:

1. **Unclear Audience:**
    - The knowledge base has content that is directed towards veterans rather than editors, distracting from editing tasks, such as the Veteran-centered
2. **Unnecessary Information:**
    - Contains highly-complex information about non-editable content, which is less relevant for editors.
3. **Irrelevant Top Tasks:**
    - Top tasks listed are relevant to veterans, not editors.

### Recommendations:

- **Remove Irrelevant Content:** Eliminate content that does not directly assist editors in performing their tasks.
- **Focus on Editable Content:** Concentrate on what can be edited and briefly list non-editable content in the introduction.
- **Refocus Task Listings:** Organize guides by how the page is constructed (e.g., all detail pages together) and remove references to top tasks that are not editor-specific.

---

## Structure and Navigation

### Findings:

1. **Redundant Articles:**
    - Multiple articles link to the same page and contain overlapping information (e.g., duplicate articles on how to add, edit, or remove a VAMC facility health service).
2. **Inconsistent Link Text:**
    - Link text on the KB homepage does not always match the actual page content, causing confusion.
3. **Poor Organization by Task Type:**
    - Articles are not well-organized by task type.

### Recommendations:

- **Consolidate Articles:** Merge redundant articles into single, comprehensive guides ensuring each article serves a unique purpose.
- **Accurate Link Text:** Ensure link text accurately reflects the content of the linked pages for better navigation.
- **Organize by Task Type:** Arrange articles by task type (e.g., Adding, Editing, Removing) to streamline navigation.

## Simplification and Clarity

### Findings:

1. **Overly Complex Processes:**
    - Some processes are overly complex with too many steps, making them intimidating.
2. **Missing Basic Instructions:**
    - Basic instructions for tasks like reordering, editing page intros, or removing content are missing.
3. **Similar Article Titles:**
    - Articles have similar names starting with "How to..." or "How do I...".
4. **Mix of Overviews and Actionable Steps:**
    - There is a mix of overview pages and actionable steps, which can be confusing.

### Recommendations:

- **Simplify Processes:** Break down complex processes into smaller, manageable parts using bulleted steps and sub-headers to better organize guides.
- **Include Basic Instructions:** Provide comprehensive instructions for all basic tasks editors need to perform.
- **Rename Articles:** Rename articles based on the location needing adjustment and include sections for specific actions (e.g., Health services > Adding a new health service).
- **Separate Overviews and Actions:** Distinguish between overview pages and actionable step-by-step guides to improve clarity.

## Terminology and Language

### Findings:

- **Inconsistent Titles and Terms:**
    - Titles and terms are not always clear or consistent (e.g., "situation update" vs. "banner").

### Recommendations:

- **Standardize Terminology:** Use clear, consistent terms in titles and standardize terminology across all articles.

---

## Permissions and Troubleshooting

### Findings:

1. **Missing Permission Details:**
    - Articles do not specify the permissions required to complete tasks.
2. **Lack of Troubleshooting Steps:**
    - Troubleshooting steps are missing from many articles.

### Recommendations:

- **Specify Permissions:** Include the necessary permissions at the beginning of each article.
- **Add Troubleshooting Sections:** Incorporate troubleshooting sections to help users resolve common issues.

---

## Update and Maintenance

### Findings:

- **Outdated Information:**
    - Some information in the knowledge base is outdated.

### Recommendations:

- **Regular Updates:** Establish a routine for regularly updating the knowledge base to keep information current.

---

## Additional Features and Enhancements

### Findings:

1. **Lack of Visual Aids:**
    - Many articles lack visual aids, making instructions harder to follow.
2. **Limited User Training Resources:**
    - There are limited resources for user training.
3. **Manual Help Desk Process:**
    - The help desk process is not automated, leading to inefficiencies.
4. **Non-Intuitive Section Name:**
    - The "Common links" section name is not intuitive.

### Recommendations:

- **Incorporate Visual Aids:** Add screenshots, diagrams, or videos to complement written instructions.
- **Expand Training Resources:** Offer additional resources for user training, such as webinars or interactive tutorials.
- **Automate Help Desk Process:** Consider automating the help desk process by auto-suggesting KB articles based on options chosen by users.
- **Rename "Common Links":** Change "Common links" to "Spotlight Section" for better visibility.
