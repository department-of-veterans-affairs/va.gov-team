## Research Goals

1. The main goal of this study is to identify where Veterans expect contact methods for their healthcare team to be located on VAMC pages.

2. A secondary goal of the study is to identitfy where Veterans expect to find help accessing and using VA health chat and VA health connect. 

## Methodology 

**IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)**
Using Optimal Workshop, we conducted an unmoderated study in which participants were invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants were sent a link to a tree test activity that contained 6 tasks. For each task, the participant was asked to locate in the menu tree where they believe a specific task can be completed. The results of the tree test will help inform optimal placement of health chat and health connect links on VAMC pages. Links to VA Health Chat and VA Health Connect were placed in various places within the tree structure so we could identify where participants navigated to most often.  


## Hypothesis and Conclusion

**1. Most participants will be able to identify and locate methods of communication on facility health care pages.**
  - _Definitely true._  - Participants primarily navigated to the Make an appointment, Contact us, or Manage your healthcare online for all 6 tasks. 


## Key Findings

1. Participants primarily navigated to "Make an appointment" when presented with tasks related to making an appointment via online chat, scheduling a future appointment after hours, or scheduling telehealth. (Tasks: 1, 2, and 6)
2. When presented with calling to refill a prescription, most expected to be able to find this on the "Contact us" page. (Task 3)
3. When presented with using online chat to refill a prescription, participants primarily navigated to "Manage your healthcare online > Refill and track your prescriptions". This currently leads to a benefit hubs page where a participant is required to login prior to completeing task. The authentication flow was not part of this study. (Task 4)
4. Participants initially looked to speak to a healthcare provider after hours in "Contact us" but a significant portion navigated back to "Manage your healthcare online" and "Make an appointment." (Task 5)
5. There was no statistical difference in chosen click paths between Veteran and Family member/Caregiver audiences. (all tasks)


## Details of Task level Insights

Labels: BNFT: Healthcare, AUD: Veterans, AUD: Caregivers, AUD: Family Members, VETJNY: Taking care of themselves 
_List all labels from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

**1. Healthcare appointment using online chat**     
- First Click:
  - 49% chose "Make an appointment" as their first click
- Final Selection:
  - 65% chose "Make an appointment" to complete this task as their final selection
      - Some selected different click paths, higher percentage related to final choice over first click 
  - 27% "Contact us"
  - 12% "Make an appointment > VA Health Chat" 
   
**2. After business hours, call to make a medical appointment**
- First Click:
  - 49% chose "Make an appointment" as their first click
    - potentially influenced as this task followed a previous appointment related task
- Final Selection:
  - 53% chose "Make an appointment" to complete this task  as their final selection
      - Some selected different click paths, higher percentage related to final choice over first click 
  - 32% "Contact us"
  - 10% "Make an appointment > VA Health Chat" 

**3. Refill a prescription over the phone**
- First Click:
  - 61% chose "Contact us" as their first click
- Final Selection:
  - 35% chose "Pharmacy" to complete this task as their final selection
      - All selected one of two distinct click paths
        - 20% "View all health services > Pharmacy" (accordion)
        - 15% "Contact us > Patient help and resources > Pharmacy"
  - 32% "Contact us"
  - 20% "Manage your healthcare online > Refill and track your prescriptions"
    - "Refill and track your prescriptions" is a benefit hub page with sign in option, may indicate they expect to do this from their MHV account after log in (existing mental model). 

**4. Refill a prescription with online chat**
- First Click:
  - 39% chose "Manage your healthcare online" as their first click
- Final Selection:
  - 29% chose "Manage your healthcare online > Refill and track your prescription" to complete this task as their final selection
  - 22% "Contact us"
  - 15% "Manage your healthcare online > VA Health Chat"
    - Online chat modality impacted final choice to be VA Health Chat over Refill and track your prescription when presented to call for this in prior task.

**5. After business hours, talk to a health care provider about a health concern**
- First Click:
  - 49% chose "Contact us" as their first click
- Final Selection:
  - 24% chose "Contact us" to complete this task as their final selection
  - 17% "Make an appointment"
  - 10% "Manage your healthcare online > VA Health Chat"

**6. Schedule a phone or video call with a doctor**
- First Click:
  - 61% chose "Make an appointment" as their first click
- Final Selection:
  - 59% chose "Make an appointment" to complete this task as their final selection
  - 12% "Contact us"
  - 10% "Manage your healthcare online > Schedule and manage health appointments"
    - "Schedule and manage health appointments" is a benefit hub page with sign in option, may indicate they expect to do this from their MHV account after log in (existing mental model). 


## Recommendations

- Add VA Health Chat and VA Health Connect links as modalities to the Make an appointment and Contact us pages.
  - Potentially review content organization on these pages for ease of findability.
- Keep links to both VA Health Connect and VA Health Chat in the Manage your healthcare online section.
- Where available, add VA Health Connect phone number where main contact info is present.
  - Provides Veterans, family members, and caregivers a quick access point when they have an immediate concern
  - Additional consideration given to phone label for Veteran understanding of after hours care (24/7 availability)
- When a Pharmacy accordion is present, include VA health chat and health connect as contextually relevant link placements. 


## Next Steps

1. Revise VAMC page designs to include VA Health Chat and VA Health Connect links according to above recommendations 
2. Monitor analytics related to links pointing to VA Health Connect campaign landing page, occuring in parallel to this study and monitor for additional improvements
3. Review possible placement differences in system vs. facility level. The findings did not address this distinction.
