# Research Plan for Facilities team VA health chat and VA health connect link placement

## Background
Unauthenticated VAMC site pages give Veterans multiple methods for contacting their doctors, patient advocates, and other members of their broader health care team. The variety of communication methods, and their placement on VAMC site pages, needs to be validated with Veteran feedback in order to determine which methods Veterans find the most useful, where it is most useful to Veterans to place this information on site pages, and where Veterans expect to find these different methods.

Two of the communication methods Veterans can access are VA health chat and VA health connect (phone). As these tools become increasingly available to Veterans across service regions, there is a need for generative research around link placement that meets Veterans' mental models. 

We will conduct a tree test research study in order to determine the best location on VAMC pages for links to VA health chat and VA health connect. The tree test will be conducted in Optimal Workshop's Treejack tool, which is licensed for use at the VA.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which OCTO priorities does this research support? 
- Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
- Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%.


## Research Goals	
1. The main goal of this study is to identify where Veterans expect contact methods for their healthcare team to be located on VAMC pages.

2. A secondary goal of the study is to identitfy where Veterans expect to find help accessing and using VA health chat and VA health connect. 

### Outcome
The results of the tree test will help inform optimal placement of health chat and health connect links on VAMC pages.

### Research questions
1. Where do Veterans expect to find each of the following methods of communication:
- VA Health Chat?
- VA health connect (24/7 phone)?

2a. Where do Veterans expect to find instructions for accessing VA health chat?

2b. Where do Veterans expect to find information about VA health connect?


### Hypothesis
Most participants will be ablt to identify and locate methods of communication on facility health care pages.

## Methodology	

### IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)
Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains 6 tasks. For each task, the participant will be asked to locate in the menu tree where they believe a specific task can be completed.
**Test logistics**
- Participant will be required to enter their unique code at the beginning and end of the activity
- Tasks will be randomized to reduce order bias
- Participants will be allowed to skip tasks to reduce forced answers
- Participants who skip 100% of tasks will be asked to repeat the activity thoroughly before receiving compensation
- Only participants that have a valid code will be compensated

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans, family members and caregivers. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in a [folder on the sensitive repo](set up and link). We want to have a meeting with Perigean before recruitment begins to make sure there is no confusion with criteria table and screener questions.

Will recruit 6 cohorts of 9 for a total of 54 recruits.  The goal will be to reach at least 36 completes.  The test will remain open for at least 2-3 days after the last invite goes out to give all invited participants a chance to complete the activity. 

### Recruitment criteria 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 
Must belong to one of the groups below:
- Veterans
- Veterans' spouses and dependents
- Veterans' caregivers 

**Secondary criteria (good-to-haves)**

- (use recruitment criteria for underserved demographics)

### Proposed cohorts
- Cohort 1 - Veteran + Female
- Cohort 2 - Veteran + Male
- Cohort 3 - Spouse or dependent of a Veteran + Female
- Cohort 4 - Spouse or dependent of a Veteran + Male
- Cohort 5 - Caregiver of a Veteran + Female
- Cohort 6 - Caregiver of a Veteran + Male

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).
We will finalize key tasks and test set up on Optimal Workshop by March 26, 2023

### Research sessions
- Planned dates of research: 4/1/2024 start until whenever we receive roughly 40 completed tests
- Participants will be able to complete the online activity anytime after receiving the invitation email
- Reminders will be sent as needed
- Recruiting may continue throughout testing period to ensure we meet minimum participant numbers

### Length of sessions
- This is an unmoderated online test. Participants are expected to spend 10 - 15 minutes to complete.

## Team Roles	
- Research lead (contractor, leaving the project 3/28/24): Alexis Logsdon, alexis.logsdon@a1msolutions.com
- OCTO project lead: Amanda Klausmeier, amanda.klausmeier@va.gov
