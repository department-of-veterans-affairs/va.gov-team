## Task based feedback
The following pain point themes are based on responses to the question, "What task were you trying to do today?"

**Campus Maps and Location Information**
- Responses: 27
- Feedback indicates frustration related to finding, downloading, or using facility or campus maps
- Example responses 
  - "download campus map - the pPage says to download the map but gives no link to do so"
  - "I was trying to find the campus and department map to find out where to go for my appointment. Directions to the campus and parking garage are great, but no map for the campus and departments."
  - "The floor map of the DC VA is not correct, it needs to be updated"
  - "Find the campus map for Castle Point"
  - "Trying to locate building where appointment is."
  - "Locate which floor a department is on."
  - "Trying to find room C226 in Bldg 100A .....cannot do that with these maps"
  - "Locate the Campus map… I followed the link but was never able to get to the map!!"
  - "PLEASE, update your campus maps and directories!"
  - "Looking for campus map and could not find one."
  - "The site says to download the file to print the map but there is no file to download."
  - "Trying to locate where building 101 C2. You have a map with 101 but not what C2 is."
- Background: Editors were instructed to link to facility map detail pages from "Campus and building maps” or "Parking" accordions within the “Prepare for your visit” section but they are still too often missing or hard to find. Reaching out to editors with pages needing improvements is a non-engineering approach to improvement. An epic covering enhancements for this topic is in the backlog: [EPIC: VAMC system "Facility map" content type and governance #3049](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/3049)
  - However, all but two of the responses were reported from the campus map page, so map discovery wasn't always the issue. Users had difficulty finding how to download the map or find a specific building or location

**Appointments and Scheduling**
- Responses: 12
- Feedback mentions difficulty scheduling, finding appointment details, or complaints about the appointment. This theme tends to overlap with contact information pain points.
- Example responses
  - "Trying to set up an appointment. I was transferred, disconnected, and was on hold for a total of about an hour and got NOWHERE."
  - "The last few times I've come the service has been HORRIBLE..."
  - "Trying to locate where building 101 C2. You have a map with 101 but not what C2 is."

**Contact Information and Communication**
- Responses: 14
- Feedback indicates a preference for direct numbers and experiences with incorrect numbers, and unanswered or unreturned calls 
- Example responses
  - "Get the number for the Neurology department."
  - "Contact the blood draw clinic at Miami Bruce Carter..."
  - "Contact pharmacy in Fresno VA about unfulfilled prescription."
  - "Scheduling department 216-791-3800 prompt 2 then 2 waits 1-2 minutes answers then they do not talk and hangup."
  - "Contact Wilkes-Barre VAMC dental clinic. Extension goes to some Cisco service and not to the dental clinic."
  - "Please add extensions to ALL your departments here instead of listing just the main medical center number for everything."
  - "Please add extensions to your departments instead of listing the main number over and over again. Not very helpful."
  - "I was trying to return a phone call to Women's Health but I can't find the correct extension and nobody left it in the voicemail."
  - "Please add an extension to Urology for that department."
- Related to the inability to find phone numbers, discovery of incorrect or missing numbers, unanswered or returned calls, or going in circles when attemtping to reach someone by phone
  - Two pain points are within our control: empowering editors to make accurate phone numbers available and presenting them in a way that makes them easy to find and use
    - Surprisingly, none of this feedback was reported from the Contact us page
    - 5 responses were reported from within a health service accordion - 3 of these reported the phone number they found was incorrect 
    - 5 from within the Location and contact information block - 2 of these were looking for specific department numbers
    - All others were reported from a facility page. 
  - The team recently completed an initiative which standardized phone number entry by editors, improving accessibility and usability
  - Enhancements to the Contact us page have been in the backlog and is consistently a quarterly sprint priority: [EPIC: Improve VAMC Contact us page experience #13900](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/13900)

  - "In your effort to make it easier for us older people you just made it too difficult that I will no longer use the service."
