## Pain points
- 76 responses were related to the inability to find phone numbers, discovery of incorrect or missing numbers, unanswered or returned calls, or going in circles when attemtping to reach someone by phone
  - Two pain points are within our control: empowering editors to make accurate phone numbers available and presenting them in a way that makes them easy to find and use
    - Surprisingly, none of this feedback was reported from the Contact us page
    - 5 responses were reported from within a health service accordion - 3 of these reported the phone number they found was incorrect 
    - 5 from within the Location and contact information block - 2 of these were looking for specific department numbers
    - All others were reported from a facility page. 
  - The team recently completed an initiative which standardized phone number entry by editors, improving accessibility and usability
  - Enhancements to the Contact us page have been in the backlog and is consistently a quarterly sprint priority: [EPIC: Improve VAMC Contact us page experience #13900](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/13900)
- 24 responses expressed frustration related to finding, downloading, or using facility or campus maps
  -  Editors were instructed to link to facility map detail pages from "Campus and building maps” or "Parking" accordions within the “Prepare for your visit” section but they are still too often missing or hard to find. Reaching out to editors with pages needing improvements is a non-engineering approach to improvement. An epic covering enhancements for this topic is in the backlog: [EPIC: VAMC system "Facility map" content type and governance #3049](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/3049)
  -  However, all but two of the responses were reported from the campus map page, so map discovery wasn't the issue. Users had difficulty finding how to download the map or find a specific building or location
- 22 responses were frustrated about the new login process
