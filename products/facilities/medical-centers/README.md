## VAMC upgrade work - October 1, 2020 thru December 31, 2020

### Business goal
`By the end of 2020 Q4, we will have 16 Systems ready for Dual-staging.`

- All 8 VISN-19 VAMC sites will be ready and/or in dual-state production on va.gov (eight VISN-8 VAMCs)
  - All new required site content is drafted and published in Drupal Prod (prod.cms.va.gov)
  - All legacy content, files, links, etc. have been accounted for and documented (upgraded or not)
  - All new sites have been fully QA'd by the team and ready to hand off to the business for UAT.
- The team has created and documented (e.g., upgrade runbook, content creation cheatsheets, step-by-step guides, etc.) a repeatable, scalable VAMC site upgrade process in order for VHA to be able to upgrade 134 legacy VAMC system websites over a 24-month period

**What this does not mean:**
- VAMC public affairs teams are trained on Drupal
- Each VAMC has reviewed and finalized their new website's content and information
