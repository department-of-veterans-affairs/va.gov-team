# VA Medical Centers README 

## Product overview
Modernized VAMC websites are comprehensive facility pages designed to meet the needs of Veterans, their families, and caregivers. The pages provide the location details needed to prepare a Veteran to visit and easy access to top tasks and digital health tools. They are powered by a custom Drupal content management system (CMS). Content is differentiated across levels of governance - VHA national, VAMC system and VAMC local facility.

VAMCs are comprised of VAMC Systems, VAMC Facilities, Services, and a number of supporting content types / pages generated and maintained by VHA editors in Drupal.

Additional inputs are
- the public-facing Lighthouse Facilities API for VA owned and operated facilities
- the VA service taxonomy within Drupal
