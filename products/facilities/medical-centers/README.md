## VAMC upgrade work - Oct. 1, 2019 thru April 3, 2020

### Business goal
`By the end of this six-month period, we will have the remaining VISN-4 VAMC Systems ready for production testing.`

**What this means:**
- All 8 VISN-4 VAMC sites are in production on VA.gov (eight VISN-4 VAMCs)
  - All new required site content is drafted and published in Drupal Prod (prod.cms.va.gov)
  - All legacy content, files, links, etc. have been accounted for and documented (upgraded or not)
  - All new sites have been fully QA'd by the team and ready to hand off to the business for UAT
- The team has created and documented (e.g., upgrade runbook, content creation cheatsheets, step-by-step guides, etc.) a repeatable, scalable VAMC site upgrade process in order for VHA to be able to upgrade 134 legacy VAMC system websites over a 24-month period

**What this does not mean:**
- VAMC public affairs teams are trained on Drupal
- Each VAMC has reviewed and finalized their new website's content and information
- We have turned off the old websites and implemented site redirects
