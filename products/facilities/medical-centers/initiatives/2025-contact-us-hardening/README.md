# VAMC Contact Us Initiative Brief 
#### Overview

The Contact Us page & information on VAMC pages is a pain-point for Veterans and their caregivers/family. Editors also encounter issues in the lack of reusable content and organization of the form(s) where they enter Contact Us information.

This initiative will address both the Veteran et al, and the editor experiences.

---

## Problem
- It is difficult for Veterans to find and trust the contact information they seek on VAMC Contact pages. 
   - 5/16/23 Briefing on Foresee data indicated Veterans want accurate and complete information, particularly related to facility and/or individual contact information and phone numbers
   - Medallia feedback consistently includes frustration related to phone numbers - can't find them, no one answers them, long hold times, etc. 
   - [Contact us pages for VAMC have some of the lowest experience ratings across all of VA.gov
   - Veterans repeatedly report they want department extension numbers and cannot find them
- Creating the contact us page is not intuitive for editors. See #12087
- Audit for placeholder content (12/22/23) found 67 systems with "Coming soon" still present on the Contact us pages
   - This info was sent to VHA DM for remediation
- Veterans look for mailing addresses

## Goal
- This initial phase will focus on pages characterized by "Joint Editorial Ownership". Pages for consideration have significant national content, minimal need for localized edits and potential for resuability.

## Project Scope and Scale
#### In scope:

VaMC
- Creation of reusable content
- Governance
- Expansion of the existing content model
- Creation of new content types
- Editorial experience considerations
- Vetern experience considerations
- - Change management in cooperation with VHA Digital Media Team


## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **OBJECTIVE 1:** Veterans are more readily able to find information on VAMC Contact Us pages.
  - **KEY RESULT:** Decreased Veteran complaints regarding lack of readily available information in Contact Us & 0 placeholder content and all information in accordions are populated & reduce by x% number of accessibilty defects % X% increase in CSAT scores
- **OBJECTIVE 2:** Deliver an efficient editorial experience.
  - **KEY RESULT:** Decreased support requests to CMS & 100% of VAMC systems have adopted the new Contact Us age (add blurb about hardening - less blobby)



## Requirements & Research Recommendations

###  Requirements (high-level) from Epic
 This effort should consider all the places where contact information is displayed. See the following information recommendations & screenshot examples (at a minimum) for the following page examples:

- Location and contact information on facility page, such as [Pittsburgh VA Medical Center-University Drive](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/pittsburgh-va-medical-center-university-drive/). Screenshot below:

### Research Recommendations
* From [Research Study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/veteran%20support%20crew/Contact%20us%20page/User%20research/09-2024%20Find%20help%20on%20Contact%20us/Findings.md)

### Add descriptions to phone numbers
- **Hypothesis**: If we add descriptions to better explain the purpose of each VA phone number, then users will read the descriptions and understand which phone number can help them the most.
- **Risks**: We know people primarily read headings to scan. Some people don't read body text. The Contact us page will also become longer if we continue added content to it.
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider the Contact us page as a multi-page experience. Or hide content through accordions, additional info, or other components.
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks on phone number links 

### Update "Contact us online through Ask VA" heading
- **Hypothesis**: If we update the heading to better explain what Ask VA is, then users will choose to send an online message to VA more.
- **Risks**: Any language around "messaging" may get conflated with VA secure messaging.
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider grouping VA secure messaging and Ask VA under a single "messaging" label
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks on Ask VA link

### Add VA secure messaging
- **Hypothesis**: If we add a link to VA secure messaging, then users will know where to send messages to their VA health care team.
- **Risks**: The Contact us page will become longer if we continue added content to it. People may think they can ask questions that their care team can't answer. People may choose VA secure messaging rather than Ask VA when Ask VA is more appropriate. 
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider the Contact us page as a multi-page experience. Clarify the distinction between Ask VA and VA secure messaging.
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks to VA secure messaging

### Update "Helpful online tools" heading
- **Hypothesis**: If we update the heading to better explain what users can use helpful online tools for, then users will choose to access online tools more. 
- **Risks**: n/a 
- **Mitigating risks**: n/a 
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks to online tools

### Add description to "Helpful online tools" section
- **Hypothesis**: If we add descriptions to better explain what users can use helpful online tools for, then users will read the description and understand helpful online tools.
- **Risks**: We know people primarily read headings to scan. Some people don't read body text. The Contact us page will also become longer if we continue added content to it.
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider the Contact us page as a multi-page experience.
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks to online tools

 ### Identify top-used online tools and add them to the page (possibly compare with what's in the VA mobile app)
- **Hypothesis**: If we identify top-used online tools, then users will be more likely find online tools that will help them.
- **Risks**: People may not find the tool they need in our list of tools. 
- **Mitigating risks**: Consider redirecting people somewhere else if they can't find what they're looking for.
- **Measuring impact**: Clicks to online tools

### Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>.

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
