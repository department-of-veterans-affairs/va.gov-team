# Manila Outpatient Clinic - VAMC page

The VA has a medical clinic within the US embassy in Manila, Philippines. This is the last VA medical center that maintains a web presence on an older TeamSite page (https://www.visn21.va.gov/locations/manila.asp), and does not have a presence on the modernized VA.gov. 

At the end of August 2024, the VISN 21 page in which the Manila VA Clinic page is housed will migrate to WordPress, and the Manila center page will be orphaned. 
Thus, VHA DM would like to prioritize planning a modernized presence for the Manical VA Clinic on VA.gov. 

However, Manila is a special type of facility, and does not cleanly map to any existing data architecture for VA Clinics, VA Medical Centers, or Benefit offices. Custom content modeling will likely be required to support its special needs, similar to VA Lovell.
