## Feature background

New options for Veterans to connect with clinicians for health related needs add to an already complicated landscape which contains main facility phone numbers, crisis lines and mental health phone numbers. Each option has its own use case and it may be confusing for Veterans to find the right communication method for their needs and/or differentiate between the tools. 

New options include
- VA health chat - a live chat live with a clinician for issues such as medical advice for a minor injury or illness, medication questions, and lab/imaging test results
- Secure messaging - an async service for non-urgent, non-emergency health-related questions 
- VA health connect - a live phone Clinical contact center 
- Telehealth - remote visits with health care providers

## UX Discovery
This table includes discovery efforts across the VAMC communication landscape.

## UX research studies
Research should be conducted to 
- identify where on VAMC pages Veterans expect to find the various methods of communication
- validate the labels used to describe the communication methods found on VAMC pages.
- identify why a Veteran would chose one particular communication method as opposed to another.

A [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/VAMC-communications-methods/Research-Plan.md) and [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/VAMC-communications-methods/Conversation-Guide.md) have been prepared for this work.
