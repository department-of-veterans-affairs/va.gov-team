# VAMC Communications - Conversation Guide

## Guide for note taking

Thank you note takers! Here's a breakdown of what we're hoping to highlight in this study, in terms of Veteran feedback:

- **Which** communication methods have Veterans used?
- **What** communications methods do Veterans prefer to use?
- **How** do Veterans locate these communication methods? (This involves the usability tasks outlined below)
- **When** do Veterans consider using specific communications methods - under what circumstances?
- **What** labels or descriptions to Veterans associate with these communication methods?

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Mute your Slack notifications*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.*

*In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Make sure task-flow site links are ready to share
- [ ] Have Optimal Workshop links ready to share
- [ ] Make sure Mural data has been recorded, and that Mural is reset for each participant

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Nick, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the different ways of communicating with VA facilities and health care personnel, that are available on site pages. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **During this session, you may need to share your screen.** Are you comfortable sharing your screen?
    - **Yes:** Ok, please make sure no personal information like email, etc. is visible on your screen before you share.
    - **No:** Ok no problem, for our tasks today I will share my screen and you can walk me through your process - I will explain again before we start.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1) Can you tell me a little bit about how you communicate with your health care team: what methods have you used?
    - **If none:** How would you prefer to communicate with your health care people?
2) Do you have a preferred method of contacting VA facilities or health care personnel?
    - **If yes:**
        - Why do you prefer that one?
        - Is there anything you wished was different about this experience?
        - How did you learn about, or find it?
        - Have you used other methods?
    - **If no:**
        - Is there a method that you would prefer, that we don't have?
3) What makes a communication experience enjoyable for you? (What makes it good?)

## Task 1: Usability testing - 20 minutes

**Task description:**
- For this task, we will start on a VA.gov page, and then from that page, I will ask you to navigate your way to a particular goal, however you choose.

**Begin:**

1) Task flow from [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/)
    - Starting form the VA.gov page, let's say you want to find the phone number of the VA health facility that is closest to you - thinking out loud, can you walk me through how you might do this?
2) Task flow from [system-level health care page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/)
    - For the next page, we will use Pittsburgh health care as an example.
    - Starting from the Pittsburgh health system page, let's say you want to see a list of all communication options available to you. How might you do that?
4) Task flow from [facility-level health care page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/pittsburgh-va-medical-center-university-drive/)
    - Finally, starting on another Pittsburgh health care page, let's say you want to send a secure message to your doctor or health care team. How might you do this?

**[Moderator notes:]**

- Try to get the participant to think out loud.
- Remind them they can leave the page to go elsewhere, if they feel they need to.
- If they get stuck, what did they expect to find wherever they ended up?
- Resetting to the start page once is fine, but if they get stuck that's part of the findings.

## Task 2: Tree test - 15 minutes

Tree testing will use [Optimal Workshop's Treejack](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack/) tools. [Create in Optimal Workshop closer to date of study]

**Task description:**
- For this task, we will take a look at how links and headings are displayed on certain pages. I will ask you under which headings you expect to find what you are looking for. You can also suggest a new option, if you choose.

1) Tree test from system-level health care page
    - Side nave tree test
        1) VA Health Chat allows for real-time chat messages with a VA health care personnel. Where would you expect to find VA Health Chat?
        2) VA telehealth allows you to video call VA health care personnel. Where would you expect to find VA telehealth?
        3) VA Health Connect is a 24/7 health care phone number. Where would you expect to find VA Health Connect?
    - Page heading/top task tree test
        1) VA Health Chat allows for real-time chat messages with a VA health care personnel. Where would you expect to find VA Health Chat?
        2) VA telehealth allows you to video call VA health care personnel. Where would you expect to find VA telehealth?
        3) VA Health Connect is a 24/7 health care phone number. Where would you expect to find VA Health Connect?
3) Tree test from facility-level health care page
    - Page heading tree test
        1) VA Health Chat allows for real-time chat messages with a VA health care personnel. Where would you expect to find VA Health Chat?
        2) VA telehealth allows you to video call VA health care personnel. Where would you expect to find VA telehealth?
        3) VA Health Connect is a 24/7 health care phone number. Where would you expect to find VA Health Connect?

**Moderator notes:**

- Try to get the participant to think out loud, as they are deliberating.
- Ask why they made the final choice that they did.
- If they chose "Another link/heading" option, what's their suggestion?

## Task 3: Contextual inquiry - 10 minutes
- For this final task, I will ask you a few questions about the kinds of labels that accompany communication methods on VA.gov sites.
- [Contextual inquiry Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1646769310259/6ca0b11d0a55138780cfc6a03f4da72718e5932e?sender=u8a90be72499ecb4354e14700)

1) Questions about labels.
    - You need to contact a health care facility to ask a question about its hours of operation. Which communication label best applies, if any?
    - You need to contact your health care team about the results of recent check up. Which communication label best applies, if any?
    - You want to make an appointment with your health care team. Which communication label best applies, if any?
    - You need to speak to someone immediately about a health care question. Which communication label best applies, if any?

**Moderator notes:**

- Try to get a sense of which labels are confusing.
- Let participants know they can say none of them apply.
- What might the participant expect or suggest, if none apply?

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- Based on your experience with the VA.gov pages, is there anything you would like to comment on that we haven't discussed?
- Is there anything about the communication methods that already exist, that you would change or add to?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    **If Yes:** Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
