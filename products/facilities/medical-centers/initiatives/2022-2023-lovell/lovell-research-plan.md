# Research Plan for Lovell Federal Experience Testing, June 2022

## Background
The Lovell Federal Facility services both VA beneficiaries as well as DoD/TRICARE beneficiaries.

However, the unauthenticated top tasks for these beneficiaries are accomplished in separate locations, making the experience confusing. Additionally, there is content that is specific to each type of location that needs to be separated for clarity and conciseness.

Veterans are already familiar with the modernized location design, however, the split between the VA beneficiaries locations and content, and the DoD/TRICARE beneficiaries locations and content will be a new experience for them.

This bespoke health care system research is building upon earlier VAMC research.

* Maintaining my health

Putting Down Roots
* Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring
* Taking care of myself (Moment that Matters)

Aging

## Research Goals	

The primary goals of this research are to determine:
* Whether Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans know where they can receive care at Lovell Federal Health Care Center.
* Whether participants notice and understand the informational alert.
* Whether dual-eligible Veterans understand when to use the VA health care experience vs. the TRICARE health care experience.

### Outcome

This research will help to determine whether the design solution is understood by Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans, or if additional iterations are needed.

### Research questions

* Will Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans know where they can receive care at Lovell Federal Health Care Center?
* Will participants notice and understand the informational alert?
* Will dual-eligible Veterans understand when to user the VA health care experience vs. the TRICARE health care experience?

### Hypothesis

We already know that Veterans are familiar with a location experience that does not separate out locations by type of beneficiary.
We already know that research has been conducted on the existing VAMC experience.

* Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans will be able to identify whether the page they are on is for VA or TRICARE health care beneficiaries.
* The informational alerts helps Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans understand whether they're viewing VA or TRICARE health information, and to navigate to the other experience, if desired.

Veterans are familiar with a location experience that does not separate the experience by beneficiary, but they will be able to identify which health care they need and where they can find it.

## Method	
Research Method:
* Usability testing.
* We will not be testing with screen readers because the designs are in UXPin, the design has been reviewed by the collaboration cycle, and the foundation of the VAMC pages have already been tested.
* Not testing on mobile because the VAMC pages have already been tested on mobile during the VAMC redesign testing.

Includes task flows from specific starting points:

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

Using Perigean recruiting, we would like to schedule 20 participants to reach our goal of observing 10 participants.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

* At least 5 participants must be enrolled in only VA health care
* At least 5 participants must be retired from active duty and actively enrolled in VA health care and TRICARE health care.
* Laptop or desktop computer only
  * For this study, mobile devices may introduce technical difficulties, or make it more difficult for participants to complete the task, so we are limited participants to laptop or desktop computers only.
* Be able to screenshare via Zoom
  * Please confirm beforehand that participant is able to use Zoom, and is familiar with screen sharing
* At least 2 participants under 35 years old
* At least 2 participants over 55 years old
* At least 2 participant with cognitive disabilities
* At least 5 participants with no college degree or professional certificates
* At least 5 participants of color

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

* Mix of Veterans and Caregivers
* All genders
* A mix of rural and urban participants

## Timeline

### Prepare
