# Research Goals 

The Lovell Federal Facility services both VA beneficiaries as well as DoD/TRICARE beneficiaries. However, the unauthenticated top tasks for these beneficiaries are accomplished in separate locations, making the experience confusing. Additionally, there is content that is specific to each type of location that needs to be separated for clarity and conciseness.

The legacy Lovell website combines the VA & TRICARE information in a single site. The team created a prototype that splits VA & TRICARE information into two separate sites in the modernized VAMC template. The two sites are connected by informational alerts that allow users to switch back and forth between between the TRICARE and VA versions of the page they are on.

This bespoke health care system research is building upon earlier VAMC research.

# Research Questions

1. Will Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans know where they can receive care at Lovell Federal Health Care Center?
2. Will participants notice and understand the informational alert?
3. Will dual-eligible Veterans understand when to use the VA health care experience vs. the TRICARE health care experience?

# Methodology

* Usability testing using UXPin
* We did not test with screen readers because the designs are in UXPin, the design has been reviewed by the collaboration cycle, and the foundation of the VAMC pages have already been tested
* Not testing on mobile because the VAMC pages have already been tested on mobile during the VAMC redesign testing

Includes task flows from specific starting points:
* [Lovell VA beneficiary system page](https://preview.uxpin.com/85c0c5e5501b4c222f4d37bfdd4d6eb59dd93386#/pages/150395163/simulate/no-panels) 
* [Lovell TRICARE beneficiary system page](https://preview.uxpin.com/85c0c5e5501b4c222f4d37bfdd4d6eb59dd93386#/pages/150395168/simulate/no-panels)
* [VA Lovell location](https://preview.uxpin.com/85c0c5e5501b4c222f4d37bfdd4d6eb59dd93386#/pages/150395164/simulate/no-panels) 
* [TRICARE Lovell location](https://preview.uxpin.com/85c0c5e5501b4c222f4d37bfdd4d6eb59dd93386#/pages/150395169/simulate/no-panels)

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

We already know that Veterans are familiar with a location experience that does not separate out locations by type of beneficiary.
We already know that research has been conducted on the existing VAMC experience.

* Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans will be able to identify whether the page they are on is for VA or TRICARE health care beneficiaries.
  * NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION - Only a few participants successfully identified the distinction between VA and TRICARE. Several participants attempted to use site features that were not functional in the prototype that led to artifical dead ends. 
* The informational alerts helps Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans understand whether they're viewing VA or TRICARE health information, and to navigate to the other experience, if desired.
  * FALSE - Across all participants and tasks, the informational alert was only noticed only 7/22 times = 32% success rate

# Key Findings

Labels: [PRDT: Facilities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/PRDT%3A%20Facilities), [RESRCH: Remote](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/RESRCH%3A%20Remote), [AUD: Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/AUD%3A%20Veterans)

## Usability Findings
Labels: [RESRCH: Usability](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/RESRCH%3A%20Usability), [DSC: Alert boxes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/DSC%3A%20Alert%20boxes)

1. Across all participants and tasks, the informational alert was only noticed only 7/22 times = 32% success rate

2. Many participants were attempting to utilize other navigational elements that they were already familiar with to get to their destination:
   - Site search
   - Find a location
   - On this page
   - Health services

3. Most participants began (or continued) their task by first scrolling through the page they were already on

4. Top Task buttons are the primary call-to-action on the page and compete with the informational alert

## Findings related to TRICARE & VA Benefits
Labels: [BNFT: Healthcare](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels/BNFT%3A%20Healthcare)

1. When asking VA beneficiaries whether they are familiar with TRICARE, most indicated they were aware of it, but didn’t know much about it

2. Most of our participants either use one or the other, almost exclusively. There are few instances of Veterans using both.

3. Why dual-eligible Veterans choose VA or TRICARE:
   - Local facility convenience - 3/5 
   - Familiarity with system - 2/5
   - Coverage for specific health services - 2/5
   - Different family members use different benefits - 1/5

4. The actual journey to receive care and benefits isn’t always clear to Veterans

## Findings related to VA.gov usage

1. Most participants indicated they visit VA.gov weekly. Most common reasons include: Pay bills, secure messaging, appointments, MyHealtheVet, checking claims, finding forms, prescription refills.

2. Most Veterans are attempting to complete very specific tasks while on VA.gov, and don’t browse very often

3. Many of the Veterans we spoke to indicated the high number of other emails, phone calls, and other communications they receive

4. When searching for a location, the majority of Veterans we spoke to would immediately start at Google.

# Recommendations 
This research was focused on the usability of the informational alert as an “experience switcher.” This research plan was not designed to identify alternate solutions.

Additional discovery and research is recommended on the following gaps before a path forward can be determined:

* More refined understanding of shared vs. separate VA and DoD content
* Differing VA and DoD Services taxonomy
* Explore a single site architecture
