This document provides answers to frequently asked questions about the VA Medical Center (VAMC) website upgrade project. This document is intended only for internal use by VA staff and VA contractors.

## General

**What is the VAMC website upgrade project?**

It is a VA digital modernization initiative to provide a better customer experience on the VA.gov website. Research indicated that the old VAMC websites were not meeting the need of users, so we worked to design a new experience that empowers users to get to top content and tools in just a few clicks. A better digital experience should mean fewer phone calls to VAMCs to get basic information or ask for help.

**Why is VA doing this?**

The new VAMC websites are part of VA’s work to execute on the VA Digital Modernization Vision, which includes consolidating and integrating VA’s top web properties (“brands”) into one user experience on the new VA.gov. This helps fulfill the VA CTO’s goal to have VA's online experience match that of a typical Fortune 500 company.

**Why is VA Digital Modernization and VA Web Brand Consolidation so important?**

VA is committed to executing on VA Secretary Wilkie’s number one priority: customer service.

Veterans, family members, caregivers, and service members all told VA the same thing over years of research and feedback sessions: navigating VA’s websites is confusing, there is too much duplicative content, and it’s hard to tell which information is accurate. Providing a best-in-class user experience on the new VA.gov is VA’s answer to making the online experience better meet the needs of Veterans, family members, caregivers, and service members.

**How much research went into the new website design?**

A lot. We conducted research with 900 participants over 9 months. VHA Digital Media partnered with OIT Digital Experience Product Office to research, design, test, and build the new website design with Veterans, family members, caregivers, and patient advocates.

**Is this a content migration project?**

No. We are not automatically moving ("migrating") old VAMC website content into the new VAMC website. Any "old" content that PAOs want to move to the new website will need to manually be moved over (i.e., copied and pasted) and/or re-written.

**Why is there so much less content in the new website design?**

The new website design is focused on top tasks and content that Veterans, families, and caregivers need most. Additionally, website analytics and data for the old websites show that users are mostly looking for health services, facilitiy services, contact information, and appointments and pharamcy information--all parts of the new website that have been prioritized in the design. Of the hundreds of content pages each old VAMC website has, users are only going to about 5-10 pages.

**Do we get to keep our old VAMC website URL/subdomain?**

Yes. You can continue to use your subdomain in marketing materials, in email sugnatures, and on merchandise. Your old subdomain will automatically redirect to your new VA.gov URL. 

Example: pittsburgh.va.gov will redirect to va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care

We currently have no plans for these redirects to expire.

**Will the website URLs go to a 404 error when users go to an old URL?**

No. We built page redirects, so any URLs from the old website will go to the new website's homepage. There are no 1:1 page redirects--everything redirects to the new website's homepage.

Example: pittsburgh.va.gov/patients/appointments.asp will get redirected to va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care

Users also get an “onboarding” modal/pop-up the first time they access the new website.

**Should we update our old URLs in our booklets, pamphlets, brochures, fact sheets, and other materials?**

Yes. You should prioritize removing and updating old/retired URLs in any materials that you print. You should update all your materials to point customers to new VAMC website URLs (e.g., va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/register-for-care/).

**What about business cards?**

If you have your subdomain printed on your business card (e.g., pittsburgh.va.gov), then there is nothing you need to do.

If you have an old URL printed on your business care (e.g., pittsburgh.va.gov/patients/appointments.asp), then you should request new business cards with the new URL. If someone goes to an old URL, they will be redirected to your new website's homepage (e.g., va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care).

**What about the VA.gov Facility Locator tool and VA Facilities API?**

When each VAMC website is upgraded and launched on the new VA.gov, then the facility website links will also be updated in the VA Facility Locator tool (va.gov/find-locations) and in the VA Facilities API data (developer.va.gov/explore/facilities).

**What about Google?**

Within 30 to 90 days after a new VAMC website launches, Google (and other search engines) will automatically update their search results to point to the new website.

## About the new CMS

**What is the new content management system (CMS)?**

VA built a custom implementation of Drupal. This new CMS only powers new parts of VA.gov.

**Does the new CMS have facility alerts, operating statuses, and GovDelivery/Granicus email triggers?**

Yes. You will have the same functionality that you currently have using Teamsite.

**What will happen to Teamsite?**

Teamsite will continue to power old/legacy parts of VA.gov. You will continue to have access to it, even after your new VAMC website laucnhes and you switch to using Drupal.

**What will happen to all the old content on the old website/in Teamsite?**

It will no longer be indexed by Google and other search engines, but you will still be able to go into Teamsite to access it.

**My old website has embedded videos--what will we do with them?**

The new CMS and VA.gov do not support hosting videos (i.e., storing the video in the cloud and serving it up for end users).

If you want to include any videos on your new website, you have two options:

1. Publish a hyperlink on a website page that takes users to an external website that hosts the video

2. Publish embed code to embed a YouTube video on a website page

VHA Digital Media requires that all videos be hosted on the official VHA YouTube account (https://www.youtube.com/user/VeteransHealthAdmin). Contact Jenny Heiland-Leudtke with questions, or to see whether your video should be added to the VHA YouTube account.
