## Research goals

To understand how mobile clinics are being used across the country, so that we accurately represent them on VA.gov facility web pages.

## Methodology

1-hour moderated individual or group stakeholder interviews over Teamsite.

## Who we spoke with

We interviewed 16 VA employees, in various roles who run and manage the MMU programs and services:
 - 2 - Emergency managers
 - 6 - Health programs and operations management 
(physicians, nurses and clinic managers)

As well as those who publicize MMU events and information to Veterans:
 - 7 - Public Affairs and communications officers
 - 1- Veteran outreach coordinator


## Research findings

##### 1. Mobile clinics, events and services will not be adequately represented by the current model of 1 webpage per vehicle. 
##### 2. PAOs are apprehensive or resistant to adopting upgraded websites
##### 3. The list of Mobile clinics in VAST is inaccurate
##### 4. Communicating MMU/MVC deployment after an emergency may not be done consistently on VA.gov, or at all.
##### 5. Collaboration between VHA and Vet Centers is inconsistent at best and needs work


## Research findings with details

### 1. Mobile clinics, events and services will not be adequately represented by the current model of 1 webpage per vehicle. 


- A mobile asset may be owned by a particular facility but it's custodianship falls under emergency management who can deploy it at any time, for different needs, crossing health system and catchment area borders. 
- Mobile clinics, MMUs, MUVs vary widely in their use and purpose. Some of the use cases we learned about in this study were:

    Non-emergency:
    - Used as primary care clinics to offer scheduled appointments by a predictable schedule
    - Used as dedicated space for a CBOC to deliver scheduled specialty care; cardiology
    - Ability to connect to a secure weblink as one reason for choice of location
    - Used as private space for counseling during planned outreach events
    - Walk-in services during a planned event

    During emergency response:
    - Used to deliver primary care in high visibility location 
    - Used to deliver food, showers, mental health counseling
    - Used by VHA staff for counseling even when typically staffed by Mobile Vet Center


   #### Recommendation: 

   - Offer multiple solutions driven by the service being offered, e.g.
   
     -  Recurring and scheduled primary care = dedicated webpage (current VAMC)
     -  Temporary event or emergency response = event page(s)
     -  Specialty service offered by an MMU = service accordion under parent facility page

### 2. PAOs are apprehensive or resistant to adopting upgraded websites

- PAO staffing and capabilities vary widely across VISNs, systems, and facilities. Some PAOs don’t feel adequately staffed or trained or supported to maintain a website. Current web solutions don’t factor in this variability. 
- PAOs prefer to update their facilities' Facebook pages than their current official website.

     - Risk: Facebook posts are often created as flat text embedded within images e.g. flyers, which are not accessible


   #### Recommendation: 

   - More discovery work to understand PAO tools, processes, needs and pain points. 
   - Find ways to improve relationships with PAOs, and create solutions that take their needs into account.

     - Help PAOs be more efficient, encourage adoption of tools; Facebook posting from events pages. What is this process like today? If you had to create an event page for 42 counties, could you duplicate it or do you have to make 42 pages from scratch? What are the friction points?

### 3. The list of Mobile clinics in VAST is inaccurate

- Emergency Management must be able to track the status and location of all (CDRs) Critical Deployable Resources, including MMUs? What system houses this data?Can we leverage this? 

### 4. Communicating MMU/MVC deployment after an emergency may not be done consistently on VA.gov, or at all.

 We learned that there are barriers to updating the status of an MMU on Teamsite in a timely manner following an emergency.
   - Emergencies often happen after hours making coming into the office to update a website impractical 
      - Facebook is easier to update than the website
   - Hesitancy in adopting a new tool
   - Belief that Veterans won't be going to VA.gov for information after an emergency


   #### Recommendation: 

   - Get an updated list of all Mobile Units from emergency management, OR
   - Send out a mandatory survey to PAOs having them confirm or correct the MMU inventory

### 5. Collaboration between VHA and Vet Centers is inconsistent at best and needs work

- MMUs and MVCs (Mobile Vet Centers) can be used and deployed interchangeably for different situations and may be parked next to each other without the other knowing. VA staff that we interviewed report poor collaboration between VHA and Vet Centers, explaining how inconsistent it is across the country and even hinting at adversarial in some cases. This is not good for the Veteran or VA staff. This means Veterans are not being effectively routed to potential care and benefits.
- In past research, Vet Center staff voiced concerns over the negative relationship between VHA and Vet Center. In this study, VHA staff volunteered the same concern.
- Health systems where VHA and VC work together effectively, like Orlando, have acknowledged the issue and put practices in place to rectify it. However, this scenario seems to be an outlier, due to considerable concerted effort by motivated staff, rather than the norm.
- In past research, Veterans expressed anger and resentment that they were not informed of Vet Center mental health care options by their VHA mental health providers.

   #### Recommendation: 

    - Identify the entity most receptive to responding to this finding and share: Veteran experience office?
    - More research is needed to understand the problem and additional downstream effects that it may be causing Veterans and staff.



## Recommendations 

(in order of priority)

1. Create the ability for facility locator to surface events
   
   - Consider creating event types for future filtering, e.g. healthcare event, emergency response, community outreach

2. Get an updated list of all Mobile Units:

   i. [Stan covering this?] OR
   
   ii. From emergency management, OR
   
   ii. Send out a mandatory survey [via optimal workshop] to PAOs [with help from leadership] having them confirm or correct the MMU inventory 
      - share early design concepts [embedded images with room for feedback]
      - solicit ideas [open box]
      - solicit volunteers to work with us for deeper user testing

3. Prototype design options and solicit PAO feedback [existing low fidelity wireframes may suffice]
   - Offer PAOs multiple solutions driven by the service being offered:
     -  Recurring and scheduled primary care = dedicated webpage (current VAMC experience)
     -  Temporary event or emergency response = event page(s) under hosting health system or nearest to where event will be held
     -  Specialty service offered by an MMU = service accordion under parent facility page

4. Increase empathy and understanding for our internal users: 
  
   i. More discovery work to understand PAO tools, processes, needs and pain points. 
   
   - Leverage/gather input from other VA web teams (CMS?) who interact with PAOs, maintainers
   - Find ways to improve relationships with PAOs, and create solutions that take their needs into account 
     - Validate and refine [proto persona](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1627038564401/bdd84c5da65e1000f7d3d2f2d365d03839a1466e?wid=0-1627502345353&outline=open)
     - PAO Job shadow (ethnographic research) to understand context, tools (Facebook vs our website) and processes
     - Walk-thrus of user flows, barriers, and areas of improvement when updating the status of an MMU in emergency response
     - Help PAOs be more efficient, encourage adoption of tools; Facebook posting from events pages. What is this process like today? are improvements needed to make this more attractive? If you had to create an event page for 42 county healthcare events, could you duplicate pages or do you have to make 42 pages from scratch each time? What are the friction points?
     - Offer training and teach benefits of adopting tools, e.g. accessible Facebook posts


6. Vet Center <:> VHA collaboration issue: 
    - Identify the entity most receptive to responding to this finding and share: Veteran experience office?
    - More research is needed to understand the problem and additional downstream effects that it may be causing Veterans and staff.

## Next steps

1. Discuss findings and recommendations with Facilities team
2. Submit high level concepts into Collab cycle
3. Refine mockups
4. Create PAO survey (if recommendation is adopted)
5. User test ideas with PAO
6. User test ideas with Veterans
