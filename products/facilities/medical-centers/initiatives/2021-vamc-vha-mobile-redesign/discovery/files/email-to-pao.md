Requesting mobile clinic information for webpage redesign

## Body:

Hello [Name], 

I work on the VA.gov Facilities digital product team. We’re preparing to redesign mobile clinic webpages and as with all our product improvement initiatives, we like to start with research first. For this effort, we’d like to talk with people who manage and work with mobile clinics so that we can focus on the most impactful improvements. 

Some of the things that we want to learn:

- Which Veteran populations use your mobile clinic(s)
- How do Veterans learn about mobile clinic hours, locations, etc. today
- What services are provided by your mobile clinic 
- What does eligibility look like and how are appointments scheduled? 
- What webpage improvements would you like to see on this page:


Are you available next week to chat for about an hour?  Also, let me know if there’s someone else that you think would be better suited to help us answer these questions.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your help,
