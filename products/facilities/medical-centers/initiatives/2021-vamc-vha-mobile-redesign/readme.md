# VAMC VHA Mobile clinic / MMU: Research and Design

## [Initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/initiative-brief.md)


## Design

### Final design
 **Note:** The final design is the MVP solution, "smallest slice", that unblocks health systems to publish mobile clinic facility pages with multiple schedules but **does not address** all the use cases uncovered as detailed in [discovery research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/research-findings.md) and [design validation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery-round-2/research-findings.md) documentation below.

 - [Prototype in UXPin - Oct 2021](https://preview.uxpin.com/20fd05cf8e86ce628f0c813166424d0a6ca38bfd#/pages/142019860/documentation/sitemap) - Final MVP design with specs and documentation
 - [UXPin file (.UXP)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/design/Mobile%20Clinic%20Schedule%20Section.uxp) - downloadable UXPin file, in case the prototype link ever breaks

#### Design Validation
- [Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery-round-2/research-findings.md) - design feedback discussions with 2 health systems using MVP design
   - Purpose: to validate or invalidate the MVP design of the new schedule section for use by mobile clinic/MMU facility types: 
     - 1) Identify problems with design 
     - 2) Discover opportunities to consider for future iterations. 


## Discovery

### Initial discovery sprint with 5 health systems (PAOs, clinical managers, emergency mgmt) 

Purpose: To understand how mobile clinics are being used across the country, so that we accurately represent them on VA.gov facility web pages.

#### Discovery/Design Round 1    
   - [Synthesis board in Mural with MMU/Mobile uses cases & Round 1 design](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/initiatives/2021-vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/files/MMU-Discovery-Phase-2.pdf) - Collection of MMU use cases from interviews with PAOs, emergency management and clinical staff. On the right side of the Mural, is a first round of design solutions/exploration for the various use cases.
