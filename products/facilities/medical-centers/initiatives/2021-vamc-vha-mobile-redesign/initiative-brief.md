# Initiative Brief: VAMC VHA Mobile Redesign 
 
---

## Outcome Summary
Although mobile clinics are very different than physical clinics in service offerings, availability, and location, they currently are represented with the same detail page format/layout/content as physical health care clinic locations. The current presentation of information is likely causing Veteran confusion.

## Problem Statement

_What is the problem?_

The VAMC MVP detail page was designed with fixed locations offering multiple services in mind. As systems have rolled out nationwide, we realized there are other types of facilities - 
- _mobile_ locations offering multiple services (mobile clinics)
- fixed locations offering _one/minimal_ services (domiliciaries and community living centers) 

The information displayed for mobile locations is misleading, incomplete and/or inaccurate. Our Veterans deserve better. We need to reimagine the appropriate experience for mobile detail pages within the VAMC product.
-The current VAMC page displays one address, which is probably where it is parked overnight - rather than representing the various locations where services are delivered/available.
- The current VAMC page displays one set of hours - which may not represent true availability.
- The current VAMC page is required to include Parking and Transportation service accordions, which may not be relevant to a mobile location
_(See annotated image below)_

_Which Veteran/organizational segments are most affected by the problem?_
The primary audience for a given set of VAMC pages is the Veterans and caregivers assigned to that health care system. There are at least 60 identified mobile clinics across the country - impacting systems disproportionately. For example, four of the ten Cheyenne health care locations are mobile. ALthough these locations often serve large rural areas, they are also found in urban locations. 

_Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?_
Mobile clinics were not part of the initial Pittsburgh pilot so the special attributes of this type of location were not foreseen. 

_How does this outcome help achieve a prioritized Crew Objective and further DE's mission and goals?_

**DE Goal 2:** Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

**DE Objective 10:** Improve accuracy of health service information at VA facilities

**DE Goal 3:** Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

## Desired User Outcomes
_With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?_
Veterans will be able to more fully understand where, how and when they can receive VA health care services.


## Desired Business Outcomes

_With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?_
This work can benefit both the VAMC and Facility Locator prduct. 
Once we are confident in the accuracy and completness of these mobile facilities descriptions, including their service information, then we can begin to surface these locations on the Facility Locator in a meaningful way.

## Measuring Success (TBD)

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*Which of your product's existing KPIs will you look at to understand if your solution is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about undesired outcome? Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports?*

- KPI | Target | Link to data source


<!--
| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

- Viability:

## Discovery
*Describe the experiments, prototypes, etc. you'll develop to efficiently validate your assumptions.*

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

## Prioritization
*Describe and prioritize the competing hypotheses the team develops as a result of discovery accounting for effort, impact, value, confidence.*
