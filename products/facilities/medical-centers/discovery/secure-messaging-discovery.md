[IN PROGRESS]

## Secure Messaging Discovery

Discovery for issue [#27687](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27687). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

### Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.

### Methodology

Informational interview with secure messaging SME(s).

### Key Findings

- **Where does this product fit into the Veteran journey?** ([Patient Experience journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Patient%20Experience%20Journey%20Map.pdf) || [Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf))
    - Patient experience: before or after a visit; at any point a patient needs to communicate with their health care team, when not in-person
    - Veteran journey: from the point a Veteran is registered for VA health care, secure messaging could apply anytime a Veteran needs to communicate with their health care team
- **What is a typical use case for this product?**
    - Sheduling appointments
    - Requesting prescription refills
    - Non-urgent general health care questions
- **Why would a Veteran use this, as opposed to something like [Health Chat](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27686)?**
    - Benficial to have a record of previous communications (see [Digital Modernization research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/discovery/Digital%20Helath%20Modernization%20-%20Research.pdf))
    - Works on Veteran's own schedules; relieves pressure of real-time communicaiton via chat or phone
- **What does a Veteran need to know about this?**
    - Secure messaging cannot be used for emergency or urgent communication
    - Health care teams are different, and Veterans and their team must agree on if, and how, they want to use secure messaging
    - Veterans can only communicate with health care teams they are authorized to communicate with

## SME Interview(s)

### Additional questions

- Does messaging connect directly to a specifc health care team, or at the system level first?
- How do Veterans currently learn about secure messaging? (ie. Are health care teams supposed to inform them?)
- Can Veterans ask general non health care questions? (ie. Questions about their education benefits?)

**SME:** Jen Echer, UX Designer, Ad Hoc (research and design for secure messaging mobile app)

- Secure messaging is a trusted and preferred method of communication, preferred over phone calls, and second only to in-person conversation.
- Depending on the health care team, secure messaging can be used for a variety of purposes including: filling prescriptions, appointments, and even scheduling rides. Messages are triaged by a Veteran's health care team, and it depends on what the team is open to using messaging for.
- Developing a relationship with the health care team was important for Veterans, in establishing communication norms. Degree of responsiveness varied depending on the team, but officially it's supposed to be within 3 business days.
- On the health care team side, there is training and onboarding they must go through before using secure messaging.
- Secure messaging isn't for introductory purposes: a Veteran must already be registered and in contact with their health care team, and they can only communicate with health care providers they are authorized for - no contacting different people in different health systems [like for more information or second opinions].
- Health care providers may be somewhat distrustful of more apps to use, including secure messaging, if they already have established methods.
