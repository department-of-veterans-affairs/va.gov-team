# Research Plan for CMS Team, Facilities Research Round 2, March 22-27



## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for? 
This document outlines the details for the first round of usability testing on the facilities sections on VA.gov (E.g. pittsburgh.va.gov )
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
- The VA.gov CMS team is researching the new IA, CMS template design, and copy for this Veteran-facing facility site on VA.gov. According to site traffic, pittsburgh.va.gov is the most visited site in the network.
- Unlike many other services in which digital properties highly inform and prepare audiences, the VA medical centers (a.k.a. facilities) are the most meaningful entry points where veterans to connect to benefits.
- The CMS template we develop here will be re-used for VBA regional office pages, NCA national cemeteries, and Veteran Centers
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
- How do participants complete tasks using the new live site (versus what exists today on va.gov)?
- How does the new homepage content score according to the VA.gov content principles that it be consistent, conversational, clear and helpful, and empathetic (in a person-to-person manner) to better and more quickly inform participants?
- How quickly do participants determine if the site content answers their questions when scanning the drafted labels, headings, copy, images, and other content?
- How often do participants correctly access the new navigation to find what they are looking for?
  - How often do participants look to search to find what they are looking for and what would their queries be?
  - How often to participants use the local (left rail) verus global navigation (in header) .
  - How often do participants get lost as a result of clicking into links in the header?
  - How does the content organization / association suit the way participants go about finding it (for example, can all content be co-located on the regional facilities page)?
  - How much does the new design in total suit their technology abilities and preferences?
- Does the content and design allow them to succeed to the extent that they stay on the site to complete the tasks?
- How realistic is it to expect Veterans and caregivers to use a facilities website in a self-service manner to connect to benefits and services when the in-person experience is as meaningful an entry point as it currently is?
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
- Veterans and caregivers will be able to successfully complete tasks at a higher rate if related content (E.g location, directions and parking) is grouped together within design patterns they trust and are familiar with (E.g. info design in Google Maps modules).
- Information will be easier for Veterans and caregivers to find with fewer options in the local (left-side) navigation.
- Interfaces that employ expand/collapse controls are effective because they reduce information density and provide an area to stage relevant content that is reused from the central content repository.

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
Remote moderated, task-based usability testing
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
This qualitative method was selected because we want to observe behaviors and motivations of participants via task completion
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*
GoToMeeting / Zoom for participants on assistive devices

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
VA.gov staging site will be used by participants (link to staging coming shortly)
- Entry points
  - Landing page for their regional facility
  - University drive campus page (scenario is they came from Facility locator)
  - Wildcard VAMC entry from pittsburgh.va.gov (TBD) to put wayfinding to the test

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
7 Veterans
- 5 who are enrolled in VA healthcare
- 2 who are not enrolled in VA healthcare or other benefits (non-VA
veterans)
- 2 who rely on screen readers (could be a spouse or family member
of a Veteran, too).
- 3 spouses / family members of veterans enrolled in healthcare

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
Perigean 

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) March 22-27, 2019

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 
The research materials will be done by March 18, 2019
- Conversation guide (Jodi Leo)
- Staging site (will be ready on 3/20) http://test1.va.agile6.com/node/95/edit
(Jeff Brauer)

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 

Sessions will be 60 minutes each

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Sessions may be scheduled M-F, 8:00AM - 6:00PM

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

Tech rehearsal can be conducted on March 21, 2019 with Andy L
