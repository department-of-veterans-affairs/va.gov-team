# Facilities Usability Testing, Round 1 Research Plan 

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
- This document outlines the usability testing for the first round of usability testing for the facilities sections on VA.gov (E.g. pittsburgh.va.gov )

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
- Unlike many other services in which digital properties highly inform and prepare audiences, the VA medical centers (a.k.a. facilities) are the most meaningful entry points where veterans to connect to benefits.
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
- Using our click-through prototype, how do participants complete tasks?
- Are they able to find content when asked to complete specific tasks? How often to they access navigation versus searching?
- When scanning pages, do the labels provide enough scent of information?
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
Nothing currently states. 

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
- Remote moderated, task-based usability testing
  
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
n/a

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*
Go To Meeting

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
A click through (InVision) prototype will be used by participants.
- Entry points
  - Landing page for their regional facility
  - University drive campus page (scenario is they came from Facility locator)
- Wildcard VAMC entry from pittsburgh.va.gov (TBD) to put wayfinding to the test

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
Veterans
- 7 who are enrolled in VA healthcare
- 3-5 who are not enrolled in VA healthcare or other benefits (non-VA veterans)
- 3-5 Spouses of veterans enrolled in healthcare

Ideal: Veterans who are "less tech savvy" are highly encouraged or welcome. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
Perigean

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
February 20-27, 


2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 
2/19/19 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
1 hour

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**.
