# VA.gov CMS: Facilities Health Services tree test

Timing: April 22-26, 2019

This research focuses on the *information architecture of the Pittsburgh VA site* and the *clarity of the content groupings under Health Services.* Our goal is to determine whether participants can find the health and support services they need.
During previous rounds of research, we conducted usability testing using an Invision prototype. Our goal was to get feedback on the clarity and comprehensibility of the three main areas of Pittsburgh facility pages: Become a Patient, Make an Appointment and being able to find parking at a particular facility.

### Research Goals
We want to test if participants can find and understand the health services they need.
- Are participants able to navigate to Locations and services > Health services within the tree test?
- Are participants able to find the service they need under Health services?
  - More specifically, are participants able to quickly find what they’re looking for within the subgroups under Health services?
- What questions or blockers do they face when trying to find the service they need?
- What are participants’ reactions to the medical terms within the services list? Do we need to rewrite certain service descriptions using plainer language?

### Methods

For this round of research, we’re planning to conduct an unmoderated tree test using Optimal Workshop.
We have yet to construct the test (we’re still collecting our internal team’s feedback on the test prompts), but we should have the test created by the end of the week of April 15.

The team plans on using visualizations of the tree test results to spark further inquiry and validate any successful content groupings.

### Participants and Recruitment

We’ll be working with Jeff Barnes (USDS) who will send the test link to a VA listserv, subscribers of which are all Veterans or service members.

Participants will receive a link to the test, along with 10 prompts randomly selected from our complete list. There is no time limit for this test, and participants are free to complete it in whatever setting they find most comfortable. 

### Roles

Please list the people who will be serving in each role. Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers.
