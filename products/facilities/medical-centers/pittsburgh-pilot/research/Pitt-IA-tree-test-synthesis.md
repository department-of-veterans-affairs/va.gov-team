# Facility IA Tree Test v1 Synthesis

## Method
- Study ran Feb 8 - 11, 2019
- 211 participants
- Unmoderated tree test distributed via MHV mailing list, run through Optimal workshop
- Data: https://www.optimalworkshop.com/a/adhoc/treejack/results/9e1febc3-1153-450f-aa85-37ff764c90de#/t/overview

## Tree Test Analysis Questions
- How many first clicks go into “Locations and Services”? Are the other labels distractors?
- Are the labels “Our Locations”, “Health Services”, and “Patient and Family Services” working as we intended them to?

## Big Takeaways
- Overall, the navigation structure needs a little work. Averaged 45% task success over 13 tasks (we are shooting for 60% or more).
- Veterans think they can find almost everything under “Health Services”
  - Examples: Patient Advocate, Enroll in HC, Billing, Women Veteran Care
- Tasks that were clearly health-related or non-health tested well
  - Hearing Care (7), Primary Care (6), Volunteer (7)
- Most Veterans correctly used the “Locations and Services” label
- The “Working with Us” label was a big distractor for the about-type tasks
  - Billing (4), Patient Advocate (4)
- People looked for Visiting Hours under “About Us” first

## Crosslink Recommendations
- Do something about Health Services
- Cross link the Facility Services list on Patient and Family Services page, for instance “Were you looking for facility services at University Drive?” And possibly vice versa.
- Events list need to be provided on the local facility pages
