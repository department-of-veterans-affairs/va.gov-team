# Research Findings: Community Care Managers Study

**VAOS, Facility Locator**<br>

11/25/2020

## Research Goals 

- Understand the current data & process that a community care request manager uses to process Veteran's community care requests
- Understand/gather feedback (where possible) about the VAOS requests for community care coming into Community Care request manages
- In addition, and more specific to the Facility Locator team, we want to understand how and where Community Care Request managers search for type of care/specialties and providers.
- The VAOS team and the Facility Locator team will both benefit from understanding the type of data Community Care Request managers get and use to process a community care request.

Prior to the study, we hypothesized that by understanding how Community Care schedulers use systems to manually process specific requests, and how they search for care providers on behalf of Veterans, we can better understand how to automate/simplify this search experience on Facility locator and VAOS.

## Research Methodology 

Remote, moderated sessions were conducted via Teams for generative questioning.

### Who we talked to
8 Participants:
* 7 Community Care Managers (schedulers)
* 1 Supervisor who manages schedulers

### Research Questions

- How does a community care request get processed by Community Care Request managers once it is received in Schedule Manager?
   - What are the different systems a Scheduler uses to process a community care request?
- What type of data is a Request manager looking for from a Veteran when processing community care requests?
- What information do you see from the VAOS request? Of that information, what do you use? What is helpful?
- How do you search for type of care/specialities? Where do you search for that data + providers?
   - What words/categories are used by the schedulers when searching?
- What search parameters do Community Care Request managers use to identify the appropriate community care provider?
   - What are community care managers' expectations for search results (such as the number of results and distance/drive time) vs. reality?
    - Does that align with Veterans' expectations?
   - What happens if no providers meet the criteria?
- What do those search results look like, what is useful to schedule the appointment, and what do schedulers convey to the Veterans about the provider? And what is a waste of time (unnecessary/confusing)?
- If you could change anything about community care online scheduling through VAOS what would it be?
- If the community care managers are able to share anecdotal experience, we'd love to know what factors are important to a Veteran so that we can present Facility Locator Community care provider search results accordingly.

## Findings

### Findings by Hypothesis

We can understand how to simplify the search experience in Facility Locator.

Finding: ##True## 
* Sub-specialties: Based on feedback from 5 out of 7 Community Care managers, sub-specialties are not something most Veterans understand. 1 CCM stated that they prefer to help them find the sub-specialty ("We'll do that."). According to another CCM, the use of the Service Type text field is problematic due to spelling typos and unfamiliarity with sub-specialty terms. 
* Urgent Care: 4 out of 7 CCMs stated that Veterans often select Urgent Care in Facility Type, rather than selecting Community Care, then Urgent Care under Service Type. 
* Provider Data Quality: However, based on feedback from CCMs, (see Finding - VAOS below) there are gaps in provider data in PPMS. This impacts the quality of data found in Facility Locator, which depends on PPMS for Community Care search results. 

We can understand how to simplify the search experience in VAOS.

Finding: True
* Based on feedback from Community Care managers, there are provider data gaps in PPMS, which requires CCMs to use other tools to find the correct Community Care providers. 6 out of 7 CCMs stated that they use Google to supplement their search for providers, while 5 out of 7 CCMs stated that they call providers to supplement their search. Additionally, 2 CCMs use a self-created spreadsheet of providers with all of the complete and correct provider information.
