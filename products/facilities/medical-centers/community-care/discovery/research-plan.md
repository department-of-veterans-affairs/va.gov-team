# Research Plan: Community Care Manager Interviews 

**November 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goals

- Understand the current data & process that a community care request manager uses to process Veteran's community care requests
- Understand/gather feedback (where possible) about the VAOS requests for community care coming into Community Care request manages 
- In addition, and more specific to the Facility Locator team, we want to understand how and where Community Care Request managers search for type of care/specialties and providers. 

The VAOS team and the Facility Locator team will both benefit from understanding the type of data Request Manager get and use to process a community care request.  


### Research questions

Based on VAOS specialties (suggest Food/Nutrition/Dietary, Primary Care and Audiology) and non-VAOS specialties (suggest Chiropractor and Dermatology):

- How does a community care request get processed by Request managers once it is received in Schedule Manager?
   - What are the different systems a Scheduler uses to process a community care request?
- What type of data is a Request manager looking for from a Veteran when processing community care requests?
- What information do you see from the VAOS request? Of that information, what do you use? What is helpful?
- How do you search for type of care/specialities? Where do you search for that data + providers?
   - What words/categories are used by the schedulers when searching?
   - ~Which specialties are the most commonly searched? Rarely searched? Never searched?~ This can be answered through analytics
- What search parameters do community care managers use to identify the appropriate community care provider?
   - What are community care managers' expectations for search results (such as the number of results and distance/drive time) vs. reality?
    - Does that align with Veterans' expectations?
   - What happens if no providers meet the criteria?
- What do those search results look like, what is useful to schedule the appointment, and what do schedulers convey to the Veterans about the provider? And what is a waste of time (unnecessary/confusing)?
- If you could change anything about community care online scheduling through VAOS what would it be?
- If the community care managers are able to share anecdotal experience, we'd love to know what factors are important to a Veteran so that we can present Facility Locator Community care provider search results accordingly.

### Hypothesis 

- By understanding how Community Care schedulers use systems to manually process specific requests, and how they search for care providers on behalf of Veterans, we can better understand how to automate/simplify this search experience on Facility locator and VAOS. 

### Assumptions 

- Research and findings are based on the assumption that the all Community Care appointments require a referral and are made via request to Community Care managers who search for providers and schedule appointments. No Community Care appointments are made by Veterans themselves (excluding urgent care, pharmacy and emergency). 

## Method

Generative research
