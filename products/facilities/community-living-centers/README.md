## What are Community Living Centers (CLCs)?

[Community Living Center general information](https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/pages/VA_Community_Living_Centers.asp)

Community Living Centers deliver nursing home level of care, and they can be a temporary or permanent home. They can provide a variety of services, from short term nursing, rehabilitation, and hospice care, to long term assisted living care.
