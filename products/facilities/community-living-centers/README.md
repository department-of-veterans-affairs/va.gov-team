## Community Living Centers (CLCs)

VA Community Living Centers are VA health facilities which are included as locations under the relevant VAMC. They don't fit the facility pattern established by the VAMC facility detail pages as they include minimal services, such as "extended care" (or none at all). The information that Veterans need for these types of facilities may be different than that which is expected for medical clinics.

Community Living Centers deliver nursing home level of care, skilled nursing and/or medical care. They can be a temporary or permanent home. They can also provide rehab care/services.

There are 2 free-standing CLCs with dual state status at this time. However, they may be different in other systems and not easily recognizable as CLCs.
