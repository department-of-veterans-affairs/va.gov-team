***[Subject:] VA.gov Design Team Informational Discussion***

Hello [NAME],

I work on the VA.gov Facilities product team, and we are preparing to make some updates to the VA health system webpages of Community Living Center facilities. To make sure that we focus on the right improvements, we would like to talk with individuals who manage and work at the Community Living Centers themselves, be that either yourself, or anyone working on-site at a CLC facility.

We want to gain a more accurate understanding of the various aspects of a person's experience while staying at these locations, including information about the facility itself, any potential services provided, demographics, and anything else the administrators on site would like us to be aware of.

A few of the questions we would like to ask:

- Is the facility free-standing, or located inside another building (like a floor, or wing)?
- Who is this facility most likely to serve, in terms of demographics?
- What healthcare is provided on site?
- What is the referral process?

Are you available this week for an informal chat for us to learn more? My schedule is flexible, and it shouldn't take longer than 30 minutes.

Thank you for your help!

How is [date/time & time zone]? Our conversation shouldn't take longer than a half hour, if that works for you.

I'm looking for information about the domiciliary facilities in your region, as well as administrators or managers working on site that I might be able to speak to. If you have any more questions for me about this project, please don't hesitate to ask, but otherwise, I'll speak to you next week.

Thanks again
