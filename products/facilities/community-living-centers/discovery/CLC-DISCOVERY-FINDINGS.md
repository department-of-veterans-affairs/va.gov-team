Community Living Centers fall under VA [Geriatrics and Extended Care](https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/pages/Nursing_Home_and_Residential_Services.asp?utm_source=geriatrics_home_page) programs, and are design to deliver a nursing home level of care. CLCs may be a temporary or permanent home, and they provide a variety of services from short-term nursing, rehabilitation, and hospice care, to long-term assisted living care, and more specific services depending on the capabilities of the facility.

Community Living Centers exist on the VA continuum of mental health care as one of the main forms of inpatient care available in the VA system, and are intended for patients requiring full-time access to assisted living services and bedside care. Whereas domiciliary facilities require residents to be indpendent with their activities of daily living (ADLs), CLC facilities do not, and residents who require help bathing or getting dressed, for example, can receive help here.

### CLC facilities and services

#### The facilities

- What are they?
  - CLCs are short-term and long-term residential facilities intended for Veterans who require assistance with their activities of daily living (ADLs). They are designed to look more like actual homes or small neighborhoods (ex: [Orlando CLC](https://www.orlando.va.gov/services/CLC_Pictures.asp)), more so than dormatories, in order to provide a greater level of comfort to elderly patients.
  - Do to the nature of the in-patient care CLC residents often require, residents have access to the full range of services offered at the VAMC the CLC is attached to. Health services are offerd in-suite at the CLC, and shuttle services are available for travel between CLC residences and other VAMC units.
- Where are they located?
  - Community Living Centers are usually located on VAMC campuses as an attached wing, or in proximity to an VAMC campus, in order to provide residents with 24/7 access to medical care. A VA health care system may also contract with community nursing home in the local area via the Community Nursing Home Program (CNH Program).
- How to people refer to them?
  - "Community Living Centers", "CLCs", and "nursing homes" are all terms used to refer to these facilities.

#### The services

- Healthcare provided
  - Community Living Centers are intended to help treat Veterans with chronic stable conditions, and who need assistance with daily living activities. Services include short and long-term nursing care, rehabilitiation care, respite care, pallative care, hospice care, and the full range of health care services offered at the VAMC location the CLC is attached to. Available services may vary slightly from location to location depending on the purpose of the facility (ex: [Palo Alto](https://www.paloalto.va.gov/clc.asp) focusing on pallative, hospice, and sub-acute care, vs [Orlando](https://www.orlando.va.gov/services/CLC.asp) offering services related to spinal cord injury specifically). 
  - Because CLCs often serve elderly Veterans, they may also have services specific to this population, including dementia and geropsychiatric care. CLCs can also serve as short-term "sub-acute" care facilities, serving as intermediary locations between VAMC hospitals and other home or community based locations.
  - Covid has restricted regular visitation at many CLC locations, but visitations may still be allowed for compassionate care circumstances, including hospice and immament end-of-life.

#### The referral process

- How are Veterans referred?
  - Veterans can be referred through their primary health care provider, their social work case managers, representatives of VA Community Resource and Referral Centers (CRRCs), and via self-referral by calling the facility directly (a VA health care representative must make the referral if the CLC residency is intended to at VA's expense (see [CLC FAQs](https://www.paloalto.va.gov/clcfaq.asp)). 
  - Because CLCs are often located on VAMC campuses, VA primary care providers and social workers working with other in-patient units on the campus often refer patients to the CLC.

- Who can Veterans contact directly?
  - CLC residency requires a referral, so Veterans should be in contact with their VA primary health care provider, VA social worker, or a Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT) for the process of admission. Veterans and caregivers can also call Admissions Coordinators directly, when their contact numbers are available, but will likely still need a third party health or social care provider involved in the process.
  - If a direct number to a CLC is available, Veterans can call the number during business hours. If a CLC is located on a VAMC campus, and a non-direct number is listed (i.e. a general number for the VAMC), Veterans can call during business hours, but it may be more difficult to reach the CLC as the VAMC desk or unit that answers the phone may or may not know where to transfer the call. (See [Florida SME interview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/community-living-centers/discovery/florida-clc-sme-interview.md)).
- What are the admissions requirements?
  - Admissions requirements may vary slightly depending on the location, but they include:
    - Veteran must be enrolled in VA health care
    - Veteran must be medically and psychiatrically stable on entry
    - Relevant medical and financial documentation, including:
      - the primary services required
      - anticipated length of stay
      - anticipated discharge disposition
    - Service connected status, level of disability, and income are all factors in determining the amount of copay a Veteran is responsible for
- Any special elegibility requirements?
  - Pets and service animals may be permitted for hospice and end-of-life circumstances, but are otherwise likely not allowed.
