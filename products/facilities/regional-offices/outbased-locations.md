## VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) 

> Reference: [VSOC locations on Teamsite](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/vsoc.asp) 

**Population served**
- VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) programs were created to support Veterans, Servicemembers, and their qualified dependents via a coordinated delivery of on-campus benefits assistance. They uniquely serve only these student populations

**Relevant content/background**
- The VSOC program is currently located at 104 schools nationwide and serves more than 85,000 student Veterans but is not available in every state. The Ensuring VetSuccess On Campus Act of 2023 is a bipartisan effort to  ensure access to the VetSuccess on Campus (VSOC) program in every state. (The legislation was introduced and referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.)
  - Note: the VBA DB lists only 91 VSOC locations.
- VSOC data and operating status is chronically out of date and local staff often request the locations be removed from the Facility Locator search results because of public misunderstanding of who can be served at the locations and which services are available there. 
- Location and service information is often available on the university/college website but content is created and maintained locally
  - Examples: [Veteran Readiness and Employment Office at East Carolina University](https://mvrc.ecu.edu/vet-success-on-campus/), [Community College of Rhode Island](https://ccri.edu/vso/vsoc)
- There is an intersection with Vet Center CAPs, such as [Houston West Vet Center, which has 2 University of Houston CAPs](https://www.va.gov/houston-west-vet-center/locations/)

**Services**
- VSOC services were standardized in early 2024 to include the following services at every location (these will need to be aligned with the appropriate services from the VA service taxonomy) 
  - Applying_for_Benefits
  - Education_and_Career_Counseling
  - Education_Claim_Assistance
