Sprinboard/dashboard: VBA springboard (dashboard) could follow the Vet Center model. However, there are some improvements that can be made to the springboard, especially from VBA pilot editor feedback. For this reason, VBA springboard is out of scope for Pilot MVP.

Spotlight/Featured Content: Spotlight is used by multiple products and there are a number improvements suggested already. For this reason, Pilot MVP will use the Vet Center spotlight model with a few label changes. There is an out of scope epic for spotlight improvements across products that can come later.

Roles: When Pilot MVP editors are bulk uploaded into Drupal, they could have content creator and either content editor or content publisher roles. As was done with Vet Centers, readiness and review could be controlled through role elevation. Alternately, editor readiness and review could be controlled through process rather than role assignments.

Editors: Per Michelle's discussion with VBA national, the editors will be the same folks currently editing in Teamsite.

Supplemental status: Will continue to be supplemental rather than replace operating status for VBA. Because of this, supplemental status will be out of scope for Pilot MVP.
