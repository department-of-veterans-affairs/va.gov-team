# VA Regional Office Facility System Product Design

## MVP

### Summary
Unlike the Vet Centers, Regional Offices have existing websites (e.g. [Baltimore Regional Office](https://www.benefits.va.gov/ROBALTIMORE/)). MVP design should largely follow the VAMC and Vet Center template and design components with minimal deviation. As with other areas of VA.gov, these sites are task-based sites that 1/ empower Veterans to know enough information about a specific location and the services offered there to be able to be prepared to make an appointment and 2/ funnel Veterans into online alternatives should they choose Veteran self-service.

We will also re-use the services pattern established through our work with VHA
- National taxonomy name (Plain language)
- Veteran-friendly, also-known-as names (if different)
- National description of service to ensure consistency
- "Type" of service (unsure if this is necessary)
- Riff on common conditions (unsure if this is necessary)


If we cross-walk the features of the RO websites and the Facility Locator detail pages for all VBA locations, what is the delta?

 #### What we want to learn:
- Top tasks (needs add'l research)
  - What else is available (e.g. Talk to someone online?) and do Veterans want that?
- Basic location information 
  - How important to the Veteran is the relationship of "child" locations to the RO
  - Do Veterans understand the different types of facilities (or does that matter?)
  - What are the questions Veterans want answered by calling the phone number(s)?
  - Prepare for your visit
    - What to bring (or is this in services? or both?)
      - [DD214](https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/) has come up in research
    - What else do Veterans need in order to be prepared for a visit (e.g. link to find a form?)
- Services
    - Is the service delivery the same across all locations nationally or locally nuanced?
    - How do we elaborate on the taxonomy structure to better explain the services
    - Is there an online version of this tool?
    - Do we need to provide routes into the benefit hubs and, if so, is that through COPE or links or other?
 - Events 
    - Are these National? Local? Hybrid? And what is the maintenance load?
 - Subscribe to updates   
    - Will this use GovDelivery?
 - Spotlights 
    - Are these National? Local? Hybrid? And what is the maintenance load?
 - Leadership profiles (is this really MVP or fast-follow?)
    - Is a list of Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) located at that facility important (I bet it is, what do we need to know. Is this critical path or fast-follow?)
- How might we (or do we?) detect and re-use content from co-located VHA facilities to prevent duplication
  - Photos
  - Facility names
