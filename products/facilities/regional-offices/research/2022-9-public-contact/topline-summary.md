## Introduction

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Findings - Services, Benefits, & Tasks 

This first group of findings relates to [research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-9-public-contact/research-plan.md#research-questions) 1 & 2: 
1. What benefit-related services are offered at these facilities?
2. What do Veterans typically try to accomplish during an in-person facility visit?

### 1 - Services at Regional Benefit Offices can be meaningfully categorized in at least four distinct ways

- **Benefit** (e.g. compensation, home loans, VR&E)
- **Task** (e.g. file a claim, check claim status, 1-on-1 interview)
- **Documents** (e.g. award letter, commissary letter, DD-214)
- **Beneficiary** (e.g. survivors, military retirees, caregivers)

> Top three would be compensation, education, and pension. - P3

> Filing a claim is a big one, and then checking the status. - P12

> Most folks are looking for the tax letter. - P5

> Survivors’ benefits is a big one. - P2

**Note:** One of the things I’m working on for the full report is a comprehensive list of the terms in these four categories and mapping important relationships between them. There’s a sneak peek in the appendix.


### 2 - Public Contact staff primarily assist with the benefit of disability compensation

- Public Contact staff have end-to-end insight into the disability compensation process
- Can assist with many tasks: determining eligibility, filing claims, checking claim status, filing appeals, resolving payment issues, etc.
- 6/12 participants listed compensation in the top three most common services

> 90% of the Veterans coming in are concerned about "What’s my percentage and how much money am I getting?" - P7

> Everyone understands that… this is where the money begins. Anything for money, they’re coming in. - P5

> It’s usually tied around "Where is my money?" - P2

### 3 - Public Contact staff primarily assist with the task of applying for benefits 

- 9/12 participants listed “applying for benefits / filing a claim” as one of the top three most common services
- They are able to assist beneficiaries in applying for a wide range of benefits
- They have to refer beneficiaries elsewhere for support on follow-up tasks

> We're there to help Veterans fill out applications. - P9

> Probably filing new claims, you know, on the VA Form 21-526 EZ. Honestly, I could probably print 20 copies and go almost the whole week. - P10

> I can hand them an application to fill out. But PMC [Pension Management Center] would be the one process and handle it. - P5

> For education benefits we can't provide specific information to the customer. So we would have to refer them to an Education Call Center like Muskogee. - P3

### 4 - Providing beneficiaries official documents is a significant function of Regional Benefit Offices

- 6/12 participants listed “get a [benefit/award/tax] letter” as one of the top three most common services
- Sometimes they are printing new copies of documents that beneficiaries previously received
- Other times, a new document is being created

> To get qualified for those funds from the City… they usually need that letter. The no-benefits letter, or the benefits letter. - P5

> If they are a certain percentage, they get a letter where they can go to the commissaries on base and shop. We provide those letters. - P4

### 5 - There are few (if any) tasks that require a Veteran to be physically present at Regional Benefit Office

- During the COVID lockdown, any services that previously required an in-person visit were modified to have virtual option
- There seem to be lingering perceptions that in-person visits are required 
- Some beneficiaries prefer in-person (homeless, non-English speakers, older Veterans)
- Some sensitive tasks are better in-person (Military Sexual Trauma interviews)

> No, no, there really isn't. Everything can almost be done online. - P8

> Sometimes they want it in their hands. - P2

## Findings - Veteran Experience at Facility

This second group of findings relates to [research question](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-9-public-contact/research-plan.md#research-questions) 3:

3. What is the typical Veteran experience when visiting these facilities?

### 6 - A common source of Veteran frustration is a mismatch between their expectations of what they can accomplish at a Regional Benefit Office and the reality

- VR&E staff are totally siloed from Public Contact staff
- These issues are heightened when a Regional Benefit Office is co-located with a VAMC
- Veterans conflate VSOs and VA

> People are being told they can get every type of benefit done here at the regional office, and you know we simply can't. - P8

> On any given day at least one of my 6 appointments is really wanting to talk with the VR&E Counselor. - P10

> We get a lot of veterans coming in and they think that we can update their DD-214 and we can't. - P4

> They think we do the Veteran ID cards - P2

> If the person is looking for a VSO, they end up in the wrong place - P5

### 7 - There is little standardization in how Regional Benefit Offices handle appointments

- Appointment only = National Captial Region 
- Certain days & hours for walk-in, otherwise appointment only = Anchorage
- Mostly walk-in, but some appointments 
- New Orleans is totally virtual, but has kiosks on-site

### 8 - Wait times at Regional Benefit Offices are primarily affected by facility location and staffing, but there are also predictable busier times

- Many locations reported very short wait times (10 min or less)
- Offices co-located with a VAMC expressed very high wait times (over an hour) due to high demand and limited staff
- Focus on compensation can lead to busy times on the 1st day of the month & tax season
- Mondays & lunch time also cited as busier days / times

> We also see a lot of rush the first of the month, especially if they don't get their paycheck. - P12

### 9 - Most services are consistently available during normal operating hours 

- Occassionally certain staff members may be better equipped to perform certain services (MST interviews, homeless Veteran coordinator)
- Guam has 2 hours every Monday morning where VBMS is down for maintenance
- Some staff serve multiple locations (Saipan has two different offices, one person does outreach day at a VAMC) but the service availability is the same for the days that particular location is open

## Findings - Veteran Preparation

This third group of findings relates to [research question](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-9-public-contact/research-plan.md#research-questions) 4: 

4. What do Veterans need to know or do to be adequately prepared for a visit?

### 10 - Having a valid photo ID and a DD-214 is helpful regardless of service

- Civilian medical records can be helpful for supplemental claims
- Surviving spouse = marriage license, the death certificate, the funeral bill, first notice of death
- eBenefits registration = 2 forms of ID
- Adding/removing dependant = birth certificate, social security cards,  marriage certificates, divorce decrees

>  They need to have an extra copy, because we're not going to copy the medical records while they wait. - P4

### 11 - Some Regional Benefit Offices are located in Federal buildings with security checkpoints, which can affect timing

> Plus they have to go through security. So you know, if they show up at like four, and then security, we're gone by the time they get here like at 4:15, 4:30 - P8
