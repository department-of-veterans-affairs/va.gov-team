Dave Pickett: Okay? Um. So before we dive into kind of the

7

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:46.490

Dave Pickett: you know, real depths of talking about what happens at the location uh just want to get some general information. Um! So could you tell me what's your role at the Va.

8

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.949

P4: I work in public contact and talk with veterans about their benefits,

10

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.930

Dave Pickett: and And

11

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.659

how long have you been in that role

12

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.760

P4: since? Two thousand and one? Okay, Quite a while, then.

13

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.360

Dave Pickett: And what's your favorite part of your job

14

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.839

P4: when you really sit down and you speak with a veteran or with a surviving spouse, and you really feel like you've helped them.

16

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.110

P4: There is, unfortunately, a lot of people come in, and they don't really need to help. They just. I want somebody to do a forum.

20

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.600

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

21

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.509

Dave Pickett: It feels good when you're able to help.

22

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.640

Great

23

00:01:46.970 --> 00:02:05.629

Dave Pickett: um! Well, to give you a little background on my team. So, um! We're currently working with seven different regional benefit offices from around the country to build a new modern website. Um, that will later be rolled out to every regional benefit office. So

24

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:24.310

Dave Pickett: your local regional office volunteer to be part of that group uh, so that you're all kind of bought in in this first version. We're gonna build um and roll out and test um before we go to the rest of the country. So we're speaking with different public contact staff like you from those seven different locations

25

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:42.589

Dave Pickett: you get a sense of, you know, day to day reality What veterans experience when visiting the facilities? Um, So my first set of questions is about. You know the kind of the physical office uh where you work. So. Um, I think you you work at the regional office. Is that correct? Yes,

26

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:53.040

Dave Pickett: um! And then is that do you work at that location. Um solely, or is there to you ever split your time at another facility?

27

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.450

No, it's just the

28

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.890

Dave Pickett: um

29

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:09.079

Dave Pickett: thinking about that building is. Uh, Is it just kind of a standalone facility just for the regional office? Or does it share space with any other type of office?

30

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.950

We have loan guarantee also here,

Okay,

32

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.870

P4: and both we have here.

33

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.080

Dave Pickett: Yeah,

34

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:26.010

Dave Pickett: Um. Is this a building easy to get to, or any quirks about parking That, you know, might be tricky for people.

35

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.809

P4: It's pretty simple to get to uh

36

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.570

P4: parking.

37

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:39.709

P4: I'm guessing, like all the Us. Is difficult. I worked in the at the Atlanta Regional office.

38

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.630

P4: They had a tower parking there. So you

39

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.109

Dave Pickett: I never had problems parking. I can't say if the veterans did or not. Yeah,

40

00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:02.810

Dave Pickett: um! And then what? What what are the sort of standard uh hours that it's open for veterans to uh to come in?

41

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.969

P4: I think. Now the hours are eight to four.

42

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:29.099

Dave Pickett: Um! So if you were to describe um, you know this regional benefits office to a veteran or beneficiary? Who's maybe not super familiar with the Va. How would you describe what this office is for,

43

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.870

P4: that we're here to assist. Button's inform them benefits. They may be entitled to

45

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:40.810

P4: um.

46

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.710

P4: That's pretty much it

47

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:48.760

Dave Pickett: got it.

48

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.530

Dave Pickett: Um.

49

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:09.109

Dave Pickett: So thinking about uh, you know, you've worked with this facility for a while. Um, just a general sense you've gotten of uh people coming in. What percentage, would you say, have an appointment, or how much you're just kind of walking in the day of without an appointment

50

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.530

P4: when you started the appointment system?

51

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.890

P4: Ah,

52

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.780

P4: when Covid started relaxing, then the majority of them to come in and not have appointments. originally that we're gonna have it set up where you had to have an appointment to come in, and then the director changed and said, No, that we would take walk in.

55

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.010

Dave Pickett: Okay,

56

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.659

Dave Pickett: So there Hasn't been a real strong push for the appointments, then.

57

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.800

P4: No? Okay,

58

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.500

Dave Pickett: Um.

59

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:56.419

Dave Pickett: Given that, You know most people are walking in what's uh What's the wait time like for somebody who walks in to get served.

60

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.040

P4: It fluctuates. It could be just anywhere from a few minutes.

I don't think anyone's ever worded over an hour. I don't. I don't not know of anyone.

63

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:21.459

Dave Pickett: Um! And then are there any busier days of the week or times of day that you see, You know kind of a Russia people.

64

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.329

P4: It starts picking up around ten, and it'll slow down like between one and two, and then it picks up a little bit after that.

67

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.210

Dave Pickett: Um, you know, thinking about um getting

68

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:54.010

Dave Pickett: over the time you've seen different veterans come in. Are there any kind of recurring uh frustrations that veterans are expressing about? You know, trying to get uh things handled, or anything like that

69

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.019

P4: most of us from their clients.

70

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.400

P4: I,

71

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.590

P4: Of course they get frustrated when there's a mistake made like with their pay, especially

and most of us regarding claims.

 And then we have our parking lot. And then there's the hospitals parking lot, the Va. Medical centers parking lot, and a lot of we get a little frustrated from some of the veterans, because the hospital will send them to us when it's not our issue.

79

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:48.870

Dave Pickett: Do you have an example of what they might mistakenly come to you for from from the hospital?

80

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:58.240

P4: I'm sorry I can't think of any right now, but

81

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.170

P4: a lot of them are.

82

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.920

P4: The majority of them that we get from the hospital is a hospital billing process, and the veterans mistake in our building for the Mccr Building.

85

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:24.659

P4: Um, but a lot of them like, I said, we get a lot of them coming over for issues that aren't ours, but like right now i'm sorry i'm mine's blank. I can't think of anything right now.

86

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:41.770

Dave Pickett: No. The billing issues that make that make sense. That That might be a place of confusion, because you do handle payments and stuff so they might think. Oh, this is anything with Va. And money. I go there, not realizing the hospital billing departments a whole separate

87

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.780

thing.

88

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.740

P4: Well, that that problem to me is because the buildings Aren't number.

 If I told you, you have to go to Mccr, and it's building Number five. The reason office is building number two. Then you know it that's not the right building, because it's building number two. I got a good number Five

91

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:08.019

Dave Pickett: got it, so there's there's a name on the building, but not a number, so

92

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:16.279

Dave Pickett: you have to kind of remember what the name was, and if you see something that looks kind of similar, you might think you're at the right place, even if you're not,

93

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.270

Dave Pickett: because You're all on one big campus, Right?

94

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.710

P4: Yes,

95

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.260

P4: which that creates a problem from for us at the regional office. Because

97

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.110

P4: um,

98

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.950

P4: you have a person that lives maybe fifty or sixty miles away, and they they ride a bus uh like the Av. They have vans, and not these other service organizations, so they'll bring them to their appointment,

: but their appointments at ten. But the the band doesn't leave until two, so they have nothing to do. So they come over to the Va. And they want a a letter or or something.

102

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.260

P4: We've had them come over

103

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:09.439

P4: every day of the week for the same thing, I guess, frustrating to us, and i'm sure it's frustrating to them that they have to wait so long. But

104

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.329

P4: anyone

105

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.150

Dave Pickett: got it.

106

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.070

Dave Pickett: Um!

107

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:27.500

Dave Pickett: So speaking of you know kind of that sense of how veterans are getting there, you know. Some are driving. Some are kind of coming in these shuttles. Um, Any other sort of um

108

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.260

Dave Pickett: ways, you. You know veterans are getting there.

109

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.730

P4: They ride the city bus.

110

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:49.020

P4: And one good thing about our city If if that was a certain percentage, then they get to ride that bus for free, and we we do this. The passes for them.

So that's that's a hit city specific. Yes, that and um, if there are certain percentage. The tall roads around  They don't have to pay to be on the Toll road. They that's a benefit that the the city gives.

114

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.960

Dave Pickett: It's interesting.

115

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:27.409

Dave Pickett: Um. So speaking of kind of benefits, services um, if you can list out what are, what are the different services that your your office um, you know. Kind of helps veterans with.

116

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:35.760

P4: We go over the benefits with them. A little system fell on a plane

117

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.910

P4: um

P4: in this State. They have what they call a property tax letter,

119

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.360

P4: they'll come in.

120

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.070

You want a property tax, that? 

Or or if they a certain percentage, they get a letter where they can go for the commissaries on base: and shop, on on the base. We provide those letters

123

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.829

P4: we'll discuss issues like a pay issue will discuss those with them.

125

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.890

P4: Most of them are claim status that especially phone calls. Now, since they have this visual system in for appointments, that's most of them that I can think of

127

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:38.270

Dave Pickett: um. So you mentioned um.

128

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.370

Dave Pickett: You know the city has those kind of a couple special benefits for veterans.

129

00:12:43.380 --> 00:13:01.039

Dave Pickett: The uh the bus pass and the toll. Are there any sort of other unique uh surfaces that maybe your location offers that veterans in a different state, or even in a different city, wouldn't um necessarily have access to

130

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.940

P4: well, on different state, the Toll Road they wouldn't have access to, or the bus

131

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.080

P4: and uh property tax, since a letter tells the vet when they're this percentage, or or whatever, and and how much money that we save.

 But in in this state in the counties for the property tax letter they have to know the effective day. So that's why they come to us, because they need that effective date in there.

Yeah, So that's not kind of in that standard letter, because the letter will say, Yes, you are, but it doesn't give that date, and in in in State income tax. It's all property tax.

So that's a big issue. If you're a hundred percent permanent total or on the I you in permanent total, you don't have to pay the property tax, but they like, I say they want to know the date that you were given that

141

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:36.990

Dave Pickett: Mhm

142

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.770

Dave Pickett: Got it.

143

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:44.620

Dave Pickett: Um,

144

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:51.670

Dave Pickett: okay, think so again. We're we're talking to, you know, benefit offices from around the country.

145

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:59.509

Dave Pickett: You said you've previously worked at a benefit office in Atlanta, so you you've seen, maybe, a little some of the differences of

146

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:15.110

Dave Pickett: right like you, said your state. Specific Um! Are there any benefits that you know of that? Veterans might get at other States or other offices or things that they can't get done at your office. They could maybe get done if they were somewhere else.

147

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.379

I don't know, because in that land I worked in education.

148

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:27.840

Every State is different in every State offers different benefits. Some States offer none, and some States will give you some like uh Georgia, if you if you went in service in war time, they give you pre Driver's license that you had to end, or like during Vietnam on the call for our, you know Korea Second World War

156

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:52.920

Dave Pickett: got it. So there's

157

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:59.149

P4: we get a lot of veterans coming in on their Dv. Two hundred and fourteen also, and that's they think that we can update their two hundred and fourteen, and we can. It has to go to the branch of service that we're in.

159

00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:09.490

Dave Pickett: Yeah,

160

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:17.259

Dave Pickett: How do you? Um, when somebody comes in? You know with that what's kind of that process for routing them to the appropriate place?

161

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.289

P4: Well, we provide them the form that they need, and we show them the address because it's on the form and kind of help support their application to get your and get their discharge up.

164

00:16:39.130 --> 00:16:40.030

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

165

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.339

Dave Pickett: So that would be um

166

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:46.540

Dave Pickett: sorry. Um!

167

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:56.100

Dave Pickett: Anything else you can think of that, you know. Veterans might come here looking for that. You have to kind of refer them to

168

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.150

Dave Pickett: somewhere else to actually, you know.

169

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.180

Dave Pickett: Get it, get it a claim filed, or anything processed.

170

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.310

P4: We wouldn't refer them somewhere else for our claim to be filed. But, uh, they'll they come in for health care, which, of course, they're in the wrong building, and they don't understand, or they'll come in, for which we do provide the application. And

 I had a book that I would give whoever was qualified. I tried to keep the book to mainly whoever was qualified. 

Then I have a little pamphlet that I would give if they were just asking about, and we would give them the application and the the P. But or if they're qualified when we give them the application and the book, and then also the letter that shows that they're a hundred percent permanent total, 

because the application goes to Denver and Denver has to review it to make sure that they're permanent total, that they're not retired military, because retired military. Don't authorize Champa, so the more that we can provide the veteran and tell them what they need to show,

175

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:12.839

P4: the easier it is for the to be a office to go ahead and approve them, because they have a tremendous backlog, and the more you can

176

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.819

P4: give to them, then they can get it done a lot faster.

177

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:28.450

Dave Pickett: Got it, and that's that's a different type of health care right

178

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:34.460

P4: um P. And r I. Up, and T, then they get health care for their dependence.

179

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:40.409

P4: Um, right, and also do education for that. If they're a hundred percent permanent total, or I, you firmly total, then their dependence will authorize the education benefits for this when they go to college for the spouse or for the children when they get it. You know they graduate high school and go to college.

182

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.789

P4: Hmm, some way for give them that information and give them the application and show them where it is mail to

184

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.490

Dave Pickett: at it.

185

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.050

Dave Pickett: Um!

186

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:15.030

Dave Pickett: So thinking about um me! And again

187

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:22.989

Dave Pickett: the bulk of veterans you've seen come through here. What would you list? As maybe the top three most frequent things people are coming in for

188

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.640

P4: filing claims. I want to know if they're authorized certain benefits and the the property tax letters. That's

191

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:49.300

P4: pretty much property tax letters, Probably the majority of one reason they come in.

192

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.230

Dave Pickett: Um:

193

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:58.409

Dave Pickett: Yeah. On the on the flip side. Is there something that you guys offer that you've

194

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:09.170

Dave Pickett: basically almost never seen someone come in. It's super rare. Maybe only once or twice you've seen somebody need help with something. Um. But you actually can help them.

195

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:26.039

P4: I can't think of anything, because even veterans that are homeless that come in. We can provide assistance for them

196

00:20:30.510 --> 00:20:34.569

P4: very rarely. You'll have someone that will apply that doesn't meet the timeframe like for a non-service connector pension they have to have served at least ninety days, and we have some that don't or haven't, so they're not authorized. But that's that's a real real case.

200

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.070

Dave Pickett: Um,

201

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:04.869

Dave Pickett: any other, you know, uh high level pain points. You see, veterans experiencing. Um,

202

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:19.020

Dave Pickett: you know, when things that could be helped by you know better information on the website like things they might need for for a visit that they don't know, to bring in

203

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:30.990

P4: on depending on what they're coming in for. It's always helpful to bring their d two hundred and fourteen.

204

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.569

P4: Now a lot of them.

205

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.610

P4: I'm. Given their medical records, where before,: when I was in service, you hardly ever even saw your medical record, much less got to touch it. And now they just kind of give it to them, or a lot of them get it before they get out of service. So then we can't find the medical records from their file on the claim, and they have them all all along where it's It's helpful if they, if they have a copy to bring it, but they need them have a extra copy, because we're not going to come with the medical records while they wait,

209

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.949

P4: and, like. I said, there's two hundred and fourteen,

210

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.339

P4: and for us surviving spouse they need to bring the marriage license, the death certificate, if they have it, the funeral bill, if they have it.

214

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.480

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

215

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:39.449

P4: Some of the the surviving spouses. They will wait until they have all that,

216

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.280

P4: and some of them Don't

217

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.099

P4: and one issue with veterans, and i'm always trying to tell them.

They think they have to have their medical records, and some people have told them they have to have their two four teams to follow a claim, and that's not true.

They need to file their claim because we're going to request their medical records, and normally, when we request them, they'll put one to fourteen in their in their medical records also.

 So you know I I hate to see veterans wait for so long before, because they requested, and then, you know, and with Covid and everything, it's taken extra time for them to receive that thing, and that's time lost that they could have filed their claim

225

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:53.519

Dave Pickett: got it so, even though it can be helpful to have those things, they shouldn't wait to file a claim to have their own copy, because finally claim will also kind of bring up those things from the other side.

226

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:04.189

P4: And you know, why should they wait nine months or a year to get copies of something that if they come in and follow a claim, we're probably going to get them within six weeks.

227

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.160

P4: Vietnam era,

228

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:22.089

P4: because not everything wasn't stored in the computers back then, and then they had the fire in St. Louis which destroyed a lot of records, and that's a misconception that St. Louis does. They'll tell veterans that it was far related when it wasn't, because it was only Army and Air Force records

231

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:35.939

P4: through the H's.

232

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:45.219

P4: But they'll tell somebody who's was in the navy, and their last name start from the Z. That. Oh, it's a fire related direct. We can't find Well, no, it's not It Wasn't navy records it wasn't marine records.

234

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.070

P4: So

235

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.470

P4: anyone

236

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.180

Dave Pickett: Yeah,

237

00:24:54.620 --> 00:25:05.599

Dave Pickett: so it There can be lots of things that stop a veteran from getting a claim, even if it's not true that that's what's actually stopping. That's just somebody telling them that.

238

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:06.490

P4: Mhm

239

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.460

P4: Yeah, I

240

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:15.379

P4: I hate when people are told that they have to have this to file a client, or that the you know It's that's not true.

241

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:36.360

Dave Pickett: Um. So i'm going to go back uh some that kind of list of services. Um, you uh you talked through before and asked some follow up questions about the different ones. So um just to kind of restate what you listed out. Um. We talked about

242

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:55.170

Dave Pickett: finally an acclaim kind of giving an overview of benefits. The property tax letter um The letter for shopping at the Commissary on Base um an issue with, you know, getting paid, or a payment not being the right amount checking on claims status

Dave Pickett: uh the toll road.

Dave Pickett: Um, the the bus pass.

245

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.310

Dave Pickett: Um,

246

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:08.059

Dave Pickett: and those were kind of the big ones,

247

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:13.430

Dave Pickett: so um,

248

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:30.130

Dave Pickett: and that, I assume, you know, applies to a lot of the different benefits, you know, because

249

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.899

Dave Pickett: if their their address change that affects any benefit they're on,

250

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.269

P4: or all of them well, they're receiving their pay. Yes, because even though we're in a computer world that doesn't mean, you know you come in and do it today, and it's effective today, because especially if they're bank, they come in and change their bank account today. We'll when their check comes out on December first. It's not gonna be in the new bank account. It's gonna go to the old one they don't understand why sometimes with we have a certain date that you have to do it by, or it's not going to be effective in the same way with the ones that receive paper checks. It's the same thing with the address change.

258

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.270

Dave Pickett: Yeah,

259

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.920

Dave Pickett: um. So you know, we talked earlier about

260

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:41.360

Dave Pickett: your facilities. Open eight to four Monday to Friday, um across those different services, or any of them, something that are only available certain days of the week, because maybe there's a specific staff member, or is it all kind of you know? Whoever is there cannot, can move it forward?

261

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:49.809

P4: No, they there's no specific day. Everyone can do. We all do each other's jobs so

262

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.869

P4: that they see the homes. But

263

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:08.670

P4: if they're not, we all have the information, so it's not like they're not gonna get the same service as if that person was there or the Ms. T person was there.

264

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.820

Dave Pickett: What's a Mst

265

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.119

P4: Military sexual trauma? Okay. So we have a male coordinator and a female coordinator. Those we we try that to always get them to those persons, but sometimes it's not not. We can't do it sometimes. So somebody else takes over in the. If it's female, we have a female talk to them. If it's a male, we get a male to talk to them, and then we pass an information on to the Coordinator.

272

00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.340

Dave Pickett: And um,

273

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:51.340

Dave Pickett: you know, thinking across all all these different tasks. Um,

274

00:28:51.520 --> 00:29:08.560

Dave Pickett: Some of these um, you know. Obviously people are coming in or trying to do it in person, or some of these tasks things people could do online, but they're choosing to do in person, or some of them something they could only do by coming to the facility. There's not really an online way they could do it.

275

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:17.740

P4: They can receive the award letters online. 

But if they want it specifically for a tax letter, they have to come in the property tax. Yes, the Metro pass, and that they, the av tags. They have to come in to get the application.

279

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.419

P4: Uh, But as far as filing claims they could do that online,

280

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.820

P4: one problem with online the handy benefits, and it's still available, and they're merging to Va: Gov: But the system isn't lined up with what's going on because You're like I I've spoken with several veterans, and they'll go well. It says my claim is completed, or my claim is in this stage, but it's not so it doesn't match us, even if it's the last time I was in It was years ago, because I looked, and it said my claim was completed, and it was completed a year later.

So it's the system doesn't, you know. If it's not lined up, it doesn't do any good. It causes It actually causes more problems because we're getting these virtual calls now, and that's about status of claims, and they'll say, Well, the system says that is complete. Well, I had one yesterday.

 It said it was complete, but it was not complete.

290

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:45.630

Dave Pickett: And you're able to look up the actual status in a system that you have access to that the veterans

Dave Pickett: veterans. It's not what they see online,

Dave Pickett: so that that's often the issue is that

Dave Pickett: the information they're getting online is an accurate and confusing because it's not. If it's done. If it says it's done. But it's they don't have. You know the check, or you know, whatever they're expecting, then that that's a point of confusion and frustration.

294

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:20.630

P4: So

295

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:27.829

P4: I can understand how it's hard to match the system, because it changes so much.

296

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:33.310

P4: And then, um,

297

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:56.139

Dave Pickett: you know. Uh so claim you know, filing claims claim status Seems like. Well, there is some ability to do that online. It's It's uh, not all the information that you know is out there, so you all have better access, and that's one of the reasons why it's helpful for people to come in, because they can get the real information.

298

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.390

P4: Well,

299

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.930

P4: the forms are confusing,

300

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:05.400

P4: and you get to so so far, and

301

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:11.360

P4: they need to be in plain language and not the the like, the O eight, four, five, which is a form to give someone else permission to to find out information for you. It wants. The first thing is the veterans name and information. climate or benefits right? Not the veteran.

306

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.310

Dave Pickett: What does that mean?

307

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:45.210

p4: And then it has an address, and normally on, for you know, we always want the veterans address, but that's for the climate or beneficiary of the vaccines living

309

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.650

P4: there isn't a benefits for it.

310

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.910

Dave Pickett: Yeah,

311

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:05.300

P4: me, I prefer if you do it online, because when you when they're online,

312

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:14.180

P4: you just type away, it's spaces over. There are certain times you have to space it yourself, but most it's so much easier just to do it online

313

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:20.589

P4: as far as filling out the application and sitting there trying to write and get your little initials or getting your letters in those little blocks.

315

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.900

P4: I think it's a hundred percent easier, and when they come in i'll i'll bring up the application online, and i'll type in their name and address for them

317

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:45.909

P4: when we get down and what they're claiming. Then I print it off. Let them make sure what I type was correct, and then they have to fill out the rest of it

318

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.970

Dave Pickett: Right? Because you're not allowed to fill out that part right.

319

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:57.619

P4: But to me just getting that one part helps them, because that's save them time at us time, because, you know, you know, you can't say. What was that? A, or is that an O, or you know? So when it's typed in there, you know what it is,

321

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.830

P4: and then they can write out what they're claiming.

322

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.359

Dave Pickett: Um.

323

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:32.539

Dave Pickett: So obviously, you know, a lot of the the forums are a little confusing and not necessarily straightforward. Are there any tasks that that are kind of easy that that people come in, that it's kind of like, okay, you know. You're just coming in for this

324

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:47.689

Dave Pickett: uh done moving on like is the Metro Pass a pretty easy form, or is even that one complicated?

325

00:34:47.850 --> 00:34:48.759

P4: Um!

326

00:34:49.260 --> 00:35:05.260

P4: They'll come in. They want to copy their two hundred and fourteen, So that's we have a pay for that. They have to do a privacy request in writing, so it's just a little short form. They fill it out. We're printing. We usually have the two hundred and fourteen printed off before they have it completed,

327

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:22.850

P4: and we're only allowed to print so many pages, and then they get. They get upset about that, because they think that, hey, you should be able to print it all off, or but so then it changes from us, and it has to go to Rmc. For them to print off what they're requesting, and that can take

329

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:34.209

P4: several months sometimes.

330

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:40.689

Dave Pickett: Um

331

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:42.830

Dave Pickett: go ahead.

332

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:49.379

p4: I was gonna say a lot of for your request, prov that request because they'll request to copy their complete file and all that got backed up because of Covid, because, you know, they had to go into their their records because the National Record Center they still have hard Ph: I guess they're converting them over to paid for file. I mean the electronic files. But so their workers that would go pull pull of a person's file wasn't there because of Covid, so that backed up a lot of those privacy requests for copies of of their files,

 and then they're using disc, and it seems like, for whatever reason, which i'm, not understanding this, but a lot of them are saying they're not receiving the disc.

p4: So I don't know, like a Cd like, or yeah, like, if you want to copy the file, and you that could be thousands of pages. So they put it on a Cd. Now, instead of just printing off a paper file, but you can still request a paper final.

But when when they do the Cd. Of all of them that we get, they're saying they didn't receive the Cd. For for what I said, for whatever reason.

345

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:24.439

Dave Pickett: And now are these the The requests for their medical record is that normally route through your office, or you're saying it routes to that. That other office

346

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:29.189

P4: medical records out and copy, and it's you know It's not just

347

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:33.170

P4: Here's the record. We can download it because you got a

348

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:38.700

P4: There's other records that may be in there,

349

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:51.530

P4: and even though it's your file, and it's part of your record, like, say, a a person may have gotten divorced, and he had to pay child support, and the Va. Is paying for well that

350

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.330

P4: X Bounces record

351

00:37:55.330 --> 00:38:05.840

P4: is a privacy issue. So you have to take that part out because he can't have that part. So it's not just okay plug in the machine and copy is filing down.

352

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.980

P4: So there's a lot involved in just getting the copy of someone's records.

353

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.109

Dave Pickett: Yeah,

354

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:18.840

Dave Pickett: Um: Okay. So for this next part i'm going to share my screen and show you um

355

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.500

Dave Pickett: a list of services.

356

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:34.559

Dave Pickett: So you able to see uh that list I've got pulled up on my screen. So this is a a list that's currently hard coded into. Va. Gov. Um.

357

00:38:34.570 --> 00:39:02.800

Dave Pickett: This list of sixteen possible services that when you search for a vba uh location anywhere in the country, some you know it'll say what services are available there, and it'll be some sample of this sixteen. So I just want to kind of talk. Walk through this list with you and um, you know, for each one, you know kind of say like, Oh, yeah, that that makes sense uh, or that's, you know.

358

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:11.620

Dave Pickett: That's not what I would call that, or you know that's something. I don't know what that is. Just kind of Get your your understanding of all these that sound good.

359

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:24.139

Dave Pickett: So applying for benefits, I think. Obviously that's that's pretty straightforward. That's something. You you all handle. Um. What about burial claim? Help? Yes,

360

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:31.259

Dave Pickett: and that would go in with uh kind of those survivor benefits that you talked about a little bit.

361

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:47.679

Dave Pickett: Um disability claim help that's uh he benefits registration. You talked about he benefits and a little bit. But do you get many people actually coming in to get help signing up for e benefits or anything like that?

362

00:39:54.070 --> 00:40:09.709

P4: Maybe for a month. It's It's not very often, because even if it's going away, that's right. They've told us that for like the last nine years, it's still here. So so we still get people coming in because they'll do something online, and it'll tell them that you have to go

and in get signed up for you benefits. So we still do that.

367

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:27.979

Dave Pickett: What about signing up for? Like a Va. Gov. Account you ever help with that, or that would not be your

368

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.790

p4: No, I don't. We don't do that at all.

369

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:36.839

P4: So when you think of the hospital of systems with with the Va. Gov:

370

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:43.680

Dave Pickett: Okay. Have you ever gotten people asking for help with that at your office? Or okay?

371

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.920

Dave Pickett: Um education career counseling.

372

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.710

P4: We talked to them about it.

373

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:56.759

P4: Uh, I think Vr. Need as a career counseling,

374

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.819

P4: but mostly for education

375

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:04.719

p4 and education. It changes so much.

376

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:11.770

p4: We can't keep up with the changes with education, so we refer them mostly to the education offices and give them the phone number, and that uh email address, because when when I worked in education: we were upstairs almost every month being taught the new changes, and that was before the nine eleven came out, and all this other stuff came out. So there isn't, any way we could keep up with what's going on on the education benefits.

380

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:47.089

Dave Pickett: Yeah. And you said like the Education Office. That's not a physical place that rings can go right. They just kind of call in It's uh for the State, if you like to fish. Yeah, miss, Go, we've got

p4: There's a a lake up there. You can catch some really nice scriers, but I don't think many of them are going to want to drive up there just for that. But there's there's there to be for education centers. But now there's only must go. Be, I think, in Buffalo the other one. So two for the whole country. Okay,

383

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:12.690

Dave Pickett: um. Family member claim help.

384

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:14.759

P4: Yes,

385

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:19.520

Dave Pickett: so um Any notes on, you know.

386

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:23.549

Dave Pickett: Peculiarities about family member claim or

387

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:37.500

P4: uh something That's someone should know if they're looking for that,

388

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.650

P4: and they're entitled to benefits, and a lot of them don't know that.

390

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:44.759

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

391

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:54.870

P4: We have some that are forty years old that nothing, you know. They come in, and they're not entitled. But i'm talking about thethe school age children uh college age children that are entitled to benefits, especially at both parents, are deceased.

394

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:06.330

Yeah,

395

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:16.090

Dave Pickett: um. You also mentioned that, you know dependence um of a veteran who is one hundred percent permanent total. Uh can also receive

396

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:20.279

Dave Pickett: uh benefits through like champ. Would you process those sorts of

397

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.609

Dave Pickett: claims in any way, or

398

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:32.829

P4: it's that to go to a place chant Va. Is It's goes to Denver. All applications go to Denver. Denver takes care of all that. Okay,

399

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:42.889

P4: And we do get uh Congressional inquiry about it because they'll say that it's been months, and it Hasn't been approved. So

400

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:50.980

P4: we just give them the Congressional contact for, and they take care of Okay,

401

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:58.850

Dave Pickett: uh help for homeless veterans. You mentioned that already. Yes. Uh. V. A home loan Help?

402

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.359

P4: Yeah. Well, we have home known people,

403

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.919

P4: so they they take care of that.

Um, we'll give them the application. But then it goes to home for them to process, and they can do that online, the the request for the certificate. But most of them will come in and and do it here

406

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:35.310

p4: uh the insurance. Uh, Normally, we can discuss a little bit with them, because there's several instruments programs, but it ends up. They get the phone number for the insurance. But the Va. Has whole life insurance,: but they also have term insurance,

but they don't put the phone number in the book for term insurance. Hmm. And there's nothing. Whenever we're looking at a veteran screen,it might show that they have the whole life policy, but it doesn't show the term life policy.

413

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:25.440

p4 So when when I i'm talking to a survivor, I will give them that phone number and tell them they need to ask if the veteran had a term policy, because they can see that, and then they can give them the number to call, because I have a term policy my wife knows, and she knows you to contact with.

414

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.009

P4: If the spouse didn't know then, and she called in and said, with my husband's to say they have insurance, and you go well. No, because it's not showing on the screen. And now here's that term policy setting there, and that belongs to her. But she doesn't know anything about it. So that's to me. That's one thing. If you're going to have a turn policy to, you need to have that number listed

418

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:59.890

Dave Pickett: right.

419

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:03.180

Dave Pickett: Uh what about financial counseling?

420

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:15.719

P4: I don't know if we do that or not? I've never done financial counseling. When I was in the military I did financial counseling, but: I haven't done any here.

422

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:27.280

Dave Pickett: So the the fact that those two things are listed together insurance claim help and financial counseling. That's probably not accurate, because

423

00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:39.559

Dave Pickett: you you know what insurance claim help is. You can do that. But financial counseling, not really something that happens at your office.

424

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.569

P4: Good.

425

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:48.069

P4: If they have a financial coordinator. Now, I don't know what that that we do.

426

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:50.649

Dave Pickett: Yeah, that Well, if you don't know, then

427

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:56.280

Dave Pickett: that that's uh, i'm gonna expect there to know some. Yeah.

428

00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:57.560

Dave Pickett: Um.

429

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:02.590

Dave Pickett: What about integrated disability, evaluation system, assistance,

430

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:11.890

Dave Pickett: um

431

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.120

P4: pensions? Yes.

432

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.969

P4: Free discharge claim, help, Yes,

433

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.419

P4: transition help. Yes.

434

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:26.759

P4: Updating direct deposit information. Yes,

435

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:32.650

Dave Pickett: and then um

436

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.320

Dave Pickett: um! Looking across this list.

437

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:43.219

Dave Pickett: Anything um that seems missing, or is this feel like a pretty complete list of

438

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:49.080

Dave Pickett: what veterans are coming in, for, aside from obviously the the um,

439

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:56.130

Dave Pickett: the state specific ones we listed out like property tax uh Toll Road and Metro.

440

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:03.469

P4: I think it's pretty pretty complete. What about the um commissary shopping

441

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:10.319

Dave Pickett: service? How would you classify that? Would that fall under any of these categories, or is that it's kind of own thing.

442

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:14.489

P4: Oh, no! Because now the military they've opened up so the veterans can can actually get an Id card to go on base any veteran regardless of their percentage. They can get an Id card to go on base and shop with the Vx and Commissary

445

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.220

P4: good,

446

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:36.380

P4: and then people get confused when they breed something about that.

447

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:40.169

P4: They like the uh car allowance.: If you put it on the website, then they all think they're authorized the car. Will you have to have loss for use of.

450

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:55.390

P4: You know. Also use of a leg or norm, or you're blind,

451

00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:04.070

P4: and they don't they don't read that far. They just read what the part they want to see, and then they stop, and then they come into the Va.

452

00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:07.240

P4: Wanting to fill out a car allowance, and you

453

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:10.269

P4: you can't tell them they can't apply.

454

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:12.489

P4: You can tell them

455

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.699

P4: that you have to have longer use of,

456

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:22.570

P4: and some of them it it doesn't make any difference. They'll apply anyway, and then they get denied.

457

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:33.530

P4: That's that's the bad part about putting things in the web. They only read what they want us to see, they don't read the rest of it that says, you gotta have this so car allowance uh the housing allowance. It's. It's the housing allowance. It's it's kind of the same way.

459

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:43.460

P4: And then uh,

460

00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:49.669

P4: yeah, Okay.

461

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.430

P4: So I mean it. It would be helpful to list it.

462

00:49:54.870 --> 00:50:02.099

P4: But maybe in bold print you have to meet this criteria to receive this. You can't.

463

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:07.589

P4: We can't tell anyone they can't apply, even though you know It's going to be disapproved.

464

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.519

P4: Got it? They can apply so

465

00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:14.399

Dave Pickett: um

466

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:21.180

Dave Pickett: great. Well, we're We're almost at time here, and I I want to respect your time. But um,

467

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:37.109

Dave Pickett: you know, thinking about everything we've talked about today. You know any other. You know things you you wish would be on a website. Um! That again veterans might not look at the website. They might only look at part of it. But if you were,

468

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:46.300

Dave Pickett: if veterans were going to look at a website before they came to your office, anything you wish that that that was on there that would, you know, make it easier for them or for you?

469

00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:53.870

P4: No, I can't really think of anything.

470

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.799

P4: It was helpful when we would get the

471

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.430

P4: the books,

472

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.280

P4: the benefit uh pampas.

473

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.630

P4: They used to issue them every couple of years, but they stopped doing that. I think

474

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:11.390

P4: I think the last book that I have was a couple of years old now, but

475

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:16.970

P4: it might be old, and that has no I don't have it with me. Uh the book I use is

476

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.790

P4: gosh,

477

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:34.439

P4: it doesn't even have a date, but it's it's a pretty old edition, but it has so much information, and that was one thing about the books. Every year they print them,

478

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:36.120

P4: but then they

479

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:43.090

P4: leave stuff out. So this year it might talk about this. But then next year it has something else.

480

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:50.460

P4: So you have to have. I have books from. When I started working in public contact up until they quit

481

00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:53.910

P4: working. I kept on it every year because

482

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:59.870

P4: this book would talk about the form. That's another issue. Foreign medical policy.

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.859

Dave Pickett: What? And what's uh foreign medical policy.

485

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.950

p4 It's for health care basically but uh for veterans living overseas. If they have service, connected disabilities, the Va. They uh I don't know how they pay, but they pay if it goes in for that service and the disability.

489

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:35.640

p4: And that used to be in the book, the foreign medical program,

490

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.639

P4: The other issue, which is not so much anymore.

491

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:46.839

P4: But, uh, I started this

492

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:51.819

P4: Crsc. And Crdp for retired military that used to be in the book because the Va. Can't pay. They offset their retired pay. If they are less than fifty percent, and if they are over fifty percent they get, they get that money it used to like. If you were getting five hundred dollars from the Va. Well, they would take it out. Military person's retired pay, but after a certain percentage, then they they put you get the five hundred from the Va. And it doesn't affect you uh retired pay.

I think that's on the website. It used to be in the book

502

00:53:42.620 --> 00:54:00.139

Dave Pickett: and in the book you're talking about. That's something that was given to public contact staff, or that something that was broadly available to veterans,

503

00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:01.370

Dave Pickett: Mhm

504

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.350

P4: but the small books

505

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:14.700

514

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:53.580

P4: Yes,

515

00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.109

P4: She's a whiz at it. But I I I can't.

520

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:24.580

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:44.350

P4: I I don't know what it is when I can't even use the iphone. So something's wrong with my fingers when I've touched the buttons it. It doesn't work right. So.

522

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:48.119

P4: But a lot of them aren't computer a little of them.

P4: They don't want to have to look it up and try to find it and read it.

P4: They don't rather have. Come in and have someone tell them

P4: so. It's important that we know

P4: what the tail name

P4: and not tell them. I mean not. Tell them incorrectly like No, you can't file a claim unless you have this and this. We want to tell them the right information and get them. There was a a time,

p4: and we had a certain supervisor investments would come in, and they were Vietnam veterans, and they had disabilities from that

 but they were having them all non-service connected tensions,

 and I asked my supervisor why they were doing that. And he said, Well,

 because we can get a money faster that way.

 Well, yeah, you can do that with. But you're cheating them out of another couple of thousand dollars, because

 if they're going to be that one hundred percent,

and instead of getting three thousand dollars and only getting a thousand dollars. It's like, Yeah, you're helping them get some money. But you're not helping them get the right right benefit.

P4: And we did one, a friend of mine a couple of years ago.

536

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:12.710

P4: I talked to the veteran on the phone, so

537

00:57:14.010 --> 00:57:15.900

P4: I went to a friend of mine.

538

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:20.390

P4: He was going to go to an outreach there, and the guy was gonna go talk to him, and I told him he should be getting a hundred percent, you know, because he was on a non-service connected pension, and that he was one of those that he was a vietnam veteran. He had all these different disabilities.

P4: So when they talked to you, filled out another application, and he got approved for one hundred, because somebody did didn't do what they should be doing

542

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:44.950

00:57:56.830 --> 00:57:59.629

P4: So when you do your website. I'm trying to make it easy short, you know, short to the point, so that they don't, you know, if you got fifteen pages, they're not going to read fifteen pages.

 Just get it short to the point of what they need to do

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:23.620
