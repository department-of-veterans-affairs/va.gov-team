00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.859

Dave Pickett: thank you.

6

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.419

Dave Pickett: so just to get started. tell me a little bit about what you do at the Va.

7

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:36.079

P9: So I have been with the Va. For 20 years. I started at on the vha side in 2,002 came over to Vba in 2,005.

8

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:46.649

P9: I was a Vsr. And Rbsr. A coach. I recently did 4 and a half years as an Assistant Service Center manager.

9

00:00:46.880 --> 00:01:06.469

P9: and I moved back here to the state in January. after being gone for 4 and a half years. So I just missed the kids and the Grandkids so much. So I've been in the state since 1982, and this is home. And so I came back. So I am back as a coach

10

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:16.450

P9: which basically front line supervisor manager. I manage a couple of different teams, one of which is the public contact team.

11

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.369

Dave Pickett: Got it?

12

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.819

Dave Pickett: And so

13

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.079

Dave Pickett: you're back here as a coach.

14

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.400

Dave Pickett: That's only been since this January.

15

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.199

Dave Pickett: so collectively? How many years Have you kind of been overseen public contact?

16

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.500

P9: Oh,

17

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.000

P9: At least

18



00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:09.299

P9:  I think it was around 325 employees.

20

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:18.880

P9: so I oversaw the supervisors of public contact and several of their teams. So I had oversight over the coaches of public contact.

21

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.759

Dave Pickett: Got it? and what's your favorite part of your job

22

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.990

P9: outreach

23

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.880

P9: for? Sure I do like doing outreach. I like to

24

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.000

P9: do employee mentoring and developing

25

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.890

Dave Pickett: great

26

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:45.299

Dave Pickett: so to give you a little background about where i'm coming from and my team's perspective. So the Va. Has found 7 different regional benefit offices

27

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:59.669

Dave Pickett: who have opted in to be our first round of participants in building a new website. so a new modernized one that will replace the current websites. and then you know, based on what we find working with these 7 offices, then we'll

28

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:09.429

Dave Pickett: iterate and roll it out to the rest of the regional benefit offices. So your RO is one of the 7 that has opted in and so we're just trying to get

29

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:27.979

Dave Pickett: talk to all of you. And again make sure we're building the best possible website for benefit offices based on what's unique about your location, and you feel free to give any insights. Since the fact that you've been to a couple of different. That's great. Don't

30

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.330

be afraid to share anything that might be helpful or useful.

31

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.150

P9: Sure

32

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.449

Dave Pickett: so think specifically talking about your RO.

33

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.630

Dave Pickett: is

34

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.610

Dave Pickett: That's the regional benefits office ? That's the facility you're working at

35

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.710

Dave Pickett: and is that the only facility? Or do you ever split your time going to another site.

36

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.260

P9: so no, we are co-located with a va healthcare facility. So in

37

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:02.290

P9: I.

38

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:21.409

P9: At 1 point I had an office for staff out in the valley in it's about 45 min north of here. I'll probably be able to re-establish that area again. But the the primary business location is here.

39

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.390

Dave Pickett: Okay.

40

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.069

Dave Pickett: And so you mentioned that it's co-located with the hospital. What are some of the

41

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.690

Dave Pickett: you know.

42

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.449

Dave Pickett: trade offs pros and cons about that versus

43

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:49.889

P9: being a standalone. It's rough, you know, in a different RO. We were in the Federal Building, and we were the Standalone. So you know, people were there specifically to see vba here. veterans think that the Va. Is just one Va. And so they're talking to their health care provider about bba benefits, and they don't know, so they send them up here

45

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:12.069

P9: up until we were closed because of Covid, and only doing phone in our views

46

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.269

P9: up until I think we started reopening. I want to say, in June or July

47

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.090

to a couple of in person Interviews? and now I am open

48

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:30.369

P9: for half days, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at my doors wide open. And so it's.

49

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:47.430

P9: The problem is is that you know they go and complain to the Bha director who has no oversight, and then I get reached out to, because there are issues that veterans are upset, and there's nobody in the office to handle these things.

50

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.909

P9: Bha is frustrated because they don't know who to go to or how to resolve these problems because the veterans just keep coming to them.

51

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.150

P9: So it's. You know those kinds of challenges.

52

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.730

P9: just folks want here in this state. They Wanna they prefer to be seen in person versus virtual. We have a: a probably a higher population of older veterans that Don't use technology. and then probably the majority of this most of the State. A lot of the State does not even have accessible Internet. So

57

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.640

P9: those issues as well.

58

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:46.330

Dave Pickett: thinking about the building itself. how how easy is it to get to any quirks about parking or anything? If somebody was.

59

00:06:46.480 --> 00:07:05.729

P9: No, we have very large parking lot. it's very accessible. It's located right outside one of the we are right next to joint base, Elmendorf Richardson. So we are only a clinic, not a hospital. and so we utilize some of the

60

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:23.280

P9: Jay Bears hospital facility for for things, and so we're right outside of one of their gates. we actually have a hallway link that connects our building to the hospital, so it's

61

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:31.140

P9: We moved in. They they built the facility. I want to say we moved in in 2,010

62

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:45.730

P9: and so kind of right away, you know, because the planning takes years, I mean right away. When we all moved in. We we had already outgrown the the building before we even moved in. So

63

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:52.569

P9: it's, you know it's had just challenges. We have some va folks that reside in our area.

64

00:07:52.630 --> 00:08:11.319

P9: but I mean there's been no concerns with with that going on. But I think the biggest thing is is veterans coming in just thinking you're just one. Va: how come you don't know this? How come You're not communicating? the Vha employees having no clue: what we do. there's signage, you know, everywhere. Yet

they keep sending them up to us, and then they get angry because we're not there, and it's justthe communication piece is probably the biggest barrier

68

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:44.090

Dave Pickett: in terms of you know, where you're located inside the facility. Is there any assuming that somebody actually was coming to you for the right reason? Anything that makes it difficult to find. Your office in particular is a pretty good signage.

69

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:54.859

P9: Oh, yeah, it's pretty good signage. They know we're at the end of one of the wings on the second floor, so it's easily accessible by the stairway or the elevator

70

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.560

P9: For

71

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:17.179

P9: many years we did not have a bathroom in our wing, and so that was done. During the time I was in another RO they actually had facilities put in a restroom in our wing. I don't know Why, I mean you. I You had to go quite a ways to get to the restroom, and so that was difficult, for you know, some veterans and employees

72

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:25.080

P9: but for the location in the building. If you were in a in a good location, easy to find

73

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.230

P9: large windows accessible

74

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.180

P9: like a bad trends.

75

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:36.559

Dave Pickett: and you mentioned that in terms of being open for

76

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:40.830

Dave Pickett: in person that's currently Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

77

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:49.360

P9: So so where our doors are open to walk in Monday and Wednesday and Friday from 8, 30 to noon. and then the rest of the day, and Tuesday and Thursday are all vera appointment, whether it's in person and virtual, so we still do in-person appointments during those days. But we have walk-ins that don't require an appointment on those mornings, those 3 mornings

and Vera appointments in person. 

What what is the range of hours that those run

80

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:31.050

P9: in person and virtual? There are appointments are every there's one slot for every 30 min, from noon to 4,

81

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:40.889

P9: and then on Tuesday and Thursday there's one slot every 30 min for a virtual and an in person from 8, 30 to 4

82

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.130

Dave Pickett: got it. So basically.

83

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.420

Dave Pickett: while you're you offer walk-ins, and you walk or offer appointments. It's one or the other at any given moment. There's never a point where there's

85

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:13.810

P9: no les is, so I I have to I I You know we could probably see more people. But I have to limit.

86

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:14.940

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

87

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:27.959

Dave Pickett: no, it it. It's interesting because I've been talking to lots of different people, and how the breakdown of if they are appointment only, or a mix it's been lots of different models. but yes, it makes a lot of sense to me.

88

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:33.470

Dave Pickett: I think other people would benefit from adopting it.

89

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:47.369

Dave Pickett: So when you're you know, speaking to somebody who's you know, maybe new to the Va. Right, like a new veteran or beneficiary, trying to explain again this whole ecosystem of the Va. What

90

00:11:47.660 --> 00:12:03.330

P9: they can get done specifically at your office versus other places. What's kind of your, you know. High level elevator Spiel: yeah.

91

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:19.279

P9: we have the health care where you're going to get your health care treatment, your medicine, and you can see your doctor. You have benefits where you know you're we're the money givers. We're going to give you some money. If we can find a way to do that. And then there's Cemetery. We want to keep you out of that.

92

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:39.199

P9: So and I say that you know there's 3 different branches, and they don't communicate. So when you're talking to us, my information is not going to be shared with your doctor downstairs, and when you're talking to your doctor downstairs about your knee getting worse. I'm not going to know that. So to file a claim for increase. So it's really important that

93

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:45.180

you understand the 2 in 3 different branches, and what benefits we can can give to each other?

94

00:12:46.720 --> 00:13:02.469

P9: higher level than that, you know. They really don't understand that we fall under another RO. So they go and complain to the director over the health care, and they're like. Oh, I don't know what to do, and so I constantly.

95

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:08.140

P9: I probably spend more time in the Director suite than I do sometimes in my own office.

96

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:22.280

P9: because dealing with with issues like that. So but yeah, I I I just make sure that they understand that the the 3 different branches. Don't communicate even though we're one. Va

97

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:28.180

P9: this is what the breakdown of what we can do, and for other things. No

98

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:48.539

P9: for me. I'm able to answer a lot of questions for the health care side, because, you know, I started there and then my husband is the director of rural health on the health side. So he's been with the Va. just it'll be 20 years in June. I just had my twentieth anniversary on the second. So you know, we have a lot of

99

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:59.229

P9: We have a lot of knowledge between the 2 of us. So, but I do make it clear that. Okay, that's a health issue. You'll need to, you know. Talk to this person about that.

100

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.680

Dave Pickett: Got it

101

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:13.380

Dave Pickett: so obviously on days when it's a point or times when it's appointments. It's appointments. but during those walk in hours what would you say is about maybe a typical wait time for somebody to be seen.

102

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:27.280

P9: it's not too bad, I mean. I think we're definitely under the 20 min the the 20 min timeframe. I would say, you know at most somebody will have to wait 5 or 10 min at that.

103

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.550

Dave Pickett: Okay.

104

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:42.050

Dave Pickett: and then obviously it's Monday, Wednesday, Friday in the mornings, or only real times that you're open. Any kind of trends you see of when there's a rush of people you know, if that's not

105

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:51.919

Dave Pickett: obviously that being the only limited window. That's not a lot of time further, but anything annually that you know, or

106

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:57.710

Dave Pickett: different any other time based things that affect when you might have a rush of people.

107

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:05.179

P9: you know. I will say that when we were just doing in-person appointment only I had

108

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:10.210

P9: 13 spots a day, and I filled them up every single day

109

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:28.610

P9: every day when I was doing in person only and I would go, you know. I'd only have maybe one or 2, maybe 3 virtual. Everybody wants to be in person, and so they could book as far as a week out, and I would have a week out of in person booked.

110

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:35.130

P9: So my in-person walk-ins in those let's see 30

111

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:49.290

P9: 3 and a half hours i'm, seeing I don't know if there's necessarily a rush time. It's pretty much a steady flow. We're seeing 10 to 15 people during those 3 and a half hours.

112

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:56.190

Dave Pickett: so next question. You've already talked about this a little bit. But what are some of the

113

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:09.229

Dave Pickett: common frustrations complaints that you're kind of hearing about from veterans that are specific to this facility different than what you would have heard from people when you were in at the other RO.

114

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.760

P9: The accessibility to an in person

115

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.160

P9: visit.

116

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.689

P9: that you know

117

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:26.079

P9: that we're not there. We're not available. vha! Not being

118

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:40.690

P9: apprised of our our hours, you know I go down, and I share flyers and stuff with them, but they will still just randomly send people up. Also, somebody will get a phone number

119

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:57.810

P9: and use that phone number, and i'm having an extremely difficult time since we're co-located. I'm having an extremely difficult time managing my workload and public contact because they get a they get a hold of one of my las's

120

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:03.030

P9: phone numbers and emails, and so they constantly reach out to that one person

121

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.390

P9: and

122

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:23.659

P9: I. When I first came on. I I had his phone number changed. I said, do not get this out. We have call centers, you know, and and so they need to getting all these emails from people constantly to do things like Fnods. And do you know what that is?

123

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:32.429

P9: I do not know what. Okay first notice of death. First notice that when a veteran passes away you have to go through the process to to end their benefits.

124

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:50.449

P9: But, the clinic side is constantly reaching out to this one person, and so he's doing all these other duties that I don't want him to be doing so so just trying to manage the workload because we're co-located, has been an extreme challenge to the point where I have disciplinary actions

125

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:51.560

Dave Pickett: great

126

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:59.640

P9: not great but helpful information. and so some of the challenges you're seeing is

127

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:10.850

Dave Pickett: not just what veterans expectations are, but actually the other staff from the other branch. because they know this

128

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:22.089

Dave Pickett: this person is in the building, and has ability to do a thing they try to get it run through that even that that's not necessarily the correct channel to normally do that.

129

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:29.169

P9: If I have my brothers, I would definitely be separate locations for sure.

130

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.040

Dave Pickett: Okay.

131

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:44.249

P9: I think that that helps the veterans understand the it puts it more. you know, having that separate visual concept. They understand that a little more that oh, okay, I need to go here now, and and it kind of diffuses the situation where they can't get angry at me for a health concern. They can't go and get angry at the health care for a Vba concern.

133

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.519

Dave Pickett: Yup! That makes sense.

134

00:18:55.790 --> 00:19:04.880

Dave Pickett: and then, in terms of how people are getting to the the building, do you say that people are mostly driving. Is there any public transit?

135

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:12.029

P9: There is a public of a stop right at the clinic, so there is public transit to the clinic

136

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:27.770

P9: mostly probably driving. We have a very large parking lot. and then I know that there are a couple of agencies within the city that transport veterans or persons with disabilities.

137

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:28.920

Dave Pickett: hey?

138

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.380

Dave Pickett: so now, you know.

139

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.559

Dave Pickett: that was mostly about what's kind of

140

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:41.690

Dave Pickett: unique about like where you're physically located. But just thinking of. Okay, once they get to your office.

141

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:47.280

Dave Pickett: what can you actually help a veteran With what would you kind of like list out as as the services that

142

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.120

Dave Pickett: you know your office offers veterans.

143

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:57.860

P9: So one of the challenges Well, so I have 2 lases and

144

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:10.520

P9: our My expectation is that? we're there to help veterans fill out applications, answer questions, [check] claim statuses.

145

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.009

P9: For

146

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:19.259

P9: I I have been working with my staff for the last 11 months

147

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:26.890

P9: on developing those skills when before. So we had the veteran service officers or in the hall behind us.

148

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:39.950

P9: And again, they're also, you know, appointment only type situation understaffed, and my folks were just kind of passing them off. Go go see a Vso. To fill out this paperwork.

149

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:47.719

and I realized that a 30 min appointment is not a long time to be able to work through an application.

150

00:20:47.730 --> 00:21:05.059

P9: So I created some space in our waiting area with some tables that were socially separated, and some chairs. with the expectation that here start your claim Here I don't. I don't want a veteran to leave without filing their claim.

151

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:07.550

P9: They just don't have.

152

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:16.899

P9: They're not gonna do it. I don't want to lose a a veterans claim because we didn't take that extra step to help them.

153

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:31.869

P9: So my expectation is that we work through it as much as we can, and then here at the table let me know. I'm going to have to help other people, but you know I'll come check on you if you have a question or my counterpart will check on you. But let's get this turned in now. There's no reason to wait.

154

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.389

the

155

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:42.259

P9: one of the problems that we come up. One of the barriers we come up with is book rehab. We get a lot of people inquiring about VR&E but we don't have a system in place to be able to refer them through VERA and that's something that i'm working on the Prior supervisor of both we have just left last week. So. that's definitely one of my top

158

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:06.789

P9: agendas. To work with the the new one on is to establish some kind of

159

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:20.810

P9: maybe either a point of contact in Vera that can, you know, Set them up in Vera, so that they have established days and times that they will see people for questions. You know. that's what I would like to see.

160

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:30.679

P9: because my folks just are answering the best they can, and then just passing on information, and I don't know what the follow through is I I don't know if the loop has been closed.

161

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:39.809

P9: but so so yeah, we mainly what my folks are doing. Folks are coming in looking for benefit letters. commissary letters. We're doing those on the spot.

163

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.239

P9: and then claim status and filing new claims.

164

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.470

Dave Pickett: Okay.

165

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:58.029

Dave Pickett: that's all great information. And I from just again

166

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.520

Dave Pickett: talking to

167

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:17.470

Dave Pickett: 11 people for an hour. So 12 h of knowledge of Vba, it's like. Oh, there seems to be a real disconnect between VR and E and public contact that's creating a huge veteran frustration. There's no real way to

168

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.420

Dave Pickett: get

169

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.370

P9: get a hold of them. Yeah.

170

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:36.010

P9: So in Vera you can set up your system to allow the veteran to select what? what is the issue? They want to talk about, you know. Are they homeless? Is this Mst: I want to claim status.

171

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:54.859

P9: There is one for bulk, rehab. I had the box unchecked, so that I would stop having people like select it. But now they just put it in the comments, you know, in the comments section, so they still keep making appointments, and we are not the subject matter experts on that. And so,

172

00:23:54.890 --> 00:24:01.370

P9: I I feel that we're probably failing a lot of people in that in that area.

173

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:13.039

Dave Pickett: right? If they they want a a counseling at session with with a a specialist, not general information about what VR. And he is, and how they might apply for

174

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.320

P9: some of that. Yeah.

175

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.280

Dave Pickett: So

176

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.069

Dave Pickett: sorry. Let me just

177

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.620

Dave Pickett: re situate myself right here.

178

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:29.050

Dave Pickett: Script. Okay. So you've obviously worked at

179

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:36.520

Dave Pickett: other benefit offices. so based on what you've seen at different places. Is there any kind of

180

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:44.439

Dave Pickett: service that's offered here. That's unique that you haven't seen other places, or vice versa.

181

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.849

I would tell you that New Orleans Have you talked to New Orleans?

182

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.470

P9: I have not talked to

183

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.969

P9: they do their public contact.

184

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.149

P9: The last I talked to them was probably last year I was

185

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:17.730

P9: 6 months ago. I'm friends with the Service Center manager. There they have a unique system set up where all of their public contact is done. Virtually. Even the folks that walk in so visualize a cubicle with a monitor there.

They have what they call a floater. So somebody walks in, and they set you up on a monitor. So you're talking to somebody either behind the wall or at home. And so if they're like oh, I need to print something. Then it gets printed in the back, and then the float or brings it out. So here's a copy of your ladder, or whatever so very limited in person contact other than the floater, so that, I think is awesome because it allows flexibility in the how you use your staff, you know. they have a lot of ras for work at home, which

 I don't understand for public contact. But anyways, you're here to work with the public, but it's allowed for a lot of flexibility in in moving things, and I think also when you're so, you're on the Monitor. So you still have the face to face. But I think it's also a little easier to

 manage the time of the interview. I think you know, when they're sitting in front of you, they get really comfortable, and I've been working with my staff on managing their interview time and get in. Get out, you know. Stay out of the weeds.

and I I, you know. So I think that that is a neat concept that they have going on.

191

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.390

P9: But for us individually.

192

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:52.409

P9: I don't know that we really do anything differently. We do have our interview. Rooms are separate, I will say.

193

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.160

P9: like at the other RO, they really kind of have a

194

00:26:56.260 --> 00:27:11.570

P9: You walk up to the little window, and there's like 3 people sitting behind this area. So you go to this window or this window or this window, so there's only like one area where you can go in for a private conversation. Our areas are set up for all for both private conversations.

195

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:17.910

P9: although the spaces are small, and we're in the process of remodeling and enlarging them

196

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:33.360

P9: so, cause we can't currently, we can't even get more than one person in there, and if they have a wheelchair. It's just really really difficult. So Sometimes we have to utilize our hearing room for interviews.

197

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:45.320

P9: I as the coach, the supervisor. I do all of the military sexual trauma interviews. I do not have a female on the staff.

198

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.690

P9: and so that is

199

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:52.309

P9: challenging, and of itself, too.

200

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:56.959

P9: you know, managing my work schedule around appointments.

201

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:02.580

P9: the veterans I don't for females and males

202

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:04.930

P9: It's it. The the

203

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:13.170

P9: interactions demonstrate that even a male is more comfortable talking to a female about

204

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:17.550

P9: sensitive stuff. So I have those kind of barriers.

205

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:19.549

P9: as well.

206

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.840

Dave Pickett: Okay.

207

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:33.839

Dave Pickett: Are there any benefits that the State offers? That maybe you're helping veterans with? That might have differed from what they got at the other RO.

208

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:46.399

P9: Absolutely the same benefits, I think, this state are are better than the ones in the other state. and my 2 lases are

209

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:53.000

proficient, and giving that information. Giving that website to the State. We work closely with the State veterans office.

210

00:28:53.070 --> 00:29:03.869

P9: one. The biggest one that everybody wants is if you're 50% service connected other than you know. Concurrent receipt for for bedroom. You know what that is

211

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:08.550

Dave Pickett: I do not know concurrent.

212

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:23.730

P9: and they're less than 50. They're military retirement, then this is not a state benefit. It's just, i'm, but their military retirement is offset from their disability. So they have

so 50 is the magic mark. So for the State benefit, the biggest value for that is the the house the home tax benefit.

214

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.510

P9: So in this state, if you're 50%

215

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:48.149

P9: or more. You qualify to You don't pay taxes on the first $180,000 of your home.

216

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:59.950

P9: Well, in most other states most other states You have to be a 100% for that. It will, asking you only have to be 50. So that's the biggest benefit that we have.

217

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:06.999

Dave Pickett: and the obviously right it's the state that processes those claims. But when a veteran comes in and is

218

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:26.120

Dave Pickett: wants to do that, what what's kind of the the ways that you support a veteran. give them their benefit letter. That shows that they are service connected 50% or more, and then we give them either the information to the website, or I believe we also have a sheet

219

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:31.360

P9: that has kind of like a cheat sheet, with all the information on it that that we hand out.

220

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.550

Dave Pickett: got it

221

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:37.290

P9: with the phone numbers and links to all the different

222

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:38.920

P9: different benefits.

223

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.300

Dave Pickett: and so you know

224

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:57.830

Dave Pickett: you would list it out. A bunch of different services that you offer, you know. Primarily it's filling out application. Looking up claim status, benefit letters right? Those were kind of the top 3 on the opposite side in your you know. Long 10 you're in benefits.

225

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:05.419

Dave Pickett: Are there really niche things that you've only seen, maybe once or twice that are actually, you know, kind of within the the benefits wheelhouse.

226

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.180

P9: I think

227

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.710

P9: i'm sure there are

228

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:29.049

P9: it's all it's. It's random. It's rare that you get somebody coming in to ask a specific question about Smc. Special monthly compensation.

229

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:47.690

P9: but we do get those, and that's it's, and I say it rare. It's not an a common thing, because usually that's a behind the scenes type, thing people don't necessarily claim. Smc: it's a benefit that we have to consider looking at the evidence and stuff, so they'll come in and ask questions about that

230

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:53.919

occasionally. and so we have to explain those processes. I think

231

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.260

P9: more so. We would get questions related to health care stuff

232

00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.640

P9: trying to think

233

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.760

P9: I can't really think of anything

234

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:08.630

P9: specific.

235

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:18.879

Dave Pickett: Okay, I mean, I special monthly Compensation Hasn't come up for me yet. So that's new for my list. So, as I'm consolidating what

236

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.669

Dave Pickett: veterans might be possibly wanting to know about when they come to a location so

237

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:25.780

Dave Pickett: super helpful.

238

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:34.020

Dave Pickett: any kind of you, to maybe more general utility. Things like

239

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:42.390

Dave Pickett: updating a bank account address that kind of stuff. that's also gets handled at the office a little bit or

240

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.099

P9: yeah, so they can do a bank

241

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:52.090

P9: updates. They're supposed to be adding dependence.

242

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:54.350

P9: But

243

00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:11.299

P9: Both of my gentlemen are great with communicating with veterans not so great with the nuts and bolts of the benefits. So

244

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:20.550

P9: We have some significant challenges with that with them, giving maybe correct information, not staying current with their

245

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:38.730

P9: information. So you know, they're supposed to be adding dependence or removing dependence when they can. Usually there's some kind of issue, and so they just make Have the veteran fill out an application which really is. it. It's not a good utilization of either

246

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:45.290

P9: our time or the veterans time, when there is a process in place to be able to do it, you know, and just get it done.

247

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:53.659

P9: but so I have those kind of issues, and those are a lot of training issues.

248

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.739

P9: yeah, there's there's a lot of training.

249

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.099

Yes.

250

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:06.379

you know. I know i'm being recorded. But i'm just gonna say this public contact is the island of Misfit. Twice it's and it's everywhere. It is a group of individuals, primarily, that have not been successful in other jobs within Vba. So they've been accommodated with a job into public contact.

252

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:24.370

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

253

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:31.569

Dave Pickett: Nobody has said that to you yet. I'm just throwing it out. There. It's the big big elephant in the room.

254

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:49.500

Dave Pickett: No, that's I have not heard that, you know. I've heard about other staffing challenges around, you know. some offices seem to have the exact right number of staff. They deal with things efficiently other places woefully under equip for the volume of

255

00:34:49.530 --> 00:35:04.879

P9: I'm. Doing all the outreach myself. I write all the Congressional responses. I'm monitoring all of the appointments trying to provide training and mentoring. And

256

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.479

P9: yeah, it's it's a lot. I also supervise 3 other teams. So

257

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.890

Dave Pickett: and so

258

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:21.190

Dave Pickett: that can. yes, that the Public Contact Office should in many ways be a

259

00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:31.480

Dave Pickett: highly specialized thing because of the the main touch point for veterans to the benefit administration. But oftentimes it is

260

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:47.020

Dave Pickett: that is not how the of the Va. You know public contact is the face of the Va. So you would think that. you're going to put in some, you know, some skilled.

261

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.319

P9: some skilled folks. but

262

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:56.829

P9: with with my experience in Vba for 17 years, that is not the case.

263

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:05.120

P9: It's not, I mean, at least in areas when i'm talking to my peers.

264

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.039

yeah, it's not the case.

265

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:08.919

Dave Pickett: Okay?

266

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:18.809

Dave Pickett: Well, I will note that. And whatever channels I have to possibly take that to a place that you can get some resolution. I'll do that. But

267

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:29.429

P9: sure, I mean it is what it is. We work with what we've got. I like, I said. They. They're really great with

268

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:42.810

P9: talking to veterans and diffusing situations. But the knowledge base is just just not there, and the problem with that is you know. I I look at them like

269

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:50.020

P9: in some aspects like I use car salesman. They could sell anything to, so anyone, and they're not going to know that they're buying a lemon.

270

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:51.129

P9: you know, right.

271

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:57.070

P9: They're not going to know that if they're getting good information or bad information because they're selling it to them.

272

00:36:57.220 --> 00:37:16.410

P9: So I've actually changed my tour duty. I was in the office twice a week. I've been coming in the office every day for the last several weeks, so that I put monitors out front so I could sit out there and just listen and help and and mentor, and be like No, that's not.

273

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.899

P9: Yeah. Let's take a look at this, hey? What about that?

274

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:27.010

P9: And especially with the new quality review process. You have to sit out there and listen to them

275

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.999

P9: to be able to evaluate their interviews.

276

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.139

P9: That started October first.

277

00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:55.720

Dave Pickett: Yeah, and obviously right. The the end goal that we're always trying to keep as our North star is. What makes the experience for the veterans the best right? So we want to make sure that they're getting accurate information in a timely manner, and they're coming to the office specifically, because it's the place of knowledge. Then they should be getting

278

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.590

Dave Pickett: right the the best knowledge they can.

279

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:02.540

Dave Pickett: So

280

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.229

Dave Pickett: So thinking of the different tasks that people come in to get accomplished.

281

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:26.389

P9: Are there any things that actually physically require somebody coming in? Or is this mostly a preference that people just want that in person? Interaction?

282

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.579

P9: we can handle questions over the phone.

283

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:40.570

P9: the problem is, you know, you have to go online to make an appointment. And so we have a lot of older generation that you know it's not equipped to do that.: And so you know they're looking. They They just they want to be in person. They? That's that's the preference.

285

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:54.769

Dave Pickett: Yeah. And so that's

286

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:06.959

Dave Pickett: a good point that even to make an appointment for in person, you need to go online. So you can walk up and or call somebody they schedule.

287

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:22.489

P9: yeah, so that feature is available for anybody to make somebody appointment. So when i'm doing my outreach, and when i'm doing my monthly training with stakeholders.

288

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:42.069

P9: I go over that process again. We get a lot of appointment scheduled through the Ncc. The call centers. So the veterans will call the call centers, and they're like, oh, okay, Well, I can go on to Vera and make an appointment for you at the office. and same thing with the Bha.

289

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:57.109

P9: there are certain people in Bha that social workers and counselors that are familiar with our process, and are willing to do that for veterans, and we'll go in and make an appointment for them.

290

00:39:57.390 --> 00:40:00.410

Dave Pickett: And would you say that there's a pretty high quality of like

291

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:01.819

Dave Pickett: They're actually

292

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:09.529

Dave Pickett: the people who are making appointments in Vera for you that they're sending the veteran to you for the for things you can actually help with.

293

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:14.119

P9: Absolutely I think that the Mcc. Probably

294

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:18.229

P9: do a little bit more, but

295

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:28.499

P9: that's my impression. I don't know what their limitations are, you know, on certain things, but I think for the most part the scheduling is good. We did have a

296

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:37.360

P9: a little hiccup in the beginning where they were. Bha was One person in particular was scheduling

297

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:56.130

P9: virtual employment for veterans, and they thought they were in person. And so it was that disconnect where we're like. Oh, there's we're trying to call you. It's like i'm in the office. I'm like i'm sorry there's nobody there, so fix that, you know. but for the most part. I think that

298

00:40:56.370 --> 00:41:00.419

P9: again, a lot of the appointments that are made can just be done

299

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:01.740

P9: over the phone

300

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.279

P9: and

301

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.739

P9: through email. But then you get into the technology piece.

302

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.979

Dave Pickett: so this next part i'm going to share my screen.

303

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:29.570

Dave Pickett: so I am pulling up a list of Vba services. So this list is currently hard, hard coded into Va. Gov. And basically for every Vba location it says services available here, and it's some subset of these services.

304

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:43.879

Dave Pickett: so just kind of want to walk through this, and you know anything that stands out to you as like. Yep, that's definitely what we do know. That's not here, or I've never even heard of that any sort of thoughts as we go through.

305

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.970

Dave Pickett: So applying for benefits.

306

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:51.440

Dave Pickett: That's that's definitely what you do. Yes, burial claim help.

307

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:52.279

Yes.

308

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.370

P9: disability claim help.

309

00:41:55.790 --> 00:42:07.099

P9: E benefits. Registration, help. We do some of that. But I only have one person that can do it, and so it's it's super: it. It's a bear it's it. It could be one of our barriers to being able to provide good service if that person's not here, or that person's, you know, not available to do that.

311

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:20.280

P9: So do do some of that. Yes.

312

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:25.169

P9: education and career counseling not with my staff. No.

313

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:31.560

Dave Pickett: and that would be

314

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.859

P9: folk. Rehab is

315

00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:39.630

P9: in our area. But my my staff, we do get questions a lot and all we

316

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:46.660

P9: basically we just say we can pass on the information, or here's the form that you can apply for

317

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.340

Dave Pickett: education claim help

318

00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:51.540

P9: the same thing.

319

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:58.390

Dave Pickett: So not you can just kind of refer them out.

320

00:42:58.620 --> 00:42:59.419

P9: Yeah.

321

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.660

Dave Pickett: family member claim help.

322

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.219

P9: Yes, we can do that.

323

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.470

Dave Pickett: Help for homeless veterans.

324

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.759

P9: Yes, we need to improve on that. But yes.

325

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:12.629

okay.

326

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:15.400

Dave Pickett: V. A Home loan help.

327

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:21.720

P9: We don't process home loans. We just give them the phone number and website for that

328

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:33.080

Dave Pickett: insurance claim help and financial counseling.

329

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:37.710

Dave Pickett: One place that does both are those 2 things that actually exist.

330

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:43.290

P9: I don't know if financial counseling exist. But there is an insurance area, and the reason I know it is because I mentored somebody that was in a a program last year that works at the in Philadelphia insurance portion. So I have my internal point of contact for any insurance questions. She probably needs it. But

333

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:10.669

P9: that's what you that's why you're here for 20 years. You build up that network of

334

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:13.990

P9: not working.

335

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:19.759

Dave Pickett: how about Integrated disability, evaluation, system, assistance?

336

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:33.529

P9: So I do. supervise the military specialist coordinators that do the I des but that is separate from the public contact. So we don't do that in public contact. But I I

337

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:40.630

P9: I supervise the we do that here at our V. At Vba or in our Vba, but it's

338

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:48.179

Dave Pickett: so. If somebody wanted to help with that Ha! You know, and they're looking at the website.

339

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:54.939

Dave Pickett: Is it accurate to say it's available at the Vba office, or is it?

340

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.580

P9: Yes, I know really, that's a program that starts with the Dod you only get into the I does program. If the Dod says we want you out because you have a disability.

So it's not really something that you come because I does They're active duty. They're still active duty, so they don't just come to our office and say, hey, I want to have the military Help me do this. No, the that starts at the Dod. So I think that a more accurate title for that would be pre discharge claims

343

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:37.770

P9: because we do. We can do pre discharge clients and provide counseling on that. It's basically the claim process. A pre discharge claim you have to be within 180 days of discharge.

344

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:50.139

P9: And so we can provide it's basically just a claim while they're on active duty within 180 days. IDES is completely different, and not something that I, personally, think should be on the website.

348

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:02.009

P9: It's a it's a it's a separate Dod Vba process.

349

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:02.819

Dave Pickett: Okay.

350

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:04.330

Dave Pickett: pensions.

351

00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:10.479

P9: We can help fill out the claim. We do not process pension claims.

352

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:11.129

Dave Pickett: Okay.

353

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:17.800

Dave Pickett: Pre: discharge.

354

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.540

Dave Pickett: Great

355

00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:20.490

Dave Pickett: transition help?

356

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.319

P9: No, no! And I don't even know what.

357

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.470

P9: I guess that's more from the active duty side. There, there's a active duty program that provides that transition assistance. We we do not

359

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:36.149

Dave Pickett: Okay.

360

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.729

Dave Pickett: updating direct deposit information.

361

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.049

P9: Yes.

362

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:44.600

Dave Pickett: and then vocational rehabilitation and employment help.

363

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.589

P9: Yeah, I mean, I I don't my staff can't do it. But

364

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:52.519

P9: we have people in the building that can.

365

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:58.850

Dave Pickett: If we get a hold of them

366

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:06.059

Dave Pickett: at the hours. Your office is open for walk-ins doesn't actually get them closer to that than if they were just to

367

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:10.110

Dave Pickett: have the information elsewhere and contact that person directly.

368

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.879

P9: Exactly.

369

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:23.050

Dave Pickett: Okay. Looking across this list anything that you would immediately add, that's clearly missing, or

370

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.119

P9: I would have on there.

371

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:37.799

P9: just because I you know it is a very high profile, sensitive subject, and so I think people should. being should know that. we have people that are trained or specialized to to handle those types of claims or interviews.

P9: I think that's the only one I can think of.

374

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.430

Dave Pickett: Okay, great.

375

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:01.869

Dave Pickett: Let me just get back to my list here.

376

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:13.959

Dave Pickett: So you know, zooming back out, we kind of dove pretty deep into some details thinking about. so, my team we are. Our scope of

377

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:31.409

Dave Pickett: influence is the public facing website. So not what happens to veteran once they're logged in just what you can see on va do go without walking in so information. If somebody is looking up this regional office list of services, what's available?

378

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:46.439

Dave Pickett: Anything they might need to know for preparing. That's why I asked about parking all that kind of thing if you could. If you had one thing, one piece of advice, you would put on that website, regardless of anything else that you think would help veterans be more prepared

379

00:48:46.800 --> 00:49:04.359

Dave Pickett: if they check the website, Which again, that's Some people are obviously just walking down a hall and not checking a website, but for you know somebody who might be planning to drive in, and they might make sure you don't you. You don't forget this, or something like that.

380

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:16.789

P9: if it's, I think a link to Vera is should be on there information for Vera that, hey? You don't have to come into our office. If you want to talk to a benefits counselor. just make an appointment here, I think you know, is would be beneficial.

382

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:26.089

P9: Traveling in the state can be challenging.

383

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:32.580

P9: even if you're on the road system, and the majority of the State is not on the road system.

384

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:39.559

P9: So I think that having that ha ask a question, you know upfront

385

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.970

P9: you know. Prom Prominent.

386

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:43.220

Okay.

387

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:52.120

Dave Pickett: And if somebody is planning to come in any kind of thing that they should always bring with them. Do they need a photo? Id

388

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:00.349

P9: yeah, they're gonna have a photo. Id I mean.

389

00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:05.329

P9: not really. We pretty much can get

390

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:09.469

P9: anything that they need, and fill it out there.

391

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:18.520

Dave Pickett: So that right Dd. 214 you could pull for them.

392

00:50:18.530 --> 00:50:34.829

P9: You know the applications themselves. You can pull any sort of information that your team doesn't have access to, that. They might need to file a claim, or if you have private treatment records that you want to consider, please bring a copy that will help speed up the process. I mean, we can always develop for those. But

393

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.710

P9: you know development actions. That's the

394

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:54.419

P9: That's the P in the python right there. You know you're waiting on third party to provide information for you. So you know, if if you have private medical treatment that you'd like to be considered in, you know it's, it's helpful if they bring a copy of that

395

00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.069

Dave Pickett: Okay, Great

396

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.599

Dave Pickett: Anything else that's come up today that you wanted to

397

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:02.410

Dave Pickett: mentioned, or questions for me?

398

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:04.999

P9: No, I don't think so I think

399

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:06.980

P9: covered it all

400

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:23.440

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:26.220
