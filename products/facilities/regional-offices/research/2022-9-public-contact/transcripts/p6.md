5

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.020

Dave Pickett: so to get started. Could you tell me just what's your role at the Va.

6

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.660

P6: My title is legal administrative specialists.

7

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:43.600

P6: my role is to assist veterans and go to the families and apply for benefits, whether it's source connected or pension related.

8

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.910

Dave Pickett: Okay.

9

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.080

Dave Pickett: and how long have you been in that position.

10

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.870

P6: maybe a little11 years.

12

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.870

Dave Pickett: Okay. So quite a while. Then.

13

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.990

P6: Yeah.

14

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.359

Dave Pickett: And what's your favorite part of your job?

15

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:10.180

Dave Pickett: Yeah. Great? just Fy: I know you can't see the computer Don is on the line. Now, Don, if you just want to say hello real quick.

16

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.209

Dawn: Hi! How are you tonight?

17

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.180

P6: Hey? Good morning or Good afternoon.

18

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.309

Dawn: Hello!

19

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.480

Dave Pickett: We've we've been working with offices from

20

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:28.679

Dave Pickett: San Juan Puerto Rico to anchorage Alaska. So we've been dealing with all sorts of time zones during these calls.

21

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:47.940

Dave Pickett: So just to give you a little background about our team. So we're currently working with 7 different regional benefit offices from around the country to design kind of a first version of a new website that will later be rolled out to every regional benefit around the country. So your local offices

22

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.200

Dave Pickett: is one of those kind of 7 places that we're working directly with as kind of a first

23

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:04.449

Dave Pickett: round of building this new website. So you're kind of opted in to give us like the first round of information, so we can build these these new websites.

24

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.240

Dave Pickett: so

25

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.889

Dave Pickett: Just to confirm you work at the Sattelite office. Is that correct?

26

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.339

P6: That is correct?

27

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.779

Dave Pickett: And now are you there? every day, or do you ever go visit a different facility to do to do work?

28

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:40.350

P6: I only visit different facilities. 

29

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.059

Dave Pickett: And is that? How often are you visiting those other locations?

30

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.719

P6: we? We try to do outreach at least once a month to each location

31

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.640

Dave Pickett: Okay.

32

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.470

Dave Pickett: so thinking of the the main facility on Siphan

 is this a the building you work in? Is that a standalone building just for the regional office, or does it share space with other facilities?

34

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:18.059

P6: Okay. So I have a an unusual setup in that on Mondays, Mondays.

 I sit at the Gsa building here on site Pan assigned to V. A check.

 So I sit in a veterans Health Administration space managed and operated by the Gsa General Services Administration.

 But that's only a London's. Tuesday through Friday. I sent no office that's provided by state. So you can look at it as a State building from Tuesday to Friday. A Federal building on Monday

41

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.149

Dave Pickett: Got it?

42

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.189

Dave Pickett: and you know, thinking about your Tuesday through Friday location.

43

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.620

Dave Pickett: That's you know, an office and a a larger building.

44

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:13.359

Dave Pickett: Are there any quirks about how people get to that office that you know might make it hard for somebody to find.

45

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:28.810

P6: No, no! This is a very small community, and actually the State offices in what they call Capital Hill, so it's a very recognized location on the Iowa.

46

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.010

Dave Pickett: Okay? And what about your Monday location? Where's

47

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.700

Dave Pickett: Where is that? Located?

48

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:53.530

P6: Yeah, that's located directly across the street from the Army Reserve Center, and that's actually a larger building than the State building, because they house medical and other Federal agencies within that that compound, or that camps

49

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.450

Dave Pickett: got it.

50

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.089

Dave Pickett: and what hours you know. Do you? you know, see people at those different locations?

51

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:11.319

P6: So I report at 0 7, 30, but we're open for services from 0, 8 to 1,600 or 4. Pm.

52

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.579

P6: Okay, and that's that's the same. Both places.

53

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:21.140

Dave Pickett: Great

54

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:30.199

Dave Pickett: Any other, you know. Again, as we're working on, making sure the information is clear for anyone who might want to visit

55

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:40.180

Dave Pickett: either of those locations, any quirks about parking or any other just kind of basic how to get their information that they might need to know.

56

00:05:41.020 --> 00:06:03.859

P6: like I said, the the landmarks for each facility are well known. I will, because the money facility is directly across the street from the Army Reserve Center, and the Military exchange or proofs for where you can get discounts on shopping because of military id or service connected. Id so Everybody knows that building. And then, because we're here on Capitol Hill, the seat of the government here on the line. Most folks are familiar with this location also.

58

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:14.540

Dave Pickett: Okay.

59

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:25.180

Dave Pickett: And if you, you were talking to a a veteran or a beneficiary who's maybe new to the Va. And

60

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:33.500

Dave Pickett: Doesn't understand all the different parts of it. How would you describe what you can help them with, versus what they can get from other parts of the Va.

61

00:06:34.490 --> 00:07:03.600

P6: i'll. I'll normally give a brief explanation to veterans that have been especially newly awarded, granted a service to disability benefit. I explain the Va umbrella that Va. Has basically a number of with 3 branches underneath it. there's the Veterans Health Administration, those over the big hospitals sometimes with veteran cemeteries in front of them that should recognize they service nothing but health care that I work for the veterans benefits administration.

64

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:40.889

P6: I'm. Working part of meeting where something happens to you active duty and you will see treatment, and then you received or required subsequent treatment or rehabilitation post active duty, then i'm the person that you come to see the file a claim because you had a residual from something that occurred while you were an active duty, and it bothers you into your now civilian life.

65

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:54.719

P6: Then I've explained to them. the third major umbrella underneath Va. Is the National Cemetery Administration, where we provide final services for veterans and their

66

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:55.970

Dave Pickett: Okay.

67

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:05.599

Dave Pickett: And now, are you doing appointments, or is it mostly just people walk in to see you at the the location?

68

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:16.940

P6: It's both. We have an appointment scheduler. that's we've been rolled out nationally the Emra. that's the scheduler but they're free to walk in and see services as they see.

70

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:30.850

Dave Pickett: And if you had to break down what percentage of people are making appointments versus just showing up.

71

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.710

P6: Well.

72

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.900

P6: okay, so i'm in the remote community with the a higher Co board of older folks. I I I would say it's probably gonna be 70 30, 70 being walk in 30 being a appointments.

 But as we to start coming in. I do see that they're using the all a lot, so I I expect, probably over the next 3 or 5 years that might change might be 50, 50, or 60, 40.

80

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.120

Dave Pickett: That makes sense.

81

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.829

Dave Pickett: and if somebody is coming in without an appointment

82

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.810

Dave Pickett: is there much of a way? They're usually pretty able to see

83

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:21.890

Dave Pickett: people quickly.

84

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:31.309

P6: No, I i'm i'm pretty efficient. So there's never been anybody that's had to wait longer than 10Â min for

85

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.559

Dave Pickett: Are there any you know

86

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.810

Dave Pickett: time periods in which you've seen? Maybe a rush of people

87

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:43.260

Dave Pickett: any times of the month or times of year, or anything like that

88

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.149

P6: because of the population here, you know.

89

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:46.950

Dave Pickett: Okay?

90

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.940

Dave Pickett: Fair enough any common frustrations that you're hearing from veterans about.

91

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:59.659

Dave Pickett: You know, kind of either of the locations any particular problems that they're you know expressing.

92

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:09.549

P6: I'm not sure your Webinar will be able to assist with this but a common complaint. Here is the the difference between services on the mainland Call this Continental United States versus out here in the far. they recognize that there's a logistical challenge in the delivering services. but I don't think they quite understand it's.

96

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.020

P6: If they get all the

97

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.790

P6: buildings. Monday morning

98

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.439

P6: You have to staff those buildings for qualified staff. qualifies that to fill full time of roles. when you're asking the folks to move halfway across the world, and a lot of times they're married with kids, and we don't have the same type of infrastructure here at Cmi at certain kinds of learning professionals will be accustomed to back on the calls. So that's a challenge that a lot of them don't really grasp.

101

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:12.900

Dave Pickett: Okay.

102

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:23.449

Dave Pickett: And then how are people typically getting to to your office? Are they driving? Are they walking public transportation?

103

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:27.119

P6: No, those mostly probably on here.

104

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.080

Dave Pickett: Okay.

105

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.030

Dave Pickett: So you listed out a couple of things that you can help people with

106

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:39.040

Dave Pickett: filing the claim. what would you kind of say? Are the

107

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.499

Dave Pickett: the top things that people come in for help with.

108

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.430

P6: Obviously what they really come in: to get a place for V about is to make sure that the forms that they are need to complete for services. you know, a little busy, little, complicated little intimidating. So they want, you know, a set of on balls to make sure that because we're all the way out here, last thing they want is something to be in complete or something not to being edited correctly, and for it to be set back and within the you know, go back into the queue. So a lot of times it's just make sure that the forum is is correct. And if they have eligibility for whatever program or service that they're applying.

114

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:48.700

Dave Pickett: what about once, you know, something is submitted to get people asking about claim status that you're helping them. Or

115

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:56.039

P6: so, once once they come into the office and they take the client on the exit remind them of my direct cell phone number, my Federal government asset phone number, and I remind them that they can call me normally once a month, or if they're in the area, they can stop by the office, and I can actually provide them with their status of their clients.

 that then, to call the 871,000 number on mainland because of the time

119

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.700

Dave Pickett: Right?

120

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.269

Dave Pickett: Any other kind of like

121

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:35.599

Dave Pickett: top things that you know is the bulk of what you're doing to support veterans that you'd list out

122

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.149

P6: absolutely.

123

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:48.699

P6: All I work for department of better affairs. the community Here they apply for different Federal programs. and because not everyone has a legal administrative specialist or someone that understands Federal needs. at this location i'm doing work for social security for defense for any type of Federal program that a person may or may not be eligible, for they get that middle, and they have a question on the go to person so far for that

126

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:33.240

Dave Pickett: got it. So not just veterans affairs, but anybody who's doing a government form and knows about you might come your way just to be like, hey, can you give us a once over? Make sure

127

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.019

Dave Pickett: it's all all looking good.

128

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.830

P6: Correct?

129

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:57.050

Dave Pickett: So you mentioned a little bit obviously different service availability here  and you also mentioned the commissary nearby. I know that's a a benefit that you know Certain veterans can get commissary letter.

130

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:07.470

Dave Pickett: Any other like kind of services that are, you know, maybe comparable to the mainland in terms of veterans, can can really get take advantage of them. There.

131

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:26.980

P6: Well, there is a College, so veterans are able to utilize their chapter. 35 for their post 9. 11. G. I. Bill benefits to attend that college here and there's also, I believe, a technical center that issues 6, 9, and 12 and 18 month certificates that I believe, are eligible to participate in education programs. So that's here.

134

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:58.429

P6: They opened up the the caregiver program. So there's certain veterans that if they're searching with disabilities or severe enough, and they have a spouse for relative caregiver and home. that caregivers able to receive the most excitement and annual training for the care of that veteran.

136

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:09.039

P6: So that programs here.

137

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.040

P6: but that's about it.

138

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.820

Dave Pickett: Okay.

139

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:19.029

Dave Pickett: now you know your official designation is, you know you're a satellite office, right and

140

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:31.259

Dave Pickett: kind of seen as underneath the Regional Office banner. How much does is there actually a meaningful relationship there on a day to day basis, like, or you just kind of. You're the office here, and

141

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.980

Dave Pickett: you're not necessarily working directly with the Regional Office in any way.

142

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.520

P6: Oh, no, no, no, no!

143

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:52.100

p6: I I work with. We're. I work closely with the public contact step in all over and we're on email daily. we meet weekly, sometimes multiple Times Weekly. so. No, I there's there's not a disconnect between this satellite office and the regional office.

145

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:05.490

Dave Pickett: and from a veterans perspective do they understand that connection, or is that not important to them?

146

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:25.500

p6 No, I would make sure that they understand that I represent the Regional Office, and that, any issues that require any type of further development as far as escalation they know contact the Regional Office Public Contact.

147

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.569

Dave Pickett: Okay.

148

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:33.070

Dave Pickett: And that's going to be there. There's kind of second point of contact after you is going to be Regional Office public contact.

149

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.190

Yeah.

150

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:52.749

Dave Pickett: Anything else that might be unique about you being a satellite office. I've mostly spoken to people working at regional benefit offices as opposed to satellite. So what's something else? That's maybe a little bit unique that I should know, so that the website kinda accurately reflects it.

151

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:14.759

P6: the personal one on one relationships that are developed. I mean, I've I've worked in, started in Cleveland, which is a large office. No personal, direct contact with veterans. went on to the Scobe. Another that's the actual.

 absolutely not as the largest regional office on this so there were no personal contacts with veterans. The Seattle office. I had some personal one to one contact with veterans, but I was only there for maybe 6 weeks. they're not to the a little opportunity which was a different role. and then once I went back into public contact on Maui I was seeing people daily on in Maui, and that kind of compared me for coming out this way, because it's very, very similar. it's a lot of one on one contact at the mail station, and mostly one on one contact. Here. It's like

155

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:00.390

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:55.299

Dave Pickett: So you mentioned you know you obviously work at the 2 different offices. Is there anything that's easier for you to do when you're at one place or the at the other? Or is it just kind of you're seeing different people because it's easier to get to

191

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:07.719

P6: The reason that i'm seeing people in 2 different offices is just as a convenience for the community. sometimes you know they're down there

192

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:13.790

P6: the the first office Monday office. That's where the medical issues occur, so they need some type of tribute, or there's some kind of follow up, you know. That's why they're there primarily, and i'm there on Mondays as a convenience, so that they're already there for vh a services. Oh, the VPN guys upstairs. I'm not going to check on my plane. I'm not going to follow the

194

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:50.530

P6: so that's why i'm there on Monday, and then Tuesday's through Friday. I'm. In the State Office, because that's their primary function, you know, facilitating services for veterans. Better and it doesn't bother me one way or the other, you know, because, like I said, it's very small, so my commute is not all either way.

200

00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:36.050

Dave Pickett: so basically. For every Vba Office location there's it a list that says these: this is what you can do there, and it's some subset of this. So just going to go one by one, and you can respond and say, Yep, that's definitely something somebody could do here or nope.

You know this button, and you can, you know, let the know how we're doing, you know. And nobody will, you know. or or unless you want to be contacted.

265

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.819

Dave Pickett: what might be helpful for

266

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:52.050

Dave Pickett: veterans who are looking at a website before coming into the location. you know anything they might need to bring

267

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.540

Dave Pickett: anything like that.

268

00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:05.500

P6: I mean. if they added, make sure that they have some type of state issue, Id and you know, maybe they're getting 2, 14,

you know any type of if they're adding dependence on to award children, you know, in birth, certificate, social security cards, same for spouse marriage certificates.

 Any divorce decrees for the fire spouses. you know any documentation required to prove relationships.

Dave Pickett: any need for them to ever bring in medical records for any of the claim things.

274

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:42.819

P6: I mean, if they haven't, we'll, we'll take them. But a lot of times medical records that we're going after our military related, or via related. So we already have access to. So they have really. They want to bring in medical records that are outside the BA. System, because then we can scan upload them to the system instead of them doing the medical release.

276

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:07.549

P6: Next things go home
