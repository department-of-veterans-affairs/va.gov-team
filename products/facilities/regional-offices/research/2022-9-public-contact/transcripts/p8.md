Dave Pickett: Um, Great uh. So just to confirm on the recording. Are you comfortable with me recording the call today.

7

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:34.069

P8: Correct. I got hired at the Va. Medical Center in two thousand and eight, and I um

P8: And What's the favorite?

20

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.160

Dave Pickett: What's your favorite part of your job

21

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.000

P8: um

22

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.399

P8: helping people solve their problems

23

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.530

Dave Pickett: Mhm

24

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:50.370

Dave Pickett: great. Um! Well, now, I'm going to dive in a little more deeper, so uh as you may know, the Va. Is currently working with seven different regional benefit offices from around that country to design a new modernized website that will later be rolled out to every regional benefit office. So your local regional office volunteered to be part of this effort. Um, as kind of that first group that'll test out the first version of this Um, and that's kind of um, you know where you come into the picture is that you know.

25

00:02:50.380 --> 00:03:04.739

Dave Pickett: Uh i'm working on design requirements of what that website would need to include. Um, So uh, you know, want to hear from you what veterans are experiencing day to day at the facility, so we can build the best website.

26

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:14.249

Dave Pickett: Oh, awesome uh Jay Just joined. So uh just want to let you know he's on. But uh, he'll just be listening it.

27

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.030

Jay Darnell: Hello, Nice to meet you.

28

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.459

P8: Nice to meet you,

29

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.730

Dave Pickett: uh,

30

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.539

Dave Pickett: just to confirm uh you work at the Regional Benefit office. Correct?

31

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.510

P8: Correct

32

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.040

Dave Pickett: um! And is that the only facility you work at, or do you ever spit, split some time at another facility?

33

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:50.709

P8: Um, I do occasionally do outreach uh either at the Va. Medical centers, or at some other organization, upon the request of uh, various people doing a benefits uh benefit events, so on and so forth, but always,

34

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:07.220

P8: and the capacity as a regional office representative got it. And how often is that a few times a year or uh it used to be a lot. But with Covid. Uh, unfortunately, we have suspended outreach hopefully. We'll be getting one hundred and fifty

35

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:14.060

P8: back to that. But I would say at least once a week. Just excuse me just a second. Hi. Can I help you?

36

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.159

P8: Sure. And your name?

37

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.430

P8: Okay. Why, Don't, you have a seat here? I'll let you here and coordinator. Now,

38

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.030

P8: Okay, Thank you.

39

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.460

P8: Back.

40

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.820

Dave Pickett: Okay,

41

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.990

Dave Pickett: Um.

42

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:59.290

Dave Pickett: So uh, you were saying you do. You have done outreach historically, But with Covid that kind of um went went down.

43

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:21.859

Dave Pickett: So um thinking about the regional benefit office, the actual place you're sitting right now. Um, is this um facility kind of a standalone building just for the regional office, or does it share space with, You know other uh types of offices?

44

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:36.169

P8: Federal Building? Um, John, for Cheryl Kennedy Building. So we share this building. We're located on the sixteenth floor currently, and we share. Uh, you know, multiple Federal offices are here.

45

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:47.599

Dave Pickett: Um! And would you say, this is um an easy place, for you know, veterans and beneficiary to get to, or there any quirks about getting here that they should know uh in advance.

46

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.230

Dave Pickett: Quarks in the building are quarks with actually commuting to the building. Both

47

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:07.590

P8: both, did you? I'm. Sorry to say both. Yeah, Well, yeah, we're we're located in uh downtown. Um and uh

48

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.580

uh

49

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:19.589

P8: traveling by car Um, isn't always the best way, so I always recommend that people take the t um once you're within the building. It's usually

50

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:33.859

P8: pretty pretty pretty easy, you know. You have to go through security, anyway, and the Fps guys are pretty good at, you know, knowing where we are, so I I wouldn't really really have. I heard from somebody saying it took them like an hour to find us.

51

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:42.360

Dave Pickett: Um! So since there's you know, a security checkpoint. Does that mean people need a any sort of identification to even get into the building?

52

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:59.709

P8: No, they don't need to. I They don't need to show that they have business in the building, but they have to go through a safety checkpoint, so they will. They will definitely go through a medical detector. They have to take off their shoes, their belts, just like going through Tsa at the airport,

53

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.609

P8: but nobody has to prove that they have business in the building. No one ids them, you know. Once they go through just like a Tsa. No one's

54

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:25.769

Dave Pickett: right, you know. Well, you already. Should you show your thing at at the beginning. But the Tsa itself no one's saying like, Let me see your boarding pass, or anything like that, right? Okay, That sounds that makes sense. Um! Any other quirks, or you know things that you you've seen with visitors, maybe having trouble finding the office in the building.

55

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:42.069

P8: I wouldn't say that, uh, unlike the hospitals where we're not really equipped for like wheelchairs, or anything like that, I know not specifically. If the person had a had business at the Ba. But I was. As I was walking to the lobby somebody stopped me asking for a wheelchair,

56

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:49.560

P8: and unfortunately, you know we don't have wheelchairs. So if you have mobility issues that might present a few problems.

57

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.790

P8: Ah,

58

00:07:50.960 --> 00:08:00.860

P8: you know, getting uh The building itself has like ramps and stuff. But once you're in the building, like if you're thinking you can like, grab a wheelchair. We don't have any of that,

59

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.769

P8: you know. And since we're a Disability office. Some people think that we might be equipped like the hospital. We're not

60

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.110

Dave Pickett: okay. That's good to know.

61

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:13.890

Dave Pickett: Um. And what are the kind of normal hours that you're open for visitors.

62

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:23.200

Ah! Our normal business hours are eight to four. I tell people eight to three, because we take, you know we don't want someone walking in at four o'clock,

63

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:42.230

Dave Pickett: closing the door, plus they have to go through security. So you know, if they show up at like four, and that's security. We're gone by the time they get here like a four, fifteen, four, thirty, we're gone. So I say eight to three, so you know people at least will get up here by three thirty, and we can serve them properly. And we're not trying to rush them up the door. Okay, good to know.

64

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:54.099

Dave Pickett: Um. So thinking about. You know what this office does, what veterans beneficiaries can accomplish here If you're we're talking to somebody who's, you know, like a new beneficiary

65

00:08:54.110 --> 00:09:03.710

Dave Pickett: uh new to the Va Doesn't, really understand the whole wide scope of what the Va. Does. How would you kind of explain the purpose of this office in particular.

66

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:20.230

P8: Um, if someone came in and said, Um, i'm interested in va benefits, I usually uh I Usually I have a va benefit booklet that I give them a benefits for sure, which is, I print off the uh the Va website,

67

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:27.090

P8: and I I name specifically most of the benefits, and the big three being health care, home loans uh mortgage and compensation, I should say big four. And then I explain what we specifically do in this office, which is, uh compensation. I tell veterans that if they're currently experiencing any type of disability or injury or condition they think was due to service, they can certainly apply to have that recognized; and if the Va. Agrees with them that their current injury was due to service, we will compensate them with free health care, and possibly a monthly check.

70

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:02.550

Dave Pickett: Mhm

71

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.829

P8: and if people are still kind of unsure, I I kind of say it's kind of like workman's comp

72

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:14.260

P8: kind of things in that way you got injured well in service. So now you're asking to get taken care of.

73

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.230

Dave Pickett: Got it?

74

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:16.680

Dave Pickett: Um!

75

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.420

Dave Pickett: So thinking about, uh, you know

76

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:32.329

Dave Pickett: broadly. People who come in. What would you say is generally the breakdown of how many people come in with an appointment versus how many people just kind of walk in um day of no appointment.

77

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:43.019

P8: Um pre covid uh there never was an appointment. We've always been walking um I would say, Pre Covid, we were

78

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:52.899

P8: twenty-five to thirty veterans a day, and I would say, post Covid, I would say, we're around ten vets a day.

79

00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:03.480

Dave Pickett: Do people make appointments now? Post Covid, or is that it's still mostly walk in, but they have rolled out this

80

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.959

P8: uh new application that veterans can make an appointment. It's called Vera,

81

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:25.200

Dave Pickett: but that's still relatively new. So um, you know I always consider us a walk in, and I tell everybody is walking. They don't need to make an appointment. I think that kind of puts people off, and we're in the business of helping people trying to make it as easy as possible. Yeah,

82

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:36.789

P8: um, Which is, which is true, people get served usually immediately. They've never waited more than yeah. Nobody's ever waited more than ten minutes. They're probably, I think people are probably shocked about how efficient

83

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:39.390

P8: this Government office has run

84

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.940

Dave Pickett: great. That's that's a good surprise, right?

85

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.679

P8: Right? Um! Are there any busier days or times of day?

86

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.770

No, you maybe like the first of a month.

87

00:11:51.890 --> 00:12:09.620

P8: Um always like the first the year, because this is the year i'm going to go get my va benefits. You know what I mean? Um. But yeah, no, I really I can't really pinpoint I can. We can be. We can be quiet all morning. And then all of a sudden five people walk in at the same time. It's right. Patches catch can.

88

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:10.630

Dave Pickett: Okay,

89

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.900

Um,

90

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:29.060

Dave Pickett: Sounds like, you know, veterans are having a pretty good experience. Right? No. Wait. Times. Are there any, you know, common frustrations or or complaints that you're hearing from that sort of just general experience of of the office not specific to. Why didn't Michael and get approved type things,

91

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:35.689

P8: I mean. Well, yeah, because you're dealing with benefits. So it's my role

92

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:39.949

P8: to help the veteran understand why they may not have gotten

93

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:44.289

P8: a benefit that they had applied for, or

94

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:50.619

P8: why they didn't get a higher rating; that they than they did that they that

95

00:12:50.940 --> 00:13:03.959

P8: why did they not get a higher rating than they did? And um, if they're still just, if I, if they may understand and may still be dissatisfied. I make sure I explain the options for them to appeal.

96

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.980

P8: So uh,

97

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.159

P8: I don't know I've always had good experiences with the veterans.

98

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.799

P8: I I I find that if you,

99

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:21.439

P8: you know, treat people well, and you know, allow them to express their frustration and give them options. Most people live happy leave happy,

100

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:31.720

Dave Pickett: Great! So if they have frustrations right, you're hearing that, and then kind of explaining um their options. And so, if anything, they're you know

101

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.839

Dave Pickett: they're feeling pretty satisfied,

102

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:50.349

P8: you know. They may not like what i'm hearing, but at least they understand what i'm hearing. And usually when you give someone options, Well, listen. This isn't the this isn't the end of the road. This is this is what you can do,

103

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.430

you know Uh,

104

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:56.520

P8: this is your next option of what you can do.

105

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:04.240

P8: I mean, I I find you know what makes life satisfactory is options or options. You have the happier you are.

106

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:22.980

Dave Pickett: So. Um! When you think about again. Um! People coming in. Um! What are all the different uh things that people come in for? Um? Obviously compensation is is a big one. But what are? What are some other things that people get done at the office?

107

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:38.410

P8: Um, everything they come in for everything. Unfortunately, we can't do everything. So uh, you know every va benefit you can think of. They come here for, because they've been directed here, either by a website by the Va website, which isn't always

 uh which isn't always correct. Unfortunately, um, or directed by other Va. Personnel, mainly at the hospitals, you know, Vha. Where Vba and anything that has to do with benefits they just sent here, you know, and not realizing that we have.

 We have very limited powers here within the regional office, you know, if you want. If you want to be a homeown, I can give you information. I can't, you know I I can't. We don't even process them here.

110

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:16.409

P8: Um! People send people get the biggest complaint right now is that they keep sending people here for a state benefit that we don't even do. Here.

111

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:23.440

P8: The regional office. Yeah. So you know, there's a lot of disinformation

112

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:37.939

Dave Pickett: out there in the ether. And unfortunately it's hard to correct it.

113

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:50.300

Dave Pickett: That's what we do here.

114

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:56.200

P8: That's specifically what we do here.

115

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:14.090

P8: You don't have like, necessarily like Vr and E staff onsite who could help? Well, we have. Yes, we are, and is on site. That's That's the only other thing. Okay. And then there is another education guy that does the gi. But once again there, even though they are on site. They're separate from us.

116

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:20.719

Dave Pickett: Okay. But the most I can do is give them telephone numbers and maybe send an email. But if someone's

117

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:27.209

P8: you know, wants to specifically get into the nitty-gritty of education, and I can't get a hold of

118

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:33.470

P8: the guy who works in education, and I have to, and I can just give him the telephone number. Well, I was told that you guys would do that.

119

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:41.700

P8: No, it's not always easy, being the front desk, and you know, and trying to be as helpful as we can. But yeah, we

120

00:16:41.760 --> 00:17:00.479

P8: Yes, education is handled um at uh at the regional office. But you know. I don't know why We're the only office that's opened

121

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:10.070

Dave Pickett: and speak to somebody in the way that they can speak to you about various things.

122

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.870

P8: They don't report to us.

123

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:25.639

Dave Pickett: Yeah. So the So the V are any like. Do if people wanted to have a meeting with a Vrn person that doesn't go through you and your team at all. You're saying, or

124

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:33.290

P8: yeah, because we're the only we, the Public Contact Office. So they come here for everything,

125

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.250

P8: including the state benefits.

126

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:45.119

Dave Pickett: Um. So if do you know much about how Vr. Any operates, or is it really a whole other thing that you know you have no insight into.

127

00:17:45.190 --> 00:18:02.939

P8: Yeah, I mean, I can. If someone wants to apply for Vr. Any, I can give them the forms. Um, you know, if they have a Vr. And like, say, they got a uh, you know a letter, but I but, to be honest, I wouldn't get into it just like I wouldn't want somebody at the hospital trying to give out compensation information,

128

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:17.739

P8: but like it's not even that. You have access to their appointment schedule and can see and can say, Oh, yeah, exactly, exactly. And it's not my place. It really is, and it's not my place. I don't work in that office. I've had

129

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:25.039

so many people come in and say, well, so and so said that you, Baba, and that you should, and i'm like, who is that? They don't work here?

130

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:31.709

P8: Um: so. Yeah. So I i'm very careful not to tread on other departments toast because i'm not.

131

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.949

P8: I don't have the authority.

132

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:43.899

Dave Pickett: Um, no, that's that's really helpful. I think you know that's one thing we want to make sure being clear about is what veterans can expect to do

133

00:18:43.910 --> 00:19:02.040

P8: when they're you know, visiting the facility versus who works at the facility, because those are two very different questions. Right? So so Vr and E uh is here. They do share the same uh the same um floor, and I would if the veterans showed here I would direct them to their office.

134

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.940

P8: Okay, so I would say Vr and e is probably one of the few offices that

135

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:18.080

Dave Pickett: is, I I know that I can always get someone a hold of there. Okay, great. So and so in many ways, you know. That is a a separate office that just happens to be,

136

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:34.579

P8: you know, and everyone comes into our office like, for instance, we're having um construction done on our floor. So every on the on the Va floors. So everybody's coming up on the sixteenth floor.

137

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:45.740

P8: So if they are looking for the Vsos on the on the fifteenth floor, which we have absolutely nothing to do with, and they can't get a hold of their Vso. They take it out on us.

138

00:19:45.890 --> 00:20:01.460

Dave Pickett: Got it. So if if I was um, you know my, I literally will be working on designing the website right? We might say that for the Regional Benefit Office. Uh, it might actually p three

139

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:21.209

Dave Pickett: some offices that each have their own specific location, right? The Public Contact Office, the Vr. Any office and the Dso. Offices. Um, and you know, having the floor, numbers and room, numbers of of those separately, and the services separated across would make it much more clear for veterans

140

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.140

P8: correct

141

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:29.080

P8: on this. Yeah. So like, for instance, people show up for Hr. Stuff,

you know, like they come to get their piv card, because eight, because uh va ah Hr. Is on our floor. So we have people from the hospital coming over to get their piv cards and

144

00:20:41.090 --> 00:21:00.800

P8: no, and for the most part that works out. But I had this guy getting on my face the other day, because the Hr guy wasn't here like. Well, i'm sorry. Do you have an appointment with him? No? Well, he's not a walk in service. Maybe i'll go the bathroom. I don't know where he is yeah, I mean, he really got really aggressive. And finally I said like dude, I added, like,

145

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:13.069

P8: No, i'm, you know, terribly sorry. Yes, sir, no. And I was like dude. I don't know. I don't know where he is. He doesn't report to me, you know that would be like me coming to your office, saying, like, Hey, where's the Hr Guy? I don't know.

146

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.749

P8: So yeah, So So public contact really is the the fall guy because we're the only ones that have our door opened and everyone gets sent here, no matter what it's for. And so a lot of the frustrations, or you know confusions that veterans are experiencing.

150

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:51.560

Dave Pickett: And in talking about in your waiting room, Aren't even necessarily related to the things that you can actually control right in many ways, right? And they're not waiting because they'll come in, and they'll you know they'll say, Hi! And you know i'd like, and i'll say, do you need veteran services? And they'll say yes, and i'll say, Well, what do you need? And

151

00:21:51.570 --> 00:22:04.430

P8: they say the R. And I would. You know on when we don't have construction? Okay, that's next door. And you know I'm here from my piv card. Okay, that's down the hall. So we're we're sort of reception. Yeah, of a contact is reception,

152

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:05.590

P8: for

153

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.520

P8: you know whether we like it or not. It's just

154

00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.430

P8: you know It's just a necessary evil,

155

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.870

you know.

156

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.930

Dave Pickett: Yeah,

157

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:15.990

Dave Pickett: um.

158

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:31.489

Dave Pickett: So um thinking about um compensation, right? The thing you actually do here? Um! If you were to break down, what are some of the the different tasks veterans are Are you accomplishing around compensation here.

159

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:42.959

P8: Um! Well, they uh, if they've never filed before, they're going to be filling out forms. And uh we'll assist them if they need it. Um If they're checking on their status of their claim, we can give them that. Um. And if they're coming in because they've gotten a letter, they've gotten their decision, and they're not exactly sure what it means, or they're unhappy about it. Then we'll talk to them about that. That's

161

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:07.239

P8: that's the life of a claim right, initiate processing and then final decision. So we help people all along the way if they have any questions.

162

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:21.940

Dave Pickett: And uh, are there, you know, common pain points of like is the how complicated is that initial form, or, you know, is that in the wide scheme of Va. Forms a relatively easy one.

163

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:29.439

P8: I think the form's relatively easy. I've seen other forms where I've helped veterans because we'll help, you know, if someone comes in and

164

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:45.639

P8: they have like a home loan or an education form, and they're having difficulty. I'm not going to turn them away. I like Well, let me take a look at, and i'm like. Oh, God, I don't know what this is. You know Um, you know, in the bigger scheme of things I think the the va form five hundred and twenty-six is pretty self-explanatory.

165

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.940

Dave Pickett: Um, And is that something that is that veterans could do online I assume.

166

00:23:53.430 --> 00:24:01.020

P8: Yes, yes, and a lot of we get. We get a lot of the older veterans. The young younger veterans who are computer savvy are pretty,

167

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.760

P8: you know. There, there they can do online. As a matter of fact, that's my biggest frustration is that the Va website at people having problems with their Va. Gov. Accounts. They are sending them to the regional office to get them fixed. We do not do that

169

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:22.650

Dave Pickett: right. You can't actually have That's more of an it department thing, probably

170

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:35.510

P8: right. And then, and there's nothing there that helps them. And then you know, the National Call Center is telling them to come to the regional office. The website is telling them to come to the regional office, the people at the hospital telling them to come to the regional office.

171

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:49.009

P8: It's like the Wizard of Oz. Sorry this is something you help for for hope or not. The Wizard of Oz. We, you know we can't make, and that and people will say that we heard you. You know you guys, the only ones can do this. I'm like Well, not really. We don't do that

172

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:53.570

Dave Pickett: right? It's it's so. It seems like not only um,

173

00:24:54.080 --> 00:25:10.350

Dave Pickett: you know. Is it two bedrooms not necessarily know the full extent or limitations of what you can do? But other parts of the Va Don't even seem to really understand what actually happens at a regional benefit office,

174

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.980

P8: you know.

175

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:30.540

Dave Pickett: Well, um, I I I will do my best to try and correct at least that small piece of that problem. Um, And that's why we're having these conversations, so we can track down any places where there's something clearly wrong that's not helping veterans um, and make that correct, so veterans are better informed.

176

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.070

P8: Um,

177

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:49.329

Dave Pickett: any um. So you mentioned a little bit uh. So we talked about just talked about compensation. There's an applying step. Uh, there's maybe a checking the status. And then there's maybe, after I get a decision letter, any other kind of compensation related

178

00:25:49.340 --> 00:26:08.810

P8: tasks that veterans might, you know, be accomplishing at the office. They'll come in for ancillary benefits. So you're already uh you're already a service connected veterans. So if you're at a certain percentage, certain percentage, there are ancillary benefits like, for instance, you can add on dependence. Um, You can apply uh

179

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.420

for uh,

180

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:18.200

P8: your car to be. Have specific modifications to accommodate your disability or house.

181

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.769

P8: There are a lot of once you get service connected that opens you up to a whole

182

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:24.980

P8: other

183

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.660

P8: well arc of ancillary benefits,

184

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:36.820

Dave Pickett: and so like for okay. Now, what are the other benefits i'm eligible for? And how do I apply for them? That kind of thing.

185

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.460

Dave Pickett: And um

186

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:54.740

Dave Pickett: thinking across, you know that's a a wide swath of tasks. But you know, for a smaller percentage of the population. Um! Are are those things things that can also be done online? Or is there anything that actually physically requires somebody to come into the office?

187

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.410

No, no, there really isn't. Everything can almost be done online. So in many ways they may not want to, 

because um, I mean, if you've ever worked with a government agency, you know. Sometimes you don't know how to do things or the the the the website is wrong, or the the that i'm talking about regarding their Va. Gov accounts. He couldn't upload something,

um, or he was trying to get his Cd. Two hundred and fourteen, and he was looking for technical help. I I definitely, even if we had access to that i'm not an it person.

 So I wouldn't be able to help with that. And That's what I asked him, I said, and usually I work around it. Well, what are you specifically looking for? I'm looking for my Dd. Two hundred and fourteen. I can get that to you. Can I mail it to you

right? Do you know what I mean? I can you that that like? I said. I'm not problem. So of a lady like, Okay, I can't help you with that. But what are you specifically looking for? I want to upload my claim. Okay, Why, don't you just fax it,

 you know. Let's see if we can do a work around, because I can't help you with your account. Sorry.

194

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.360

P8: So so you know, always being that's my job to i'm a fixer to my ability. So if the Ba. Has a breakdown,

197

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:33.340

Dave Pickett: you know, because we're a large sometimes bureaucratic machine. My job is to find a workaround.

198

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:46.319

Dave Pickett: Understand? The forms, fill them out online. Do self service. Um, if that doesn't happen, you can't ask questions to a form, but you. They can ask questions to you, and you can actually redirect them in a helpful way.

199

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:52.429

P8: Correct life is not a kiosk, especially if you're sick and you're old

200

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.040

Dave Pickett: Absolutely um.

201

00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:12.460

Dave Pickett: So thinking about, you know, things come in for uh people come in for. Is there anything else that stands out that, you know. Uh Oh, if the information was better on the website, you know I'd be getting less of this. Obviously, we've talked about quite a few, but anything else that comes to mind. Um as we're

202

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:18.149

P8: we're here. No, though those are the only things that have really, you know, like people people being told that they that you know they can get every type of benefit done here at the regional office, and you know we simply can it. 

There's just too many veterans. It's too large of a job. So that's why Buffalo does education, and you know Philadelphia does pension. And um I forget who does the home loans? Um, I think it's Atlanta um depending on the region you live in. 

So Yeah. But i'm. But people think that. But for the most part people are pretty chill. I don't know if you're yeah,

206

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.850

P8: that that that's for you guys to figure out how to

207

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.290

P8: convey that on a website.

208

00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:17.170

Dave Pickett: Um. So for this next part i'm gonna read off uh a list of services. So this is the list that's officially currently hard coded into. Va Gov: um. So there's a list of sixteen uh benefit services, and they are, uh, you know, shown as available or not available at different

209

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:33.920

Dave Pickett: benefit offices. Um. So i'm just gonna kind of read through. And you know you can just kind of respond like, Yep, that's what we do. No, we definitely don't help with that Um, or I've never heard of that sound. Good. Yeah. Uh, first one applying for benefits.

210

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:35.240

Dave Pickett: Um. Next one education claim help.

223

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:18.420

P8: I mean, I can. We will like help them fill out the claim. But we that's it, that's all. We'll do so I I

224

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:33.749

P8: you couldn't give them a status update, even right. You don't have access to that.

225

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.520

P8: Okay, All right, Charlie.

P8: depending on the claim.

228

00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:00.409

P8: The screens to look at it. But once again we don't process them there like, so say say there was an error

229

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:14.970

P8: on uh well, if it's an error, they have to follow a certain form, so we tell them, what do that? But if they're looking to specific, and from we can't do that, I can look in the We have access to the to their uh electronic file, but we don't process them.

230

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.530

P8: Okay, that's out in Philadelphia.

231

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:38.429

Dave Pickett: And so family. I'm thinking like survivor benefits, so survivor benefits. Um! If they have a question that you're ultimately going to redirect them to call Philadelphia, or you are able to give them some information. Sometimes it depends. Yeah, I can give them some information, and I have contacts in Philadelphia.

232

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:55.549

P8: Like me, I have personal contacts that I I can help. But that's not really not. Everyone has access to that, right? You You have this because i'm a fixer, and I've been here a long time. So yeah, that's sort of the key of we can at the Va. Is the contacts you develop when you work here a long time.

233

00:32:55.810 --> 00:33:08.479

Dave Pickett: Um! What are some of the other family member claims that exist That, uh would be totally outside of the realm of possibility for you and give insight into it.

234

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:17.980

P8: So kids. So So, for instance, I had a family because as a one hundred percent service connected veteran, they their kids, get education benefits.

235

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:24.970

P8: So I had a family member, a a mom who I definitely empathized with, because I'm going through college applications.

236

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:30.479

P8: And so I helped her fill that out. But I didn't know what it you know. It's not like. I had any insight,

237

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:42.300

P8: you know, and that was one of the funds I was like, What do I? What does that mean? I don't know i'm like leave it blank, because if they read because some of those, some of these forms are so

238

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:55.890

P8: superfluous, you know, like we don't really need to know that, like I have to have the claims that I do. I'm like you, don't have to worry about that. So yeah, that's doesn't apply to you. So I said, Leave A. I just tell them to leave a blank, and if they really need it they will contact you

239

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:10.330

Dave Pickett: right, but better to leave it blank and get asked for that information. Then fill it in when it's not necessary, and yeah or not, fill in the right information, or maybe opening up questions. You know what I mean, like. Yeah, that makes sense.

240

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.479

Dave Pickett: Um.

241

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:15.199

Dave Pickett: Next one help for homeless veterans

242

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.290

Mhm

243

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:30.409

P8: definitely, because we'll we'll help the veteran follow claim, and then we'll hook them up uh get them hooked up with uh with, like the hospital and stuff like that, or with the homeless shelter.

244

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:42.400

Dave Pickett: Although we may not specifically would do that. We we would never want a homeless veteran not to come here there any vulnerable population. We will come. We want them to come here,

245

00:34:42.409 --> 00:35:01.520

P8: but just you know, like, Hey, I want to check on my Va home loan. You know I need a certificate of eligibility like you know what I mean. That's that's somebody who can take care of themselves, a homeless veteran. We want him to come here, even if we it's not something we specifically do in this office, right? But you have the the connections and can make sure that you

I would give them the form and I would give them. I have a list of telephone numbers. Here's a telephone number. You need to fill out this, and you know, and give out general information on them. Or what does this mean? I'm. You know. Either I can answer that or I. You know you're gonna need to direct that question to

256

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:30.160

P8: I I know about insurance once again that was something I would print off the website and say, This is what you need to do. I've never heard of financial counseling. If If someone needed that, I would direct them to their social worker.

257

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:36.929

P8: But if you have someone just a general veteran, and who is looking for financial information,
