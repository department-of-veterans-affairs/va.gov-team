00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.374

Thank you so much. Um. So just to get started. Uh, could you tell me what is your role at the

VA? I'm a legal administrative specialist. I work in public contact. We.

Um. Deal with congressional inquiries from the Senators and congressman's office offices. We also deal with White House inquiries that are sent and sent to the director's office. Um, we'll deal with ask VA questions from veterans. We

b45d9af1-2232-4d8b-b43a-95af23d4177c-4

00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:59.845

also do interviews, and then we

deal with veteran's day to day

b45d9af1-2232-4d8b-b43a-95af23d4177c-5

00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:01.450

outside in the office.

a66409f1-c903-4191-b879-882a22fb78b9-0

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.331

You know that are that are

coming in as walk-ins or as

a66409f1-c903-4191-b879-882a22fb78b9-1

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:08.850

appointments. We do virtual

calls and in person phone calls.

5942fc4f-84c1-4090-8c60-587d66d63960-0

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.093

Got it. And how long have you

been in this uh, position? Uh

5942fc4f-84c1-4090-8c60-587d66d63960-1

00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:15.590

since December of 2014.

37f94687-6f85-4e4f-ba91-e95127864da0-0

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.984

OK, so quite a while. Yeah. And

then what's? Uh, what's your

37f94687-6f85-4e4f-ba91-e95127864da0-1

00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:21.500

favorite part of your job?

7fc76427-dd48-4ece-8c27-61b6f241c93a-0

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.420

Help him, that's.

44d481e5-09ca-4aea-9256-7d097be542ed-0

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.091

Yeah. So as I said, you know,

we're working with seven

44d481e5-09ca-4aea-9256-7d097be542ed-1

00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:32.687

different regional offices

trying to get a sense of the

44d481e5-09ca-4aea-9256-7d097be542ed-2

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:36.347

day-to-day reality. So let's

first set of questions. I'm

44d481e5-09ca-4aea-9256-7d097be542ed-3

00:01:36.347 --> 00:01:40.328

going to ask is about the, you

know, the physical office that

44d481e5-09ca-4aea-9256-7d097be542ed-4

00:01:40.328 --> 00:01:44.502

you work at. So just to confirm

you work at the Regional

Benefits Office, correct? Yes.

And is that the only location

44d481e5-09ca-4aea-9256-7d097be542ed-6

00:01:48.418 --> 00:01:52.528

you work at or do you ever split

your time at another facility?

44d481e5-09ca-4aea-9256-7d097be542ed-7

00:01:52.528 --> 00:01:54.839

No, I used to go out on

outreaches.

8d0a3c03-1472-47f4-a6a9-ba30b19a9599-0

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.569

And stuff like that to help.

That's going out to like Port

8d0a3c03-1472-47f4-a6a9-ba30b19a9599-1

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.477

Arthur, you know, to the rural

regions to go out and help vets

8d0a3c03-1472-47f4-a6a9-ba30b19a9599-2

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:02.850

there.

274cf48c-90c8-4d4e-8508-6a9f7e26a700-0

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.210

But that's not that's not part

of it.

76072e8d-bab0-4494-bb75-ee96216880c2-0

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.750

Yeah, got it. Um, so thinking

about this building. Uh, that

76072e8d-bab0-4494-bb75-ee96216880c2-1

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.657

you're in, is that a standalone

building just for the regional

76072e8d-bab0-4494-bb75-ee96216880c2-2

00:02:15.657 --> 00:02:18.943

office or is it a shared

building? 

It's a standalone building on campus where the

 VA Medical Center 
 
 got it. And is it easy to find, easy

to get to or any quirks that

76072e8d-bab0-4494-bb75-ee96216880c2-5

00:02:26.447 --> 00:02:30.230

might make it difficult for vet

to find their way there? No.

d723ece1-8f89-4385-b9a0-e02538d4b0c3-0

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.760

OK, pretty easy.

9a01085a-ded1-4faa-9451-b013ce1b1306-0

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.945

Um, and then you know what, what

are kind of your normal

9a01085a-ded1-4faa-9451-b013ce1b1306-1

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:38.430

operating days and hours?

65f95277-6643-4628-97f1-411ed9750ad2-0

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.570

We worked 7:30 to 4:00.

bac2fb43-c0d9-4450-a348-7c93c53bd0c7-0

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.050

OK.

a1de7739-6eb2-409b-ba2c-b6a41a4606c9-0

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.102

And um, if you were talking to,

you know, beneficiary who's

a1de7739-6eb2-409b-ba2c-b6a41a4606c9-1

00:02:48.102 --> 00:02:51.617

maybe new to the VA, you know,

just starting to get familiar.

a1de7739-6eb2-409b-ba2c-b6a41a4606c9-2

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:55.019

How would you describe this

office and what they're able to

a1de7739-6eb2-409b-ba2c-b6a41a4606c9-3

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:55.529

do there?

4020d3c3-5ad4-4ded-bdfd-a8eb014835f4-0

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.095

Ohh it's awesome. I mean trying

that you know when they come in.

4020d3c3-5ad4-4ded-bdfd-a8eb014835f4-1

00:03:00.095 --> 00:03:03.261

I mean, we know what we're doing

and what we're talking about,

you know, to helping them get

the benefits if they can get

4020d3c3-5ad4-4ded-bdfd-a8eb014835f4-3

00:03:06.225 --> 00:03:07.080

that, it's great.

56a8601c-c63b-4ebc-803e-0903bc3e4902-0

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.570

Got it.

75db41e5-2c09-4764-88a8-df3d7ca372ab-0

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.750

Um.

c37fa2a9-bcfc-4f55-bd58-8f07f3fdcb0d-0

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.817

And then, uh, thinking about,

you know, the bulk of people

c37fa2a9-bcfc-4f55-bd58-8f07f3fdcb0d-1

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:19.166

coming in, how many are coming

in with uh, an appointment

c37fa2a9-bcfc-4f55-bd58-8f07f3fdcb0d-2

00:03:19.166 --> 00:03:21.650

versus just kind of walking in

the day of?

6c21866a-5972-419d-b30e-844df69c2fae-0

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.293

It's more walk-ins, you know,

with that, they've got the new

Viera website. I don't know if

you want me to expand or if

that's a question later on.

8541885d-aee2-430e-b68d-bca91b19e448-0

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.030

Uh.

50a94fe3-72f0-4aad-b286-017a83f9270a-0

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.883

Yeah. What? What would you want?

What would you want to say about

50a94fe3-72f0-4aad-b286-017a83f9270a-1

00:03:38.883 --> 00:03:39.820

Vera? Well, I mean.

21c18f37-931b-46cd-8e13-b90b6e4ffeee-0

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.310

Veer is kind of a it's a great

program for a vet to access.

You know, an appointment to

schedule, but I think there's a lot of confusion with it within with the veterans as far as they'll schedule an appointment to come talk to us about an appeal or something, you know, or something there where we can't represent them or tell them which lanes to use. It's got to be with their veteran service officer and that's who they think they're scheduling it

with. It's been brought up to maybe put, you know, links to the service organizations towhere.

When they're going on and they're signing up for their appointment, if you want to meet with your veteran service officer, this is what you need

to do.

0fbf4763-7a03-486d-b044-75f76e81d9ec-0

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.109

Got it. So there's a point.

There's just confusion when they

0fbf4763-7a03-486d-b044-75f76e81d9ec-1

00:04:28.109 --> 00:04:31.849

think they're meeting with them

and they come and they meet with

0fbf4763-7a03-486d-b044-75f76e81d9ec-2

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.531

us. And that is are the service

officers Co located in the same

0fbf4763-7a03-486d-b044-75f76e81d9ec-3

00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:39.098

building with you all correct.

Correct. So that might be like

0fbf4763-7a03-486d-b044-75f76e81d9ec-4

00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:42.493

if you if they weren't there,

that might be not a point of

0fbf4763-7a03-486d-b044-75f76e81d9ec-5

00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:45.370

confusion. But since you're in

the same building.

2aa8be2e-b738-4dc4-9408-a7509e0bed15-0

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.241

Correct. It's all the same to

them and they they work off

2aa8be2e-b738-4dc4-9408-a7509e0bed15-1

00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:52.685

appointments as well. So if they

schedule one with us and then

2aa8be2e-b738-4dc4-9408-a7509e0bed15-2

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:55.965

they drive an hour and a half to

see it, but they're really

wanting to see them, they might

not be able to get in to see

them this the same day. Yeah.

OK. So that's that's good to

2aa8be2e-b738-4dc4-9408-a7509e0bed15-5

00:05:02.526 --> 00:05:02.800

know.

da57ac38-f593-4323-a03a-c81a944b5d19-0

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.872

And then, uh, Speaking of

driving, um, what percentage of

da57ac38-f593-4323-a03a-c81a944b5d19-1

00:05:09.872 --> 00:05:14.238

people would you say are driving

or taking another method to

da57ac38-f593-4323-a03a-c81a944b5d19-2

00:05:14.238 --> 00:05:14.740

arrive?

391dcdb3-f16e-4d4c-af09-d293b32e6fef-0

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.830

Ah.

380afe86-f6d5-4f80-92b3-f6c04b63ffe5-0

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.759

All of them. I mean pretty much

around here because, you know,

380afe86-f6d5-4f80-92b3-f6c04b63ffe5-1

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.114

they're either coming by bus or

they're walking homeless, you

380afe86-f6d5-4f80-92b3-f6c04b63ffe5-2

00:05:25.114 --> 00:05:25.980

know, with that.

cd5f6e0d-e5da-488a-82c8-8b1eeb99891c-0

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.830

Um.

9adb149f-6e8f-4841-be7d-c10b258eb6da-0

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.522

In terms of, you know, with

there being a lot of walk-ins,

9adb149f-6e8f-4841-be7d-c10b258eb6da-1

00:05:34.522 --> 00:05:37.984

what's what's the typical wait

time somebody might experience?

9adb149f-6e8f-4841-be7d-c10b258eb6da-2

00:05:37.984 --> 00:05:41.336

You know, they're just showing

up without an appointment. So

a long time, you know, with the

veterans. So I'm the one that

sees them. I know you spoke with

9adb149f-6e8f-4841-be7d-c10b258eb6da-5

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:48.590

Lisa.

7e9f91f9-8167-4cb8-812a-08bbe72b743c-0

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.547

You know, we've got it where we

can burn through it, but it all

7e9f91f9-8167-4cb8-812a-08bbe72b743c-1

00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:56.681

depends. I mean, we could get an

influx of people you see at

least by noontime, we'll have a

line of people, you know, that

are waiting that can wait

anywhere up to 30 minutes.

You know, but we try to keep it

within the 20 minute time frame,

but sometimes just with, uh,

lack of personnel.

We it just it's gonna exceed

that. Um, we've lost people

dca55a69-5ab1-48b9-85fb-0c0ec441003a-1

00:06:15.296 --> 00:06:19.638

lately, so we don't have

somebody at a desk that can move

dca55a69-5ab1-48b9-85fb-0c0ec441003a-2

00:06:19.638 --> 00:06:21.660

some of the people over to.

cdb26df9-dff2-405b-9786-c72baeb82793-0

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.255

Maybe that would push people

towards their VSO. They'll wait

cdb26df9-dff2-405b-9786-c72baeb82793-1

00:06:27.255 --> 00:06:30.180

in line when that's what they

really wanted.

b1db54dd-4fb3-421f-91a4-b002995b2d6c-0

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.240

Right.

814a7bff-e5ff-4735-919d-bcdfa983b3ea-0

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.220

Um.

6d6260dd-157c-41e7-b88a-0afc806d58c9-0

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.263

And in terms of, you know, wait

times obviously could be

6d6260dd-157c-41e7-b88a-0afc806d58c9-1

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:40.232

frustrating to veterans. Any

other kind of common

6d6260dd-157c-41e7-b88a-0afc806d58c9-2

00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:43.556

frustrations you're hearing from

like just that general

6d6260dd-157c-41e7-b88a-0afc806d58c9-3

00:06:43.556 --> 00:06:47.415

experience of getting in. I got

my list right, right here. We'll

6d6260dd-157c-41e7-b88a-0afc806d58c9-4

00:06:47.415 --> 00:06:50.739

have a look because we're Co

located with the hospital.

You know, with that it it's it's convenient for the vet which is great, but there's a double

edged sword on that like we'll have veterans that will have HR issues over there or something, even ones that work there that are vets themselves and they'll

send them over here to this office, which we're in a

different, different administration, you know, so we

can't do anything there.

Scheduling medical care will

8dbe906a-4530-499c-bf3d-a0b4ec0ffb53-7

00:07:17.383 --> 00:07:21.422

have them get sent over here to

schedule medical care, which we

8dbe906a-4530-499c-bf3d-a0b4ec0ffb53-8

00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:21.990

don't do.

42b45865-5cd1-406c-a617-1c4427d40bc5-0

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.426

Um will have to be sent over

here with medical billing issues

42b45865-5cd1-406c-a617-1c4427d40bc5-1

00:07:26.426 --> 00:07:30.899

and the only thing that we would

see on that is when a veteran's

42b45865-5cd1-406c-a617-1c4427d40bc5-2

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:32.000

not 50% or more.

7a711d67-fd57-42f7-a92d-2f06e503253b-0

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.713

They're a lot. They can take money from their disability compensation for copays. So we have access to a link right now that's going away. It's the finance application which would let them know, hey, you have a debt, the hospital, you know, took it.

380d3c1d-c465-47e2-bfd8-3483f12589d6-0

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.950

You know that money?

c03708dd-6072-4153-837a-bb650d2cce8a-0

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:58.151

I think you're currently able to

see that information, but that

c03708dd-6072-4153-837a-bb650d2cce8a-1

00:07:58.151 --> 00:08:02.177

you won't be able to. Yeah,

yeah, that come in here to to

c03708dd-6072-4153-837a-bb650d2cce8a-2

00:08:02.177 --> 00:08:06.618

get VA medical ID cards, which

would be handled through the the

c03708dd-6072-4153-837a-bb650d2cce8a-3

00:08:06.618 --> 00:08:07.659

Medical Center.

74f3d3c4-ad7f-4e37-a05e-57580e2a5f61-0

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.402

Scheduling home health care and

then when they when they've lost

74f3d3c4-ad7f-4e37-a05e-57580e2a5f61-1

00:08:13.402 --> 00:08:17.089

medical equipment, you know

being sent over here for that

74f3d3c4-ad7f-4e37-a05e-57580e2a5f61-2

00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:19.759

which would be handled on the

other side.

4302b68a-ae08-4664-9530-3aa1a8ca2b73-0

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:21.560

Um.

6ed0e755-b3e6-4760-85db-7d604ae23144-0

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.190

I get.

5a86504a-bab0-4be4-9e39-5511c8e1ff95-0

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.956

Somehow there's there's a

missing link. They've got a

5a86504a-bab0-4be4-9e39-5511c8e1ff95-1

00:08:27.956 --> 00:08:31.175

front desk over there at the

hospital with people. I think

5a86504a-bab0-4be4-9e39-5511c8e1ff95-2

00:08:31.175 --> 00:08:34.557

that can't do their job because

they got hurt or whatever and

5a86504a-bab0-4be4-9e39-5511c8e1ff95-3

00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:37.885

they're down there and they just

don't know and they go over

5a86504a-bab0-4be4-9e39-5511c8e1ff95-4

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:40.449

there and then they they send a

vet over here.

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-0

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:43.965

And the vets get mad and

frustrated with us and we're

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-1

00:08:43.965 --> 00:08:47.329

like, we're just trying to help

you. We're not, you know, trying

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-2

00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:50.642

to do anything more. We just got

to get you to the right place.

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-3

00:08:50.642 --> 00:08:53.851

There's things we can do and

things we can't do. If we can do

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-4

00:08:53.851 --> 00:08:57.164

it, we're going to help you out,

you know. But when it's out of

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-5

00:08:57.164 --> 00:09:00.425

our control and it's under the

different jurisdiction with the

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-6

00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:03.738

Health Administration, you have

to go there. And I'm sorry that

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-7

00:09:03.738 --> 00:09:06.740

you got bad information, you

know, to take that trip over

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-8

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.001

here. I mean, it's not like it's

across a big parking lot. So.

38961c42-0382-40d5-a5df-59f850ca5d22-9

00:09:10.001 --> 00:09:12.020

And some of these vets, you

know, are.

5e8da1ed-0704-452b-a41e-0aac24676d55-0

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.602

Challenged with getting around,

which is sad when we do that,

5e8da1ed-0704-452b-a41e-0aac24676d55-1

00:09:15.602 --> 00:09:18.944

you know? Yeah. I mean, I

personally walked in 87 year old

5e8da1ed-0704-452b-a41e-0aac24676d55-2

00:09:18.944 --> 00:09:22.286

vet over to the hospital that

was having an issue and they

5e8da1ed-0704-452b-a41e-0aac24676d55-3

00:09:22.286 --> 00:09:25.628

were telling him to go all

different places. And I'm like,

5e8da1ed-0704-452b-a41e-0aac24676d55-4

00:09:25.628 --> 00:09:29.027

no, we're gonna go handle this.

Let's get on. We'll go over

5e8da1ed-0704-452b-a41e-0aac24676d55-5

00:09:29.027 --> 00:09:32.029

there and we'll get done. What

you need to get done.

e4d7d19b-9548-44e8-904e-55bfa8db5ec7-0

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.080

Yeah, um, some other chat. So

that's just the healthcare side.

e4d7d19b-9548-44e8-904e-55bfa8db5ec7-1

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.801

Yeah. With what with with what

they have then? Um, we're sound

e4d7d19b-9548-44e8-904e-55bfa8db5ec7-2

00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:47.597

like sometimes it's almost like we're a mental health counselor or social worker, you know, with vets coming in, things that can't be done by us, you know,

like, they're legal advice. 

Wanting Social Security benefits and our award letters from here

from Social Security that they can't get, that's a that's a

common one. The legal advice is

all the time.

Wanting to come over here to deal with their retired pay issues from the military like

I'm retired, I'm retired CoastGuard, but I can't do anything

here with my Coast Guard stuff.

I got to deal with the Coast

Guard on that.

42b7605d-9fc7-4707-afba-ff55d4922601-0

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:28.061

And then access to like the VRE

counselors VOCREHAB and the

supervisors, there's a lot of

frustration there amongst the

veterans.

1ec24fb0-286c-4827-93d8-86ea1550ddf6-0

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.431

And then I got two more things

on a list, you know, where

1ec24fb0-286c-4827-93d8-86ea1550ddf6-1

00:10:39.431 --> 00:10:43.577

veterans are coming, where they

get upset about a lot. 

So we have a system called VBMS and they have what they call a national work queue.

The national work queue pushes Claims based off suspense states they get assigned to someone to work. It would go into their queue but. We're not seeing the suspense states hit. You know, they come in and they're like, because they can look on a system called va.gov.

Hmm, well, obviously you're

doing stuff for that, but.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.166

They're saying my stuff's been ready for decision for 2-3 months, four months, fivemonths, whatever, and it's not reaching to the next level, you know, to get done. So they they really get upset about that with us and like there's nothing we can do. It's in a cloud and the cloud, you know, for it to get pushed out. I don't know what the parameters are set for, which ones get pushed. That's way above my level, you know, on that for the assignments of it.

d011c713-3bf3-41b2-8605-2fc9bcb84bb7-0

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:45.885

Um and right, but for the vet

coming in, you're the you're the

d011c713-3bf3-41b2-8605-2fc9bcb84bb7-1

00:11:45.885 --> 00:11:49.544

face of the VA. So you're the

one getting correct hearing

d011c713-3bf3-41b2-8605-2fc9bcb84bb7-2

00:11:49.544 --> 00:11:53.646

that. Yeah. And they they really

get upset about that. I do what

d011c713-3bf3-41b2-8605-2fc9bcb84bb7-3

00:11:53.646 --> 00:11:57.747

I can, you know, I try to reach

out to where I can to try to get

d011c713-3bf3-41b2-8605-2fc9bcb84bb7-4

00:11:57.747 --> 00:12:01.533

stuff moving sometimes, you

know, with that. And if there's

d011c713-3bf3-41b2-8605-2fc9bcb84bb7-5

00:12:01.533 --> 00:12:05.319

a hardship, I'll have them fill

out the paperwork to and to

d011c713-3bf3-41b2-8605-2fc9bcb84bb7-6

00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:09.105

submit any documentation for

that. So we can flag it to try

d011c713-3bf3-41b2-8605-2fc9bcb84bb7-7

00:12:09.105 --> 00:12:11.440

to get it pushed through if

there's.

fa85177d-d527-43ff-abc7-307b3ab929df-0

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:16.724

And we already spoke about the

beer link that that's the things

fa85177d-d527-43ff-abc7-307b3ab929df-1

00:12:16.724 --> 00:12:18.890

that I had the the biggest stuff

there.

f71b1bfd-b7a4-42fb-9f4f-2d0c5bb8dee6-0

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.190

Well, that's that's very

comprehensive. Thank you for

f71b1bfd-b7a4-42fb-9f4f-2d0c5bb8dee6-1

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:22.740

sharing that.

60b29849-d559-45cc-9d76-6b2cffe42672-0

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.410

Um.

b0b2c2fa-17fb-40d2-8a73-38fca0ec4681-0

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.930

So thinking about um.

ff671d6e-accd-4245-8c6f-116e5c032540-0

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:31.750

Uh.

8372e2a7-1386-48c4-8e1e-c1e71195e39b-0

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:36.199

What veterans can do at the

facility, you know, we just

8372e2a7-1386-48c4-8e1e-c1e71195e39b-1

00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:39.376

talked about a lot of things

that they come trying to do that

8372e2a7-1386-48c4-8e1e-c1e71195e39b-2

00:12:39.376 --> 00:12:40.759

they're at the wrong place.

2d13176b-891e-4122-a403-1b3c91d6bc6a-0

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:46.217

And some things that are they'd

like to get done. But there's a

2d13176b-891e-4122-a403-1b3c91d6bc6a-1

00:12:46.217 --> 00:12:49.833

problem of two pieces of

software not speaking to each

2d13176b-891e-4122-a403-1b3c91d6bc6a-2

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:50.820

other properly.

f7a186af-5185-419b-8907-d0cbf00fea38-0

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:55.332

Uh what? Uh, for tasks that

actually do get accomplished

f7a186af-5185-419b-8907-d0cbf00fea38-1

00:12:55.332 --> 00:12:58.882

when veterans come, what would

you list out as kind of like the

f7a186af-5185-419b-8907-d0cbf00fea38-2

00:12:58.882 --> 00:13:02.544

main service offerings of of the

office in terms of what you help

people with?

Ah.

Just submitting of their claims, award letters, explaining the laws on their decisions and what they have, and then their options. Because really when we

see the vet, 99% of the vets, all they care about is what's my

percentage and how much money I'm getting about. They don't

read all the other legal stuff

2c74510d-fbe8-4d67-aefa-4d6a16e3025e-5

00:13:26.916 --> 00:13:31.420

that's inside inside the letter.

So we we try to break it down. I

2c74510d-fbe8-4d67-aefa-4d6a16e3025e-6

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.720

I tell them to keep it simple

stupid. Just do it we highlight.

92cccfc6-290a-4a2a-8ad4-b9f7f5fef74f-0

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.085

Stuff form. We do whatever you

know, we're the ones that are

92cccfc6-290a-4a2a-8ad4-b9f7f5fef74f-1

00:13:39.085 --> 00:13:42.543

professionals doing this day in,

day out. So our job is just to

92cccfc6-290a-4a2a-8ad4-b9f7f5fef74f-2

00:13:42.543 --> 00:13:46.001

make it as easy as possible, you

know, for them, there's things

92cccfc6-290a-4a2a-8ad4-b9f7f5fef74f-3

00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:49.243

that you gotta help yourself.

There's things I can't do for

92cccfc6-290a-4a2a-8ad4-b9f7f5fef74f-4

00:13:49.243 --> 00:13:49.460

you.

d949c5cd-d7ae-4134-be2c-9af8afe8a951-0

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:54.191

You know you you need to be part

of this play and we explain to

d949c5cd-d7ae-4134-be2c-9af8afe8a951-1

00:13:54.191 --> 00:13:57.534

them with like the Veterans

Service organizations. They

d949c5cd-d7ae-4134-be2c-9af8afe8a951-2

00:13:57.534 --> 00:14:01.176

handle too many vets and not

looking at what's going on with

d949c5cd-d7ae-4134-be2c-9af8afe8a951-3

00:14:01.176 --> 00:14:04.878

RJ's claim this week. You have

to be back and forth with them

and communicating, you know.

58f0e185-534c-4e2c-ac7a-5c44d15122cf-0

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:07.910

And.

3d9688cc-26b3-4805-8c62-ea26746e69dc-0

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.829

They'll be able to work your

claim at that point with that,

3d9688cc-26b3-4805-8c62-ea26746e69dc-1

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:14.734

but they're not going to make

the decision. Nobody can

3d9688cc-26b3-4805-8c62-ea26746e69dc-2

00:14:14.734 --> 00:14:17.692

guarantee you're getting

benefits. You know it's there,

3d9688cc-26b3-4805-8c62-ea26746e69dc-3

00:14:17.692 --> 00:14:20.756

and the doctor makes the medical

opinion. If the doctor's

3d9688cc-26b3-4805-8c62-ea26746e69dc-4

00:14:20.756 --> 00:14:23.872

positive, you get granted. If

it's negative, you don't. If

3d9688cc-26b3-4805-8c62-ea26746e69dc-5

00:14:23.872 --> 00:14:27.094

it's not there, they won't even

schedule. You just trying to

3d9688cc-26b3-4805-8c62-ea26746e69dc-6

00:14:27.094 --> 00:14:29.999

clarify everything for them,

they're not always happy.

d84e4431-dc03-4032-ad06-b9b171a54418-0

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:35.008

But the rules of the rules, you

know, with that and we explained

d84e4431-dc03-4032-ad06-b9b171a54418-1

00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:38.879

to them, you know we can't tell

you not to put claims and

d84e4431-dc03-4032-ad06-b9b171a54418-2

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:43.284

because laws change, we just had

to pack that come into play, you

d84e4431-dc03-4032-ad06-b9b171a54418-3

00:14:43.284 --> 00:14:47.288

know in August you know. So if

if we told them not to put a

d84e4431-dc03-4032-ad06-b9b171a54418-4

00:14:47.288 --> 00:14:51.360

claim in a long time ago that

could affect that you know so.

3e44cbb8-82c3-4053-9af4-8462dca0bce8-0

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.740

But I I think a lot of ours is

just.

4b9d9490-276f-49cc-9385-c48f0d60580f-0

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.620

We're pretty understaffed right

now.

8ec8df75-6354-4fe5-ad9b-7bc5393ede31-0

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:02.986

Yeah, you know with with what we

have this, this the staffing is

8ec8df75-6354-4fe5-ad9b-7bc5393ede31-1

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:03.710

there and.

b3572c55-58cc-4d85-98ca-adc7845f9879-0

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.542

It's something's gotta happen at

that point, something's gotta be

b3572c55-58cc-4d85-98ca-adc7845f9879-1

00:15:09.542 --> 00:15:12.626

fixed with that because our

workload. You can juggle all

b3572c55-58cc-4d85-98ca-adc7845f9879-2

00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:16.090

over the place. I mean, I know

you already spoke with Lisa, you

b3572c55-58cc-4d85-98ca-adc7845f9879-3

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.175

know, and I, you know, she got

it with, with, with those

b3572c55-58cc-4d85-98ca-adc7845f9879-4

00:15:19.175 --> 00:15:21.989

things. But there's a lot.

There's a lot to juggle.

b0f42f12-8506-4467-abf5-6928f8b3318f-0

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.372

You know what was going on and

some of them things you can't

b0f42f12-8506-4467-abf5-6928f8b3318f-1

00:15:26.372 --> 00:15:29.598

jump back and forth between

seeing a veteran or calling a

b0f42f12-8506-4467-abf5-6928f8b3318f-2

00:15:29.598 --> 00:15:32.435

veteran and responding to a

White House inquiry or

b0f42f12-8506-4467-abf5-6928f8b3318f-3

00:15:32.435 --> 00:15:35.661

responding to the senator's

office. You know, you need to

b0f42f12-8506-4467-abf5-6928f8b3318f-4

00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:38.998

kind of stay focused because

otherwise everything will just

b0f42f12-8506-4467-abf5-6928f8b3318f-5

00:15:38.998 --> 00:15:42.391

group together with what you're

doing and you're you have to

b0f42f12-8506-4467-abf5-6928f8b3318f-6

00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:44.949

restart over to catch up to

where you are at.

ba33f35f-84a2-4239-840b-8643f935bf41-0

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.703

Yeah. No, that, that makes sense

that it's, uh, the issue is not

ba33f35f-84a2-4239-840b-8643f935bf41-1

00:15:49.703 --> 00:15:52.844

that you don't have the

expertise and the knowledge to

ba33f35f-84a2-4239-840b-8643f935bf41-2

00:15:52.844 --> 00:15:56.272

help veterans. It's just you

don't have the right amount of

ba33f35f-84a2-4239-840b-8643f935bf41-3

00:15:56.272 --> 00:15:59.300

staff for the the volume of

veterans you're getting.

c107bd37-2373-4029-8d16-b87fcd414dca-0

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:04.091

Yeah, I think that that's been

that way for a long time. You

c107bd37-2373-4029-8d16-b87fcd414dca-1

00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:07.359

know, here unfortunate

unfortunately, I mean and some

c107bd37-2373-4029-8d16-b87fcd414dca-2

00:16:07.359 --> 00:16:11.172

things are out of our control.

You know we, we've got OPM, you

c107bd37-2373-4029-8d16-b87fcd414dca-3

00:16:11.172 --> 00:16:15.166

know they, you know they there's

an allowance list, you know from

c107bd37-2373-4029-8d16-b87fcd414dca-4

00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:18.978

what you're allowed to have. But

wait with the viewer, I guess

c107bd37-2373-4029-8d16-b87fcd414dca-5

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:21.459

what I wanted to expand on with

Vera is.

2dc666c9-3205-47de-987a-52a73779e94e-0

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:26.068

We've got workload management

and we've all been supervisors,

2dc666c9-3205-47de-987a-52a73779e94e-1

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:29.785

so when you've got it, you you

can manage that workload. But

2dc666c9-3205-47de-987a-52a73779e94e-2

00:16:29.785 --> 00:16:31.369

when you open a system up.

d6dc6959-767f-4bee-9f68-8b7063f18994-0

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:37.537

To people from the outside to be

able to make their appointment

d6dc6959-767f-4bee-9f68-8b7063f18994-1

00:16:37.537 --> 00:16:38.760

when they want.

00a9b60b-c957-4b34-8f3c-f0806dc9c1c1-0

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.201

You know, you've kind of taken

that out, taken the whole

00a9b60b-c957-4b34-8f3c-f0806dc9c1c1-1

00:16:43.201 --> 00:16:44.680

workload management out.

12fcdd3b-7d1e-4152-96b1-e9b083bc6834-0

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:49.123

I don't care if you change it to

two interviews or not, but as a

12fcdd3b-7d1e-4152-96b1-e9b083bc6834-1

00:16:49.123 --> 00:16:52.790

leader I'm retired chief. As a

leader, I could tell people what

12fcdd3b-7d1e-4152-96b1-e9b083bc6834-2

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.227

their work is for the day, but

if the work changes based on

12fcdd3b-7d1e-4152-96b1-e9b083bc6834-3

00:16:56.227 --> 00:16:59.435

someone having access to a

system to schedule their own

12fcdd3b-7d1e-4152-96b1-e9b083bc6834-4

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:03.101

appointment, that's when it can

be rough. Because I know we had

12fcdd3b-7d1e-4152-96b1-e9b083bc6834-5

00:17:03.101 --> 00:17:06.653

it at times where you know you

get all the virtual interviews

12fcdd3b-7d1e-4152-96b1-e9b083bc6834-6

00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:06.940

done.

34223844-5a26-4016-96f9-22263d100d8e-0

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.250

And then you're working and you got a lobby full of people, and then you turn around and all of a sudden you missed the virtual because somebody when you thought you had them done,

somebody came back in and they

they scheduled a virtual.

3993a7fb-afc1-4ec5-be0b-adeceb2bdf42-0

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.519

Yeah. No, that's uh no for that.

And they're upset because they

3993a7fb-afc1-4ec5-be0b-adeceb2bdf42-1

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:27.200

didn't get the call and you're

calling them two hours late.

32fb05b8-532b-4d7a-921a-238e4780b58d-0

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.420

You know.

392505a9-966f-4123-9de4-46df3df63296-0

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.280

So.

216d68b6-e34a-4f44-86c0-11c35103889a-0

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.753

I mean some things people are

just gonna complain. I know that

216d68b6-e34a-4f44-86c0-11c35103889a-1

00:17:36.753 --> 00:17:40.562

I've been there in the leader,

you know, and everyone can do

216d68b6-e34a-4f44-86c0-11c35103889a-2

00:17:40.562 --> 00:17:44.121

the job better than than we can

when you, you know, as a

216d68b6-e34a-4f44-86c0-11c35103889a-3

00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:47.618

supervisor, I'll never think

that way, you know? I know

216d68b6-e34a-4f44-86c0-11c35103889a-4

00:17:47.618 --> 00:17:51.365

there's things that are out of

control, you know, with that

216d68b6-e34a-4f44-86c0-11c35103889a-5

00:17:51.365 --> 00:17:55.423

building is out of control of a

supervisor. Like that comes at a

216d68b6-e34a-4f44-86c0-11c35103889a-6

00:17:55.423 --> 00:17:59.170

higher level, you know with all

that. But overall the job's

216d68b6-e34a-4f44-86c0-11c35103889a-7

00:17:59.170 --> 00:17:59.669

amazing.

839e32ad-3e79-47da-a29d-daae1301d396-0

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.647

Job is 100% amazing. This is

what I wanted to do when I

839e32ad-3e79-47da-a29d-daae1301d396-1

00:18:04.647 --> 00:18:08.697

retired, you know, at the VA for

helping vets here. I used to

839e32ad-3e79-47da-a29d-daae1301d396-2

00:18:08.697 --> 00:18:10.330

work claims upstairs. Um.

3255ae02-8360-412c-add5-1a6f02dfb8e7-0

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.840

I started here as a work study.

00e4038e-7a19-4a16-953d-06ffb57263cd-0

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.002

I worked as a claims assistant,

got promoted to the veteran

00e4038e-7a19-4a16-953d-06ffb57263cd-1

00:18:17.002 --> 00:18:20.477

service representative. When I

came down here, as in Las, you

00e4038e-7a19-4a16-953d-06ffb57263cd-2

00:18:20.477 --> 00:18:23.840

know, with this take the good

and bad here with everything,

00e4038e-7a19-4a16-953d-06ffb57263cd-3

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.146

you know, you got the people

screaming and yelling at you.

00e4038e-7a19-4a16-953d-06ffb57263cd-4

00:18:27.146 --> 00:18:28.379

They've thrown chairs.

21f15e5c-2c1e-48d2-9a5b-cce8ee792309-0

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.705

You know, hitting the glass in

front of you, you know, and

21f15e5c-2c1e-48d2-9a5b-cce8ee792309-1

00:18:32.705 --> 00:18:34.970

things that just out of your

control.

8c8ac178-91fb-474b-baab-e97bbadc578c-0

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.720

They're just upset. They got to

lease it out on somebody.

95f913a4-f4c5-4e4d-9eac-27eedb317d76-0

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.290

But but All in all, when when

you get that?

f814f9db-b1e5-4ac1-ba2b-79431eaa9aea-0

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.777

That veteran that was doing

everything wrong because they

f814f9db-b1e5-4ac1-ba2b-79431eaa9aea-1

00:18:46.777 --> 00:18:50.718

didn't understand the processes

and what needed to be done and

f814f9db-b1e5-4ac1-ba2b-79431eaa9aea-2

00:18:50.718 --> 00:18:54.596

you can help them and then you

see them get their benefits or

f814f9db-b1e5-4ac1-ba2b-79431eaa9aea-3

00:18:54.596 --> 00:18:58.661

that surviving spouse that's got

a financial hardship and didn't

f814f9db-b1e5-4ac1-ba2b-79431eaa9aea-4

00:18:58.661 --> 00:19:02.477

understand the claims process

and you helped them through it

f814f9db-b1e5-4ac1-ba2b-79431eaa9aea-5

00:19:02.477 --> 00:19:06.167

and they come back and they get

granted. You just see that

f814f9db-b1e5-4ac1-ba2b-79431eaa9aea-6

00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:10.045

relief, you know, off their face

and how grateful they are to

f814f9db-b1e5-4ac1-ba2b-79431eaa9aea-7

00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:12.859

you. We just had a lady that got

denied No2.

b871aa46-d4f9-4a4e-bd61-3f4f48451b54-0

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.240

And then we just got our stuff.

She got $280,000 retro pay.

2d0d20ac-f0be-4ba9-8098-e844a2fc216f-0

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.692

You know, I mean to come in

financial hardship, elderly

2d0d20ac-f0be-4ba9-8098-e844a2fc216f-1

00:19:21.692 --> 00:19:25.619

lady. And it was just wrong with

what happened. Yeah, she got it.

2d0d20ac-f0be-4ba9-8098-e844a2fc216f-2

00:19:25.619 --> 00:19:28.000

So that's what makes it all

worthwhile.

e50fbfe1-33f4-4230-9d09-6a179cefb082-0

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:31.580

You know when you're doing that

with assist in these people?

e551508f-e9b8-4d61-a1cb-5910be8b270e-0

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:36.432

Yeah. And, you know, I think

kind of connects to what you

e551508f-e9b8-4d61-a1cb-5910be8b270e-1

00:19:36.432 --> 00:19:40.041

said earlier of, you know, often

when people come to you, they

e551508f-e9b8-4d61-a1cb-5910be8b270e-2

00:19:40.041 --> 00:19:43.707

got bad information previously

and you know the most you can do

e551508f-e9b8-4d61-a1cb-5910be8b270e-3

00:19:43.707 --> 00:19:47.316

is try to rectify the situation

that's in front of you at that

e551508f-e9b8-4d61-a1cb-5910be8b270e-4

00:19:47.316 --> 00:19:47.660

point.

c802acc3-8e0b-4541-8470-07091f0dbff9-0

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.410

Most definitely. You know, if we

if if we had like.

c7f8ff59-b541-4b85-ad15-087da1a1c6e4-0

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.406

Computer systems, I mean, you know when when you, if you report back whatever. I mean, if

we had a computer system, somebody puts their veteran ID

card or they check in and if it

c7f8ff59-b541-4b85-ad15-087da1a1c6e4-3

00:20:03.162 --> 00:20:06.706

says you want an award letter,

it just prints the award letter.

c7f8ff59-b541-4b85-ad15-087da1a1c6e4-4

00:20:06.706 --> 00:20:10.251

You know what I mean with that?

And and it not that they'd have

c7f8ff59-b541-4b85-ad15-087da1a1c6e4-5

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:13.629

to really see somebody they

could have something there. They

c7f8ff59-b541-4b85-ad15-087da1a1c6e4-6

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:17.173

print, you know. And they cap it

off. You get one award letter.

c7f8ff59-b541-4b85-ad15-087da1a1c6e4-7

00:20:17.173 --> 00:20:18.890

It's not like you can print 50.

b6bad90f-0bcb-42c0-a890-614e6c2375e7-0

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.407

You know what I mean? There's

machines out there. We see them.

b6bad90f-0bcb-42c0-a890-614e6c2375e7-1

00:20:22.407 --> 00:20:25.285

Check them in at the hospital

with the machines. You know, you

b6bad90f-0bcb-42c0-a890-614e6c2375e7-2

00:20:25.285 --> 00:20:28.071

go over there and you put your

card in there and it'll check

b6bad90f-0bcb-42c0-a890-614e6c2375e7-3

00:20:28.071 --> 00:20:28.620

somebody in.

3f318636-68e2-435d-b0fd-d8b2ed0fc5b4-0

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.290

You know, it's easy, but.

a41c0576-c3b3-4e71-b3c0-1b4f373030db-0

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.320

To take the little things I know

on va.gov they can go print

their award letters and do stuff

like that, but we got some older

people that are not computer

savvy by any means. You know,

a41c0576-c3b3-4e71-b3c0-1b4f373030db-3

00:20:42.082 --> 00:20:45.329

you got the ones that are that

sharp as a stick and you got

a41c0576-c3b3-4e71-b3c0-1b4f373030db-4

00:20:45.329 --> 00:20:48.412

ones that just ain't and it's

not their fault, you know,

a41c0576-c3b3-4e71-b3c0-1b4f373030db-5

00:20:48.412 --> 00:20:50.090

they're 80 something years old.

f5c6b037-8b52-46b8-8492-ff28c3061746-0

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:55.998

You know, they they just didn't

stay with the times as as times

f5c6b037-8b52-46b8-8492-ff28c3061746-1

00:20:55.998 --> 00:21:00.440

are changing, they just kind of

drifted one along did their

f5c6b037-8b52-46b8-8492-ff28c3061746-2

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:04.660

thing and it is what it is.

Right? But So what are they?

949c346d-7f38-4d7f-996d-6a53cd273dd3-0

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:09.020

I kind of. I was gonna say uh.

c2d3d386-c6b6-4d14-b385-1eb614f8a9a4-0

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.740

Um, you know our scope. Uh, for

this project is really the the

c2d3d386-c6b6-4d14-b385-1eb614f8a9a4-1

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.721

the front part of the website

that anybody can see without

c2d3d386-c6b6-4d14-b385-1eb614f8a9a4-2

00:21:18.721 --> 00:21:22.769

logging in. So I'm so basically

that information that'll be

c2d3d386-c6b6-4d14-b385-1eb614f8a9a4-3

00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:26.548

about, you know, the

Regional Benefit Office if

c2d3d386-c6b6-4d14-b385-1eb614f8a9a4-4

00:21:26.548 --> 00:21:30.799

you're coming for this service,

here's things to bring. So you

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:34.982

know thinking about you know

that piece of problem, obviously

c2d3d386-c6b6-4d14-b385-1eb614f8a9a4-6

00:21:34.982 --> 00:21:39.368

there's a lot of things that you

know could make it a lot better

c2d3d386-c6b6-4d14-b385-1eb614f8a9a4-7

00:21:39.368 --> 00:21:40.919

veteran experience but.

5003a624-dd99-494f-b397-18a89d03e4ae-0

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.149

Um, are there any kind of common

things you see people maybe

5003a624-dd99-494f-b397-18a89d03e4ae-1

00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:49.506

forgetting to bring that if they

if they check the website which

5003a624-dd99-494f-b397-18a89d03e4ae-2

00:21:49.506 --> 00:21:53.662

not everybody does. Yeah that

you know, we could help them be

5003a624-dd99-494f-b397-18a89d03e4ae-3

00:21:53.662 --> 00:21:57.751

better prepared. So they're not

having to come back a second

5003a624-dd99-494f-b397-18a89d03e4ae-4

00:21:57.751 --> 00:22:01.304

visit, things like that

surviving spouses, you know,

5003a624-dd99-494f-b397-18a89d03e4ae-5

00:22:01.304 --> 00:22:04.588

maybe bring in their the

marriage license, death

5003a624-dd99-494f-b397-18a89d03e4ae-6

00:22:04.588 --> 00:22:08.275

certificate DD214 Umm for

dependency claims if they're

5003a624-dd99-494f-b397-18a89d03e4ae-7

00:22:08.275 --> 00:22:10.890

coming in about that making sure

that.

0e7a4c0c-b61d-4279-924c-b68a784cd589-0

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:14.582

They might have the divorce

decrees, marriage licenses and

0e7a4c0c-b61d-4279-924c-b68a784cd589-1

00:22:14.582 --> 00:22:17.360

Social Security numbers for

their dependents.

29c29619-d160-4d06-b960-ee7afb2d0d86-0

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.171

And any medical records that

they might have that they if

29c29619-d160-4d06-b960-ee7afb2d0d86-1

00:22:25.171 --> 00:22:28.711

they saw outside sources, if

they if they saw the VA, we're

29c29619-d160-4d06-b960-ee7afb2d0d86-2

00:22:28.711 --> 00:22:32.546

going to have those records, you

know, they'll be able to access

29c29619-d160-4d06-b960-ee7afb2d0d86-3

00:22:32.546 --> 00:22:36.085

them through the program when

they look up, you just ensure

29c29619-d160-4d06-b960-ee7afb2d0d86-4

00:22:36.085 --> 00:22:39.625

that they put whatever clinics

or facilities that they have

29c29619-d160-4d06-b960-ee7afb2d0d86-5

00:22:39.625 --> 00:22:43.460

used that that are the VA stuff

on that. But if they get private

29c29619-d160-4d06-b960-ee7afb2d0d86-6

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.410

treatment records, that always

helps. Picture ID.

d64ab4fe-458f-4e30-9281-4bac6a7e41a1-0

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.250

A up to date picture ID because

we can't use expired. You know

d64ab4fe-458f-4e30-9281-4bac6a7e41a1-1

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:56.590

we got our protocols in place

for verification that they have

d64ab4fe-458f-4e30-9281-4bac6a7e41a1-2

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.790

to answer. If they don't have

it, you know to protect their

d64ab4fe-458f-4e30-9281-4bac6a7e41a1-3

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.420

identity.

b03d7c3a-a6ed-42a9-a05f-3ebed6e066a2-0

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.100

That we go through.

f4eb5b78-9fa6-4aa1-8433-51df783d7431-0

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.407

Those are the biggest things for

coming to us. I think that that

f4eb5b78-9fa6-4aa1-8433-51df783d7431-1

00:23:11.407 --> 00:23:15.918

if if there would be something

on there that that stated, if

f4eb5b78-9fa6-4aa1-8433-51df783d7431-2

00:23:15.918 --> 00:23:17.250

there is anything.

2ba74181-bf11-4243-bbee-e54119cb919d-0

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.550

To deal with treatment.

7c745691-35c3-4819-8791-1a706250f525-0

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.471

Or medical billing that is done

through the Veterans Health

7c745691-35c3-4819-8791-1a706250f525-1

00:23:24.471 --> 00:23:28.343

Administration that is not

handled by the Veterans Benefits

7c745691-35c3-4819-8791-1a706250f525-2

00:23:28.343 --> 00:23:32.150

Administration, which which

would stop a lot of confusion.

7d9d124b-f29a-4ed2-ba74-edc678e9e2ff-0

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.633

Prescriptions, medications,

medical bills. You know anything

7d9d124b-f29a-4ed2-ba74-edc678e9e2ff-1

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:40.414

to deal with. Treatment is done

through the Veterans Health

7d9d124b-f29a-4ed2-ba74-edc678e9e2ff-2

00:23:40.414 --> 00:23:41.360

Administration.

c310f1b0-339b-413a-ab1e-3d29857437eb-0

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.501

Right. And there'd be a specific

uh building address on that

c310f1b0-339b-413a-ab1e-3d29857437eb-1

00:23:46.501 --> 00:23:50.397

campus that they want to go to

if they're, you know, coming to

c310f1b0-339b-413a-ab1e-3d29857437eb-2

00:23:50.397 --> 00:23:53.860

to the campus overall. Yeah,

because we've actually had

c310f1b0-339b-413a-ab1e-3d29857437eb-3

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.075

people report over here, you

know, that they've had

c310f1b0-339b-413a-ab1e-3d29857437eb-4

00:23:57.075 --> 00:23:58.560

appointments over there.

fb08382c-0067-44a0-ad44-86905d99529c-0

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:03.950

They'll get confused. They're

2002 hold for 6900 out meter.

ba4ca2dc-7f50-48a8-8261-83bd348726cd-0

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:08.320

You know? Yeah. When they when

they've come here and then they

ba4ca2dc-7f50-48a8-8261-83bd348726cd-1

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.606

gotta rush over there and

they're late for their

ba4ca2dc-7f50-48a8-8261-83bd348726cd-2

00:24:10.606 --> 00:24:12.940

appointment at that and we we

know how that goes.

185da7fa-4a9c-42b1-a417-0be70b31bcd2-0

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.654

Absolutely. Um. So, uh, you've

obviously worked in, you know,

185da7fa-4a9c-42b1-a417-0be70b31bcd2-1

00:24:18.654 --> 00:24:22.900

VBA for a while. Probably have a

pretty good grasp on all sorts

185da7fa-4a9c-42b1-a417-0be70b31bcd2-2

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:27.014

of different benefits. Yeah,

services. Are there any that are

185da7fa-4a9c-42b1-a417-0be70b31bcd2-3

00:24:27.014 --> 00:24:30.863

kind of unique to, you know,

veterans in at your location

185da7fa-4a9c-42b1-a417-0be70b31bcd2-4

00:24:30.863 --> 00:24:35.110

that might not be available at

other places around the country?

9a37c271-5a98-4ccd-aca0-22b5f1b1819a-0

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.534

No, no. The When you're dealing

with the benefits

9a37c271-5a98-4ccd-aca0-22b5f1b1819a-1

00:24:39.534 --> 00:24:43.483

administration, you're you're

you're dealing with that. I

9a37c271-5a98-4ccd-aca0-22b5f1b1819a-2

00:24:43.483 --> 00:24:47.569

mean, as far as locally, you

know, you got your local state

stuff, you know benefits that we

have like in our city, we have

the metro.

0ff1a79e-2ba1-499d-a747-99ac12b961c5-0

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:59.447

Umm, Pass where? If a veteran's

50% or more you know or 40% due

0ff1a79e-2ba1-499d-a747-99ac12b961c5-1

00:24:59.447 --> 00:25:04.170

to amputation of a leg. You know

above the knee.

1176f367-e285-482e-8ddf-f8c7b45fd453-0

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.676

Like service connected that they

can ride Metro for free, you

1176f367-e285-482e-8ddf-f8c7b45fd453-1

00:25:09.676 --> 00:25:13.484

know the property taxes if

they're 100% in the state 

1176f367-e285-482e-8ddf-f8c7b45fd453-2

00:25:13.484 --> 00:25:17.904

you know, you don't pay,

you know, but don't those things

1176f367-e285-482e-8ddf-f8c7b45fd453-3

00:25:17.904 --> 00:25:19.060

would be hard to.

dfd5dfa8-094b-4baf-9b81-e83a515d4442-0

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:23.753

Like put on a website, you know

they'd have to hyperlink or

dfd5dfa8-094b-4baf-9b81-e83a515d4442-1

00:25:23.753 --> 00:25:27.766

something to the state because

they can stay in theirs at a

dfd5dfa8-094b-4baf-9b81-e83a515d4442-2

00:25:27.766 --> 00:25:31.980

moments notice, you know, right.

They they went talk and said,

dfd5dfa8-094b-4baf-9b81-e83a515d4442-3

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.261

you know what, we can no longer

do Hazelwood, act in this State. You

dfd5dfa8-094b-4baf-9b81-e83a515d4442-4

00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:40.342

know, we just can't. We can't

absorb the cost anymore or you

dfd5dfa8-094b-4baf-9b81-e83a515d4442-5

00:25:40.342 --> 00:25:44.422

know, we can no longer do the

property tax. So we we have we

dfd5dfa8-094b-4baf-9b81-e83a515d4442-6

00:25:44.422 --> 00:25:48.703

have a list of benefits that we

keep up to date on a sheet with

dfd5dfa8-094b-4baf-9b81-e83a515d4442-7

00:25:48.703 --> 00:25:50.710

veteran based off percentages.

65aeb790-3e7d-4b45-a48a-cf3837304846-0

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:55.760

And we give that to the vet, you

know, for the local.

f694491e-e581-47bd-ae98-e3599a1f0c6a-0

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.144

But as far as claims or anything

like that, there's nothing

f694491e-e581-47bd-ae98-e3599a1f0c6a-1

00:26:00.144 --> 00:26:02.890

unique. That's just standard

across the board.

7e3ab620-e9bc-4dae-b4f1-eb921accb63d-0

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.827

Right. And to your point, the,

the stuff that is local, it's

7e3ab620-e9bc-4dae-b4f1-eb921accb63d-1

00:26:07.827 --> 00:26:11.906

not technically from the VBA,

it's just you're helping them

7e3ab620-e9bc-4dae-b4f1-eb921accb63d-2

00:26:11.906 --> 00:26:15.850

get a piece of paperwork for

this other administration or

7e3ab620-e9bc-4dae-b4f1-eb921accb63d-3

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.929

government agency at the front

desk when we're dealing with

7e3ab620-e9bc-4dae-b4f1-eb921accb63d-4

00:26:19.929 --> 00:26:24.144

stuff, we like know a little bit

of everything, you know, for

7e3ab620-e9bc-4dae-b4f1-eb921accb63d-5

00:26:24.144 --> 00:26:28.020

stuff going on. So if veterans

100%, they're not retired

7e3ab620-e9bc-4dae-b4f1-eb921accb63d-6

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.720

military, they could get.

ee3ab546-eb75-4149-9b6b-63144b9086d7-0

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:35.265

What they called Champ, VA. Now

I'm a military retiree. If I was

ee3ab546-eb75-4149-9b6b-63144b9086d7-1

00:26:35.265 --> 00:26:39.324

100% then I wouldn't be able to

get Champ, VA because I would

ee3ab546-eb75-4149-9b6b-63144b9086d7-2

00:26:39.324 --> 00:26:40.110

use Tricare.

09cee2ce-3e54-4198-82b4-bed2d5b53c97-0

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.442

That that wouldn't be available

to me, but we still have the

09cee2ce-3e54-4198-82b4-bed2d5b53c97-1

00:26:44.442 --> 00:26:47.896

paperwork and we can explain it

to them and then, you know, tell

09cee2ce-3e54-4198-82b4-bed2d5b53c97-2

00:26:47.896 --> 00:26:50.819

them where they need to go off

for that type of stuff.

1d50bb20-fd44-4969-96ad-158e45355cc7-0

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.513

So we'll answer like those types

of things. You know, that would

1d50bb20-fd44-4969-96ad-158e45355cc7-1

00:26:55.513 --> 00:26:58.875

be done by another agency

instead of them having to go

1d50bb20-fd44-4969-96ad-158e45355cc7-2

00:26:58.875 --> 00:27:02.666

over to the hospital and ask

that it gets sent over here. Who

1d50bb20-fd44-4969-96ad-158e45355cc7-3

00:27:02.666 --> 00:27:03.950

knows, wherever else.

3bd6e693-6478-459b-9b97-5245a83f4823-0

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.890

You know, yeah, so.

942e4945-aa72-45d4-a515-7ac4a77aec09-0

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.908

Um, typically right. VBA doesn't

really deal with that kind of

942e4945-aa72-45d4-a515-7ac4a77aec09-1

00:27:10.908 --> 00:27:14.405

which of the three types of

medical care of veterans gets

942e4945-aa72-45d4-a515-7ac4a77aec09-2

00:27:14.405 --> 00:27:18.204

right, right, Tricare, Champ, or

just normal? VA, that's that.

942e4945-aa72-45d4-a515-7ac4a77aec09-3

00:27:18.204 --> 00:27:21.882

That's outside. They deal with

the champ, VA, you know, it's

942e4945-aa72-45d4-a515-7ac4a77aec09-4

00:27:21.882 --> 00:27:23.390

worked out of Denver, Co.

dae3decf-c85e-42fe-9118-49638cc8a969-0

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.804

With that, but yeah, the the

other ones like I tell the vet

dae3decf-c85e-42fe-9118-49638cc8a969-1

00:27:28.804 --> 00:27:32.662

whenever retiree that's not the

VA you have to contact Tricare

dae3decf-c85e-42fe-9118-49638cc8a969-2

00:27:32.662 --> 00:27:35.480

themselves. They're they've got

the contract.

100715cc-a032-403f-bad6-5ca576be8489-0

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.100

You know for us.

56e2591c-732e-4a82-a67a-693dd5e2f691-0

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:43.549

Right. But when a veteran from

the veteran perspective, it's

56e2591c-732e-4a82-a67a-693dd5e2f691-1

00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:48.114

all day for veterans. So yeah,

like why can't you give me that

56e2591c-732e-4a82-a67a-693dd5e2f691-2

00:27:48.114 --> 00:27:52.607

information? You should know

that right? Well, the Tricare no

56e2591c-732e-4a82-a67a-693dd5e2f691-3

00:27:52.607 --> 00:27:57.389

champia as far as with that it's

because you're 100% it's medical

56e2591c-732e-4a82-a67a-693dd5e2f691-4

00:27:57.389 --> 00:28:02.171

benefits you need to go directly

to Champ, VA, the Tricare stuff.

56e2591c-732e-4a82-a67a-693dd5e2f691-5

00:28:02.171 --> 00:28:06.808

I know because I deal with it on

a day in day out basis with my

56e2591c-732e-4a82-a67a-693dd5e2f691-6

00:28:06.808 --> 00:28:08.910

family you know for that but.

71c48c1d-7b2a-41f2-9ae4-247efcb8f6db-0

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.873

That's not the VA. You know

those those things all change

71c48c1d-7b2a-41f2-9ae4-247efcb8f6db-1

00:28:12.873 --> 00:28:16.833

based off Tricare, not the VA.

With that we can give them.

71c48c1d-7b2a-41f2-9ae4-247efcb8f6db-2

00:28:16.833 --> 00:28:20.927

We've got a phone listing for

them with the phone numbers to

71c48c1d-7b2a-41f2-9ae4-247efcb8f6db-3

00:28:20.927 --> 00:28:24.954

call. You know, we got a mask

thing if they need to talk to

71c48c1d-7b2a-41f2-9ae4-247efcb8f6db-4

00:28:24.954 --> 00:28:28.915

defense, finance, accounting

service, they need to talk to

71c48c1d-7b2a-41f2-9ae4-247efcb8f6db-5

00:28:28.915 --> 00:28:32.875

education, life insurance,

whatever. We got a long laundry

71c48c1d-7b2a-41f2-9ae4-247efcb8f6db-6

00:28:32.875 --> 00:28:36.969

list of phone numbers for them

and we'll highlight those and

71c48c1d-7b2a-41f2-9ae4-247efcb8f6db-7

00:28:36.969 --> 00:28:40.459

give them out so they can get to

the proper agency.

9723206d-13ef-4e5b-b035-7380d1630558-0

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.640

To speak with.

5e2792d4-37d5-4a80-a0d5-a9fff2b28033-0

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:48.281

Got it. Um, but yeah. Any other

things that you know again from

5e2792d4-37d5-4a80-a0d5-a9fff2b28033-1

00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:53.455

a website perspective, kind of

something a veteran might want

5e2792d4-37d5-4a80-a0d5-a9fff2b28033-2

00:28:53.455 --> 00:28:58.545

help with, but actually isn't

your place. So we talked about

5e2792d4-37d5-4a80-a0d5-a9fff2b28033-3

00:28:58.545 --> 00:29:03.719

medical and you know even like

Tricare if somebody thinks oh.

cc4d911d-f834-4a4f-8701-23b58e5b9f36-0

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.902

So putting on even the website.

Ohh if you're looking for

cc4d911d-f834-4a4f-8701-23b58e5b9f36-1

00:29:07.902 --> 00:29:11.295

Tricare, actually don't come

here. Go to this website or

cc4d911d-f834-4a4f-8701-23b58e5b9f36-2

00:29:11.295 --> 00:29:14.867

something like that or I mean so

you have defense, finance,

cc4d911d-f834-4a4f-8701-23b58e5b9f36-3

00:29:14.867 --> 00:29:18.320

accounting service that deals

with you know, the military

cc4d911d-f834-4a4f-8701-23b58e5b9f36-4

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.891

retirees and stuff like that.

They if there was a hyperlink

cc4d911d-f834-4a4f-8701-23b58e5b9f36-5

00:29:21.891 --> 00:29:23.379

for Coast Guard retirees.

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-0

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.580

You know that they could link to

the Coast Guard website. You

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-1

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:30.980

know, you could go to go over

there. I think it would be kind

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-2

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:34.326

of cool because not everybody

stays on top. I talked to vets

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-3

00:29:34.326 --> 00:29:37.945

and retirees. And I mean, I read

everything I can that deals with

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-4

00:29:37.945 --> 00:29:41.071

anything about my benefits or

entitlements. So I'm never

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-5

00:29:41.071 --> 00:29:44.527

behind the curveball on that.

You know, people coming through.

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-6

00:29:44.527 --> 00:29:48.092

I mean that's I got to do it for

my family. I ain't doing it for

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-7

00:29:48.092 --> 00:29:51.656

myself. I got to make sure that

they're covered. You know, if we

f794db26-35c6-41a1-8366-726c83cb831c-8

00:29:51.656 --> 00:29:54.070

got changes and you're just

going on about.

b29529a5-5cd3-4a90-ba19-d8d5e3bbd286-0

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.625

Life. You need to see what's

going to affect you and what

b29529a5-5cd3-4a90-ba19-d8d5e3bbd286-1

00:29:57.625 --> 00:30:00.750

changes, because there might be

good or bad, right?

fc706577-d471-42ed-a5b2-5260d5ba6e44-0

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.110

That.

eadad0d3-96b9-46e3-a747-4ce3c2a8e720-0

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.848

But no, I don't see any any

anything else. I mean if you

eadad0d3-96b9-46e3-a747-4ce3c2a8e720-1

00:30:06.848 --> 00:30:10.595

know making sure veterans that

think that they could report

eadad0d3-96b9-46e3-a747-4ce3c2a8e720-2

00:30:10.595 --> 00:30:13.030

here to get stuff for Social

Security.

25c17194-783a-426e-94ca-677464f64fc2-0

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:17.747

You know, here's the hyper link

for that. If you have any

00:30:24.787 --> 00:30:25.270

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:37.567

I appreciate uh all your

thoughts and feedback. Is there

dc627d76-c051-4728-a897-8c4b40c6c761-1

00:30:37.567 --> 00:30:41.410

any questions you have about the

process or anything else that

dc627d76-c051-4728-a897-8c4b40c6c761-2

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.009

came up today that you want to

get in in these last couple

dc627d76-c051-4728-a897-8c4b40c6c761-3

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:48.852

minutes? No, I think I think a

lot of it was answered. I mean,

dc627d76-c051-4728-a897-8c4b40c6c761-4

00:30:48.852 --> 00:30:52.451

I was kind of curious what it

was. I didn't know if it was

dc627d76-c051-4728-a897-8c4b40c6c761-5

00:30:52.451 --> 00:30:56.172

just trying to find out what

complaints we have, but it it's

dc627d76-c051-4728-a897-8c4b40c6c761-6

00:30:56.172 --> 00:30:59.405

more based on how we can make

the website better and

dc627d76-c051-4728-a897-8c4b40c6c761-7

00:30:59.405 --> 00:31:03.004

user-friendly for veterans,

which is cool. Yeah. You know,

dc627d76-c051-4728-a897-8c4b40c6c761-8

00:31:03.004 --> 00:31:03.309

it's.

c2675429-fe0f-4483-b52e-a5d5717ef730-0

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:07.372

School there. You know, if there

was something that could

c2675429-fe0f-4483-b52e-a5d5717ef730-1

00:31:07.372 --> 00:31:11.777

definitely be on there about the

one signing for va.gov because

c2675429-fe0f-4483-b52e-a5d5717ef730-2

00:31:11.777 --> 00:31:16.252

we're not experts in va.gov, you

know, and when when people have

c2675429-fe0f-4483-b52e-a5d5717ef730-3

00:31:16.252 --> 00:31:17.560

issues we we would.

f8fa87bb-7a06-4857-9a46-f7c03af80f34-0

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.997

Used to verify a person. Someone

in person. Right. Umm, where we

f8fa87bb-7a06-4857-9a46-f7c03af80f34-1

00:31:22.997 --> 00:31:27.131

would do that, they would go and

and verify and upgrade them to

f8fa87bb-7a06-4857-9a46-f7c03af80f34-2

00:31:27.131 --> 00:31:30.941

different levels. But with

theva.gov website you got ID me

f8fa87bb-7a06-4857-9a46-f7c03af80f34-3

00:31:30.941 --> 00:31:34.687

and that and it's all electronic

and it's like OK, you're

f8fa87bb-7a06-4857-9a46-f7c03af80f34-4

00:31:34.687 --> 00:31:38.820

successfully verified and you're

and and you're good to go now.

f8fa87bb-7a06-4857-9a46-f7c03af80f34-5

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.695

Now you got the higher level

access to do other features if

f8fa87bb-7a06-4857-9a46-f7c03af80f34-6

00:31:42.695 --> 00:31:45.860

there would be something more

there you know to.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.660

Not everybody's kids computer

savvy, like I said, right, and

cbfd7b81-1662-49ae-80ac-9f9d8e073313-1

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:57.452

there's just basic stuffs and we

got one guy that's very, very

cbfd7b81-1662-49ae-80ac-9f9d8e073313-2

00:31:57.452 --> 00:32:00.882

good. He's got like a 99%

success rate in getting people

cbfd7b81-1662-49ae-80ac-9f9d8e073313-3

00:32:00.882 --> 00:32:03.470

walk through the system, he

explains. Hey.

0c2e005f-fbc6-4ff0-8935-4cf2b2e1ceba-0

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:07.213

I'm not a master at this, I'm

only doing it as I did it

0c2e005f-fbc6-4ff0-8935-4cf2b2e1ceba-1

00:32:07.213 --> 00:32:10.282

because a lot of people don't

want. They don't want to read

0c2e005f-fbc6-4ff0-8935-4cf2b2e1ceba-2

00:32:10.282 --> 00:32:13.555

and they don't want to check the

boxes, they need to check, you

0c2e005f-fbc6-4ff0-8935-4cf2b2e1ceba-3

00:32:13.555 --> 00:32:16.879

know, to get stuff. So he walks

him through and he's like, don't

0c2e005f-fbc6-4ff0-8935-4cf2b2e1ceba-4

00:32:16.879 --> 00:32:19.845

be trigger happy with that

thing. President. We got to go

0c2e005f-fbc6-4ff0-8935-4cf2b2e1ceba-5

00:32:19.845 --> 00:32:20.509

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.670

You know for that, but if there

was something there or a phone

e8791046-1a0e-4c39-8b63-c48978d21069-1

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.510

number directly if they're

having.

e21dd19e-4f21-470f-9227-eb6720bad25d-0

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:31.243

Access specifically to getting

signed on to va.gov to where

e21dd19e-4f21-470f-9227-eb6720bad25d-1

00:32:31.243 --> 00:32:35.247

they got it, they get confusing

with my healthy vet and coming

here they got issues with my

healthy vet and we're seeing

them come here and they're

complaining about it and there's

nothing we can do. My healthy

vet is managed by the  VA

e21dd19e-4f21-470f-9227-eb6720bad25d-5

00:32:46.751 --> 00:32:48.340

R the VA medical centers.

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.863

You know, with that. So just

something if they can make that

1b7fd656-dfbd-4b5e-a029-d30eb23e7193-1

00:32:52.863 --> 00:32:54.140

a little easier on them.

c1493009-0210-4054-88f7-464fa715ebe7-0

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.777

You know, for that if they got

questions stuff because it

always says go to the regional

office, that's what we get from

everybody. The link always tells

them go to the regional office, go to the regional office, they can proof you and and it's not

necessarily proofing when it's

dealing with my healthy vet.

a28bcc65-f865-43de-9a4d-9791592fcdbf-0

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:15.250

You know, it's just it's there's

really no proofing for us at

a28bcc65-f865-43de-9a4d-9791592fcdbf-1

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:18.921

that point. It's them doing the

ID ME or one of the other two

a28bcc65-f865-43de-9a4d-9791592fcdbf-2

00:33:18.921 --> 00:33:22.770

options that they have to where

they can upgrade themselves to a

a28bcc65-f865-43de-9a4d-9791592fcdbf-3

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:23.540

higher level.

c155f1bf-924d-4e69-936c-6a411384f421-0

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:28.147

Right. So that information

telling them to come to regional

c155f1bf-924d-4e69-936c-6a411384f421-1

00:33:28.147 --> 00:33:32.166

office might have been true of

an old process that's no longer

c155f1bf-924d-4e69-936c-6a411384f421-2

00:33:32.166 --> 00:33:36.185

true anymore. And you know what?

the state is big. The city's huge.

c155f1bf-924d-4e69-936c-6a411384f421-3

00:33:36.185 --> 00:33:40.204

You know, we might have somebody

driving, you

c155f1bf-924d-4e69-936c-6a411384f421-4

00:33:40.204 --> 00:33:42.819

know, 2 1/2 hours to come here

for that.

ecc450f8-4b07-4d45-9f87-1a5304233e25-0

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.420

And they got to get walk

through.

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-0

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.120

Because we don't have a presence

out there all the time that they

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-1

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.540

can just go to for that, right.

You know, that's one of them

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-2

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:57.016

rural areas and we go ahead if

we got something on there that

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-3

00:33:57.016 --> 00:34:00.436

they can make a phone call so

that they know they would know

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-4

00:34:00.436 --> 00:34:04.024

that instead of coming in, they

get frustrated and they yell at

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-5

00:34:04.024 --> 00:34:07.331

us. Why? Why did I tell me to

come here? It where? Where a

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-6

00:34:07.331 --> 00:34:10.639

catch all you know the the

regional office for everything.

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-7

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.171

So man, it was good meeting you.

I'm glad you clarified. Now I

85d16cf8-1cdc-4c5e-a01b-2eb4a8df2dbe-8

00:34:14.171 --> 00:34:16.190

know what this really actually

was.

7ffa2f05-1a6f-402b-a6d7-173aefc99d4b-0

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:20.770

Yeah, I think I ran it on some

things that didn't need to be

7ffa2f05-1a6f-402b-a6d7-173aefc99d4b-1

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:22.100

because of that, but.

0667619d-3262-48d4-8658-fab19f5bc522-0

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:26.846

You know, it's it's all helpful

context for, you know, here's

0667619d-3262-48d4-8658-fab19f5bc522-1

00:34:26.846 --> 00:34:30.712

what a veteran is experiencing

that's causing frustration and

0667619d-3262-48d4-8658-fab19f5bc522-2

00:34:30.712 --> 00:34:33.955

it's good to have that

documented and to extent our

0667619d-3262-48d4-8658-fab19f5bc522-3

00:34:33.955 --> 00:34:37.822

product can fix it. I'll, I'll

do what I can and extend other

0667619d-3262-48d4-8658-fab19f5bc522-4

00:34:37.822 --> 00:34:41.626

people in the broaderva.gov

ecosystem. You know, I'll try to

0667619d-3262-48d4-8658-fab19f5bc522-5

00:34:41.626 --> 00:34:45.367

clue people in as well of hey,

you know how how can we make

0667619d-3262-48d4-8658-fab19f5bc522-6

00:34:45.367 --> 00:34:49.047

this easier so that it's better

integrated because there's

0667619d-3262-48d4-8658-fab19f5bc522-7

00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:52.289

there's definitely some

unnecessary friction there.

918e061b-9a89-4065-a0fb-af57894294ee-0

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:55.290

100 a 100%.

cea3a98f-fb30-4b81-8591-0d4a60736005-0

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:59.425

You know that. I mean, people

are trying, you know? Yeah,

cea3a98f-fb30-4b81-8591-0d4a60736005-1

00:34:59.425 --> 00:35:01.050

we've we've come a long way.

68a33f5e-7441-4d40-b66e-bf76c6b4e164-0

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.050

Yeah, come a long, long way.

72e03a2f-2f53-4fd9-8eb8-22e186917922-0

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.290

You know, with the other big

thing and is it all good? No.

72e03a2f-2f53-4fd9-8eb8-22e186917922-1

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.853

But you know, you take the good

with the bad, but the the end

72e03a2f-2f53-4fd9-8eb8-22e186917922-2

00:35:11.853 --> 00:35:15.530

thing that matters, you want to

get the claims done as quick as

72e03a2f-2f53-4fd9-8eb8-22e186917922-3

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.323

possible for these veterans. And

we want to make them not have to

72e03a2f-2f53-4fd9-8eb8-22e186917922-4

00:35:19.323 --> 00:35:22.885

go to 10 different places to get

the one thing done that they

72e03a2f-2f53-4fd9-8eb8-22e186917922-5

00:35:22.885 --> 00:35:26.333

need that need to happen because

there's a lot they they're

72e03a2f-2f53-4fd9-8eb8-22e186917922-6

00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:29.896

challenged, they're challenged

to get around canes, you know,

72e03a2f-2f53-4fd9-8eb8-22e186917922-7

00:35:29.896 --> 00:35:32.079
