00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.300

Dave Pickett: so to start out, Could you just tell me a little bit about what's your role at the a. What do you do?

7

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.480

P10: Okay. My position is an las legal administrative specialist.

8

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.660

P10: And basically

9

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.559

P10: I have

10

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.560

P10: me, myself and one co-worker still left in the Regional benefit office.

11

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.730

P10: So

12

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.760

P10: on days that i'm tell her working

13

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.770

P10: he's in the RO Office, and then vice versa. One days there that

14

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.500

P10: you know he's telework, and i'm in the Office so basically

15

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.859

P10: to sum it up, it's every other day.

16

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:09.650

P10: I'm going into the Office

17

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.829

P10: a tool called Vera V era.

18

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.470

P10: and we basically we. We tried it in the beginning to

19

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.750

P10: do the 30 min time slots. But

20

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:32.179

P10: we we have a problem because of traffic people coming in late. You'll have the 9 30. You'll show up late, and the 10 will show up early. So

21

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.220

P10: you wind up by the time it's all over You're going to wind up with anywhere from 2 to 3 people waiting to see and they all get testy. So basically we spread it out now to where thatit's you. You better serve each and every veteran if we we allow one our time slot.

25

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.859

P10: So, in other words, 8, 39, 30, 1030, 1130. Then we take a little pause

26

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.500

P10: and go. 1, 32, 30

27

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.079

P10: usually keep it down to about 6,

28

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.690

P10: and we're able to do. You know, any paperwork involved and basically anything that anybody comes in, and what's done we can. We can get done in that timeframe.

29

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.890

Dave Pickett: got it. And how long have you been in this role?

30

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:25.780

P10: I have been a basically public contact since 2,012 September, the end of September of 2,012.

32

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.010

P10: I got tired of working files as a. Vsr. In the Appeals management center.

33

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.089

P10: And you know, I actually wanted to come down and start. you know, working with people. And it just so happened everything just times, you know, perfect.

35

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.560

And the director at that time of the Amc.

36

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.939

P10: He went ahead and said, I've got the perfect job for you, he said over the weekend, he said.

37

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.269

P10: I saw your face, and do you want it? And I go? Yeah. And he says, okay.

38

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.370

P10: Then go upstairs and

39

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.239

P10: take everything on your desk, put it on a cart and go on down. I'll. I'll let the director at public contact know that

40

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.170

P10: you're his new employee, so that it

41

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.810

Dave Pickett: so. what's your favorite part of your job?

42

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.839

P10: Honestly, i'm telling you the the

43

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.180

P10: Probably my most favorite part of the job is being able to

44

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.440

P10: make a difference in people's lives.

45

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.680

P10: I know this sounds kind of simple, but

46

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.420

P10: the thing of it is I actually can see I can see my end results.

47

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.669

P10: if I help a veteran today, for example. Honestly, if I help a veteran today that say is homeless and get them up and off the street. I've had at least one or 2 come back actually one. I not only helped him.you know, get up off the streets. He was sleeping in his car. but I actually helped him in terms of of actually getting sober.

He had a real bad drinking problem on top of that. So not only was he sleeping in his car, but he was pretty intoxicated, sleeping in his car.

56

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.880

P10: So

57

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.569

P10: And he asked me, he said to me, said,

58

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.360

P10: how do you not drink? And I told him I said, Well.

59

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.790

P10: I said, there is nothing in this world that can happen to me today

60

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.460

P10: that a drug or an alcohol would make better in my life.

61

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.109

P10: He he just remembered that one sentence, and 3 years later he came back, and he

62

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.100

P10: said, I know you don't remember me.

63

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.010

P10: but i'm a Gs. 14 working for the government now.

64

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.329

P10: he said, i'm not homeless. I have a real nice place.

65

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.349

P10: and he says I have not had a drink since I talk with you.

66

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:53.719

P10: and he says that that one sentence that you said that there is nothing that a a drink or a drug will do to ever.

67

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.190

P10: you know. Make my life any better.

68

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.579

Dave Pickett: So

69

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.349

P10: you know. And I said, don't worry about.

70

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:10.590

P10: You can't ever have a drink again in your life because they're not going to quit making it, you know. And he says, yeah. Now I understand what you mean by that.

71

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.830

P10: I said. but there's gonna come a point where you do not care

72

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.740

P10: about all that. So

73

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.569

Dave Pickett: Well, that's really that's really powerful. Thank you for sharing that.

74

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.099

P10: Yes, and and and that's it really the money's not bad, I mean, you know i'm a Gs 10 step 4,

75

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.330

P10: but i'm telling you more so than anything else. There is a

76

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.550

P10: There's an intrinsic value that I can't, and you know I can't put on it

77

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.589

P10: that I leave every day feeling like

78

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.690

P10: you know, I've I've done something. I've done something worthwhile, actually making a difference in somebody's life.

79

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:56.470

P10: Sometimes I don't know which one it actually is. But either way there's an intrinsic value that I get from having this job.

80

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.740

Dave Pickett: No, that's great.

81

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:07.280

Dave Pickett: Well, let me tell you a little bit about my team and what we're doing just to give you some context for what? Why, i'm asking all these questions today.

82

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:24.810

Dave Pickett: okay. So the Va. Is currently working with 7 different regional benefit offices from around the country. as kind of our first group to design a new website that'll be then later rolled out to all the regional benefit offices across the country.

83

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:31.659

Dave Pickett: So your regional office was one of the ones that opted into this small for a group of like

84

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.780

Dave Pickett: first pass for our, you know, minimum viable website that we're gonna build

85

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:56.270

Dave Pickett: so you you all are kind of our our experts on the ground. telling us like this is what veterans need. this is what they do here to make sure we're building a website that really reflects that. So when they go online ahead of time they know what they can expect and all that kind of stuff.

86

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:57.540

P10: Gotcha.

87

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.290

Dave Pickett: that is so much.

88

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.189

Dave Pickett: Go ahead.

89

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.980

P10: No, that is needed. What

90

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.389

P10: you're saying you're trying to do. Oh, you don't. You can only imagine how much that is needed.

91

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:25.390

Dave Pickett: you know, just like you said, you know, at the end of the day the stuff you're doing has a real impact. It's one of the reasons, you know, I was drawn to this position as well. You know it's clear. The website that we're building is important, and we'll help people as

92

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:38.190

Dave Pickett: close to some things I've done with other jobs. So yeah, so just to confirm you said, you work at the benefit office correct.

93

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:46.820

P10: you know, benefit office, and we're our number is 372, but we're actually we're actually under Baltimore,  Okay, so there there are, I guess, what you'd call parent.

96

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.400

P10: You know that control everything on the building.

97

00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:06.109

Dave Pickett: and and in terms of is that more mostly like an administrative thing that you, as staff, have to understand? Or does that affect the veteran experience? And I think why the fact that you're connected to Baltimore.

98

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:16.819

P10: Not really, because i'll tell you the one of the the weirdest things about our offices. We don't keep files. We don't work files, you know, at our office.

 so we're not exactly, you know. : so you know. ultimately they're going to get assigned to an an office other.

105

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:44.199

P10: So. But we get a lot of people coming in. They'll They'll drive frombelieve it or not: to You know our office and say. we know if we come here. We're going to get everything done. So, you know.

108

00:08:52.240 --> 00:09:04.230

P10: I'm: like, okay, Here we ready.  That's that's quite a drive. That's that's about as far as you can drive right now. I've had people actually come from

109

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.260

P10: I'm from Mississippi. So i'm from Alabama.

110


00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.840

P10: Yes, Yes, yeah.

114

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:54.620

Dave Pickett: And so you said you obviously do some working from home telecommuting condition. Going to the office? Is that the only facility that you go physically work at? Or do you ever split your time at another benefit? Facility?

115

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:01.009

P10: Not any more. We haven't been going out on. I'll tell you one of the reasons, because there's only 2 of us.

116

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:10.000

P10: We can't really go out on what you know. Outreach. I used to myself. I used to go to the armed forces retirement home.

117

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:17.180

P10: And I really enjoy doing that. that usually was the first and third Thursday of of every month.

118

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.329

P10: and no! First and Third Tuesday. Excuse me.

119

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:28.310

P10: and then I had a homeless shelter over in southeast that I I went to on the first and third Thursdays of every month.

120

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:32.400

P10: But ever since Covid we stopped doing the outreach.

121

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:33.180

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

122

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:38.710

P10: So I don't know if that's gonna be a thing in the future that will do. But

123

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:39.760

P10: you know.

124

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.120

P10: I hope at some point we get back to that, because a lot of times those very ones, particularly at the homeless shelter.

125

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.519

P10: those those individuals there cannot.

126

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:59.589

P10: Actually they don't have the means, you know, to actually come to the regional office and take care of things where I can go there and take care of everything they need.

127

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:00.850

P10: So

128

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:11.279

Dave Pickett: now, thinking of the the physical building that the office is in is that a standalone building just for the regional offices, or is there a whole bunch of other

129

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.099

Dave Pickett: things going on in that building?

130

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:19.660

P10: Well, i'll tell you what we actually share the office with, You know, the 2 most hated

131

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:35.469

P10:  We're in the building with the Department of Treasury Irs, and we did have the amo that was the Amc. Originally Appeals Management Center.

132

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:41.600

P10: but now that, I think has changed the name of it now is oar, they've changed the name class

133

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.339

P10: office of administrative something or other.

134

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:51.260

P10: and they do the appeals mostly throughout the the You know nation.

135

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:57.189

P10: the ones that are from the Bba. They'll send them there on remans, and then it's up to them to go ahead and farm them out.

136

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:02.889

P10: Their director up there went ahead and told all the employees.

137

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.299

P10: So look we're. We're not coming back. So you don't tell the work here all now.

138

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:14.290

P10: so I don't know how many floors are right now at present are are tied up with.

139

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.489

P10: you know. in the event that they would have to come back.

140

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:21.830

P10: But I know the bulk of our building right now is

141

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:30.040

P10: Department of Treasury between Irs and okay, let's see. Mint Bureau of me has an office somewhere in there.

142

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.849

P10: and we have general offices like.

143

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.109

and

144

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.180

P10: you know, a couple of the V. So they're in on the second floor.

145

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.550

P10: and then, of course, you have the it office up on the second floor.

146

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.800

P10: So we share, you know, at least

147

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:50.430

P10: to floor 2. I think

148

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.230

P10: i'm not sure what 4 or 3 is anymore.

149

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:56.600

P10: 5 is still the

150

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.520

P10: but I think everything else is actually owned by the trends. We now

151

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.530

Dave Pickett: got it.

152

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:11.989

Dave Pickett: and then in terms of when a veteran walks in the building. Is it pretty easy for them to figure out where they're going or is, you know.

153

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:17.620

Dave Pickett: is their front desk that greet some? Are they following signs? How are they getting, you know, to the Public Contact

154

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:19.480

Dave Pickett: Office Specifically.

155

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:25.080

P10: generally, when they come in, you have the security which is very tight with

156

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:31.449

P10: you know us being the an Irs in the same building. So you know,

157

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:40.029

P10: they really are very tied about that so, and and you know they run you through, Make sure you're not carrying any weapons or anything. And

158

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:47.640

P10: then, what happens is now that everybody's different. I come down. I usually like that personal touch.

159

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:56.949

P10: I usually come down the guards call my cell phone and say, hey, Dave, you're You're 8 thirty's Here I come down, and I introduce myself to them shake their in.

160

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.720

P10: and you know, determine whether or not they can walk up 11 steps

161

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.119

P10: to the mezzanine, or, if if we need to.

162

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:08.190

P10: you know both up to the you know, messing on on the elevator.

163

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:11.759

P10: you know. Sometimes I get a few, or at least

164

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.359

P10: once request a week. I get some that.

165

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:23.459

P10: you know you know very good and well, you look at them. No, boy. Okay. They're not going to get that wheelchair up. Step so might as Well, so.

166

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.930

P10: but no, in answer to your question,

167

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.800

P10: I usually the guards. If they run through security.

168

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:33.290

P10: I I come down and actually scored them up

169

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.919

P10: to got it deal

170

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:42.909

Dave Pickett: and you mentioned that there can be a lot of traffic getting to the office. So in terms of getting to the building itself.

171

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:52.989

Dave Pickett: Is it easy to find or do? Veterans have trouble finding it, or parking, or what sort of like transportation issues might there be to to let them know about.

172

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.310

P10: Not really. I'll tell you. The biggest thing about the biggest problem I run into is

173

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.160

P10: we we're we're having a severe problem right now with

174

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:12.790

P10: in on this Vera. It's a very good. I I didn't like it at first, but now I love it. You know the the vera tool for scheduling performance.

175

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.340

P10: We really have a lot of people that actually they make a virtual appointment, and I don't think they realize it's either gonna be, you know most of the time it's on phone. We do it by phone. But you know you'll have They'll show up. They'll show up and tell the guards. I have a 10 o'clock appointment.

 and there got No, that is a virtual, ma'am, for, sir. You know what I mean. It's like.

179

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.750

P10: Yeah, I'm here for my appointment. And I said, yeah, but you you could have done that from your house, and here they've already paid parking.

181

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.379

P10: you know, that can be any work depending on how they negotiate

182

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:51.929

P10: 12 to $20 just to put their car in a garage.

183

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:56.989

P10: So that's the biggest problem I see we run into is

184

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.209

P10: people messing up, and

185

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.240

P10: you know, paying for parking.

186

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.319

and you have the traffic's bad. So they can actually

187

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.479

P10: believe it or not. You can schedule an eight-thirty appointment.

188

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.399

P10: and you have 2 extremes. You have the ones that

189

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:17.600

P10: they which normally would probably be about a 45 min drive up . But traffic

190

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.229

P10: an hour and a half or 2

191

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:24.160

P10: like myself. For example, It's 76 miles from

192

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.399

P10: from where I'm. Sitting right now to my desk

193

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.600

P10: So

194

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:45.240

P10: it just depends on how traffic is how long it takes me to get there. But that's what will happen. You'll have the other extreme. I've done this long enough now for 10 years that I pretty well got it down to a science, but you know, when you're telling somebody to show up at 8 30,

195

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:53.790

P10: and then they get on the road at like 5 30. Well, I need to get there early. So the next thing you know you, you got them showing up, and we're not even open. The cars are like

196

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:59.950

P10: this building up and up at 8, 25, so I mean, can you come back? And they're like, Well, what am I supposed to do, you know?

197

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:06.149

P10: Well, there's coffee shops, you know. Go grab some breakfast or something, rather, and you know.

198

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.650

P10: but so that that's what the other extreme is.

199

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:15.489

P10: They leave so early to make sure they get there that they get their 2 errors before their appointment.

200

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:20.249

P10: and then they're standard. They're normal, like like, what do I do?

201

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.649

Dave Pickett: Yep.

202

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:31.450

Dave Pickett: And so you mentioned the building doesn't open until age, 25. So what are the kind of standard hours that you know? Veterans can come into the office?

203

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.820

P10: Well, normal hours right now. We got it

204

00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:41.969

P10: 8, 30 for our office da V. And some of the V, so they will not see anybody before 9 o'clock.

205

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.349

P10: so

206

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:50.769

P10: and you know, I think, VR. E: I think they're on an appointment only basis.

207

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:57.969

P10: You know a lot of times what we actually do. I wish there was a way that they could actually

208

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.010

P10: filter off the vre from from the Vera opponents that we get, because

209

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.289

P10: On any given day at least one of my 6 appointments is really wanting to talk with the VR&E Counselor.

211

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.710

P10: and you know, because Vera is not a part of the re

212

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.260

P10: you got.

213

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:23.130

P10: I've got that situation where I have to send emails or or ping them on on

214

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.349

P10: that. You know I have a veteran that needs.

215

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:29.130

P10: You know you're all's help. So

216

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.059

P10: you know.

217

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:34.690

P10: So that's that. That is one problem that

218

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.939

P10: you know could be, you know, worked on as

219

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.650

P10: if they, if the R. And E could have their own

220

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.239

P10: either side of V or of of you know, Vera.

221

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.840

P10: or at least

222

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.990

P10: some mechanism where we can

223

00:18:48.180 --> 00:19:02.810

P10: shift those deployments right into a you know vre queue something like that right? Do you know it does? V. Or any have some tool that they use for appointments? Or are they just kind of manually scheduling the appointments they have.

224

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:08.110

P10: that I couldn't tell. I would have to assume that they do it manually, because.

225

00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:10.089

P10: you know, you know. Basically

226

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:13.750

P10: I'm. I'm making appointments, you know.

227

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.080

P10: but

228

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:21.630

P10: pretty much by the the day, you know, like, hey? I have somebody here. Well, Friday Friday was the perfect example.

229

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:25.020

P10: The let's see. It was the 9 30

230

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:29.040

P10: yeah, the 9 30 point I had on Friday this past Friday.

231

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:35.109

P10: that's what she was there for now. Luckily I I was the one that filed her original claim.

232

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:36.280

P10: So

233

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.490

P10: she was like, oh, yeah, I was hoping i'd get you. Yeah, you know.

234

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:48.770

P10: so. But she was there to actually talk with somebody in VR. And as to you know, payment issues and

235

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.720

P10: in her new program and everything. So

236

00:19:51.780 --> 00:20:00.930

P10: I said, Well take what let me do. Let me go ahead and get some people involved here. So I started my emails to the deck director up at.

237

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.399

P10: and then the assistant supervisor.

238

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.380

P10: and then I went ahead and also ping both on Ms teams

239

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.820

P10: and the assistant Supervisor came down. So I know. I'm taking a lot of their time.

240

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.300

P10: you know. Both of them had in the Red Dot home. So they were in meetings in Ms teams.

241

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.660

P10: so one had to come out of a meeting.

242

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:23.929

P10: you know pretty much to come down, and and you know

243

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.430

P10: I introduced her to the assistant supervisor, and

244

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:30.819

P10: you know, that takes time.

245

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.670

P10: So

246

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.700

P10: yeah.

247

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:47.489

Dave Pickett: Oh, go ahead. I was gonna say so. It seems like, you know, veterans don't necessarily understand the distinction. They just know that it's in that building. This is a way they can make an appointment.

248

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:54.340

Dave Pickett: but they don't realize Vera is not going to get them VR any specifically, and that

249

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.140

Dave Pickett: that seems like that's something that could be resolved.

250

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.129

P10: Yeah, yeah.

251

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.360

P10: i'll tell you something else. I don't know if you ever hear this from anybody else. But

252

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:10.039

P10: we're having a lot a lot of problems now with people I I know i'm guilty of it, too, is

253

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.870

P10: the Ds log in.

254

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.939

P10: and he benefits but I understand he benefits is migrated over to Va. Gov. Anyway.

255

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.160

P10: But you still have the old timers that come in there and go.

256

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.789

P10: I can't get into my E benefits account.

257

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:28.079

P10: and i'm like Well, I can't either. Yeah. Oh, well, they told us we had to come to the regional office to have our password reset.

260

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:40.520

P10: and

261

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:48.369

P10: the thing of it is is neither me or Greg my my co-worker, the 2 of us. Neither one of us

262

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:57.610

P10: can do that anymore. we have to call, you know, Eric Brown up in Baltimore, and he's the one that handles since we're under the same.

263

00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:59.200

P10: you know, actual

264

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.520

P10: regional office.

265

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:01.939

P10: you know, per site.

266

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:07.179

P10: you know. Hey, Eric, who got this guy here needs to have his password reset and everything like that.

267

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.139

P10: that actually is a problem. We have at least one person a week.

268

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.050

P10: you know, comes in, and that's the thing i'm locked out. I don't remember my password.

269

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.969

P10: and I don't know how you are. But

270

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:24.440

P10: half the time i'm lucky if I remember my username. So

271

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:30.779

P10: I really love the stuff like Vbms, where you know you. I use my tech card, you know.

272

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.510

P10: Gift card to sign in. You know

273

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.320

P10: much easier than trying to figure out what was my username for that, you know.

274

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:44.060

Dave Pickett: Yeah, no, I piped. Card it it's you have it, or you don't, and it's right there, so

275

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:48.330

Dave Pickett: you can't got nothing to forget, aside from remembering the card. So

276

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.510

P10: right right?

277

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:57.719

Dave Pickett: so you mentioned the office kind of opens at 8 30, When when would it close? When's kind of your last appointment over for the day.

278

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:04.650

P10: I try not to take anybody after 2 30, because, you know, I I make the 230 appointment a at 4 o 5. I have to be out front in order to get my Van Pool to go home. I got 1 one shot of getting home, because there's no Metro comes out to this place.

280

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.330

P10: So

281

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:21.940

P10: you know, i'm out in the Shenandoah Valley, which is Blue Ridge mountains.

282

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.310

P10: So

283

00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:29.299

P10: yeah, I schedule at 2 30, for a couple of reasons. First of all.

284

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:30.700

P10: you

285

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.190

P10: with traffic you

286

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.610

P10: invariably have people that will get there at 3.

287

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.470

P10: So yeah.

288

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:42.880

P10: and i'm still able to take them if they get there. 3. Not a problem. It's it's

289

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.810

P10: We just got to kind of turbo a little bit.

290

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:56.440

P10: But yeah, yeah, that's what I do. I figure if anything, they're going to be late and that way, if something else happens. I do. I know i'm guilty of this, you know I during the day, if I get an person that comes in that want something like a Dd. 214, or even a letter done.

293

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:12.620

P10: you know. Well, I'm here now, and I said, Did you pay for parking? Yeah.

: all right. Come on up: i'll I'll give them a letter, or give them a copy of their Dd. 214. It's not a big issue.

296

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.290

P10: You know what I mean because I hate them.

297

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.489

P10: You know they may have paid $20 just to find out they

298

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:29.470

P10: they can't get in the building because it's by appointment only to their place. Right?

299

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.760

Yeah.

300

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:38.020

Dave Pickett: So you do get some people who show up without an appointment, and if possible, you're able to, you know. Maybe set them in if you cut some time.

301

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.249

P10: Yeah, or if it's a small task.

302

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:48.529

P10: or you know a lot of times, I i'll, you know, if somebody really needs like, you know. For example, a widow definitely.

303

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:54.509

P10: if I if they're all booked up on on appointments where I can't schedule them in.

304

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.610

P10: i'll go ahead and take him at 1230,

305

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.770

P10: because that's normally falls within my lunch period.

306

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.530

P10: So i'll just go ahead and

307

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:06.179

P10: you know it doesn't really take all that long to eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. So

308

00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.780

P10: yeah, that's my yeah for today.

309

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.529

P10: So yeah, i'll. I'll work them in to where that

310

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.270

you know.

311

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.239

P10: on a on a case by case basis, you know. Right?

312

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:25.289

P10: Yeah. And then sometimes, like, say, i'll actually work people in, although they don't have an appointment, but I don't make that

313

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:34.060

P10: always a habit. The reason being is because the word travels here . Oh, it travels. You may think it's a big city, but

314

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:36.830

P10: it's like a big small town when it comes to.

315

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:42.229

P10: you know they'll They'll go to the Va Hospital to these different support groups like the

316

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.720

P10: Ptsd support group or prostate groups.

317

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:51.099

P10: Oh, yeah, if you go on the day's day's working. Yeah. So I wound up with.

318

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.840

P10: You know more people than I. You know I can handle, you know. So

319

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.070

P10: just selectively.

320

00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:04.419

Dave Pickett: Right? So you know you said officially, it's appointment, only you have about 6 appointment slots per day.

321

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:14.040

Dave Pickett: and then are you doing when on the days you're not in, are you doing virtual appointments? Are you doing a totally different job basically

322

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.740

P10: basically virtual appointments, and

323

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:22.670

P10: pretty much the same way I start them. I I have them staggered because sometimes

324

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:24.729

P10: my associate.

325

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:32.079

P10: I've gone through all the training for what they call super user for the Crm Udo roll out that they had

326

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.320

P10: so occasionally he will. He will go ahead and

327

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:42.070

P10: ping me and say, hey, look! Can you do me a letter? And I can actually print letters from my house here?

328

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.429

P10: They go to the you know printer in the back.

329

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.400

P10: you know, and he can go get the letters off of that. So

330

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:54.590

P10: I stagger the appointments like you'll have in today. for example, if if

331

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.249

P10: I was not on leave.

332

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:00.099

P10: he'd have an 8, 30 in person, I would have a 9 o'clock virtual

333

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.690

P10: for this very reason

334

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.030

P10: got it. Wait

335

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.819

P10: all throughout the day. Same number 6,

336

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:11.710

P10: and we usually wind up now. Lately it's been 6 either either way.

337

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.910

P10: 6 deployments

338

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.610

P10: either way, virtual or in person. It doesn't matter it it feels.

339

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.530

Dave Pickett: Yep.

340

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:35.019

Dave Pickett: and then thinking across, okay, in a week you've got what is that? 30 appointments? and then maybe there's a couple of people who try to walk in. What what a percentage would you say of in your week is maybe a couple of people getting in without an appointment.

341

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:41.650

P10: I'd say, I I average probably one every day.

342

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.490

P10: Yeah, at least, you know, there's early a day goes by.

343

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:53.290

P10: and another thing is, is, if I have let's say, if I have an 8, 30, or 9, 30, and 1030, no show

344

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.809

P10: during that 1030, you have, you know

345

00:27:56.990 --> 00:28:01.200

P10: Johnny Smith shows up downstairs at the Guards then, and says.

346

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.100

P10: You know

347

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:10.799

P10: I just need to, get a Dd. 214, or, you know, file a claim, you know. Supplemental claim. I've got a letter here.

348

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.149

P10: I know exactly what I need to do.

349

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:19.430

P10: and they'll call, and they'll say, hey, we got a guy down here. I come down and talk with him. Introduce myself to him.

350

00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.769

P10: and i'll say, you know. Okay, come on up.

351

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:23.320

P10: and then the guards are like.

352

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.339

P10: I don't believe Dave's taking him up there. You know

353

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.070

P10: my 1030 was no show, so

354

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:34.140

P10: they know I don't. I don't like sitting there not doing anything?

355

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.070

P10: Yeah.

356

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:39.149

Dave Pickett: especially if somebody's there and needs help right like that's

357

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.709

Dave Pickett: what you hear.

358

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:46.199

P10: Yeah, that's that's what I'm: I'm here for is to help the person that I can. So

359

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:52.049

P10: if if my 1030 doesn't show up, for example, and there's a veteran downstairs that needs help.

360

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.249

P10: he will become my 1030. So

361

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:02.369

Dave Pickett: obviously you know it's a case by case basis. But if somebody shows up without an appointment

362

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:07.369

Dave Pickett: how long might they be waiting. If if you could get amend to get a man

363

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.930

P10: maximum.

364

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:18.009

P10: I had a situation probably I would say a week and a half. What was it 2 weeks 2 weeks ago.

365

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.619

P10: it was a Tuesday and Thursday week

366

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:24.229

P10: the weed poorly, and I I think

367

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:27.310

P10: you know the G. Came in.

368

00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:32.859

P10: and he had made appointment in Vera, but it wasn't confirmed.

369

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.939

P10: So what happened was was

370

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:45.240

P10: I, he says, I have an appointment. I have it scheduled right here. And I said, yeah, it wasn't, confirmed. I said I, my 9 30 standing right here.

371

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.130

P10: so

372

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:52.659

P10: you know, and I've been helping my 930 appointment that day, Nelson, since probably 2,013.

373

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:59.670

P10: So you know he's he's all confused like, hey? I kind of important with you now, so I I told the boy I said, Look.

374

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.790

P10: unless it has my name at the top, where it says, you know you have an appointment with P10.

375

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.519

P10: I said, you really don't have a confirmed deployment. But I said, i'll tell you what

376

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.800

P10: you know.

377

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.690

P10: you know. If you're willing to wait around.

378

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.150

P10: i'll go ahead and take care of my 9 30 deployment.

379

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.419

P10: and then call you. Come down, get you, and and i'll work you in.

380

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:26.449

P10: and it turned out. It worked out good, and and one of the reasons is is.

381

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.749

P10: his mother has dementia.

382

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.789

P10: and she was trying to apply for a and attendance under the fire Fathers.

: she's already already drawing dependency and nimity. Compensation.

384

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:39.630

P10: Well. my father had an alzheimer's, so

 I had read all the notes. and I'm like sitting there i'm like.

 Come on up and he goes. Yeah, i'm glad you're seeing me.

 And I said, No, no, no, it's it's. So. We took care of everything, and

it was kind ofI don't know if

393

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.629

P10: you know. I don't want to paint myself as one there that picks and chooses, but

394

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:07.500

P10: it was dear to my heart. I said to him, You're not leaving out here until we get this handle.

395

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:10.450

P10: Yeah. So he says, Well, thank you. And

396

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:15.670

P10: I said for future reference. Wait until you see that confirm, or it has. You know you have it.

397

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.339

P10: Greg Gregory? A rod, or P10 at the top of the the point.

398

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:25.220

P10: And I said, that's a real appointment. Until that time you just you have an email.

399

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:29.960

P10: Yeah, email is not an appointment. Yeah.

400

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:31.930

P10: no.

401

00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:45.839

Dave Pickett: So obviously, you know, with it being primarily appointments, you know it's going to be pretty consistent, you know. You've got these slots. That's when people come in. But Are there any times? And you said they're You're pretty much booked.

402

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:53.729

Dave Pickett: but are there any times you notice that are a little bit busier, or there's a higher demand whether day of the week, or any time of day.

403

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.030

Dave Pickett: Anything like that.

404

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:59.630

P10: I would say, probably

405

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:07.189

P10: believe it or not. The it used to be used to when we were all in the office. Monday was always the busiest day. Monday was the day there that

406

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.499

P10: you just smack your head at the end of the day and say, oh, my God, i'm glad this day so. But

407

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:16.100

P10: you know that that used to be, because

408

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.490

P10: at one time.

409

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.710

P10: you know.

410

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.979

P10: I probably had almost

411

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.889

P10: most of the people that were waiting

412

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.819

P10: to get into the office when we weren't on appointment, only we're there to see me.

413

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.190

P10: Yeah. So.

414

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:37.489

P10: And it's not that I'm. You know a a mogul, or you know a guru.

415

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:38.850

P10: but it's just that

416

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.769

P10: I do one thing that my associate doesn't? Do I feel the paperwork out for the

417

00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.339

P10: the the veteran or the widow?

418

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:49.400

P10: You know I've I've found

419

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:50.850

P10: you know.

420

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:59.439

P10: from years past. It. I used to actually be in the car business for 10 and a half years, and I had. I had one real bright

421

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:00.990

P10: individual One day

422

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:04.959

P10: he says, what goes in this spot? I said. I'll just put your name in there.

423

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:10.260

P10: Well, that's exactly what he wrote your name.

424

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.829

P10: Okay, dude. I don't know. You know. let me let me school here on this.

425

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:22.720

P10: He didn't put your oh, I did put your name in there. I go. No, no, no, No, no! And who's on first.

426

00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:31.290

P10: So after that I learned, especially when I was a sales manager, I learned, you know, hey?

427

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:38.979

P10: Just feel their pay work out for them. You you'll know it's filled out right, and they're not sitting there, you know, coming up with.

428

00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:43.419

P10: and especially if they start putting in their conditions, you know, like

429

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.630

P10: I gotta hear it.

430

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.779

I hit her.

431

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:49.629

P10: and they'll put actually, if you let them do it. It hurts.

432

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.260

P10: and you know

433

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:57.039

P10: not migraine, headaches, 3 episodes a week, or whatever so.

434

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.620

P10: And I think that's actually do me

435

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:04.880

P10: to that. I have a lot of people come in.

436

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.949

P10: So yeah, that's that's one thing.

437

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:13.500

Dave Pickett: because word gets around, You know, this is the one that want it will get it done for you easy.

438

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:24.769

P10: Yeah, no, I'll fill it out for him if you go down there, particularly if they like some of them, particularly some of the older veterans here, i'm 68 years of age. So let me just say

439

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:27.060

P10: the older than me veterans.

440

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.979

P10: They'll come in, and they're like I don't know how to fill out forms. I hate feeling out forms and have arthritis in my hands. And I said that just relax, breathe deep

442

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:43.919

P10: so, and you know, fill it out for them. So they're appreciative of that.

443

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:51.150

P10: you know, plus I can fill it out in in way less time than them sitting there trying to figure out the form.

444

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:52.870

P10: So

445

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.290

P10: yes, very interesting.

446

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:06.709

Dave Pickett: So obviously, you know, people like the service you're providing. I think people. It sounds like they're coming in getting

447

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:13.569

Dave Pickett: There's stuff handled. But are there any you know, common frustrations or complaints that veterans have.

448

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.119

Dave Pickett: Obviously it's probably changed over time. But you know, in the current kind of era.

449

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.660

P10: I think the biggest thing, the biggest complaint everybody has is

450

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:29.380

P10: believe it or not. If I had to pick something. Yes, the Va. Gov.

451

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.699

P10: You know they they come in, and they say

452

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:40.120

P10: I tried doing my, you know password, and I couldn't get into va gov, and after 3 tries I think it locks you out.

:So then you have to come into a regional office. That's what they're told on at the National Call Center.

454

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:54.290

P10: you know. That happened to me, too. Is My sister used to be actually

455

00:35:54.460 --> 00:36:00.350

P10: higher, level human resources. She hard and fired top and middle-level managers at NASA

456

00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:01.620

P10: So

457

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:06.769

P10: it My My security question was actually, you know.

458

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.740

P10: Where did your sibling live?

459

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.299

P10: Well, I'm sitting there, i'm thinking, oh, my God, let's see. When did I do this? 

460

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:24.229

P10: Oh, wait a minute. Did she live in Lancaster, California, Wednesday? We're working at Travis Gr. And and my brother in law

461

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.020

P10: or did they live in Carl's bed.

462

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.520

P10: California?

463

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:39.029

P10: And then they left Carl's bed and went to Georgetown, Texas. So i'm gonna take a guess I think they lived in Lancaster, California. Bang! Wrong answer.

464

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:44.040

P10: So then I guess them tried Carl's death. California, and

465

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:49.359

P10: correct answer, Believe it or not at the time was brandy wine, Maryland. So you're

466

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.379

P10: they hadn't

467

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.109

P10: she hadn't even gone and taking the job out there. But it is

468

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:57.109

P10: it was one of 4 choices. So.

469

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:04.120

P10: And then what scares me is the you know the some of the questions, particularly with the id me.

470

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:05.609

P10: you you

471

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:12.349

P10: and i'm not the only one that does that the last time I did, an Id me so I could log into my V. A. Go account.

472

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.439

P10: It says

473

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:22.380

P10: you had a car alone in 1,987, and i'm like oh, my God! These people know where I had a car loan! Who it was

474

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:28.560

P10: and i'm trying to figure out. let me see, that must have been a honda accord. I bought.

475

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:36.099

P10: So yeah, yeah, so. But they get locked out, and that's the biggest source of frustration I see in veterans today is

476

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.169

P10: the

477

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.200

P10: getting

478

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:43.810

P10: Yeah. And then they have the when they try to do the Id Me.

479

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:45.000

P10: you have that

480

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:54.870

P10: thing where they're asking so many questions, and some of them i'm telling you some of them shouldn't even leave their house. If you ask me, you know what I mean. They they have like an ankle

481

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:58.240

P10: so.

482

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:03.439

P10: but they're They're like, I don't know any of those answers, and I go Well, You you picked them

483

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:16.839

P10: so. But yeah, they get frustrated about that. And then when they come there I have to pretty much rely on a different office to

484

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:20.419

P10: reset their their password, or, you know.

485

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.119

P10: get them logged in

486

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:31.119

Dave Pickett: and so that's something you are able to help people with. If they do get logged out or locked out, that you're able to help get their password reset.

487

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:38.600

P10: Yes, yes, I gotta go go through like that other regional office to help me with that. But it is something that can be done.

489

00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:41.470

Dave Pickett: Okay.

490

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.679

P10: I don't know if it's something that

491

00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:50.829

P10: couldn't inherently be done actually with a new program, and that's the reason I'm bringing that up to you also. This is right.

492

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.250

P10: Yes.

493

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.740

Dave Pickett: Well, yeah, and I mean the fact that

494

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:59.570

Dave Pickett: their Co. If somebody calls the National Call Center for that problem.

495

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:08.000

Dave Pickett: why are they then being routed to a physical office when that's theoretically something that could be handled over the phone at some level. Right?

496

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.589

P10: Yeah. Yeah.

497

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:11.879

Dave Pickett: Yep. Good to know

498

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:18.289

Dave Pickett: and for context. My team is responsible for the part of the website

499

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:23.820

Dave Pickett: that's before you log in, so just what you can see any information you can see without logging in

500

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:28.190

Dave Pickett: It's a whole other team that deals with the login and behind the stuff. So.

501

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:34.969

Dave Pickett: But to whatever ever extent we can make sure the information that you see before you even have to try to log in

502

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:41.690

Dave Pickett: gives you the best information. That's that's what i'll have power to to give you. My word on

503

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:43.330

Dave Pickett: it's fair enough.

504

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:53.609

Dave Pickett: and then, you know, thinking across all the different veterans who come in. How are how are they arriving? Our people driving? Are they taking public transit is like about 50 50.

505

00:39:55.100 --> 00:40:03.729

P10: Actually, it's probably, I would say about 50 50. We're blessed. Actually, we're on that, or it's a big glass building, 9 floors.

506

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:05.460

P10: and it's the only

507

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:12.460

P10: big glass building on the whole street. it's sandwiched in between Seventeenth and Eighteenth Street on our streets.

508

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.830

P10: and the

509

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:20.190

P10: you know you have believe it or not. You have an entrance to Farragut, West Metro station

510

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:26.609

P10: on both ends of the street. Pretty much. You just you have to go downstairs to get into it. But

511

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.429

P10: the thing of it is is equidistant. You figure at most 150 yards.

512

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:35.180

P10: I mean either way. So I tell him I said, doesn't matter which.

513

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:39.050

P10: you know Exeter entrance. You get off it or come on.

514

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:45.810

P10: You're You're still gonna end up coming up out of the the dungeon down below where Metro is.

515

00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:49.470

P10: and you know you. You'll either have to go across the street and

516

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:53.079

P10: to the left, and walk 150 yards, maybe.

517

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.599

P10: or you'll go across the street and

518

00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:00.669

P10: and maybe go to the right. So it just depends really, necessarily on you

519

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.600

P10: on, you know.

520

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.480

P10: which one you were equidistant in between.

521

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:09.509

P10: So that's one thing, and a lot of them choose to do that. Because.

522

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.130

P10: you know, I don't know if you're in a metro area or not. But

523

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:19.030

P10: basically. Sometimes, at least here the Metro is the way to go.

524

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.449

P10: Yeah, if you can go.

525

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.169

P10: you can go on the train

526

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.539

P10: skip. I went driving, because, you know.

527

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.480

P10: you never know when

528

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:36.189

P10: there, you know, the President may decide to leave the White House, and then they block off all the roads, and you're sitting there in traffic

529

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.969

P10: for 30 min, you know. So

530

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:44.830

P10: the the train still runs, whether he's up above or what. So

531

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:56.710

Dave Pickett: I live in Chicago. So back when Obama was president whenever he decided to come home. That's when we all get the extra traffic. So not not quite as frequently. Yeah.

532

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.830

P10: do you have a great loop?

533

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.519

Dave Pickett: Yeah, we got

534

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.900

P10: P Street.

535

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:12.000

Dave Pickett: So thinking about All the different things veterans can do that you help them with when they come in.

536

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:20.499

Dave Pickett: If you were to list out, you know what are, what are the things that people get help with there. What would be kind of your your list of services that are

537

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.439

Dave Pickett: available for for a veteran.

538

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.419

P10: I think.

539

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:27.630

P10: Probably filing new claims. You know, on the VA Form 21-526 EZ. That, and also in in general. The the major other form that I use is is 20 days. So 9, 9, 5 supplemental plane. I think honestly, I could probably print 20 copies of each of those and go go almost the whole week with either one of those or both depending on the the person.

P10: Sometimes you get a higher level review.

P10: The other form that you we fill out is a 21 dash 41 38

P10: you know. Statement in support of the claim.

551

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:14.189

P10: and what generally happens there is we get a lot of people that have debts, for example.

552

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.239

P10: and what I will do is i'll go ahead and fill out a 41, 38

553

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.819

P10: requesting. That they you know, provide the person

554

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.409

P10: you know, with a for example, a

555

00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:29.369

P10: a personal hearing before any adverse action.

556

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:30.759

P10: It's taken against them

557

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.050

P10: because they are.

558

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:37.379

P10: They are given that right under due process, you know, and I I just word it like that.

559

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:42.800

P10: I know probably sitting there saying, I thought he was going to retire. You know what I mean.

 He's still kicking and listen to what he's doing here. That I know. This is him.

561

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:51.270

P10: you know, is, but I I write it in a in a certain way, where it says.

562

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:56.620

P10: You know, I respectfully request the personal hearing before any adverse action

563

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.830

P10: it's taken against me or my claim.

564

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:00.189

P10: you know.

565

00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:03.969

P10: and you, you in advance always leave on a positive note.

566

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.529

P10: So

567

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:06.399

P10: The

568

00:44:06.530 --> 00:44:10.700

P10: big forms are the new claims 526 ez

569

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:15.530

P10: or the appeal supplemental claims the o 9, 9, 5,

570

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:19.890

P10: and then the 41, 38 to kind of adjust.

571

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:21.229

P10: you know what

572

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.939

P10: what

573

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:23.750

P10: we do.

574

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.529

P10: You know, like that.

575

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.690

P10: or if you just want to add more to your your claim there, because a lot of times

576

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:35.180

P10: you gotta get them on track, you know with that 41, 38 like

577

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:38.060

P10: I provided you copies with the

578

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:39.950

P10: you know, my doctor.

579

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:44.960

P10: you have all that information, please. Review. So

580

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:46.330

P10: Yeah, I you know

581

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:51.069

P10: I do that those are probably the 3 main forms, but

582

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:56.120

P10: sometimes it gets more. I mean, you know you have also like, I say, at least

583

00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:00.950

P10: once or twice a week I get a desk claim. I used to do all the death claims.

584

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:01.959

and

585

00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:04.660

P10: you know,

586

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:15.129

P10: the thing we do. And I actually did the claims and and went for outreach. When we did outreach they, the Marine Corps would call up and say.

587

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.839

P10: Can you send down

588

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:21.129

P10: so, and I always like to go into Quantico because

589

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:26.210

P10: the marines are organized. They really are they when they're on their desk claims.

590

00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:28.749

P10: Really, you know it goes off

591

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.279

P10: so. But I used to do the death claims for that

592

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.240

P10: and

593

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:38.289

P10: army for what? what is that for it? And

594

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.859

P10: for our for bail bar.

595

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.180

P10: That's another one I used to go to.

596

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:44.819

P10: So

597

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.020

P10: Hello.

598

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.430

P10: Navy! The navy always comes to you.

599

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:54.329

P10: They know this, you know. You're going to go to the maybe Yard and do a claim note.

600

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:56.379

P10: We're bringing them to you

601

00:45:56.980 --> 00:45:57.930

P10: so.

602

00:45:58.230 --> 00:45:59.840

P10: But they were organized just

603

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:06.179

P10: not as good as the Marine corps. The Marine Corps was best, and I was navy, too, so i'm not being partial. Okay.

604

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.370

P10: so, but no ring. Marine Corps always was the best at at doing desk claims

605

00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.770

P10: very impressive and just

606

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:17.110

P10: closely followed by the Navy

607

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.040

P10: army. I don't know they

608

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:26.010

P10: not as not, as I don't think they're as sharp as the other 2. Just my opinion.

609

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:30.899

P10: Yeah.

610

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:38.320

Dave Pickett: So when you say, you know, filing a new claim or a supplemental claim, is that all related to

611

00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:43.709

Dave Pickett: compensation. you would say right. That would be under disability. Compensation?

612

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:45.029

Yes.

613

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:46.770

P10: 4 Pm. Either one

614

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:48.709

Dave Pickett: so. And

615

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.359

Dave Pickett: when you talk about you know what veterans can do here

616

00:46:53.660 --> 00:47:00.619

Dave Pickett: that you specifically help with versus what they might be going to the building for, like you, said VR and E.

617

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.220

Dave Pickett: You know

618

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:11.460

Dave Pickett: You are mostly handling compensation and pension, as we would, you say. Are there other? And if they want education that's going to be our any

619

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:14.689

P10: dependency.

620

00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:20.510

P10: You know now that you really mention it. Dependency actually is a little bit of a problem. You.

621

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:24.030

P10: If if veterans could make it easier

622

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.239

P10: to let's say,

623

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.559

P10: like, okay, for example, add add a wife.

624

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.980

P10: or they had a tal. You get a newborn.

625

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:35.179

P10: you know.

626

00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:38.979

P10: There, I've always thought the easiest thing could be is if

627

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:47.409

P10: the I I know the pi, and it stands in the way of doing this. But if a veteran from their house could actually

628

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:50.899

P10: take a photograph of the birth certificate of their newborn.

629

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:57.979

P10: and then, just, you know, find a way to, you know, maybe the what do you call it?

630

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.959

P10: for for 674, if they're in school.

631

00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:05.870

P10: you know.

632

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.549

P10: or let's see what is it? The 6 46

633

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:10.219

P10: for the

634

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:11.890

P10: adding the dependent.

635

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:16.070

P10: I know the actual number on that, although I use it all the time, but

636

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:18.889

I think it would be easier if the

637

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:24.019

P10: if a veteran or a spouse, You know the surviving spouse.

638

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.890

P10: Good.

639

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:29.010

P10: Make changes just by like taking a picture of the birth certificate, and

640

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:32.330

P10: and you know, send it in that way

641

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:33.930

P10: versus having to.

642

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:40.509

P10: you know. Get in the car, particularly at worst case scenario car, $1220 parking.

643

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.219

P10: and then they give you the birth certificate. You fill out a form.

644

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.799

P10: and you know, add your, you know, child, or or you know, in some cases some of them

645

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.089

P10: remarry.

646

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.780

P10: you know hopefully. Not not right after, and most of the time you don't see them where they

647

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:02.340

P10: husband dies on a Monday, and they're remarried by Thursday. I I don't think I've seen that yet.

648

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.709

P10: So but, you know.

649

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:11.600

P10: in general they they should be able to to do a lot of things without having to actually

650

00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:12.960

P10: come in the office.

651

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.949

P10: and I think they're so trained on that. as far as I got to come in and hand you the birth certificate or the marriage certificate.: and there's so much duplication, you know we're

 You're filling out all those forms.

: you know a lot of, you know, in a lot of cases.

656

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:39.169

P10: I'm. One that I believe that if I don't put something on a form, you may say that page 7 was missing, so you

657

00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.850

P10: you'll have, for example.

658

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.350

P10: you know, 686, c. That's the form for a dependency.

you'll have, like 12 pages to that 14, if they need a in attendance

: for nursing home, or even in-house attendant.: Okay, but you'll have other pages where, if they only or they're adding a wife. Basically the first 2 or 3 pages is all you really should need, and then sign, I think it's page 12, 11, or 12. You have to sign one of them and date, stamp it, and then submit that. But

666

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:18.750

P10: in the interim

667

00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.130

P10: i'm. Drawing x's, and putting in slash a on

668

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.199

P10: 7 or 8 pages of that.

669

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.919

P10: and faxing that in, you know, to scan.

670

00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:28.209

P10: So

671

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.359

P10: if there was just an easier way to add a dependent.

672

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:32.899

P10: Yeah.

673

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:43.770

Dave Pickett: And so you're saying that if if they want to add a dependent, there's really no way to do that without coming into an office. That's not something they can do online currently.

674

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:51.760

P10: They could do. Va on va. Gov. They could do that. but problem is is once again going back to

675

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:56.290

P10: the age factor. Those that are in my age. Group

676

00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:00.959

P10: you know, out here in the valley, you know, windows as Wenders

677

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.929

P10: menders for dummies, is our favorite app out here, and believe me, trust me.

678

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:07.470

P10: you do not know

679

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:09.850

P10: how many people are sitting there, seeing

680

00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.319

P10: I I I don't know how it gets you an email.

681

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.360

Dave Pickett: Yeah, and i'm not.

682

00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:17.229

P10: Yeah. So I mean, you know.

683

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:20.949

P10: I mean sad. I I have 2 grandsons that

684

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:28.290

P10: I can give them my phone and they can program it for me, I mean, you know, and 5 and 7 resp., ages

685

00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:37.429

P10: so, or you know any of my kids. They're great, I mean, you know. Hey, I need this here Move away from your computer, Dad. You're on.

686

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:43.370

P10: Okay, You're good. What you do I took care of it for you. That's what I said.

687

00:51:43.710 --> 00:51:44.870

P10: Yeah.

688

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:47.370

P10: yeah, our age group.

689

00:51:48.310 --> 00:51:52.249

P10: You know a Rp: eligible people, 60 and above

690

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:57.530

P10: yeah, we're we're kind of behind the ball and stuff, you know, as far as

691

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:04.789

P10: and a lot of times they're They get it in their head that I got to come into the office to do this, because.

692

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:08.820

P10: you know, i'm going to give you my new marriage certificate from a new bride.

693

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:11.440

P10: and he's going to fill out one of them forums for me.

694

00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:12.640

P10: So.

695

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:15.939

P10: not knowing that the a gove could be

696

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:19.449

P10: very easy. But there has to be some sort of

697

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.509

P10: you know way that they can take a picture of it

698

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.669

P10: without violating any Pr.

699

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:29.179

Dave Pickett: So right

700

00:52:29.590 --> 00:52:31.330

Dave Pickett: and

701

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:34.210

Dave Pickett: thinking about the different

702

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:40.140

Dave Pickett: things people come in for. So you were talking about filing new claims, supplemental claim.

703

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:49.110

Dave Pickett: statement, and support of claims before we kind of got into the dependency. How would you rate some of those things in terms of what's like a

704

00:52:49.910 --> 00:53:01.349

Dave Pickett: high, super complicated form versus maybe a form that's a little bit easier. you know. obviously nothing here is simple. But, you know if you were trying to think about which ones are

705

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:06.439

Dave Pickett: might be possible for veterans to do easier on their own, whereas dependency, it seems like

706

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.780

Dave Pickett: it's too, a little over complicated

707

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:10.990

it.

708

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:14.610

P10: It's not so much that it's over complicated. It's just, I think, the

709

00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:21.389

P10: that 686, c. Form makes it over complicated, because then they want the pass.

710

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:25.590

P10: and I can see why I actually had one case about. Oh, about

711

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:27.899

P10: 4 years ago. I think it was

712

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:33.220

P10: where I found out why you have to put your previous marital history on there.

713

00:53:33.250 --> 00:53:37.540

P10: Because I had this one. I had this one lady that came in and followed it clean.

714

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.519

P10: And

715

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:57.989

P10: i'm sitting there just you know I don't. I don't think it's my responsibility to to tell somebody that I can't file a claim for him. So in other words, I'm going to go ahead and file a claim. We're going to stay friends and let the Va. You know. Sorry, ma'am, but you haven't been married, or with this veterans since. In this case.

716

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:01.770

P10: I said, when was the last time you live with this veteran that she goes.

717

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.859

P10: Oh, 1,954 was the last time I saw him.

718

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.699

P10: and i'm sitting there thinking, oh, God!

719

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:11.620

P10: So I said. Well.

720

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:13.189

P10: well, it turned out.

721

00:54:13.310 --> 00:54:17.660

P10: you know I ended up having to get o Ig involved in this one, because

722

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:22.750

P10: when total he had 8 wives after her.

723

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.390

P10: And

724

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:28.999

P10: so she's claiming that because Has a

725

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:31.439

P10: what is it? Common law status

726

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.999

P10: that he never divorced her? So she still married to him.

727

00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:39.270

P10: and i'm with with this man.

728

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:40.910

All right.

729

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:46.249

P10: I'm going to file this claim for you, and and we'll see where it goes. Yeah, but

730

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.130

P10: he he's not legally married to any of them.

731

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.950

P10: Well, finally O, it got involved with it.

732

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:53.790

P10: and they came down there, and

733

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:58.529

P10: after they came down, when she came back in to blast me and tell me

734

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:01.239

P10: i'm the valid wife I am it

735

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.809

P10: in the Ig. No. As a matter of fact.

736

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.050

P10: life Number 9

737

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:10.009

P10: has been with him since the eighties

738

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:15.139

P10: she paid for all the burial expenses, and

739

00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:18.099

P10: she is the deemed valid wife.

740

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:20.680

P10: So, in other words, the Va. Had to

741

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:25.479

P10: in in essence make a deemed valid, wise decision.

742

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:31.189

P10: and she goes so what is what do you mean? It says it's legally. He's still married to me, and

743

00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.610

P10: how are Jesus

744

00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:39.119

P10: sorry? But no! It was determined by the Va. And office of general counsel that

745

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.320

P10: Life Number 9

746

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:46.020

P10: has been with him, and has been his caregiver since 1,988,

747

00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:49.360

P10: and paid all his, you know expenses.

748

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.910

P10: and paid for the burial.

749

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:55.719

P10: So she is now the deemed valid wife, and you know.

750

00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.370

P10: good luck, man.

751

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:05.869

P10: So I kind of feel sorry for her. But in a way, it's like, you know that's that's just

752

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:09.740

P10: Oh, I haven't seen him since 1,954.

753

00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.700

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

754

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:16.920

Dave Pickett: it's all right. It's. A

755

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.550

P10: Yeah. I understand. After that I understood now I know clearly.

756

00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:22.740

P10: You know

757

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:27.169

P10: why that you do have to put the previous marital history, because

758

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.800

P10: there are going to be those.

759

00:56:29.010 --> 00:56:30.109

P10: If you don't

760

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:31.120

P10: put it.

761

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:35.539

P10: there's going to be those cases where it comes back to bite you. You know we're

762

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:39.449

P10: Whoa! He's not divorced from, you know. Laugh number 3.

763

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:41.229

P10: So

764

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:48.490

Dave Pickett: so we you talked about like some of the most common things you you see veterans coming in for

765

00:56:48.530 --> 00:57:02.780

Dave Pickett: what's maybe something that you see very rarely, maybe only once or twice in the time you've been working there like something that it is a benefit you can't help people with, but it's just not a a common thing. It's kind of a a rare situation. Maybe

766

00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:04.270

Dave Pickett: you think of anything.

767

00:57:04.780 --> 00:57:06.339

Dave Pickett: It's been like that.

768

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:10.390

P10: Well.

769

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:20.690

P10: this is gonna sound very odd, but I think I have a few, you know. I'm sure. If you live in Chicago, you've got the illustrious.

770

00:57:21.210 --> 00:57:23.619

P10: you know 10%.

771

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:28.770

P10: For example, I'll, i'll give you a perfect example.

772

00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:29.890

P10: you know

773

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:34.130

P10: I have this one veteran. I haven't seen her. I hope she's still alive.

774

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:40.929

P10: but it was before it was actually 2018 the last time she came into my office.

775

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:42.529

P10: But

776

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.279

P10: she.

777

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:50.029

P10: you know, came in, and I filed a claim for her back in. I think it was 2,013,

778

00:57:50.550 --> 00:57:55.629

P10: and okay. Then in 2,014 she came in and she wanted her status change.

779

00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:00.510

P10: Okay, and you know, i'm just i'm bringing up to speed on.

780

00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:07.660

P10: How bad it Scott! And this is something I don't see too often. But I do see. Can I go ahead and wait on them. And

781

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:13.620

P10: okay, and and actually wait on them like I'm in taking it serious. I'm not going to lie to you.

782

00:58:14.090 --> 00:58:16.899

P10: but she came in, and she says

783

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:22.969

P10: it shows in the system that I serve 6 years in the United States. Maybe I want that changed.

784

00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:26.869

P10: And I said, okay, what would you like? It changed to?

785

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:28.280

P10: And she goes.

786

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:30.939

P10: I served in the Islamic army.

787

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:32.740

P10: and I go. Oh, okay.

788

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:35.660

P10: and

789

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:41.579

P10: you want me to change that, and she goes. Yes, and I was under the tutelage of Genghis Khan.

790

00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:44.990

P10: and i'm like, okay. Now.

791

00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:48.709

P10: maybe i'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, you know, Dave. But

792

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:50.640

P10: I started thinking.

793

00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:56.839

P10: you know, didn't he kind of like die and like, let 1,000 or 1,100, maybe 1,200. Max.

794

00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:57.709

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

795

00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:59.270

P10: So I don't think she

796

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:01.710

P10: it was under the 2 legs of Genghis Khan.

797

00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:07.459

P10: Then she started calling me Ronald Reagan. She thinks i'm Ronald Reagan.

798

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:09.990

P10: So once a year.

799

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:13.059

P10: you know, there's 2,018 was the last time.

800

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.880

P10: and I got my little 41, 38, my favorite form

801

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:21.220

P10: out she came in and she poisoned.

802

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:25.129

P10: She wanted to confess that she poisoned 142 of her

803

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:27.520

P10: neighbors

804

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.589

P10: So

805

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:31.079

P10: I went ahead and

806

00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:35.460

P10: filled out a 41, 38 cutter to sign it and send it off to Roanoke

807

00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:41.529

P10: and you know. Then I have a friend that's a Police officers. I called.

808

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.520

P10: and I said,

809

00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:47.909

P10: hey! Just before I really go through with all this, you know she had just lived.

810

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:54.239

P10: I said the Have there been any mass poisonings. Lately, and

811

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:57.619

P10: I said like 142 of them

812

00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:59.870

P10: overnight.

813

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:07.239

P10: He goes No, but she's going to be at Farragut, West Park tomorrow at no time to have an appointment with Osama Bin Laden

814

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.009

P10: if you want to join her, Dave.

815

01:00:09.170 --> 01:00:11.479

P10: Oh, okay.

816

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.159

P10: all right. So you know I just.

817

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:19.200

P10: I very seldom do I get this, but I have at least 2 or 3 that are

818

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:23.289

P10: They're repeat, you know what I mean they're you know.

819

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:30.030

P10: where she comes in. I i'd hope she's actually still living, because I haven't seen her since 2,018,

820

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.909

P10: but that's when she can say us the last time

821

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.470

P10: and thank me, Ronnie. Thank you for

822

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:40.640

P10: filling out that form and getting. Let me get in that off my chest.

823

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.970

P10: And I said, No, you feel better when you confess to things like that. So

824

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.930

P10: all right, i'll see you next year.

825

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:52.339

P10: So every year is something different. But I haven't seen her. I haven't seen her since.

826

01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:54.590

P10: Covid is very well because of Governor.

827

01:00:55.210 --> 01:01:02.530

Dave Pickett: Yeah, so i'm gonna just rephrase what I heard there a little bit to make sure. So you're saying that

828

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:11.320

Dave Pickett: obviously the veteran population includes some people who, you know, have some mental health issues, and might not be going to

829

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:19.400

Dave Pickett: the the the Va Medical Center or a vet center for actual mental health. And so you kind of end up just

830

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.919

Dave Pickett: getting some of that, and doing what you can to

831

01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:34.619

Dave Pickett: to help them, you know, through, even if the form you're filling out isn't gonna necessarily. That's not really the reason they are right. That's just kind of a excuse for them to talk to somebody. Maybe

832

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:44.849

P10: pretty much like in this case. Here she's she was all for mid. So that's the reason she would confess both to Metro. Pd. Met, probably in Police.

833

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:54.949

P10: and then she came over and confess to me. So. Yeah, and i'm sure that if we, if I could ever figure out what her name is again, she's got to come back. She got to right, so

834

01:01:55.050 --> 01:02:04.050

P10: and i'll know her right up front because she'll say, i'm here to see Ronnie Reagan. Oh, i'll come down and get her all scored her up. yeah, I don't know.

835

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:10.379

P10: But I mean, yeah, yeah, we've got a couple of them. I don't see this too often. I You know

836

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:13.229

P10: I've got another veteran that

837

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:18.700

P10: even the guards are like tape. You gotta come down here and get him. Please take him upstairs, you know.

838

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:25.480

P10: I'm like, okay, yeah, he's saluting everybody. Yeah, he's saluting everybody. I said, yeah. Well.

839

01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:30.049

P10: he probably got Lord Salute in the trees:

840

01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:31.629

P10: So

841

01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:36.420

P10: But yeah, not not too often do I have this, but

842

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.040

P10: some of them they just

843

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.020

P10: they walk the streets.

844

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:42.779

P10: They don't want to live, you know.

845

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.319

P10: You can't get them to live in a home with shelter.

846

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.730

P10: right, you know.

847

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:50.419

P10: and i'm the homeless veteran coordinator. So some of them they just.

848

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:54.160

P10: you know. No, i'm not. You know people steal things from you and those

849

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:56.169

P10: you know, homeless shelters.

850

01:02:56.390 --> 01:03:02.679

P10: And I'm like, okay, Well, can I get you somewhere? You know, off the street? No, i'm happy right where i'm at.

851

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.269

P10: So

852

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.660

P10: so that part of it

853

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:12.759

so

854

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:17.209

Dave Pickett: well, we're we're coming up on the the

855

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:27.059

Dave Pickett: end of our scheduled time here. This has been a great conversation. Anything that's come up today that you want to add on that you think you know this is. If I could put one thing on the website.

856

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:35.560

Dave Pickett: You know people aren't going to always look at the website before they come in, but if they do like this is what what you'd want people to know before they come in.

857

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:46.709

P10: basically that we're still on appointment only basis on our, you know, because we do at least once or twice a week. You have veteran shows up and says, you know, if I, if I call the 1 800 number you all are not on appointment only basis.

860

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:57.669

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

861

01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:03.050

P10: So i'm like, okay, Well, let me see what I can do to to get this taken.

862

01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.349

P10: But

863

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:06.670

P10: you know, taken care of, but

864

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:10.310

P10: it somehow or other that Hasn't been addressed there

865

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.770

P10: so and then Secondly.

866

01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:15.099

P10: I don't know just

867

01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:29.839

P10: if if it could be more user friendly we're, you know. Maybe the person doesn't have to necessarily log in unless they're gonna take care of personal pi stuff, you know. Allow the 5 26 easy or

868

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.660

P10: 995 for supplemental claim.

869

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.569

P10: If they just want to add their wife or add a newborn.

870

01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:40.199

P10: if there's just, maybe just.

871

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:41.209

P10: you know.

872

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:48.089

P10: say a sidebar where they can click and then take a picture and upload it to that.

873

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:54.449

P10: It could. It could sure make their life a lot easier. And then actually, when would make the Va more effective?

874

01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.879

P10: So

875

01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:59.299

P10: But yeah, you know.

876

01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:09.500

P10: I hope I've been fairly honest with you, on, on, You know some things. I think that's the reason they picked me, because they know i'm not going to sugar Code anything.

877

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:21.969

Dave Pickett: Yeah, no, I appreciate that. and then in terms of you know, when somebody comes from an appointment, you know, they might need to bring photo. Id or another form anything that people might

878

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:28.779

Dave Pickett: be in the habit of forgetting that, you know we could make sure it's kind of clearly listed what they need to bring in

879

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.159

P10: that would help that would help to.

880

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:36.700

P10: I'm blessed! I've since I've been down, like I say.

881

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:44.899

P10: I've been pretty much in the public contact since 2,012, Greg actually believe it or not. Was there longer than me by a little mount?

882

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.979

P10: A wee bit.

883

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.540

P10: But,

884

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.490

P10: you know

885

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:50.639

P10: I know just

886

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:56.980

P10: almost everybody there that. you know, that comes in particularly if they ask for me, you know.

887

01:05:57.670 --> 01:06:02.510

P10: So the guards will ask me. They'll say, is it okay? Yeah.

888

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:05.670

P10: he's he's fine.

889

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:10.180

P10: so that's if they don't have any, Id I've lost everything.

890

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:14.060

P10: I gotta get one of my, the one that I told you about that salutes trees, and

891

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.919

P10: everything else that stands on the corner and yields.

892

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:19.480

P10: You know he

893

01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.740

P10: he's an unusual individual, but.

894

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:26.430

P10: generally speaking, it's always. He came in about 3 or 4 weeks ago.

895

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:27.259

P10: so

896

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:32.019

P10: I need to get another commissary letter, because so I can go on the base and shop.

897

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:38.859

P10: So he had No, Id with him in the guard says that was the one they called, and says, come down here and get it.

898

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:46.919

P10: So I took him up there and typed him up a commissary letter in, you know, year to go.

899

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:51.340

P10: which is really easy now I like that. Crm.

900

01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:57.100

P10: Oh, that is, that's about. I I heard that from a couple of other people that that has a lot of good information or

901

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.279

P10: easy, very easy.

902

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:02.700

Dave Pickett: great.

903

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:09.109

Dave Pickett: And people said, yeah, make the website like that. It's so easy. Everybody could figure it out. Then. Right

904

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:14.769

P10: that, honestly, if you make the website along the

905

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:18.990

P10: you know Crm Mudio program somewhat.

906

01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:20.109

P10: I think

907

01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:23.390

P10: you you have created the the gold standard.

908

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:25.610

P10: Yeah, I don't seriously, because

909

01:07:26.820 --> 01:07:29.660

P10: the C. Or a mud for letters

910

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:33.739

P10: I got locked out as soon as I took that second class. Was it second?

911

01:07:33.770 --> 01:07:38.250

P10: The first one was super user class. Now it was actually the first one.

912

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:42.969

P10: and then I couldn't do letters anymore through Letter Creator. Oh, 365.

913

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:46.920

P10: So I had to go actually in Crm studio. So

914

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.520

P10: now, all of a sudden. It's like.

915

01:07:48.810 --> 01:07:55.210

P10: Okay, Dave, you gotta learn something you're uncomfortable with, and we always are something very new like that.

916

01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.629

P10: So, but now that's the way to go. Somebody says they need a letter

917

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:03.109

P10: honestly under Crm.

918

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:04.739

P10: If it's a

919

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.549

P10: like income statement.

920

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:13.709

P10: you're looking at a minute and a half 2 min, Max. Just you know. Follow down click, click, click, main.

921

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:14.959

P10: Okay.

922

01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:18.200

P10: All right. I'll be right back in a second. Let me go. Get it off the printer.

923

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:20.659

P10: Would you like 3 copies? Sure. Okay.

924

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:29.110

P10: I mean. And and that's I think if you pattern anything after the crmudio, you

925

01:08:29.210 --> 01:08:33.969

P10: you will have done everybody that works for the Va. Including, you know, the

926

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.309

P10: and then everybody that comes to the Va. For help.

927

01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:40.729

P10: yeah, you would double standard.

928

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.900

Dave Pickett: Yeah, perfect. Well, I really appreciate that anything else you can think of that. you know

929

01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:50.530

Dave Pickett: you might have knowledge of that. we should be looking at that

930

01:08:50.649 --> 01:08:53.849

Dave Pickett: may never have heard of before, because we're coming from

931

01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:58.080

Dave Pickett: one angle, and the Va. Is a huge, you know, ocean of stuff.

932

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:06.059

P10: i'll tell you what one thing there. I know this is like a small thing. But

933

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:08.779

P10: the

934

01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:13.189

P10: National Cemetery Administration the Vh. A

935

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.099

P10: we're we're all one Va: but

936

01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:19.230

P10: in terms of programs for computers.

937

01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:27.890

P10: and I can understand a lot of it's a mythics thing. You know what I mean. You you you you don't want us to worry. We can go in and change.

938

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:32.309

P10: You know somebody else's say health records or what not.

939

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:36.240

P10: But if there were some sort of way of interfacing.

940

01:09:36.490 --> 01:09:38.729

P10: for like, for example.

P10: i'll give you a perfect example. you get people that go to the Va Medical Center.

942

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:48.720

P10: and they're 70%

943

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:51.559

P10: disabled service connected.

944

01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:53.189

P10: But then.

945

01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:56.109

P10: if you you know they they've

946

01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:59.560

P10: unemployable takes them up to 100%.

947

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:05.379

P10: So then the Va. The vendors health administration is telling you're not 100%.

948

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:13.839

P10: Well, when they come back to my office they're right. I mean, they are actually yeah, They're like

949

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.070

P10: Dave.

950

01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:31.840

P10: You told me I was a 100%. I got a letter. I got a letter from you now. It didn't come from me, but I mean they think it came from me. You know I got a letter. You're a 100% that i'm a 100. You told me I was 100% congratulated me. The hospital just told me i'm 70%.

951

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.270

P10: And i'm like, oh, boy, okay, all right. Well.

952

01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:37.709

P10: you know, we're kind of separate

953

01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:41.920

P10: because of an ethics reason actually more than anything else. But

954

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:46.099

P10: it would be nice if there could be some sort of interface. And there were.

955

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:53.309

P10: you know, without us being able to dive into somebody's complete medical records, You know

956

01:10:53.420 --> 01:11:01.369

P10: they're they're at least you know they can look and say, Well, this veteran actually is 100, but he's a 100% because he's unemployable.

957

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:04.789

P10: And he's unemployable because Big bing

958

01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:09.529

P10: that that would help them, and then would also help us it it would

959

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:10.950

P10: less than the

960

01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:14.979

P10: because I see them with their worst whenever they're like, You know you.

961

01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:19.300

P10: I kind of letter from you sent right from you. It says I'm, a 100%.

962

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:23.350

P10: So yeah.

963

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:25.949

Dave Pickett: So that kinda enter

964

01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:37.989

Dave Pickett: Departmental Va: Communication right? It's taking like one office has said this, but it takes time for it to get updated on the other side, and

965

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:43.110

Dave Pickett: you know it's not seamless. And so there's that frustration point for the veterans.

966

01:11:43.930 --> 01:11:49.980

P10: Yes, yes, you got it, and there's there there always. This seems to be a small divide

967

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:54.889

P10: between the National Cemetery administration and then the

968

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:59.159

P10: Veterans Health Administration, and then the veterans benefit administration.

969

01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:06.570

P10: And if there is just some way to bridge that gap without, you know, doing anything. Hip a violation.

970

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:08.929

P10: Yup. Or yeah.

971

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:13.059

P10: That probably would make things more seamless, you know.

972

01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:14.840

P10: in transactions.

973

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:21.880

Dave Pickett: Yeah, Well, that is a that is one of our big North stars we talk about is single source of truth

974

01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:30.620

Dave Pickett: for veterans, so that's definitely part of the effort. i'm. A small piece of is kind of trying to get information and

975

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.319

Dave Pickett: a consistent source, so that you know.

976

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:40.660

Dave Pickett: we have a single way of communicating between. So you know, my team previously built out the websites for the

977

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:43.519

Dave Pickett: the Vet center is the B Amc. So

978

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:59.490

Dave Pickett: this is our first time really interacting with the Vba as this whole other separate thing. But that's one of the reasons is we're gonna try to bring them all into Va. Gov: so at least where we can. We're starting to bring things into one place, single source of truth. So but

979

01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:04.689

Dave Pickett: I appreciate that that's it reminds us what we all still need to strive for.

980

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:09.429

P10: That's it. North Stars what it's called. Oh, that's cool.

981

01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.900

P10: Yeah, that's cool.

Dave Pickett: months. This is this is not a short term project, but this is this is my focus right now. So
