

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:49.559

Dave Pickett: Sorry So good um fun working at home Absolutely. I have a little dog who sometimes is nipping at my feet. So I know the uh the experience uh what's uh? Tell me a little bit. What's your your role at the Ba. What do you do?

7

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:56.230

P2: Um. I am what they call a legal administrative specialist, slash public contact representative whatever. Um, So what I do. Um,

9

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.699

P2: i'm kind of. I don't want to say hybrid, but kind of um I do the regular public contact stuff like interview people when they

10

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:29.969

P2: come in um interview them over the phones. Um, i'm sorry i'm fighting with this um. And then, of course, we and we do all kind of responses, whether it's to um the national call center the ofo

P2: um through ava we um answer Congressional inquiries. White House inquiries,

P2: um inquires from attorneys, and then, if there's any forms like Uh from Dmv or Social Security Administration. We do all those,

13

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.030

P2: and I think that's And then a portion of whatever the veterans need when they come in, so that could be a hundred different things.

14

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.479

P2: So I kind of do you know, some offices have um Congressional teams? We don't um,

16

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:19.330

P2: and since you're recording it, I might as well say that kind of sucks because um, it puts a lot of pressure on some of us. Um, anyway. But um! And of course we aren't the same pay grade. So yeah, they get two for one um,

17

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.780

P2: anyway. But yeah, so it it,

18

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.980

P2: you know. We don't want to talk on.

19

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:50.520

P2: So you were saying, You have kind of two different roles that you're serving. So one of them is that kind of veteran facing thing. And then this other piece is, you know, responding to maybe those Congressional inquiries or other things. So that's kind of the this. The two separate roles are kind of Well, the two separate roles. The the public contact rep does everything except the Congressionals and the White House inquiry. Everything else is kind of our role. Okay,

20

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.220

P2: yeah,

21

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.930

P2: sorry. Didn't mean to confuse it.

22

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:11.129

Dave Pickett: Uh, it's. It's all good information, you know. Uh often, you know, we hear about people who are juggling multiple roles, and it's always good to know what specific people balls, different people are juggling through as well as people. So um So how long have you been um in this role?

23

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:25.139

P2: Um, I've been in public contact since uh about five years now, around yeah, about the end of um, two thousand and seventeen. But I've been with the Va. Fifteen years.

24

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.339

Dave Pickett: Um! And what's your favorite part of your job

25

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.240

P2: meeting with the veterans in person? It's it's better than the phone I in. But I seem to be good at the paperwork. It aspect. But that's not what I like, as much as you know, helping somebody face to face.

27

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.490

Dave Pickett: Great

28

00:03:43.540 --> 00:04:13.119

Dave Pickett: um. So now i'm going to give you a little bit background uh where I'm coming from from this project, and we'll dive into more specific questions. So um you may or may not know, but the Va. Is currently working with seven regional benefit offices from around the country to design a new modernized website that will later be rolled out to every regional benefit office. So your regional office uh volunteered to be part of this kind of initial efforts. Um! So to make sure we're building the best possible web experience.

29

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.460

Dave Pickett: Um. So you're kind of like in the the first group to kind of give us feedback and direction.

30

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:39.590

Dave Pickett: Um, and then later it'll get rolled out to, you know, larger groups. So um we're speaking with public contact staff from these seven different locations to get a sense of the day to day reality of what veterans experience when they visit the benefit offices. Um! So that we can make sure the website is, you know, serving that and preparing them as as well as possible.

31

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:48.199

Dave Pickett: Um! So uh, first set of questions is specifically about the physical location benefit Office, where you work so.

32

00:04:48.210 --> 00:05:07.600

Dave Pickett: Um! Could you confirm what facility uh you work at?  And is that your kind of uh only facility? You work with, or are there any other facilities that you might visit on a part time basis? In a way? 

Nope. Just someone just Aro: 

Yeah. Great

33

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:26.200

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:33.240

Dave Pickett: Uh, would you say it's easy to get to. Are there any quirks that you know people might have trouble with uh arriving?

35

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:50.629

P2: Yes, only because our building does not face the street that it's on. And so it's a ways off the street, and so people try to come through our side door, which is like by receiving, you know, for our mail room. So it's It's yeah, it's kinda awkward.

37

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:10.640

P2: No, no. We have good parking right out in front. The bus drops people off right in front of both of our entrances. So yeah, I absolutely that's pretty good. 

sometimes  they get turned around because we're on the same campus as the um. The hospital, so they get kind of lost, even though we have a million signs you know, when it's somewhere you haven't been. You get confused

40

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.590

P2: um Monday through Friday, eight to four.

41

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:59.910

Dave Pickett: Um. And if, in your own words, if you were to describe this to a beneficiary, who's not familiar with? You know the ins and outs of the Va. What would you tell them about this office in particular?

42

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:15.889

P2: Cheese Them. Um. I I mean, are you okay? Because we're not talking about how to get there right we're talking about.

43

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:33.599

P2: I feel put on the spot. But okay, so as long as i'm not being graded. Um, well, of course. Um! When veterans come, you know, come into the office. Um! Whether they have an appointment or not. We're gonna see them um, but they can see a benefits. Um, you know what like

44

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:49.949

P2: we call them public contact, representative, or whatever um we can help them filing claims, checking status of the claim. We can answer questions about education, home loans, uh Vr. And I mean as much as we can. you know there's state, you know. Say, come in with a uh first notice of death. We help with burial plans, getting them in contact with the cemetery. If they wanted to go with the National Cemetery. Um. Also in the building. We have our veteran service officers. Uh, you know the different agencies VR&E team. We have loan guarantee in our bill, and we're lucky. We have that Not every you know. Or has that um trying to think?

Oh, they come in, and we do their their Dmv plate. I mean, you know the Dv plates um the passes for the Metro. Um, you know the toll tags things like that. Um, if they need a benefits letter.

P2: Um, We We also try to help them understand how to use the you know. Set up a va Gov site, so they don't have to keep coming in, you know. But some people don't like to come in. I mean, don't like to computers. Um.

50

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.669

P2: I think

51

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:07.040

P2: I know it doesn't seem like I've said enough, but that's kind of the yeah it's just. I know a e every day is different. So it's, you know.

52

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:13.939

Dave Pickett: Got it? Uh Now that's really helpful. Um. So you mentioned a little bit um that

53

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:32.960

Dave Pickett: people can get helped, whether they have an appointment or not. Um, you know, based on what you've seen your time there? What would you say? What's the percentage of people who come in with an appointment versus people who just walk in just kinda I'd say about eighty percent do not have an appointment. Um.

54

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:50.190

P2: But unfortunately, because just because of we've lost so many people um whether promotions, retirement whatever. Um, if they don't have an appointment, we might not be able to see them. So that's the that's the that's Our worst thing is, we just, you know we have to do it. We have to do so Sometimes we we do ask them to make an appointment for another day, or they try to help them at the front counter. Uh, you know, when they check them in.

 But yeah, it's, you know we don't like to turn people away. Um! And of course we're not going to turn away Anybody that's homeless, or uh somebody that's coming into reported Death, you know, has a money issue. They didn't get their chat. I mean those kind of things we're going to help them, anyway. 

They may have to wait a while, and sometimes, you know, if they don't mind, even even if it's not a um like an emergent case, if we can help them, we're gonna try and get them in, but they have to understand. It might be a couple of hours, because the people we also do the phone appointments. So we're doing phone appointments in between the walk-ins, and, like I was saying before, you know, if i'm working on a White House thing it's due at noon, i'm not going to take an appointment, you know. So we're kind of

00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:23.179

Dave: Immediate triage of Okay, who's come in? When might somebody have time to deal with this. And who else? We have? 

Yeah, that you guys at the front counter do an awesome job of handling a bulk of of stuff at the front. Um! And sometimes it's it's more of they actually need their service officer when they say they're coming in for us, so sometimes we can reroute them and get them in um, you know, with their vso or something.

 Um, but you know they think we we do everything. So we kind of have to make sure they really want us. And so the front desk. They're pretty good at that, so sometimes they can say, Oh, no, no! You let me walk you to the phones and show you how to call your your service officer. So they're really good up front.

66

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.609

Dave Pickett: So if somebody might not back who comes in doesn't necessarily need a public contact staff person. They might be the at that building for a Vso. Appointment and

67

00:11:51.620 --> 00:12:06.730

P2: not realize it. Yes, um. Sometimes they come to us. They think that we do the Ids uh like the the, you know, like the um they call them for the hospital. The veterans. Id cards, you know. Yeah,

68

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:25.340

Dave: is it the I have a piv card? But that's for staff. So that's different. 

Lisa Yeah, no, it's. It's it's an Id car, but they get it from the hospital, and so they they come to us, thinking it's ours, or they come and say, Hey, I need to get my hearing Aids. Well, we aren't the hospital. So you know, sometimes we get a you know people

69

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:43.589

P2: and we go. Okay, there's a little shuttle coming. We're gonna take you. Tell the shuttle you need to go, you know, and we tell her where to go so. And that's because you're on the same campus, and they just they They see. Va: And you know we're a smaller building compared to the hospital, you know,

70

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:56.290

Dave Pickett: less intimidating,

71

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:21.230

P2: typical. Wait times, you would say, or is it all just kind of over the place, you know. I i'm not really sure. Um, 

If they have an appointment, usually not even five minutes, that they're waiting. Uh once we get them Um! If and if it's ever busy the guys will usually let us know where we kind of stick our heads up and go. Hey? Does anybody have an appointment? And then we kind of pull them out the line, you know, If there is a line to kind of get some of the people out of there. Um! 

But I know that there's been times We've I've had people that have come back to me. It says i've been waiting two hours. I've been, have I've had them say they've been waiting an hour, i'm like, Oh, i'm sorry. What time was your appointment? Do we mess up? And they're like, No, I didn't have an appointment. I'm like, okay. Well, you know, when they come back and and say, i'm the only one back there. They could see why they had to wait. You know. I'm like i'm. I'm sorry i'm the only one here today, um, you know, and and usually they kind of calm down, you know

 I charm them. Yeah, but I mean, and we tell them that we go. Look, If you don't have an appointment, and you don't want to make an appointment. If you're gonna wait, you know Rick and Rj. The guys at the front, they'll tell them it could be an hour. It could be half hour. We don't know how long it's going to be, you know. So yeah,

75

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:24.030

Dave Pickett: um, And then, you know, uh, Are there any trends you notice about maybe busier days of the week or times of day, when you maybe get some of those longer Wait times, because everybody's coming at once.

76

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:43.710

P2: Mondays a lot of times. They're waiting for us, especially after long weekend, you know, or the Tuesday depending on how you know it was after holiday. Um and lunch. From about eleven till about two or so you we usually get slammed. So um! And then, of course, you have some people trying to sneak in right at, 4 you know. God bless them! We can only help them so much at that point. But you know um, we do have a couple of people who work late, and so they try to stay and help those. But but i'd say most of these lunch the is the busiest any given day.

78

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:12.439

Dave Pickett: Um! And then, aside from, you know, wait times any other kind of maybe common frustrations or uh things that veterans express about, you know, just showing up and trying to get something done

79

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:31.729

P2: we used to before Covid. We had a system where they checked in. We had, like a triage desk, and that way it kind of fended off some things. And so they complained that we don't have that anymore, because it would save them time, but we don't have the manpower anymore. So we don't have that. And we also had used to have where they would, you know, like old school, you know, pull a ticket, and the little number would come up, you know, like you're at Dmv. Or something. Um, And they did away with that, thinking we were only doing appointments when we first came back.: Um! So people sometimes in the lobby get mad. They go. Well, how do I know? He came in first. I came in next, and you know, if so, I again, if if it was all appointments, then we wouldn't have as much problem. 

But even though we were told that we're only appointments. Um, We were told we can't say that because of the and i'll put this delicately.: If the media hears that we're not helping veterans. That was how it was told. So it and i'm like I don't care to me it should either be all appointments or no appointments. It just. It's too hard for us juggling that and the phone appointments and

86

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:39.789

P2: or other duty. So it's It's kind of a So there's some inconsistency, and perhaps how it communicated and the actual experience.

87

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:53.170

P2: Yeah, yeah, and I need my job. But I have to say what you know. I I it's it's um. We had a lady that recently retired. They'd been there thirty plus years, and before we open she says, Well, I have some suggestions while y'all are doing the so. You know those kind of things. I mean somebody with thirty years in public contact. You think they know what they're doing.

89

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:12.809

P2: Um! They ignored what she said. And um, we'll just put it this way. They use somebody an intake specialist and um an outreach person, neither of who really do what we do. And then, months later, it's like, Oh, yeah, we should have done this. We're like, Well, yeah, and and see, I don't give it. I I

91

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.040

P2: I don't even give suggestions anymore, because they go. That's ridiculous. No, we're not doing that. And then five, six months later they They do it. They don't say, hey? Lisa came up with this. So I said, you know what I just let them fall in their face, and what happens happens, and I can only do what I can do. Um, I had to. I had to take a step back from it.

 You could only do what you could do so. Um. But yeah,

there's a lot of inconsistencies, and it depends on who the coaches who's working that day Who? You know, we've changed Service Center managers, Assistant Service Center managers, coaches, and everybody has a different way of doing something. And there's

 yeah, well, you know. And i'm sure you've heard it. You know, just like us, having no Congressional team, whereas other stations have a Congressional team,

it's every ro kind of makes their own rules. Um! So

99

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:46.220

P2: I don't. I don't know where I was going with that. But anyway, yeah, everything is kinda So you you really just don't know what you're walking into every day, and and not only you, but obviously veterans don't know they don't know right. 

Some Some days they might be able to be seen pretty quickly. Other days they might not. All depends on you know. Explain that when they come in and they go last week. Yeah, I was here. It was only you know I had to wait ten minutes, and you all took me right back, and why, you know, and it's and it's kind of hard. But I can't say Well, you know my last appointment ran a half hour late, and this and this, and i'm the only one. And last week we had three people. They don't care. They just want to know. Why am I waiting so long, and so we just have to be apologetic and do what we can, and you know. But even when they're cranky i'd still rather see him than talk on the phone.

104

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:42.709

Dave Pickett: Yeah, um. So you listed out um earlier a whole bunch of different services that veterans might come into. So i'm gonna repeat back to what I got from that Um, and um,

105

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:59.449

Dave Pickett: cause that was one of my questions was, What are the different services that this facility offers uh to to beneficiary. So I had education, home loans, V or any um burial plans. Um!

106

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:12.589

Dave Pickett: What else to be of um help setting up the A. Gov. Um site access loan guarantees uh disabled veteran plates uh passes for the Metro

107

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:21.720

Dave Pickett: um getting help with a benefits letter uh filing claims, checking status which are kind of broadly

108

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.460

Dave Pickett: different categories. Um,

109

00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:35.159

P2: did I miss anything that you? But I did um. And then the same thing for tech and appeal, status or filing an appeal, or any of that kind of stuff um

110

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:49.579

P2: us. Sometimes we have veterans that come in with their spouses and go. What's my, What's my wife going to get when I die, and I don't know how to where to classify that. I mean, I know It's a benefits question. I just

111

00:20:49.820 --> 00:21:09.479

Dave Pickett: you know we get that a lot. Um, which I think is a good idea to, you know, specifically like Um, what What are widow benefits versus right family benefits when your survivor benefits. Right? Yeah. Okay. Survivor benefits. That's good. No. I spoke to somebody else today who said that that was one of the largest.

112

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.690

Dave Pickett: The pieces of their work was actually speaking with with others and survivors. So

113

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:21.419

Dave Pickett: um yeah, good to know um. Any anything else you can think of off the top your head that you would put in a list of.

114

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.700

Dave Pickett: You know the types of things veterans can get done at this facility.

115

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.650

P2: Um,

116

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.440

P2: no. We used to have an audiology clinic. Um. But our doctor left Um! That was a good thing that we did have, and they've never replaced her um, and that kind of helped veterans that um just wanted to file a claim for hearing loss or whatever, and a lot of times we could get them in right away and get that done, and you know, get their claim moving, and say, Hey, We already got the exam done, you know, but we lost our doctor so um. She took a job, some uh at a different facility, and they never replaced her. 

120

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:11.989

P2: um well, they come. They come to us for appeals hearings. But that's not really. I mean, you know our appeals, hearings and um hearings, for you know, predetermination hearings like when we're proposing to reduce their benefits or something like that. Um, Not that that's something they would look for. But I mean, we do do that at our office. Yeah,

 Sometimes I think they're meeting with the judge, but we just go okay. But they'll say I have a hearing, and it's like, okay, and we figure out which one where they're going. And hopefully the people who run the hearing show up so that I don't have to run back there and cover them. I guess sometimes we do that, too.

125

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:55.600

Dave Pickett: Um!

126

00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:13.630

Dave Pickett: So thinking about, uh again, you've been at the da for a while, so you might have a understanding of some of the broader ecosystem different benefit offices, and what might be available here versus other places, or any of those services kind of unique at this facility that you know.

127

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:24.289

P2: Uh you mentioned. Maybe the loan guarantee was one that you have that's not everywhere. Right? Um, i'm thinking I think we all do about the same. Um,

128

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:40.509

P2: and we don't, you know it's not like when they come to public contact. We're not. We can't advise them. If it, you know we can't approve their loan stuff, but we take the paperwork form, whereas if they go, you know, say they live in New Orleans or something. Um,

129

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:58.730

P2: they can fill out paperwork, but it's going to take a longer for that, you know, for it to get processed because they don't have that you know you're handing off to another person. They come down every day and get and grab their mail, and they're responding within days. So yeah, we kind of have a

130

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:07.159

P2: on a leg up. You take the ones where you can get them right.

131

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:22.110

Dave Pickett: Um! And then kind of the opposite, you know. Maybe any other benefit offices that you might have to refer somebody to for something they're looking for help with around the benefit. Um that you can't do specifically at your office or give them the full.

132

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:39.930

P2: Yeah, I I would well, not sending them to another office, but giving them the number uh sometimes, like BVA stuff. We we only can access a certain amount. Um like they have the new um, the new system, and I cannot remember what it's called. But um

 Case Flow. I think it's what it is and that

 I can I can't. I can't see documents, I can't see. I can basically say, okay, this is where \at, but I can't see why it's stuck in this position, whereas in the old system I would I had access to all kind of stuff, and it wouldn't necessarily be all the documents. But it had more information. So we're kinda stuck. So I have to refer a lot of times I have to say, Hey, you're gonna have to call and and speak to somebody at the BVA, because I can only get to here, you know.

135

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:26.329

P2: And so that kind of sucks,

136

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:43.879

P2: and sometimes our Vr. Need people can help them depending on what they're. You know where they're qualified at um. But but sometimes when they come in and go. Okay, I use so much on this one. And I, you know I need to know. Can I move it to this? How much time do I have left? Well, then, we're kinda like No, you need to call education, so

137

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.269

P2: you know I can only do so much now.

138

00:25:47.400 --> 00:26:04.269

P2: I'm not. I I have called before I've called the insurance people before. If I if I can, I try to get it while they're in there and let them. You know we put them on, Speaker, and let them talk if we can. Um! It's not always feasible, but

139

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:09.069

P2: um, so sometimes I feel a little handicap that I I can't do as much.

140

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:17.369

P2: But no matter how much training I have, i'm not that trained on that, and I think that would actually require more than

141

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:39.800

P2: I would have time to do, anyway. So you know, I I mean, let's be real. I mean, I think they have kind of a plateful now. Yeah, but you you feel like you're you're able to at least um pass them on to a person who could could help. Yes, and and at least give them, You know, a baseline, you know. Kind of say, okay here I I mean, I have to say on the

142

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:40.780

P2: on our

 I don't know if they still call it the bass website. But the knowledge, portal, or whatever I don't know if you all guys do that, too. But let me tell you. That is the best thing ever, and I use that for everything. The fact sheets. I am always looking up stuff on there, and there's so many times that,

144

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:15.990

P2: you know, and I know it's meant for the call center, but it's it helps me when i'm talking to someone that I can look up. You know. Sometimes it's just hey, Let me see. Okay, uh, whatever. And a lot of it I use is for the burial stuff the burial the survivors benefits,

145

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:23.630

P2: even though I always think I know it seems like they always come up with something. I don't know um, but to me that's that's like I don't. I don't know who ever made that. But it was like the best thing to me that makes my job a lot easier.

147

00:27:41.370 --> 00:28:01.350

Dave Pickett: It's basically where it you go to like when something's slightly outside of the realm of your knowledge, you can kind of get the details. Um, yeah, you're just one person, and you need that that kind of.

148

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:12.179

P2: But I have some stubborn coworkers. Sometimes they don't like change, and i'm all about change. So like um. You know we use the um.

149

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.009

P2: Gosh! I know i'm looking right at it. What is the name of this thing? Um!

150

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:24.930

P2: Sorry about Mouse? Oh, great! Now my mouse is not working. Either you do the unified service desk or whatever

151

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:41.800

P2: I like when i'm doing that, because if I click on a certain point, you know, I could get to something it says, Okay, acts the veteran. This. You've completed all these steps. Okay, you want to do something else and you go to something else, and it'll tell you, Hey, this is what you need. This is what this is for,

152

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:56.729

P2: and I I know It's hard because we're bouncing back and forth between that in Vbms and checking them in. And Vera and you know we're we. We might be in the Knowledge Portal. So it is a lot to have, you know, several things going,

153

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:03.399

P2: but to me it's easier because it tells me this is my next step. This is my next step, and if I just follow it.

154

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.099

P2: I'm not saying There's not,

155

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:11.819

P2: You know things that are gonna happen, you know. Yes, there's gonna be weird things, but you can deal with that later. You know it. It

156

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:31.309

P2: kind of I I need step by step, when I don't know everything. I'm doing so. It makes it seem like I know what i'm doing. So you know anything to make my job easier.

157

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.660

P2: Right? Exactly.

158

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:50.280

Dave Pickett: Um. That's great. Um. So now that huge list of services i'm gonna pick one at a time and kind of go through some questions about it. Just so, uh, I make sure we have a deeper understanding of it and understand anything that you know

159

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:59.639

Dave Pickett: might need again to be on the website of what a veteran could or couldn't do um kind of related to that um. But actually, before that um

160

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.989

Dave Pickett: switching up my order here real quick

161

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:19.979

Dave Pickett: um thinking broadly again about you know all the veterans you've seen in your maybe you said five years in this role. Kind of right? Um! What are what are maybe like the top three things that you're seeing most frequently that veterans uh, or beneficiaries need support with,

162

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:25.570

Dave Pickett: as from the public contact team, like you had to say, these are the top three things I deal with. The most often

163

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:30.510

P2: um survivors benefits. The big is a is a big one.

and which makes sense, because if they're not a veteran, they don't have that they have any good exposed to us, so they we need more hands on time with them. Um,

168

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:58.480

p2: um either missing payments or any kind of payment issues like if there was a debt from the hospital, or whatever which that's always fine. There's a debt from the hospital, but it comes up. There. Compensation checks. So guess who gets the you know. Explain things. Um. So anything with payment issues is a big thing. Um!

 And then I think the third would be just coming in with questions on how to file a ben. You know how to file a claim, or, you know, slash status to claim anything claim related, even if it's

171

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:37.500

P2: we’ve been getting a lot of PACT act questions lately. Of course you know. Um, but do I qualify for this? When are they going to raid it, you know, but that's kind of like a big umbrella of claim. So it's kind of hard to say when it's just all claims Okay, that that's super helpful.

172

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:47.020

Dave Pickett: Um. So now i'm gonna go back to that list. I wrote out of all the different services.

173

00:31:47.030 --> 00:32:04.339

Dave Pickett: Let's start with um home loan and then loan guarantee. I don't know that's the same thing. I'm. Sorry. Yeah, no, that's that's totally guarantees the proper name or um regional loan center they might call it. Yeah, sorry. I'm using all kind of terms.

174

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:23.330

Dave Pickett: No, it's helpful, because uh, having a multiplicity of terms helps us make sure if a veteran has one name for that. We've got that listed for it as well. So um! You know What are some of the specific tasks of veteran might come in for with the home loan process overall,

175

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:26.899

P2: the only thing I've ever had on come in for is, I need a certificate of eligibility. That's it. That's that's all I ever asked for, and it might be something like I had one five years ago. Is it still good kind of question? But mostly it's I need to file for certificate of eligibility, which,

if they are working with a lender, they would do it for them, and it will be quicker actually, butbsometimes they want it in their hands. So you know, and that's fine,right. And prior to Covid, the uh homeown people would come down and do it right away.

184

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.769

P2: Um! Now that most of them are still at home, and they're not.

185

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:21.640

P2: They don't answer to. You know the regional office, so they none of them are really in the building except for maybe one a day. Um! So they don't do that. So we tell them. Oh, they'll email it to you in a couple of days, or you know here's their number. You can give them a call kind of thing, so they don't have that instant like they used to, but they still get it a lot more quickly than they would if you know they were in another state or something.

188

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:50.270

Dave Pickett: Um, and then, you know, thinking about that, You mentioned that actually, if they were working with a lender, the lender would go through that process.

189

00:33:50.280 --> 00:34:10.630

P2: Um! Are there other ways. They could get that certificate other than physically coming in, you know. Can they do all that themselves online?

190

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:27.389

Dave Pickett: I always have to look sorry. No, it's okay again, Like you, I don't expect you to know all the details of everything, what you've seen. Um! And then, you know, thinking about that task, You know why people might come in to do it versus doing it another way. You know. What's your kind of

191

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:47.380

P2: gauge on? Why, they're coming in to do it versus Is it because it's complicated, or just because they they feel like they'll get it done faster this way? Why? Why did they come in person? Some of them think they're still gonna get it the same day. Um, you know they're not used to. Not that, you know not having the right, You know the

192

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:54.329

P2: response right away. Um! And I think some of just don't know that they can do that. Um, they know they need it,

193

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:59.530

P2: but they don't know how to get it. So yeah, and so it's, and it's pretty painless. It's like one page filled out, and you know we stamp it. And you know, Prior. I mean during Covid we would email them to uh, you know the loan people, but since they have somebody who comes in now, they come and get them themselves. 

Thank God, that was another task. At least we got rid of that one.

196

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:33.750

Dave Pickett: Um! And then, uh, you know, thinking about, You know your office is open uh, but eight to four Monday to Friday. Is there any that specific home loan, any time that that

197

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:48.260

Dave Pickett: would they be unable to do that Seems like not since again it's not actually related to the home one people being there, you'd be able to help them with that piece.

198

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:56.419

Dave Pickett: They have to just wait. Unfortunately.

199

00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:21.919

P2: Um! So again is this A. Are there multiple steps in this process? Is this a one and done kind of thing like home loans. What are? Maybe the tasks veterans might have around Db: 

There's and there's not much for them. Um! If they have the form or we'll give them the form um, and they fill out. You know their information, their car whatever. And basically um. The State has made it pretty easy for us. We just check off.

They're fifty percent or more, or they're less than fifty percent kind of thing, and we stamp it. We sign a Service Center managers signature on it, and then they have to take it back to get their plates in it. But it's for us. It's kind of an easy thing. Um! Sometimes they'll want their like a benefits letter to show their percentage to go with it. Um!  And this is kinda, you know, just like just like va offices. DMV’s are different, depending on where they are. Some want the letter. Some will send it back to get the letter, so we kinda almost do the letter, anyway, while they're there, so we save them the trip so like. Oh, I don't need this. 

203

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:20.029

P2: Our The tax tax letters for their um. I just thought about that. Um, because if they're you know, one hundred they get. They don't have to pay um property tax. So that's a and and then it's It's um

P2: It's reduced, you know, depending what percentage they I can't like. Kind of prorated, or what I don't know. But yeah, you know, like so based on their rating of disability that my outback, their property tax rate as well, but I know the hundred percent is zero. So that's always a big, you know.

206


00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:57.470

Dave Pickett: Um. So uh, okay, Dv: plates um. They're coming in because they need a form that then they're going to take to the Dmv. And the benefits letter

208

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:07.090

Dave Pickett: uh same question as before. Could they do that in another way. Could they do that online, or is this form something they need to come in person to kind of get?

209

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:29.620

P2: We've had them during Covid. They would send like, you know, they would send them through the system, or we call them, and they'd say, Yeah, i'm gonna upload it. And my V. A. Gov. Account. We would pull it. We would sign it digitally, you know. We'd have a digital signature, whatever um, and we would send it back to them. Um! So they don't have to.

 But there's like there's nothing that I know of like in a system that says, Hey, can I do that? You know they want to do this. It's a State thing. It's not a Federal thing, so i'm not sure. 

Um. But we we've been doing them a lot on Vera calls, you know the hey? I got this? Do I have to really have to come in? No, once I verify who they are, and you know, check everything. I'll send it to them. I'll just email them. So yeah, But they still have to talk to us to get it. The you know what I mean. You they come in or they're calling us, or whatever. Yeah,

213

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:30.150

Dave Pickett: yeah, that makes sense. Uh: I talked to somebody from California, I think, who also was doing that in California. So it's not every State but some states um. And then you know how complicated is the Dd. Plate form in the whole range of complicated or non complicated

214

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:35.920

P2: you in and out in a couple of minutes. It's it's nothing. Yeah,

215

00:39:36.660 --> 00:40:06.000

Dave Pickett: So that was um. I'm just looking at time. We've still got another twenty minutes here just checking You're still good on time. I'm gonna keep on going through these services. You know. This is a lot of what we want to make sure we have. Right on the website is what they could do, what they might need to bring something in for um. So you know, thinking on the home loan and the Tv, just is there anything that a veteran might need to bring in with them Um! If they're coming in for that appointment.

216

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:17.550

P2: Um! Like they might need to do some pre-work, or that is that just kind of a a show, I think just I mean they. You know, in both for the the the Dmv. They could download the form, and

217

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:25.219

P2: uh this, this the certificate of occupancy that that uh application that could download it and fill it out before they came in. But

218

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:38.530

P2: they they're both relatively their one page. They're pretty easy, so either way. It's not going to take them a long time. If they didn't do that, I mean, there's I mean other than bringing their ids, and there's not a lot they need to bring in now.

219

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:44.750

P2: Um! So let's switch gears to talk about um aerial benefits.

220

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:53.319

Dave Pickett: Um, so um obviously uh population. We're talking about with burial benefits is slightly different, because

221

00:40:53.340 --> 00:41:12.419

Dave Pickett: somebody's being buried. So they're not the one finding the benefit. So um thinking about. You know. What What is it uh kind of Again, the typical experience of somebody who's trying to get burial benefits. Um! What are the tasks they might need to accomplish? Is this a multiple visit. Are there multiple forms? What?

222

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:31.560

P2: Yes, um we If they come in, and a lot of times they literally will walk from the hospital to us and say, my husband just died, I mean, you know, in that that's that's hard. Um! 

So we can get. We give them the forms for the burial, but but for burial they're going to need a desk certificate, you know. Things like that. Um, so they but they have two years to file for burial benefits. So that's not something they have to do right away,

224

00:41:48.440 --> 00:42:00.100

P2: and so always tell us that. Okay, let's let's just, you know, and we go through everything, and I explained about, you know, if they were getting benefits or not, we have to cover like month to death. Um! Things like that. Um,

 they will need this hopefully. The veteran social or claim number, you know their Id um that kind of stuff. But you know that's just filing, for you know, to notify us, and then to file for either um survivors pension, or what they call the dependency and indemnity compensation,

P2: which you know two different benefits. But, um, it it just depends on. If the veteran service connected, if you know what kind of service he had. If you you know income, there's a whole bunch of different things. But basically I try to explain. When they come in i'll do as much as I can for. But if it's, if when they come in, and they're just over all. I'll go, you know. We can do this another time. You can take this home. 

Um, I also try and suggest they meet with a service officer and say, Look, you know, let them help you do this. So you're not because I I can't enter their claim form online where a service officer can do that, You know. Um, there's different things that you know. We aren't allowed to do like I can't fill out their form like, especially if it's something with um survivors pension, and that's partially based on income.

Well, if I write that they get have a hundred thousand in the bank as opposed to ten thousand. You know I can't do that because they don't want us messing with people's money, you know, making a mistake. So. Um, it's kind of a sticky situation. Um, but we try to help them as much as we can. Hopefully, they and I hate to say hopefully. They've come in like after I had to say. You know things to kind of settle down a little bit.

235

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:50.119

P2: Um, it's easier to explain things, but whenever they come in I go. I go to my fact sheets from A.

 I know how much portal and I print out. I print out the one, you know there's one for like, okay about the flag. There's one about um, you know the the D. I see the dependency and indemnity compensation. There's one for um the pension so that I go through it. So when there's uh they're sitting in front of me, they go. 

Well, my husband said you were gonna take care of me. And then I look. And he was only service connected for hearing loss, and he's been at ten percent forever, you know, so he's not He's not a hundred. He didn't die at the hospital. He didn't dive a service connected condition. There's a whole lot of things, and i'm and I go through. I go. Okay, Well, let's see, and I and so that, and I give them a copy, and then I have a copy. So let's go through this, and then it kinda go step by step, and they go. Oh, and then they realize i'm not going to get this one. It's like, Okay, that's okay. Let's try the other one. 

Okay, Now let's look at the pension. Okay, did he, you know, Did he have wartime service? Okay, And he's honor. But you know, and I go through the same things, and we go through. But that one's gonna require income stuff. That's not something they're probably gonna have with them, so I make sure I give them. You know the the forms they need for the income, the show, you know, and I go through a set. See here, and this is where you're gonna. 

If you have this, you know I over the forms with them, but we don't necessarily fill them out then, so they may have to come back, or they may take me up and say, Yeah, we'll go see a service officer to help me, you know. Do this, or I may have my daughter help me. Can I bring her back? Yeah, sure, you know. Um, It just depends on what it is. If it's A. D. I see you know the like. Okay, he's been a hundred. You've been married fifty years.

You know it doesn't matter if he's been if he's been a hundred percent doesn't matter where he dies from, so we can. That's going to be an easier form, and they don't have to fill out so much so we can get that done right away. So I don't.

243

00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:58.809

P2: I don't know where I was going with that, but but you you know Um! It's a great answer. Oh, thank you, and but we will have to, You know. We always tell them we're going to need a copy of the death certificate, and um we do have, especially during Covid. They were saying, Well, I got one, but it says Covid,

244

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:09.339

P2: and then you look, and it doesn't show any like secondary issues, or you know what's contributing factors. And then you look, and you see he had well, he service connected for Co. Pd. You know, but he wasn't a hundred. So we're like, okay. So we've We've had to do a lot of learning how to. Okay, let's You might want to go back to the coroner, and I hate to say it, or get your doctor to write something, or you know, should just say that it was second or so. We've had a lot of that to say, I mean, I always tell him if you have the desk, if you get, bring it, but you know, but they might not. They might the best certificate updated before you get them the benefits that they just

249

00:46:45.700 --> 00:47:02.740

P2: hopefully, since this Covid has gone away, you know. But so sometimes we we we say, Well, you need to get that. So it shows, you know you don't want it to show Covid. You want it to. So even if it shows Covid, we needed to show. Co. Pd. You know, contributed to that, or whatever: I mean. It's kind of hard to like, Put that on a website. Yeah, make sure you bring, you know. So yeah, just if you had the desk to get, bring it that kind of thing, but I don't know what else she could.

251

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:27.120

Dave Pickett: You know It's kind of hard to know what you're gonna need, so you're in there full with everything you know. Well, i'm gonna make a statement just to see if I'm accurately conveying what I heard and what you were saying. It sounds like if somebody's coming in

252

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:37.309

Dave Pickett: um for burial benefits. They're not just coming in for burial benefits. They're coming in because they just had a massive life change which could have impacts on

253

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:59.930

Dave Pickett: five different types of benefits they may have been receiving, that they may expect to receive. And so often, if somebody's coming in, you're they're talking about all of that. It's not like you're specifically starting with burial. It might be later down the line. I might.

254

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:03.890

P2: You know he didn't have a spouse or something. Then yeah, it's probably just burial. Um. And and what sometimes people don't understand that a veteran can be cremated and not buried, and still receive benefits. So you know that's people go. No, but it's not, and i'm like it's on the form, I promise you. You know I read it. Um, you know people think they're not going to get it. So we, you know, have to make sure they understand. Yes, that is something that can be covered, you know.

 But yeah, So I mean yes, we'll say burial benefits, and a lot of times they'll say, i'm coming in. My husband just died, you know, and and they may. They may say it's burial benefits. But then they tell me, Oh, yeah, we already worked everything out with the cemetery. Okay? Well, then, how can I help you, you know, and then it gets into everything else, you know. Sometimes they they say, Well, my husband was a veteran, but you know we have a private we already buried, and we did this, but I wanted to get a flag. They didn't get a flag, and it's it's, you know, part of burial benefits, I guess, in a way I don't in my head. It's something separate, but they're not talking about money. They just want the flag, you know. So it's there's always something.

260

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:23.829

Dave Pickett: Um. So little while ago I asked you kind of top three things that you know you're seeing frequently. Survivor benefits with kind of one. Then you talk about anything with payment.

261

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:34.090

Dave Pickett: So uh I know that's a that's a pretty broad category. But i'm just curious. What are some of the the things that come up um in terms of

262

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:58.510

P2: things that we might be able to help on from a website like status, Is there? Is it people need a status of their payment. Or, yeah, it's more of Where is my money? Um, and it's not, and it's not. Usually the people that have just gotten, you know, approved for a claim, you know, or something. It's usually um. They were overdrawn at the bank.

264

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:17.699

P2: It could be. They get a paper check, and they never received it. It could be. They have a debt at the hospital, and we recouped it. It could be. We recouped some money because they had separation pay for the military, or they have retirement pay.

265

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:32.939

P2: So it's It's kind of I didn't get my check, or I didn't, you know. Get all my money, or you know It's it's usually tied around. Where's my money? You know that's kind of the the big thing I need. My money. Yeah,

266

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:37.529

Dave Pickett: um. And then uh the other thing you talked about was just kind of

267

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:54.339

Dave Pickett: what do I qualify for? How do I kind of even and get benefits or side of that broad eligibility. Um! Any sort of trends you can point out again. I know every situation is different. You deal with a thousand different cases all the time. But any sort of things I should know, and trying to, you know, build the best website to support veterans before they come in if they check the website which they aren't necessarily going to do,

269

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:12.440

P2: you know, if it's if it's something like, well, what can I get? Um,

270

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:23.460

P2: I I if it if it's on the phone, and I don't see him always say, Well, we need a copy of your Dd. Two hundred and fourteen, or you know I need your discharge papers. I need something to, you know. So if they could bring in what they have, because sometimes it's it will, and I'll especially with older vets. We may have them under a claim number, and they're calling with a social security number, and you pull the social security number up, and it wasn't put in.

272

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:58.669

P2: And so you're trying to find where this, because well, I've been getting money for fifty years, and i'm like what. And you're looking, you know. So sometimes it's like, Give me your service number, or if they have this, you know, anyway um to me. Dd. Four, d two hundred and fourteen is always a good thing. Um,

273

00:51:58.810 --> 00:52:09.499

P2: to make sure it's.

274

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.720

P2: It's kind of like, Okay, Um. But

275

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:15.319

P2: you know,

276

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:27.139

P2: after Harvey I could understand, because, you know, we had Hurricane Harvey, and a lot of people lost all their stuff so me too. Um so. But um,

277

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:33.529

P2: but I I mean to me the Dd. Two hundred and fourteen and a and a picture Id and I know it sounds kind of silly. But

278

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:52.700

P2: yeah, we've had a lot of them come in and they don't bring, an Id they go. Oh, it's in my car. I'm like, okay. Can you go get it? Well road to shuttle here from the hospital, and you know, and i'm like. And then you you know you. They're like, Well, Can't you just ask me questions? Yeah, I can. But you know what I mean. It's that

279

00:52:52.920 --> 00:53:11.109

P2: I always feel weird when it's. You know one of those. Um. But yeah, if they would just bring their Id and their Dd. To fourteen. That that's a good jumping point for any, no matter what they need, We We, you know, I mean. And if they're in the system. Yeah, we don't need their two fourteen usually, but

280

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:16.010

I always say it's It's just easier, because then I can say, Oh, okay, Well,

281

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:25.120

P2: well, Let's see you. Were I you for two hundred and ninety days, you know I mean I I a while for two hundred, ninety days. It's kind of a

282

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:33.829

P2: an issue, you know, with getting benefits. So you know that's going to tell me right there. You know where we need to go so

283

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:36.769

Dave Pickett: great. Um! Well

284

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:51.069

Dave Pickett: got just a few minutes left here. Um, no, this is this is all this. This is super helpful, Um, you know. Uh i'm, you know new to this space, so really appreciate all your expertise and insight.

285

00:53:51.080 --> 00:54:05.020

Dave Pickett: Um, you know you were mentioning that um a couple of things that I you mentioned. I want to follow up on one was the service officers. Uh, because i'm not super familiar with that. I've heard a little bit about it, and then the other was um

286

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:22.339

Dave Pickett: you mentioned with, uh, I think it was the unified service desk or bas where you would go and actually print out some of the things from that to give to somebody. Um, Just curious like um is obviously that information is kind of

287

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:28.350

Dave Pickett: something that you have access to that veterans. Normally, Don't. But are there any things that you feel like?

288

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:39.550

Dave Pickett: Some of the stuff should be publicly available? Because it explains the steps better than other materials, or any.

289

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:57.499

P2: If um the stuff that we print there, there are our fact sheets, or if Faq's whatever they but if no, I think they're actually called fact sheets. Um, but they're they're those are on our on our knowledge portal our, you know our bass. Um!

290

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:11.579

P2: Oh, sorry cats trying to hit the screen. Um! And those those are um, especially especially the me, like I said. The ones I use, the biggest or the the the survivors benefits, because

291

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:28.549

P2: it's just easy to go step by step, by step, by step. I mean there's other ones on there. And to tell you what they are, it's probably I don't use them, because it's probably stuff. I know. Um. I'd say i'd go in. But if you ever, if you need follow up questions, I can send you the information.

292

00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:47.309

P2: Say, it's on here. I'm sorry. I didn't prepare. Very well. We didn't know that that was going to be something we needed to know. Yeah, and I mean, I mean to me, because whoever has written these, the ones I have used are awesome, and I think if you know for a veteran, or

293

00:55:47.320 --> 00:56:02.490

P2: you know a family member. It's it's just easy to follow um. I know they did some, I I believe. You know. Bunch came out for um with the packed act, and there's some that are, you know, geared for veterans. So I mean, I think you would. I am so sorry

294

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:08.240

P2: it's not like she never gets attention. Um,

295

00:56:09.310 --> 00:56:16.450

P2: i'm sorry, but anyway um, I I think, though you know those would be helpful if they were, you know, more

296

00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:18.830

P2: readily available. Sorry

297

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:39.670

Dave Pickett: um. And then speaking briefly about, uh, briefly about Uh service officers just uh assume I know nothing about service offers. That's basically true. What? What what is kind of the role they play, and you know the benefits process.

298

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:42.560

P2: I can advocate to a point for a veteran, but they're really going to advocate like they know. Okay, this is the Va language they want you to use. You know this is how they want you to say something I can't say, Hey, let me look and see how you know what the rating is going to say. So They kind of steer them, hey? No, this would be better if you filed a supplemental claim as opposed to higher Level review claim, like I can't say that.

300

00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:16.319

P2: And so I always tell them. Look, they're free. So you know why not use them. And secondly, they're They're there to look out for you. So if you know, you say, hey, something doesn't look right with my client. They can kinda check it out, or they're kind of like a second set of eyes where they can say, Hey, you know you've been. This has been six months and it hasn't moved, you know. They kinda can keep it tabs on things for them, you know, so I always say it's better to have somebody kind of watching the Va. So it's, I mean, and that's what it is. It's you're having somebody else who has access in your account and can say, Hey, Wait a minute, you know, and can kinda maybe get things moving for you, you know.

303

00:57:49.670 --> 00:58:09.419

Dave Pickett: Um service officer. Obviously, you don't get one by default. Um, and there's a variety of different veteran service organizations that they could get a service officer through correct, or

304

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:29.200

P2: you know the service officers and the you know, private attorneys and stuff um, but like in our in our building we have the State Veterans Commission, and then we have the disabled American veterans. We have uh wounded Warrior project American veterans, paralyzed veterans of America. American Legion,

307

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:37.779

P2: I think that's it. But I know those like on our like, which I think, is really good. If, when a veteran goes to like the  listed like you know, visitors or whatever, and it's listed, you know which service or you know. So it's veteran service organizations, and they can click it and see each one with the phone number. So it's. That's one thing. I say, I don't know who does that, but that's a good one, too.

310

00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:27.550

Dave Pickett: Yeah, Um. And if you have anything else you think of that, you think would be helpful. Um, you can always email me afterwards. But um uh, really appreciate all the time you gave us today.
