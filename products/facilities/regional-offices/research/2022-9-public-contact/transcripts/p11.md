00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.309

Dave Pickett: All right. So start out could you tell me what's your role at the Va.

6

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.050

P11: I'm: a public contact Representative.

7

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.209

Dave Pickett: Okay.

8

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.160

Dave Pickett: And how long have you been in that position

9

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.640

P11: 2 years?

10

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.839

Dave Pickett: 2 years?

11

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.170

P11: Yes, sir.

12

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.680

Dave Pickett: And what's your favorite part of your job?

13

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.730

P11: the

14

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.030

P11: success.

15

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.929

P11: The ability to change lives on a daily, you know to see the veteran when they get their decision, and

16

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.459

they're, you know.

17

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.710

P11: Happy?

18

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.810

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

19

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:11.270

Dave Pickett: So to give you a little context about my team. so the Va. Is currently working with 7 different regional benefit offices from around the country. so this is going to be our test group to design a new modernized website that'll later get rolled out to regional benefit offices all around the country. So your local regional office volunteered to be a part of that effort. So we're

21

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.800

Dave Pickett: making sure we're You know, learning from the ground what

22

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.580

Dave Pickett: what the website needs.

23

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.249

Dave Pickett: so we're speaking with people like you from these 7 different kind of Mvp. Sites to get a sense of the day to day reality at these different locations

24

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.029

Dave Pickett: That will make sense.

25

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.179

Dave Pickett: so could you confirm what facility do you work at?

26

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.450

P11: Or the regional office.

27

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.809

Dave Pickett: Okay? And now do you work there full time, or is there any other facility that you ever split your time at?

28

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.870

P11: I do. I split I I work one day a week at the VA Hospital.

31

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.210

Dave Pickett: Okay?

32

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.740

Dave Pickett: And then the others would just be at the RO.

33

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.190

P11: Yes, sir.

34

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.179

Dave Pickett: Okay, so thinking about

35

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.300

Dave Pickett: the

36

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:18.790

Dave Pickett: regional benefit office? is that facility a standalone building? That's just for the regional office, or does it share space with other types of offices.

37

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.289

P11: Oh, no, this is the Federal building, and we share the entire building.

38

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.459

Dave Pickett: Got it. is it easy for veterans and beneficiaries to find, or there any quirks about

39

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.279

Dave Pickett: finding the building or the office.

40

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.700

P11: the biggest complaint would probably be the parking.

41

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.920

because it's downtown and 

Parking is expensive or hard to find or both.

Well, one of 2 things they don't know that it that we have a free parking, and when they do it's like a block away.

45

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.450

P11: So about the walk

46

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.850

Dave Pickett: got it.

47

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.390

P11: and it's not the safest of neighborhoods, either. So

48

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.739

P11: is what it is.

49

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.740

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

50

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:16.769

Dave Pickett: Once they get inside the building, is it is there? Are they greeted. Did they go through security? Is it pretty easy to get them routed to the right place anything confusing inside.

51

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.959

P11: Now they go through security as soon as they come through the door. So they're: they, they, you know. That's a little hiccup for most of them. They they, you know they all understand. It's a Federal building, and they have to go through security, but they're not ever happy about it?

53

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.410

Dave Pickett: and what are the offices sorry the hours that the office is open for for veterans?

54

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.610

P11: Okay. So to see veterans, we're open at 9 am. Till 2 30.

55

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.590

Dave Pickett: Okay.

56

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:55.170

Dave Pickett: and then If you were to describe this office to somebody who's a beneficiary, maybe kind of just

57

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.509

Dave Pickett: new to the Va. And trying to get the lay of the land. How would you describe what they can do at this office? Specifically.

58

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.520

P11: I I always say it's the disability office.

59

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.809

P11: Okay, we're coming to file for disability. disability, or or pension to make make any type of necessary adjustments to their their compensation like adding and removing dependencies. There are a few other services that we offer, like

62

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.999

paperwork for certificate of eligibility for a home loan.

63

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.919

P11: and

64

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.570

there's a variety of different

65

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.890

P11: services that we offer to.

66

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:44.889

Dave Pickett: But the the main thing that most people want it is the Disability Penstream Compensation. That's what most people are going to resonate with.

67

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.230

Yes, sir.

68

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.719

Dave Pickett: Okay, and then

69

00:04:50.480 --> 00:05:03.579

Dave Pickett: you know kind of across the you know the time you've been there thinking about how many people make appointments in advance versus just kind of walk in day of to get served. How would you break that down? Maybe a percentage?

70

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.080

P11: Primarily it was on 100%. First to come for. Serve. Walk in

71

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.850

just this year. We now have the Vera.: the Vera appointments. Yeah. So: there's maybe

maybe 3 appointments scheduled for the day. Okay, and the rest is first come for serve.

76

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.960

Dave Pickett: So is it. It's still mostly walk in, but there's a little bit of appointment starting to tick up.

77

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.210

Yeah.

78

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.230

Dave Pickett: and for somebody who's walking in what would be a typical wait time. Are they seen pretty quickly, or might they have to wait around a bit

79

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.349

P11: here at the regional office. It's usually pretty quick, I would say. 5 min at the most.

80

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:56.339

P11: Usually they're seeing right away. I mean I even joke about it. I say, you know. sir, don't don't sign that that's the wait list, and there's not a way. But if you want to wait, you can sign, and you have a seat

81

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.329

P11: that's great.

82

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:05.129

Dave Pickett: Are there any busier days, or of the week or times of day that you've noticed.

83

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:12.750

P11: I've always said that Our busy season is like the holiday season. Everybody wants to increase.Got it so generally it picks up during the winter winter times of colder times, and right after Christmas

85

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.540

P11: you're after the New Year you'll see a decrease.

86

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.490

P11: but it's it's pretty much busy right around September through December.

88

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.400

Dave Pickett: Okay.

89

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:44.760

Dave Pickett: Thinking specifically of again the the physical location. You mentioned that there were complaints about kind of parking any other sort of complaints that you might hear from veterans who are visiting that regional office

90

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:54.090

P11: other than okay. So the normal complaints are. The parking lot is too far. I can never find parking.

91

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:02.890

P11: It's a downtown. you have to take all your clothes off it's security. Those are generally the complaints that we get.

92

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.770

Dave Pickett: Okay.

93

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:14.860

Dave Pickett: and if you were to say a split between how veterans arrive, you know what's the breakdown of how many drive or might use public transit?

94

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.740

we probably get one or 2 a day that use public transportation and the rest drive.

96

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:22.440

Dave Pickett: Okay.

97

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.210

Dave Pickett: now, switching to the other facility that you go to

98

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.860

Dave Pickett: one day a week.

99

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:39.150

Dave Pickett: you said that was the the Raymond G. I didn't get the full name of it. What was that?

100

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.460

Dave Pickett: Okay.

101

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.260

P11: you know.

102

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:54.670

Dave Pickett: you know. Tell me about what it what is. What do you do when you're there? Do you have a specific place that you're at, or do you do rounds? How how does that kind of work being a benefit person onsite at a a hospital?

103

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.819

P11: I just I do the exact same thing that I do here. I just satellite at the hospital.

: so I have. I have a desk in in the enrollment office, which is right through the front door to the right.

105

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:15.600

P11: So veterans, you know it's it's it's really convenient for them. They're already there. Then they can ask questions, you know. So.

106

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:30.329

Dave Pickett: And is there anybody else who who covers that spot? Or is that one day a week that you're there the only day week? That's kind of like. They can get benefit questions answered at the hospital there.

107

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.190

P11: so I personally cover that day

108

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.190

P11: one day a week there. But it's man 3 days a week by

109

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:40.830

P11: the regional office, and then.

110

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.759

P11: I believe, one day a week. It's it's it's

111

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:48.569

used by the State Department of Action Services.

112

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.080

P11: that desk one day a week.

113

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.010

Dave Pickett: and then you know, Obviously that's like a very different, You know. Kind of experience. Somebody getting help

114

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:05.859

Dave Pickett: at the hospital versus, you know, coming specifically to the visit any sort of differences, you know, in you know

115

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.879

Dave Pickett: what how people are interacting with that office versus at the main regional office.

116

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:13.730

P11: Well, it's

117

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:15.430

P11: that

118

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.519

P11: the office that you would go to

119

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:19.970

P11: I'm going to do your best.

120

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.079

They don't. They don't understand that. You know we're 2 branches on the same tree.

121

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.710

P11: You know that the the Va. Is just the hospital. They don't understand that that's the Vha. And this is the Vba veterans benefits. Administrator.

 Most of them don't understand that.

124

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.139

Dave Pickett: Got it. So.

125

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.590

Dave Pickett: When.

126

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:55.060

Dave Pickett: if they're coming to you at the regional benefit office, they maybe have figured that out a little bit more versus if they're just stopping by at the hospital. There's maybe less clarity on that

127

00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:07.449

P11: right? So I think a lot of the misconception of the hospital doesn't. You know the Va doesn't do anything for me. They can't help me with anything. It's because they don't understand that there are 2 locations. There's the hospital in the regional benefits office.

128

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:15.550

P11: So when they're at the hospital, you know it's almost like it's an expectation because of that perception. This is the Va.

129

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:29.839

P11: You know what I mean versus when they come in here. And then obviously, we're going to help them with whatever it is. But when they come in here that it happens on the opposite end, too. You know what I mean, like on the other way. So they come in here. Well, this isn't aren't you Can't you set me up for a an appointment with my prime? No, this is this is stability. This is in the hospital. You're gonna have to call the the 800 number or you're gonna You know what I mean? If they come in, we gotta get Ids we don't issue ids here, we that's done at the hospital. You have to go to the hospital. Isn't: this is the Va: yeah, it's the Va. But this is the Benefits administration. You know what I mean, like

131

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:50.690

P11: right?

132

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.269

P11: And so

133

00:10:54.890 --> 00:11:13.079

Dave Pickett: so you know, thinking again of the what you hear one day a week when you're at the the hospital. Obviously it's a different set of frustrations right it maybe the parking isn't the issue you're hearing about over there any sort of difference that you might hear about on those days. Then the other days

134

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:18.749

P11: the wait, because there's only one person there. It's extremely busy and veterans typically wait 1:30 min to an hour to see one of us

136

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.210

got it so

137

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:35.800

Dave Pickett: huge. Wait time there, and you're obviously only there one day a week. so you can't really judge busier days. But do you know about like from

138

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:40.999

Dave Pickett: other people who work at that place is. Maybe it's always just busy and backed up. But

139

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.939

Dave Pickett: any seasonal variance you notice again, or anything like that.

140

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.940

So we have a log that is, live

141

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:49.480

P11: when we, when we

142

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:52.160

P11: check in a veteran for an interview.

143

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.850

P11: it goes on the log, and the long is a live spreadsheet.

144

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:02.200

P11: so we can see the difference between how many people are at the hospital a day, and how many people are at the Ro. A day?

145

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:02.870

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

146

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:08.219

And I can tell you that it's at the regional office. We probably get about anywhere from 20 to 30 veterans. between 9 and 230, and that's serviced by 3 different legal administrative specialists.

153

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:28.879

P11: and at the hospital you can get anywhere from 20 to 30 by yourself.

155

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.730

Dave Pickett: Wow!

156

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.460

P11: And at hospital

157

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:41.229

P11: they, you know, as soon as you know, because because we are in a department, and that department has a secretary

158

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.680

P11: or somebody who mans their desk.

159

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.959

We give them

160

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.670

P11: the Vera flyer.

161

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.140

P11: the map to get here, and the hours

162

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:51.700

P11: and 3.

163

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:59.990

P11: So if you don't want to wait, you know that's what you hear all day. If you don't want to wait. You can go to the regional office, and here, and then they give them whatever it is.

164

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.980

P11: the packet that they have for them.

165

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:15.589

P11: You know you can set up a You can set up an online appointment. You can go to the regional office. It's usually what I tell people when i'm here at the regional office, you know. I mean when I'm at the hospital, too, is I'll tell the line. I'm sorry, guys, You know you. I got about 8 people in line already. If you want to go to the regional office, there's 3 people that are available to assist. You

167

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:34.109

Dave Pickett: got it and so I I assume you don't take appointments at when at the hospital days. That's all. Walk in versus like vera doesn't do anything for your hospital day, right.

168

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.479

P11: Yeah, that's all walk-ins. And then we try to back each other up like the other day, Tony, that

169

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:43.710

P11: i'm sorry one of the other guys was at the hospital, and he had a bunch of Veras.

170

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.810

and I went to the Bo and said, I'll just work all the virus today.

171

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.009

P11: Yeah, give him to me. So he gave him to me, and I worked all the various.

172

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.250

Dave Pickett: Got it

173

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.319

Dave Pickett: Anything else to note about, you know. Just kind of those

174

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:05.809

Dave Pickett: base level different experience of veteran might be getting at the the hospital versus at the regional benefit office.

175

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.409

P11: Right? the biggest. Probably complaint is when they report something to the hospital. It doesn't come to us.

177

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.470

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

178

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.269

P11: You know what I mean. Oh, I reported my divorce to the hospital. How come. You don't know: you know what I mean. And then that's like a big issue.

180

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.849

P11: right? So the fact that

181

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.879

this stuff yeah, that that's a mess.

182

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:34.080

Dave Pickett: You don't have immediate access to something that they've, you know, done somewhere else in the hospital.

183

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:41.450

Dave Pickett: you know they have to refile it with you, or there's no communication whatsoever between the 2 systems.

184

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.890

P11: Right?

185

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:46.300

Dave Pickett: okay.

186

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:56.169

Dave Pickett: And obviously with them being at the hospital talking to you. It's even more absurd to them that you don't have that information because you're physically there that day.

187

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:57.430

P11: Right?

188

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.320

Dave Pickett: Yeah. Okay.

189

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.060

Dave Pickett: That all makes sense.

190

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:13.110

Dave Pickett: And then thinking about the hospital, any issues with parking or public transit. Or is that all pretty well managed there because it's a bigger facility.

191

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:14.770

P11: I think that's

192

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.370

P11: managed.

193

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:18.230

Dave Pickett: Yeah, okay.

194

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:28.329

Dave Pickett: Now now to switch gears a little bit. So you listed out a couple different services that are available

195

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:34.489

P11: to veterans, you know, when you're working with them at either location. So you know you listed.

196

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:44.519

Dave Pickett: You're the disability office. You handle compensation pensions. Then you mentioned a couple smaller services like Home Loan.

197

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:52.280

Dave Pickett: Are there any things you'd add to like a list of services, if you know you were saying kind of everything that a of that could get accomplished there.

198

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:59.349

P11: yeah, there's there's some, you know, Award letters. We issue award letters. Commissary Letters

199

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.480

of we we deal with survivors benefits

200

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:09.789

P11: Burial benefits, Burial Reimbursement not benefits burial reimbursement.

201

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.210

P11: the adding and removing dependencies.

202

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.630

P11: Yeah, I think that's

203

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:27.910

P11: that's all I can think of right now, and say that's it. Because I know. I feel like i'm leaving something else. I'm big, too.

204

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:28.899

Dave Pickett: That's all right.

205

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.180

Dave Pickett: That's why we're talking to lots of different people.

206

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:49.179

Dave Pickett: And so you know, think we're talking to benefit offices around the country. So thinking about, you know, your RO Are there any specific services that you all deal with? That might be different from other places around the country.

207

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:52.400

P11: Well, yes, I assume. And this is just

208

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.530

assumption, because we get this all the time is that

209

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.139

when a veteran cannot log in to the website.

210

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:04.419

P11: The help desk for the website sends them to the regional office. and we have no access or training to make any changes to allow them into the website. Yeah, that's a big one for us.

213

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.090

Dave Pickett: Yeah, I I've heard that a couple of times, but that is.

214

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:21.709

Dave Pickett: people are getting sent to you, and you can't actually do anything. You're not really in a position to help

215

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:23.040

P11: right

216

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:38.539

Dave Pickett: anything that's you know, any other services that might be unique. Like. Is there a State any State benefits that veterans you you help with? That might not be available in other States, or anything like that.

217

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:45.859

P11: I don't know what the other States offer, but we have a here here in the Public Contact Office. I have a fact sheet which

218

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.370

gives them their benefits that is provided to me by the State Office. So it has

219

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.880

all their State benefits right.

220

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:57.080

P11: There are a number of applications.

221

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:58.309

P11: Give me a 1 s.

222

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.440

P11: Here's a number of applications like that

223

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.870

P11: that they can.

224

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:10.999

P11: They can apply here, and the State has a portal on a website that we I mean an email that we send all theirtheir complete packages to.

so they can apply for plates. license plates.

certificate of eligibility to wave their their tap property, taxes on their houses.

They can apply for a free hunting and fishing license parks, passes, monument passes, and stuff so on and so forth through the state

231

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:39.749

P11: they come to us, and we fill out all the document they we haven't, fill out all the documentation. We've put their D, 214,

232

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:44.820

P11: their award letters together, and then that goes to a portal for the State

233

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:58.510

Dave Pickett: Got it. So yeah, that's not a benefit that they get through the a. You know the Va. You just help them because you you've got all that access to the paperwork they might need as supporting for that application.

234

00:18:58.930 --> 00:18:59.710

Right?

235

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.790

Dave Pickett: okay, No, that's that's a really great list. so

236

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.680

Dave Pickett: looking at a couple of these a little more in detail.

237

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.459

Dave Pickett: so say somebody was coming in for

238

00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:18.349

Dave Pickett: something to do with compensation.

239

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:32.920

Dave Pickett: you know thinking about, you know you've obviously that's one of the the bread and butter, you said, is, you know, kind of disability, compensation. What are some of the different tasks a veteran might be trying to accomplish, related to compensation

240

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:37.979

P11: dependency. I hear I got married. I want to add my wife to my benefits.

241

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.699

i'm now a 100. How do I apply for champ? BA.

242

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.379

Well, I got divorced. How do I remove my spouse?

243

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.690

Expouse?

244

00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:01.760

P11: Other things we can't help them with if they often ask for is education benefits.

245

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.079

P11: how much time on my gi do I have left? We don't have training on that.

246

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:16.519

P11: i'm 100%. My child can go to school. What are the benefits available, and you can tell them what the benefits are, but they can't apply for it here.

247

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.990

P11: I can't apply for that kind of eligibility here for that. So

248

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.690

P11: those are probably the things.

249

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.080

Dave Pickett: Okay.

250

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.769

Dave Pickett: i'm gonna say.

251

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.110

Dave Pickett: and

252

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:47.479

Dave Pickett: thinking kind of. So we talked about. You know. What are some of the most common things people are coming in for and in the opposite way. Is there anything that you've only seen, maybe once or twice since you've been there. That's like a super rare thing. You don't see often, but

253

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.969

Dave Pickett: is something you all do actually help with.

254

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:58.489

P11: Yeah, I found out today a surviving spouse accidentally tore up her benefits check when she was throwing out some of her other. her other male so she brought in the check, and then we actually collect the check and then send it to to the finance office to reissue.

258

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.670

Dave Pickett: Okay.

259

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.849

Dave Pickett: So yeah, like

260

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.400

Dave Pickett: Re: issuing a check.

261

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.929

P11: Yeah, we don't do it, but we'll care for it here.

262

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:21.730

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

263

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.049

P11: we actually are supposed to take the check.

264

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.870

P11: even if the check is outdated or expired where it was to collect those checks here and then issue them with Phoenix.

267

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.500

Dave Pickett: Got it?

268

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.930

P11: that's

269

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.850

Dave Pickett: yeah

270

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.139

Dave Pickett: so you've mentioned that you know some some of these things like

271

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.380

Dave Pickett: disability. Compensation.

272

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:50.000

Dave Pickett: Pretty specific, if somebody's applying for a claim on that. But

273

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:54.380

Dave Pickett: things like updating dependencies might apply to multiple

274

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:56.860

Dave Pickett: different types of services, right? Like.

275

00:21:56.880 --> 00:22:07.649

Dave Pickett: are there any other sort of like basic utility things that veterans might be doing that Apply across all the things that you know, they might be getting benefits for

276

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:13.359

P11: sure. So one of them would be updating a direct deposit.

277

00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:20.969

P11: Yeah, so that's something that we would do here. it can be done over the phone as well. But that's something that we we handle here.

278

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.889

P11: That's whether it's pension or disability. So that's across the board.

279

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.230

P11: got it.

280

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.290

 you know. Changing addresses, phone numbers.

 you know. Profile information updating that name change.

283

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.330

P11: Yeah, that's requesting letter like an award letter. That's pretty pretty common that's actually probably the most common 

now, hinking across, you know, listed out a whole bunch of different things veterans can get done at the benefits office or

287

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.870

Dave Pickett: at the hospital when they're talking to the benefits person

288

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:04.460

Dave Pickett: it

289

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:18.369

Dave Pickett: thinking across all those different tasks, Are there any of them that require the veteran to do it in person, or many of these things they could do on phone or online. But these are just, you know, people who want some of that assistance and the the personal touch.

290

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.779

P11: I would say.

291

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.059

P11: Yeah, I would say, everything that we do is probably available for veterans to do online

293

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.130

P11: I would say pretty much

294

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.870

everything that we do. Yeah.

295

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:35.310

P11: I know that.

296

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:36.670

P11: Well, no.

297

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.230

P11: I think they can add an add in

298

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.620

P11: remove dependence online.

299

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.519

P11: I don't think they can do that.

300

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.619

Dave Pickett: So depend, adding and removing dependence, they might have to physically come in for

301

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.410

P11: yeah or call.

302

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.669

P11: I know that they can call to it. Yeah.

303

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.780

P11: know, they can call. But

304

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:58.660

yeah.

305

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.110

P11: yeah, okay.

306

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.440

P11: So yeah.

307

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:09.620

Dave Pickett: but a lot of the other stuff around compensation. Theoretically, they could be doing online if they wanted to. But you know.

308

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.220

Dave Pickett: depending on

309

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.980

Dave Pickett: their level of comfort, they might just prefer to come in person.

310

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:15.410

P11: Right?

311

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:23.570

Dave Pickett: I was so again thinking about the the population of veterans who are coming in to get some of these things done

312

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:31.290

Dave Pickett: anything you notice about. You know Why, they might be choosing to come in person versus getting it done another way.

313

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.200

P11: I would just say elderly.

314

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.100

Dave Pickett: Yep.

315

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.500

P11: yeah, the elderly or less tech savvy

316

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.249

Dave Pickett: and then across the tasks. So there any that you see that are

317

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:58.079

Dave Pickett: more complicated, or certain ones that are pretty simple. you know that stand out to you, as you know.

318

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:05.770

Dave Pickett: the the the trickier pieces, or or easier pieces in the the wide range of benefit services.

319

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:08.620

So

320

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.239

P11: I don't know what you mean?

321

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:30.389

Dave Pickett: so you know you said, okay. Somebody might be coming to try to add their their dependence to champ Va, but you know, is that of that that might be a simple form, versus I don't know a applying for an increase in my disability rating.

322

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:37.030

Dave Pickett: maybe that's a comp, you know. Are there any forms that you know you you deal with on a regular basis? You're like, Wow! This one's

323

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:45.119

P11: really complicated. I get. Why, veterans often want help with it versus like, oh, this is easy like, oh, yeah, that's simple. Yeah, Grieving widows come to apply for benefits

326

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.330

P11: not yet

327

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:54.380

extremely stressful.

328

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.360

P11: Yeah.

329

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.100

P11: it's just emotional. They normally are unfocused because of the stress

that even to fill out a simple form is very stressful.

I often fill out the form, the important dates on the form, like the the entrance date, and the actually date from the Dd. 214 branch service. The whole

try and100% of that for them because of the situation.

339

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:33.880

Dave Pickett: Yeah, no, that's and they also probably Haven't interacted with the Va. Directly before that, right?

340

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.380

Dave Pickett: And a lot of cases.

341

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.630

P11: Yeah.

342

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.909

P11: I would. I would have to agree.

343

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:40.730

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

344

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.940

Dave Pickett: So thinking about

345

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:53.000

Dave Pickett: what somebody might need to bring with them when they come in for a visit.

346

00:26:53.770 --> 00:27:02.380

Dave Pickett: Anything anything that everybody needs to bring, regardless of what they're coming in like to get into the building. Do they need a photo? Id anything like that.

347

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:05.780

P11: Identification Can't even get up here without an Id in some cases you can. They'll escort you up here.

349

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:19.240

P11: and then they'll the the you can ask to be escorted up here, and then they bring them up here, and: if they can't prove that present us with, Id there's nothing that we can do for them. You know what I mean.

351

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.700

Dave Pickett: Okay, so yeah.

352

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.189

Dave Pickett: what and then, you know, maybe if somebody is coming in for one of the

353

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:38.419

Dave Pickett: the different forms, would they need to bring any information with them? In addition to that, Id

354

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.030

Dave Pickett: or Can you pull up pretty much anything you'd need from people's records

355

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:50.670

P11: if they're coming just for a blank form we can issue forms all day, but if they're coming for any any type of

356

00:27:51.050 --> 00:28:03.399

P11: let's say they're coming in for a Dd. 214. I need, an Id they have to fill out a request for it, and then I have to. Then I can give it to them. But every every every records request needs to be in writing.

357

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.320

Dave Pickett: Okay, but there's not a lot of

358

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:10.489

Dave Pickett: pre-work or anything they need to bring with them. Aside from like that photo. Id

359

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:11.980

P11: Yeah.

360

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:12.920

Dave Pickett: Okay.

361

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:30.720

Dave Pickett: and then again, just thinking to, you know. you being located in your city. Then he sort of quirks about the population of veterans you deal with. That might be different from when i'm talking to somebody in the other side of the country for instance. that we should know about

362

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.000

P11: accents.

363

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.500

Dave Pickett: Okay, just kidding

364

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.920

you know.

365

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:45.039

P11: I would say that the veterans here are probably more polite than they are elsewhehe.

366

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.650

Dave Pickett: Okay.

367

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:53.289

P11: I told that. But I was in the service, and when I was I'm. From and and I had a

368

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:59.369

an officer in charge who  and he said that I was too polite for him.

369

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.379

Dave Pickett: good to know. All right.

370

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:11.340

Dave Pickett: so for this next part I've got a list of services that i'm gonna read off to you.

371

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:29.139

Dave Pickett: so this is a list of services that is currently hard coded into the a. Gov. To the website, and these 16 services can be associated with different benefit office locations. so every office that's, you know.

372

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:34.810

Dave Pickett: built into the system currently has some selection of these set, and it says, this is what you can do with that office.

373

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:47.160

Dave Pickett: so as I read through them, just kind of want to get your your thoughts like. Yep, that's something we do here or no, or any or like. Yes, I do. But I wouldn't call it that that kind of reaction sound good.

374

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.599

Dave Pickett: all right, first thing applying for benefits.

375

P11: Yes.

376

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:52.890

378

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:56.910

379

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.410

Dave Pickett: next one Disability claim help.

380

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.750

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.550

Dave Pickett: no.

384

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:13.620

Dave Pickett: Okay.

385

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.150

Dave Pickett: Are you familiar with the benefits.

386

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.240

Yeah.

387

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.090

Dave Pickett: okay.

388

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.310

P11: It's out of date now. Isn't it?

389

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:27.890

Dave Pickett: Yes, but that is still listed as a thing people can get help with at different offices. So

390

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.270

Dave Pickett: it's one of the things we'll probably be changing as we build our new website.

391

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:35.539

P11: education and career counseling.

392

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:43.579

P11: Okay. So in our office we have a a veterans

393

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.930

P11: readiness and employment office

394

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.600

P11: that would be next door.

395

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.040

Dave Pickett: Okay.

396

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:57.600

Dave Pickett: And so it's the same physical building, but maybe a different office number that they'd come into.

397

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.740

Yes.

398

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.720

Dave Pickett: and

399

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:06.269

Dave Pickett: Do you often get people coming in looking for that and come to your door instead?

400

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:17.649

Dave Pickett: and are they able to if they came in without an appointment? Are they usually able to get served by that, or would they need an appointment for the counseling next door.

401

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:20.490

P11: they have to apply.

402

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:21.510

Dave Pickett: Okay.

403

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.660

P11: and all applications are done online. So even if they come in. they don't get an appointment. They get either sent to the computer to apply, or they get sent with the address to go and apply online.

406

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.799

Dave Pickett: already talked about this a little bit. But next one on the list is education claim help.

407

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:47.379

P11: Oh, sorry. Get the education blow number here.

408

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:49.990

Dave Pickett: Okay.

00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:57.070

Dave Pickett: okay.

421

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.580

Dave Pickett: So those really shouldn't be combined into one, because

422

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.159

Dave Pickett: one you can kind of help in the other one, not even remotely.

423

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:39.850

P11: Yeah, we can see if they had insurance life insurance.

437

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:50.479

Dave Pickett: do you know much about Ides the integrated disability evaluation system as a concept?

438

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.760

Dave Pickett: Okay.

439

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.190

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:42.230

P11: Like Etsing from the military, and becoming a civilian

453

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:43.800

P11: counseling for that.

455

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.729

Dave Pickett: all I have is the words transition help. So

456

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:55.590

Dave Pickett: what would you interpret that? As and if is that a thing they could get at your location?

457

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:57.470

P11: Yeah, yes.

P11: definitely. You can get resources and stuff

459

00:35:00.850 --> 00:35:01.490

P11: about here.

460

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:02.430

Dave Pickett: Okay.

461

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.490

Dave Pickett: updating direct deposit information?

462

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:06.759

Yes.

463

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:12.449

Dave Pickett: And then the last one is vocational rehabilitation and Employment V. Are any help?

464

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.020

P11: Yes, or I guess that is better and not

465

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:20.239

P11: not not in my office, but in office next door. Yes.

466

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.890

Dave Pickett: I was next door. Okay.

467

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:26.180

Dave Pickett: and then, you know, thinking back on some of the things

468

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:33.390

Dave Pickett: we talked about that might not be on this list. Anything that stands out to you that you would be like. Well.

469

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:39.859

Dave Pickett: this is that should definitely be on that list, and isn't right now that you that you know

470

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:42.879

P11: they can get award. Letters

471

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.830

P11: should definitely be on there, you know any of the letters

472

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:50.329

P11: award letter survivors benefits?

473

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.240

Dave Pickett: Oh, adding a dependent that was a big one that's not really listed here.

474

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.600

P11: you know, adding and and removing dependence.

475

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:13.799

P11: forum help, basically, hey? Is there, you know, like the aid & attendance program, they come in here. They can leave with those forms. You know what I mean. So forums should always be available to the veteran, even from the website, you know, like, yeah, I mean, that's a big one. We have out forms all the time.

477

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.930

Dave Pickett: Great

478

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:32.859

Dave Pickett: Anything else that kind of struck you as we were going through that list of things that made you think about that we should know as we're making the website.

479

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:36.609

P11: No?

480

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:37.629

Dave Pickett: Okay.

481

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:44.190

Dave Pickett: Anything else that's come up today as we've talked that you know you want to

482

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:53.219

Dave Pickett: bring up about. You know pain points veterans might have that we might be able to, you know, smooth out by making the website a little bit better.

483

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:57.429

P11: Yeah, the the Id me process

484

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.870

P11: the passport process

485

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.509

is way over, thought I. Think

486

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:09.119

P11: way over. Thought like, let's let's not have to reset our password every

487

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.749

P11: 5 days and make it

488

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:17.870

P11: have to make it. You know this extra long password for high security that we're going to make them change in the

489

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:22.469

P11: 12 weeks that they can even set up one now, let alone remember it, and

490

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:25.520

P11: you know it's way way overthought. I think

491

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:38.260

Dave Pickett: great anything else otherwise. I know you have to to go in a few minutes anyway. So anything else that that came up you want to share with me today

492

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:39.879

no

493

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.009

P11: other than if you you know you create a website, and you guys, should it, and and be able to make the necessary changes to allow a veteran in there without sending them to us.

You are going to send them to us, at least give us the training so that we can help them, you know.

496

00:37:55.870 --> 00:38:09.320

Dave Pickett: absolutely. Yeah. So my team is works on the parts of the website that are outside of the login, so I can. I can only guarantee you i'll. I'll only send them. Tell them to go to you, if

497

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:14.379

Dave Pickett: that's clear that that's what they should be doing. So

498

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:24.570

Dave Pickett: well. But yeah, if you have any other thoughts in the future. you have my email address. You know this is the project i'm going to be focused on for the next several months. So yeah.

499

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:26.999

Dave Pickett: and there go.
