00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.750

Dave Pickett: so to start off. could you tell me what is your role at the Va?

7

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.770

P12: So I am a veteran service representative in the Va Regional Office.

8

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.920

P12: what I do is I assist on a day to day basis veterans or family members that come into the regional office.

9

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.050

P12: if they have questions on how to file a claim, if they have questions about benefits

10

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.579

P12: answer those questions, and then I also assist

11

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:53.550

P12: either new veterans retiring veterans or veterans who are going service members who are going through a Med board

12

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.940

P12: on how to file a plan with the Va

13

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.530

hey?

14

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.569

Dave Pickett: and how long have you been in this position?

15

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.329

P12: I've been with the Va. Since 2,016.

17

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.110

Dave Pickett: Okay? And was that as a veteran service representative, or you based on other roles? Okay, it's just been a veteran service representative.

18

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.550

Dave Pickett: And then what's what's your favorite part of your job?

19

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.329

P12: my favorite part of our job is helping veterans apply for their benefits especially those who have never applied especially the older ones.

 Occasionally we'll have a a World War Ii veteran or Korea veteran and us nowadays we're seeing more and more Vietnam veterans coming in blind for veterans. So I like helping those veterans. or also I also like helping the the spouses or widows

24

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.250

P12: applying for the fossil benefits.

25

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.500

Dave Pickett: Great

26

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.219

Dave Pickett: so give you just to give you a little context about my team. So the Va. Is currently working with 7 different regional benefit offices

27

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:18.689

Dave Pickett: from around the country to design a new modernized website that would later be rolled out to every regional benefit office. So your local office is one of those 7 that volunteered to be part of this effort. so you know.

28

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:34.279

Dave Pickett: making sure we're getting information from a variety of locations sourced across the country for a variety of particular demographic reasons and whatnot make sure we're getting good coverage. as we build the first version of this new website.

29

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.910

Dave Pickett: so My first set of questions is kind of about the physical.

30

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.580

Dave Pickett: A office of that you work at.

31

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.209

Dave Pickett: So could you confirm which regional office you work at?

32

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.870

P12: I work at the via regional office.

33

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.960

Dave Pickett: got it.

34

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.190

Dave Pickett: and are you

35

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.530

Dave Pickett: Is that the only facility you go to? Or do you ever split your time at another facility, part time, or anything like that.

36

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.249

P12: that is the the main regional office I go to sometimes.

37

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.979

P12: if I need to. I'll do outreach events at the some of the local hospitals, or at some of the clinics. But my main to the office is at the via regional Office.

39

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.370

Dave Pickett: and those outreach events are any of those like regular recurring things, or they kind of sporadic at this point

40

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.980

P12: before Covid, they were scheduled. But now they've been more sporadic.

41

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.730

Dave Pickett: Okay.

42

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.450

Dave Pickett: so thinking about the regional office?

43

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:44.339

Dave Pickett: Is that a building unto itself? Or is it in a building that shares space with, you know, different offices of other types.

44

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.660

P12: it's in a Federal building, so there are 24 floors of different government agencies

45

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.740

Dave Pickett: got it.

46

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:01.120

Dave Pickett: is this building pretty easy to get to Any quirks that veterans or beneficiaries might need to know in arriving.

47

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.010

P12: the main thing is. It's very hard to drive to and find parking and also so if they are an elderly veteran or disabled veteran it's very hard to get to and that's one of the biggest issues is trying to find parking, because we don't have parking for a veterans there, so to find either street parking or parking garage to get there. and then, if they can't drive, then we have to find they have to find means of either the Metro, the public transportation. there is a train station that does let them off, and then they can walk there. or other ones. But other than that, there's no other means to get there.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.789

Dave Pickett: and then, once that are inside the building, is it pretty easy for them to get routed to your office from? You know

55

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.860

Dave Pickett: the entry of the building. Any potential hang ups there.

57

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.740

P12: basically, when they come into our building they have to go through a government security. They have to be served to make sure that they don't have any contraband weapons or anything like that. And then, after that they can ask the the Security Guards how to get to our office. there's also signs by the elevator. Assign them how to get to our office.

60

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:32.219

P12: and what is the normal operating hours for veterans to come in to this office?

61

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.060

Dave Pickett: Okay.

62

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:50.099

Dave Pickett: now with thinking of, as you said, maybe a veteran who's in a transition state? maybe not super familiar with the Va overall. How would you describe what they can do with this office in contrast to the wider network of va stuff

63

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.249

P12: so mainly our regional office just focuses on compensation benefits.

 so if they want to file a disability claim they can do that.

we used to be able to have people there that did what it used to be called Voke rehab, or now is a. V. And Rn. But they are in a different location. and then we also had some people there that would help them if they want to do a gi bill stuff or education. But as right now, they're not there anymore.

68

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.650

Dave Pickett: Got it?

69

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.980

Dave Pickett: So If somebody did

70

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.560

Dave Pickett: want help, with

71

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.330

Dave Pickett: what would be the closest facility you would refer them to? Or is it

72

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.159

Dave Pickett: all virtual now? Is

73

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.069

P12: It's about mainly virtual? since Covid, and also our building is under renovation.

74

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:52.830

P12: So they are in offsite, and what they have to do is if they came into our office, and I want to see if we already? Then we will give them the number, and then they would have to make an appointment with VR.

75

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.410

Dave Pickett: Got it. And what about education or Ji

76

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.169

P12: same thing.

77

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.110

Dave Pickett: Okay.

78

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:09.209

Dave Pickett: Any other services like that that? Maybe veterans still have an expectation that they can get just by coming in person. But I've actually kind of

79

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.749

Dave Pickett: move to a virtual modality that you're seeing.

80

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.389

P12: we. We get a lot of stuff from different agencies sending them there. You know we don't do. Id cards so if they want the either the veterans, Id card we don't have the capability to do that we same thing where we the the hospital car, we get those so we have to refer them to the hospital for that or to the regular veterans. Id card we have to for them to via Gov. Because that's how they can get it. is the main. The some of those things health care benefits. We have to always refer them to the hospital

84

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:56.379

P12: insurance. We don't do insurance stuff like there. We don't do pension benefits or death benefits, or burial benefits. So we always have to refer them to those other agencies.

86

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.540

Dave Pickett: Got it?

87

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.000

Dave Pickett: so

88

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.519

Dave Pickett: thinking across, you know just

89

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:18.550

Dave Pickett: a day or a week different veterans to come in. How many would you say? Have appointments versus or just doing walk-ins

90

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.980

P12: we are.

91

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.889

P12: I would say, about 90% walk in and then about 10% appointments.

93

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:38.389

Dave Pickett: and for people who are walking in what's like a typical. Wait time. They might have to wait before being seen.

94

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.630

P12: no more than 5 to 10Â min. Okay.

95

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:48.559

Dave Pickett: And are there any times where you see

96

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:55.119

Dave Pickett: busier rush of people either day of the week, time of day, time of year.

97

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.100

P12: I I would say the biggest rush

98

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:07.629

right now is midday, like around noon time because a lot of people are trying to get stuff if they're working during the lunch hour. we also see a lot of rush that first of the month, especially if they don't get their paycheck. they come again. So those are the 2 time periods, I would say.

101

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.430

Dave Pickett: Got it.

102

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:31.520

Dave Pickett: you You already mentioned that parking is a big, you know. Kind of pain point frustration that you're hearing about anything else. That's kind of specific to the facility as opposed to the

103

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.600

Dave Pickett: benefits process. Broadly that you're you're hearing about from veterans

104

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.889

P12: one of the other issues that we are running into is we are. Our office is also collated with the veteran service organizations. And so we also have issues with people coming in and saying, hey, i'm here to see X organization, and they're not there. so it's a lot of them have either changed locations, and they Haven't informed people what they close down because of Covid or whatever. And also our building is under construction. So we're having issues with that them finding office locations.

109

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:30.809

P12: And then there's also a big confusion with the veterans organizations and and the Va. Is the that relationship? Because some people say, oh, i'm here for the da V, and then what's like? Oh, the Da V is on here, and it's like Well, I thought, you guys with the AV, and we have to explain to them the difference between what is a veteran service organization and what the Va. Does.

110

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:36.880

P12: and we get a lot of complaints about that. Because you know what? What's the difference?

111

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.669

P12: Yeah. And why do I have to go with the veteran service ovation? Why can I just go straight to you

112

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.540

Dave Pickett: right and well.

113

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:50.750

Dave Pickett: you could go straight to us. But if you, unless you want to have somebody help you

114

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:55.380

Dave Pickett: so that that whole kind of relationship of the

115

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:03.639

Dave Pickett: I forget the the term, for like a pointing kind of a we call them a veteran service representative

116

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.500

P12: via vso

117

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:25.080

Dave Pickett: so that seems to be a point of confusion and frustration that they expect they can just walk into your office and get information appointments for any of those places, even if they're no longer even physically located in that building

118

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.930

P12: the Dv. Or whatever or and I was like

119

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.499

P12: they're not. We don't have their information. They're not in this office anymore. Here's the last number that we have for them. and so so forth.

121

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.470

Dave Pickett: Got it.

122

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.410

Dave Pickett: So now thinking

123

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:48.570

Dave Pickett: about the different things a veteran can do at this office. So you said, You know you're primarily dealing with

124

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.270

Dave Pickett: compensation. Disability claims. Are there other

125

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.660

Dave Pickett: kind of service categories that you would list out as things that you

126

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.319

Dave Pickett: and help veterans with.

127

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.610

P12: we do, I guess a conversation

128

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.900

P12: We can help own for the pension form, but we have to send that it off. we can help them with their death claims, and then we send those off.

The other one is that they have issues with their pay. either as if they didn't get paid, and we can help them with with that stuff. We can help them a little bit with  you know, If they have a debt with the Va. we can help them. So the the for debt management, and then we send those off. 

but those are the main things we can help them with following for the the the benefits, or if they have the issues. But the main thing is after they we work with them. We have to send a lot that stuff off

135

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:50.730

P12: to the appropriate, appropriate offices, or we tell them to send it off.

136

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:59.530

Dave Pickett: so thinking about the wide range of maybe different types of tasks, a veteran might be doing related to compensation

137

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.960

Dave Pickett: as your kind of main service.

138

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.230

Dave Pickett: what you know versus you know, maybe

139

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:14.269

Dave Pickett: initial file versus you know, adjusting a claim, or what are some of the things that you see people coming in for around compensation?

140

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.270

P12: either the a. They want a file claim, they want to check the status of their claim. if they have the issues with their appointments. they want to. They miss an appointment, so they'll come in and ask us to say I miss my appointment can i reschedule it. and then

144

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.929

P12: And once their claim is done, if they don't understand the decision, and we sit down with them and talk to about the the decision letter. and then, if they want to file, appeal will help them with the appeals.

147

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:56.969

P12: and then same thing. If they wanted to file an increase, we help them with their increases, or if they're going through a reduction. and we also tell them how, what? Why they were being reduced, and then we can help them.

149

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:03.770

P12: with their reduction.

150

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.660

Dave Pickett: Okay.

151

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.169

Dave Pickett: are there any kind of

152

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:20.920

Dave Pickett: The more basic utility things like updating their bank account information, or any of that kind of stuff to handle those pieces. Or is that mostly self service.

153

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:30.860

P12: we help on with the updating their the banking and their change of address, or updating their information and the system as well. Yes, we do that.

154

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.630

Dave Pickett: Okay, what about dependence?

155

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.639

P12: We do that

156

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:41.009

Dave Pickett: Anything else that's maybe a little bit more in that utility category

157

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.720

Dave Pickett: that might apply to multiple benefits that you handle.

158

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.070

P12: I think that's pretty much it.

159

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.569

Dave Pickett: so

160

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.379

Dave Pickett: just listed out, you know.

161

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.770

Dave Pickett: 8 or

162

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.669

Dave Pickett: 11 different, like kind of sub little tasks that kind of

163

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.810

Dave Pickett: could be related to compensation.

164

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.289

Dave Pickett: Thinking about those tasks, or any of them.

165

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.830

Dave Pickett: Do any of them stand out to you, as

166

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.700

Dave Pickett: you know.

167

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.460

Dave Pickett: particularly easier or harder that you know might be

168

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.830

Dave Pickett: driving a a veteran to come in versus doing it themselves in another format.

169

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.670

I think

170

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:27.959

P12: a lot of the issues, I would say is, we still have to deal with the older veterans. We are not computer literate. So we have to deal with those coming in. and so we see a lot of those veterans who don't have access to the Internet or homeless veterans who don't access to the Internet. So that is why that those populations we see a lot of those, the younger generation, those who have access to the Internet. They They they're pretty self-sufficient.

174

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:57.809

P12: and they can handle a lot of that stuff on their own

175

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:03.869

Dave Pickett: is there Any task that absolutely requires a veteran to come in, no matter their level of Internet comfort or

176

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.599

P12: It's kind of hard to think.

177

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.240

P12: I I know that they can do a lot of this stuff by calling into the call center.

178

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:28.560

P12: like, updating their information, their banking, and all that kind of stuff they can file claim online through V. A dock of They can even check the status of their claim there. And so I can't think of anything really physically where they would need to come in to go to the office.

180

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.020

Dave Pickett: What about adding or removing the dependent? Is that is that

181

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:37.770

Dave Pickett: something

182

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.550

Dave Pickett: you've heard is uniquely.

183

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.490

P12: No, it doesn't need to be done in person, because,  a veteran service representative, can do it over the phone. They could sign off on the 660, and we can do that and add a remove, or depend it that way

186

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.319

Dave Pickett: good to know. So

187

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:09.129

Dave Pickett: Obviously a lot of the people coming in are choosing to come in because they want, you know, or need some extra assistance.

188

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:23.040

Dave Pickett: do you feel, Have you noticed any kind of people who are coming in because they think they have to that, you know. Maybe Aren't aware of the tools, or who may have chosen to do it online if they had only known.

189

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:27.630

Dave Pickett: or do you think it's mostly just people who want that kind of in-person support at this point?

190

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.389

P12: I I I really back towards it. Still the elderly

191

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:36.550

P12: I don't have Internet access. Yes, and then we also still have some people that come in because they still want somebody to have somebody review their forms because we get a lot of people to say final claim.

 I just want to make sure that the forms are filled out correctly before I submit them. That one final step because they don't want that, let us say, hey, you fill out the form incorrectly, and then that's down the the process.

195

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:04.230

P12: And so we so we still got a lot of those people that say, hey, I just want that final review. before we they turn it in.

196

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.020

Okay.

197

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:14.189

Dave Pickett: and then thinking back to you know that kind of list of tasks, you know, File initial claim doing an appeal. What would you say or like the the top

198

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:20.329

Dave Pickett: 3 most common things that you're you're doing for better helping veterans with, you know, just day and day out.

199

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:26.820

P12: I get a lot of people that come in on a day to day basis

200

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:34.480

P12: asking for an updated benefit letter because they have to turn that into their housing office. and we get, though I I probably get like half a dozen, those a day, or from the hospital.: and they they can. They can either call online to get one of those letters, or if they have access to, they can print off their benefit letter right there. and that saves them from having to come into the office. But we get a lot of those every day

 final acclaim is a big one. and then the other one is checking the status. We get a lot of people coming, and you want to check their status.

But and then the last one is pay issues it's a big one, so I know that they can call the call center

209

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:21.830

P12: but

210

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:29.809

P12: they Still, I I still think that they still have to come in here to you know they'll bring in the P. The paperwork and say, hey, you know.

211

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:41.459

P12: I didn't get my check this month, Can we? Can we do a check tracer on it and see where the the check was went? Or if the money didn't go to their bank account.

212

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.290

Dave Pickett: Okay.

213

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:51.040

Dave Pickett: on the flip side. Are there any issues that you know you can actually help people with that are super rare. You don't really see happen very often.

214

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.720

P12: that's a hard one.

215

00:19:57.340 --> 00:19:59.270

Dave Pickett: Yeah.

216

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.709

P12: I mean, I I did have a super rare one.

217

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.880

P12: but it's

218

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.780

P12: I had to refer them out.

219

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:24.020

P12: But we had somebody come in that wanted to have a a person removed from a grave that was buried on National Cemetery, and we could not help them with that issue. because, apparently the the veteran wanted their current spouse buried with them.

 and that's where it is. And then the family of a previous marriage came in and said, that's wrong, and they want their parent buried with their father, and so we we. We went back and forth, saying, we can't help you with that. So we have to keep referring them to the National cemetery on how to do that. and then and I was like, Well, we can't. We can't. I don't have the authority and this office doesn't have the authority to exhume a body from a cemetery grave. So

223

00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:04.349

P12: that was like a rare one time. Issue that. that came up for us

224

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:12.950

Dave Pickett: right? Your your ability to assist with burial claims is just applying for reimbursement. That kind of thing, not the actual

225

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.250

P12: management of where bodies are placed.

226

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.260

Dave Pickett: Got it?

227

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:27.139

Dave Pickett: And then. So we're talking to, regional offices that are located around the country. So thinking about, you know.

228

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:36.799

Dave Pickett: Are there any benefits that or services you're helping veterans with here that might be unique or different from other States or

229

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.140

Dave Pickett: the other places.

230

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.839

P12: yeah, so we do a lot of like state benefits

 here . So if a veteran wants a disability plate.

they have to come to our office to get the the the State letter

 that says, what? because they have to list out everything that they are disable for from the military.

 and then they have to turn that into the and so that they can get their plate

another benefit that we help them with is what we call chapter 1 15

 is is similar to the veterans pension for low income. But it's just a state benefit.

239

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:19.890

Dave Pickett: Hmm.

240

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:26.470

P12: And so we try to help them with that. But we always refer them to the State Va. Office because one of the things they have to do to come to us is sometimes they have to get a benefit letter from us, saying either what they're getting from us, or they're either receiving no benefits from us, or what they're actually to check is from us.

242

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:44.729

P12: So that's a a a state benefit that we help with Another one is  the State. They pay out a annuity every 6 months if you're a 100% veteran. So veterans come in here for to make sure that they get a benefit letter showing that they're 100%, or they're receiving, I you.

244

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.420

P12: And then

245

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.569

P12: The state also does what we call a welcome home. So if you get out of the service

246

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:15.420

P12: and we also help with that as well. But mostly we refer them to the State Va. For that one

247

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:23.919

Dave Pickett: right, because it's not provided by the National Va. It's provided by the State. But you're just helping, giving them paperwork that they need for that process

248

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:30.329

Dave Pickett: anything the city offers like a transportation discount or anything like that.

249

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:36.570

P12: I know that they do. For if you, if you're disabled, I think you have to be at least 60%. they do that for veterans for transportation.

251

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.059

Dave Pickett: Do you ever get people coming in for

252

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:48.450

P12: claims for, or letters for that? Specifically that you know of.

253

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.160

Dave Pickett: Okay.

254

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.979

Dave Pickett: Okay. So this next section I'm: going to share my screen

255

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.439

Dave Pickett: and let me get that going.

256

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:07.739

Dave Pickett: So I am going to show you this list of Vba services. So this list is currently

257

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:23.929

Dave Pickett: hard coded into. Va. Gov. this list of 16, I believe different things. and each of these services are things that can be listed as services that are or are not available at different Vba sites.

258

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:29.469

Dave Pickett: so just kind of want to like. Walk through this list one by one, and you know, note if

259

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:41.999

Dave Pickett: yes, this is obviously something we offer or no. This isn't or I don't even know what that is. Any kind of reactions you have, or any thoughts on it. that's just kind of what i'm looking for. Sound good.

260

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:43.279

P12: Okay, Sounds good.

P12: Oh, yes, we do that. There.

263

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.049

Dave Pickett: Okay, burial claim help?

264

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:56.260

P12: yes. We help them fill out the forms for burial, and then

265

00:24:56.450 --> 00:24:59.880

P12: we'll take those and then for them off to

274

00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:25.630

Dave Pickett: Do you help them set up a V 8 of account, or just tell them to to go do it.

275

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.760

P12: we give them the information on how to go to via do go.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:59.120

P12: education people for the gi bill in our office. But we haven't seen them since Covid, and so we just refer them

284

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:00.919

P12: for our virtual help.

285

P12: the main one is if they are receiving benefits.

294

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:37.550

P12: We give them a letter that they can turn into that office.

295

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.259

P12: we get a lot of the requests for G 214 to verify if they are a veteran

296

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.639

P12: as well. And then also

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:50.060

P12: veterans come in asking for had vash: stuff. So we we refer them to the Hot Bash office because a lot of the homeless veterans come and say, how how can we find housing around here?

 And so we? We. We refer them mainly to the either homeless shelter down the street, or to the hot, rash office in the hospital

317

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.880

P12: there is only one person in our office that does that.

318

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:19.409

P12: and they go out to one base Hanscom Air Force Base. that's who we've partnered with.: And so it's only one person that does that, and they they handle that.

320

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:35.280

Dave Pickett: And so that's all handled on site there it's not actually taking place that physically at this your location.

321

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.770

Dave Pickett: Is there anything that

322

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:37.490

Dave Pickett: they

323

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:41.139

Dave Pickett: veterans would come into this office to do around that?

324

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:45.640

P12: only if they wired to meet with that person

325

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.719

P12: to, and they need to help with final claim. But other than that

326

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:52.669

P12: nothing I can see.

327

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:56.599

Dave Pickett: And they would need to schedule appointment directly with that person.

328

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.329

Dave Pickett: That's correct. Okay

329

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.079

Dave Pickett: pensions.

330

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:07.279

P12: the only thing that we do with pensions is we help them fill out the the pension form.

331

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.980

P12: and then after that, we send it off to the Pension Office

332

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.080

Dave Pickett: pre discharge, claim, help

333

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:19.420

P12: the person that does the it is also the person that does

334

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.889

P12: the previous charge counseling

335

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.390

P12: most everybody in our office

336

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:32.649

P12: who does clearance works on previous charge claims. But, the person that actual physical help is the same person that does ideas.

337

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.950

P12: we do have Occasionally we'll have people that come in

338

00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:40.140

P12: that want to file a previous charge claim.

339

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:49.349

P12: and then we we have a certain checklist with them to make sure that they have the stuff in order for them to file. I just charge claim the main issue. There is

340

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:54.749

P12: making sure that they have their medical records with them because they have to turn that in.

341

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.759

P12: if they want to file a previous charge claim

342

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.629

Dave Pickett: transition. Help

343

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:06.369

P12: the I would say. That's the same thing with the person

344

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:13.500

P12: who does the ideas and the pre discharge when they go out to the base. I guess we do have people that come in

345

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:20.879

P12: every now and then. I actually had a couple of people this past couple weeks, saying I just got out, and i'm here to file for my benefits.

346

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:31.329

P12: and so we'll sit down with them after we'll get there to to 14, and say there's the forums. What disabilities you want to plan for, and and we go from there.

347

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:36.450

Dave Pickett: Got it. So that's like kind of a benefits orientation for somebody who's transitioning.

348

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.780

P12: That's correct. Yes.

349

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.649

Dave Pickett: updating direct deposit information.

350

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.570

P12: yes, we do help them with that

351

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:49.650

P12: the the the main issue with updating drug deposit

 is having them fill out the the standard 199 having them to go back and have their bank sign off on it.and so we have a lot of people saying, Why do I have to get my bank to sign off on it?

 I already have the form from my bank with their direct deposit information.: or they say my bank is there's no physical location for it. It's all online.

 And but we then we have to explain. It was like, Well, this is a new security thing. we heard a lot of fraud with people calling in, or people coming in and trying to change banking information. So now we have to have your bank physically. Sign off on this, for i'm saying that this is a a legitimate bank account. and so that that is, has been an issue since that's been. The phone has come out.

360

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:38.230

Dave Pickett: Okay.

361

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:42.619

Dave Pickett: and then vocational rehabilitation and employment. Help?

362

00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:44.770

P12: yes, we do have that.

363

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:52.379

P12: at our office. the only thing is, if they come into the Public Contact Office, we have to refer them to the number so that they can set up an appointment with the actual office.

365

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:02.150

Dave Pickett: and now, just kind of looking back through this list again.

366

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:04.290

Dave Pickett: Anything

367

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:11.650

Dave Pickett: stands out, as you know, clear things that should be added. or oversight. Anything like that

368

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.110

P12: that's about it.

369

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.080

Dave Pickett: Okay.

370

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.320

Dave Pickett: let me stop that.

371

00:32:18.660 --> 00:32:20.170

Dave Pickett: so

372

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.519

Dave Pickett: thinking about

373

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.070

Dave Pickett: again, going back to the context of

374

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:44.239

Dave Pickett: the thing, i'm actually working on, which is the website for the regional office that veterans can look at out without logging in. So I just our team just controls kind of that experience. That's not. That's outside of the login system. So just kind of what you could just see that's publicly listed about a benefit office.

375

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:51.939

Dave Pickett: Anything that you know you think should be on there that make sure a veteran is absolutely prepared for an appointment.

376

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.049

Dave Pickett: or just to walk in that, you would say top things you would want to make sure we're on that website.

377

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.300

P12: if they are, I would say, if they are initially final claim

 make sure that they understand what disabilities that they want to apply with the Va, because that does take up a lot of time.

379

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:23.269

P12: because we do get a lot of people that come in and say, I just want to file for my benefits, and then we have to explain to them. Okay, there's a whole bunch of benefits that we offer. What do you want to file for?

380

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:27.800

P12: And then that? And so that does cause issues?

381

00:33:27.890 --> 00:33:35.999

P12: if they are filing for also, if they're fine for a disability claim. Make sure that they have their medical records, because we may not have those or access to them

 due to 14, if they have because we don't have access to everybody's gd to 14

384

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:48.449

P12: so

385

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:54.970

P12: the other thing is same thing is if they are fine for

386

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:09.000

P12: or if they're fine for dependency, you know, make sure that they have the information about their dependence, because we have issues with that. It's like oh, I want to add or add a dependent. But then they don't have their social security numbers, or

 you know, sometimes they don't remember birth dates same thing. if they want to add a spouse, they don't know their social security numbers, or

they remember that our spouse's birthday. So those information.

389

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:23.750

P12: And then for

390

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:26.299

P12: like the IC. Or  spouse, a little pension, just remembering the information about their spouse, because sometimes they don't have that information. you know. they just know that their spouse was in the military, and then they come and say, I want to file for this, but then they don't know anything about their spouse's. Military service.

395

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:48.770

Dave Pickett: Okay.

396

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:57.650

Dave Pickett: And what would they you know, for a a spouse who's coming in perhaps a a widow who's coming in? What would be

397

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.340

Dave Pickett: the the thing they should be looking for about their, you know.

398

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.700

Dave Pickett: to part it

399

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.040

Dave Pickett: spouses record.

400

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:10.329

P12: either. A. G to 14 helps discharge paperwork.

401

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:15.119

P12: It is something to prove that they were in the service

same thing. If they have medical records if they want to file, for G, I see.

 is is important. we need death certificate because we don't always get that.

and then or marriage certificate.

and then also if they're fine for burial benefits

 the copy of the bill for the for reimbursement.

407

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:48.729

Dave Pickett: Anything else. you can think about that. you know.

408

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:53.520

Dave Pickett: Maybe you're commonly seeing veterans not bring that they should be bringing

409

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:58.219

P12: I think that's that's

410

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.450

P12: pretty much it.

411

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.909

Dave Pickett: That was a very expensive left list. So

412

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.859

Dave Pickett: I I think you probably got everything

413

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:16.809

Dave Pickett: great. Well, that's basically the end of my list of questions. Has anything come up today that you want to circle back to

414

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.719

P12: I think that's pretty much it.

415

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:24.460

P12: I think the main thing is that people just need to know the services that are provided at the regional office. a lot of people think that. we are just the catch all, and know everything at the regional offices, and then they get disappointed when we come and say, oh, we don't offer that service. here's a number and sorry you have to drive all the way into the regional office to to be told that that service is not provided.

420

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:58.230

P12: and or they say, oh, I call the 1 800 number, or I went to the hospital, and they told me to come here.: and then we have to tell them, hey, that Sorry you were given that wrong information.

422

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.559

P12: this is the actual real information.

423

00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.790

Dave Pickett: right?

424

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:08.799

Dave Pickett: Okay?

425

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:15.569

Dave Pickett: Well, that's that's what my team is working on for for the next several months. So

426

00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.410

Dave Pickett: yeah.

427

00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:30.829

Dave Pickett: if you have any additional thoughts that come up, you know, at any point always feel free to reach back out to me and hit me up because i'll be working on making sure we get everything up to date as as good as possible.

428

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.859

P12: Okay, thank you very much.
