00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:51.060

 Okay, I'm currently.. I'm. Currently the um uh public contact coach. 

6

00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:08.800

P1: Um, but I've been working for Vba for over seventeen, close to eighteen years already. 


8

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.719

P1: knowledgeable as what goes on since, like I said, I've worked here before as an employee, so you know,

9

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:46.489

didn't forget close to two or three years as a Uh. Vsr. Here in public contact before I moved on. But um yeah, right now. Um, I would probably say overall two months uh as coach

10

00:01:47.230 --> 00:02:03.580

Dave Pickett: got it. So you said Vsr. That's veterans representative or Yes, yes, and um, you said your title now is coach. What's coach on that little coach is actually is like a supervisor,

11

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:15.950

P1: or they call in coaches here at that. The um at the station. Uh, you know, assistant coaches or system managers or or assistant um supervisors. Um.

12

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:32.540

 So that means you kind of oversee some other people who are maybe in a role you previously had them Is that way. Uh, yes, yes, actually uh before they were my peers Now i'm their supervisor. Uh, uh,


14

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.460

Dave Pickett: got it.

15

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.909

Dave Pickett: Um! And what's your favorite part of your job

16

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:28.919

P1: uh uh favorite part of my job is actually thinking outside the box trying to come up with um uh ideas, innovative ideas, and which I can actually is like Uh, my philosophy is to create a a teamwork added to teamwork environment. That's that's what I want, and that's what I expect from my uh, my staff. Um! If we accomplish that, I think we can provide an overall uh

17

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:57.149

P1: better service to our veterans and beneficiaries. Um, like I said. Um, I bring that along because I actually had it work with my fiduciary um team for nine years never failed, you know, a a top performing team.

18

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:16.250

P1: like, I said. For me, it's important that my staff um buys into that team work, attituding team work, environment. Um. Another thing that I do bring along that uh I expect them to do is um, I tell them right off the bed. You know. What I expect from them is um a commitment. Respect

19

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:44.490

P1: that's for me. It's um very important, you know if if you're committed to your job, and you, you know, provide the respect they deserve. I think they've earned it. Um, I think that's uh the way we should go, and most of my employees are veterans, anyway, so they should know um. Just treat Just treat them the way you would like to be treated Um! And right now um like I said some of them were my peers and their supervisor. But uh, I lead by example.

20

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:55.660

P1: You know i'm not just the coach or supervisor that's just behind a desk. If it came down to you know um short staff which I've done already. Um, I I go in and help them out,

21

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:12.570

P1: you know, and like I said, um, I lead by example, and that's and you know, I think when you see, and when you do that. Um! They actually believe you, and you know It's not like, I say, and I don't do anything. No, I say it, and I, you know, I lead by example. So Um:

22

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.999

yeah. But um, yeah. So I I would probably say in two months I've accomplished a lie.

23

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:47.010

P1: Um, I would probably say the majority of my staff right now. Uh, I have a total of twelve employees, and I would probably say the vast majority have already uh bought into my um philosophy or concept, whatever I bring in. Um, I allow them to actually bring up uh suggestions and ideas. That's another thing I bring up uh, cause we're a team, you know. Uh in a team there has to be a leader, and that's me. But it doesn't mean what I say. You do?

24

00:05:47.020 --> 00:06:16.259

P1: Um, I'm. I'm part of the team, and whatever uh it's like, I tell them you during the do you? You're doing the dirty work. So you know what works and what doesn't. So bring up the ideas. You know what we we can discuss it. If it's something that's feasible. I'll bring it up to my leadership, and you know, and take it from there. Um, I don't take the credit the credit. You know. Whoever brings up that she that's your project. Um! I just want them to feel ownership of what they bring up. Um! I just want them to feel like they're empowered, you know, to

25

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:46.249

P1: to bring up ideas, and it'll be taking consideration. And um uh, like, I said, I think that actually does work, you know, because uh, I've been through that before I've implemented such philosophy, and in in in other teams. Um, it hasn't failed. You know, of course, there's always one or two that that that don't buy into it, but you know it. I don't. I don't. I don't lose sleep over that. Yeah, you can only set the expectations whether people want to sign up for that or not. That's

26

00:06:46.260 --> 00:07:13.910

Dave Pickett: individuals. Yeah. Well, that's great. Um. Well, you know kind of in that spirit, you know. Uh give you a little background of where we're coming from. So uh our team, we're working with seven different regional benefit offices from around the country to kind of work on a new modernized website. Um! So you'll all get to be the first uh in line to do it before we roll it out to every regional benefit office across the you know

27

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:34.640

Dave Pickett: the whole country. So your you know local regional office kind of volunteered to be in this uh first round uh make sure we're building the best possible experience. So uh, you know, this is really an opportunity for any ideas you're seeing or getting to rise up to to us as we're starting to build this, so it gets in from the beginning.

28

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:46.499

Dave Pickett: Um: So yeah. So we're really just talking to you all to get a better sense of what is the day to day reality when a veteran uh visits one of your benefit?

29

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:59.799

Dave Pickett: Um! So i'm gonna ask. You know a whole bunch of questions might seem like stuff that should already be known. But again, this is just to make sure we have everything. So i'm gonna jump in now. Um.

30

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.540

Dave Pickett: So um!


00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:42.679

Dave Pickett: Okay, Great. Thank you. Um. So let's talk just about the you know the main regional office . Um for a bit. Um. So is that a facility? Is that a standalone building, or is it in a shared building with some other, you know,

44

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:54.669

P1: Stand alone building just for um uh for V uh Vba. Excuse me uh ve veterans benefits administration. So um if i'm not mistaken, we're uh over two hundred plus employees for Vba: Um: yeah. Most of us, you know. Um. Well, I have to come every day, but the employees they they're working from home, you know. They only come like two times for pay period. So um right now in the building there's not a lot of employees,

46

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.310

P1: but on just a handful. But um yeah, But it's a standalone just for Vba

47

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:32.610

Dave Pickett: got it. And Obviously, your team is more likely to be on-site. Since you're actually uh face to face interactions right?

48

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:43.430

Dave Pickett: Got it. Um! So thinking about, you know the physical location, Is it easy to get to? Are there any quirks that might make it difficult for people to find parking or anything like that.

49

00:12:43.690 --> 00:13:09.140

P1: Oh, well, as far as um uh parking, you know, I think. Uh, there's a good parking space for our visitors here as well as the employees. Um as far as um location um around here. It doesn't matter where you come from. You go get quite in traffic, anyway. So um! So I would uh taken away traffic. I would probably say we're pretty much centralized. It's uh easy to um to reach

50

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:29.069

Dave Pickett: great um! And what are the uh, you know, kind of normal operating days and hours for the facility

51

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:47.649

P1: we don't uh, uh allow any more uh individuals or veterans or benefits you towards in the building, because we actually want to, you know, uh address, or attend the ones that are in the waiting area. Um. Normally, normally, we should be done by three, three, thirty Um! But at times, for example, today is a good example. Where our waiting there is it's packed, and you know I cross my fingers that you know it goes down fast. But um, yeah, I do have sufficient staff in today. So um we should be good.

53

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:20.390

P1: But um yeah, but um Monday through Fridays. Um from seven to four. Um, of course. Um, there's some employees that don't work in the public contact. Every that are in the building. That um probably, you know, process claims that

54

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:32.620

P1: stay longer five, thirty, or six. But there's always a supervisor in the building. Um, even though my my turb duty is supposed to be over at four. Uh I leave like around five, thirty-six every day. So Um. You know. Yeah, I just don't feel comfortable as a supervisor leaving before my staff, so I just make sure you know um. My staff is all gone, and you know they done uh they complete a tour of duty once that's completed. And

56

00:14:48.760 --> 00:15:09.080

Dave Pickett: um i'm good to go like like I said, lead by example. Yeah, no, I appreciate that? Um: Okay. So in your own words, how would you describe this office to a beneficiary? Who's kind of unfamiliar with, you know, maybe the V eight. They're just kind of maybe starting out, and don't have a good sense of

57

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:29.030

Dave Pickett: You know what what the Vba is versus other parts right? You know that it's obviously a wide complex space. So how would you describe what they can do at this office specifically? Oh, actually, what they can do at this office is, 

P1: if they have any type of um doubts as far as if they qualify for benefits. I think they can have a clear sense that uh they're gonna get the proper orientation from the staff. And actually, whoever interines with you know with them in in the process. Um! That they can leave with that sense that, hey? You know I got the information I needed. Um, and if I do qualify i'm going to be uh uh, you know um uh helped out accordingly, and you know when my paperwork is going to be processed the way it should be.

60

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:15.400

P1: Um, so I think um overall uh they should. Um they shouldn't I wouldn't say they should. They do. They do leave with that uh uh sense that they've got uh uh the that quality service that they expect, and, like I mentioned before, that's what I expect from my staff to actually um uh provide our our veterans and and beneficiaries. And another thing that we do. Um, We provide surveys, you know, like a little slip as far as how. How did we do today, you know, so

62

00:16:34.620 --> 00:17:04.030

P1: actually provide us a feedback and my my tension with this feed. You know the survey is to actually get that feel from our our customers. Let's just put it that way just to see what areas we can improve on. Um, Yeah. And one thing, uh, I also intend to do with these surveys. Actually, this is a working pro and and progress is to actually uh set up like awards, prepare something, so I can put it up in a in a waiting area and actually say, Hey,

63

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:23.790

P1: these are your suggestions or recommendations, and this is the action we we we're taking, or have taken to address your concerns so they can actually see and feel that they're part of our um uh our growth and part. You know they they feel that there they are being heard. So that's my intention. That's my goal with

64

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:29.060

P1: with the surveys and but, like I said, that's a work in progress. So

65

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:45.819

Dave Pickett: uh no, that's you know. I've been talking to different veterans, and you know that definitely have heard that you know they they recognize the Va. Is doing a better job of listening now than maybe historically. So I appreciate that a a feedback loop um.

66

00:17:45.830 --> 00:18:01.579

Dave Pickett: So um thinking about again uh the this office a veteran coming in. Um! What are the different services that this location offers for veterans.

67

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:13.540

P1: Um. And actually we in our public contact. Um, uh, I use their services a lot as far as um hiring nonp work, experience um veterans. Um, you know I've I've been very successful with with their program. Um, In addition to that, we have uh support services in the building. Um! We also have the um uh claims um divisions which actually process the claims. Uh do the final ratings appeals? Um. Actually, we have uh

69

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:47.859

P1: probably the all the works here that that we need to actually process a claim completely from from start to finish. We can provide that type of service here at the Url.

70

00:18:47.870 --> 00:19:01.160

P1: But um like, I said, in addition to that, we have V or any in public contact. Um, we did have, or we do have a call center. But actually they're all working remote from home. So there's no one here physically in the in the building.

71

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:16.139

Dave Pickett: Okay, um. And so if you could. Um! What you said? Public contact, right? That's a service. So what are the different types of, you know, maybe subcategories of support that a public contact

72

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:27.979

Dave Pickett: we get the public Con contact team provide to veterans, you know, throughout, you know, on daily basis a daily basis,

P1:  I would probably say the majority of our claims are widows, so um uh, we do provide um pension benefits, you know, uh orientations on on the services. Um, we do get uh quite a few from education. Um, chap thirty five, you know. That's um provide them the guidance, you know. Um, uh how long they're gonna get the benefits, and what the process is. Um! And actually just normal. Uh, I would say, the majority is actually um compensation benefits that. Um, they're actually seeking um um That service connected a possibility for um conditions incurred or aggravated during their military service.

77

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:23.640

P1: But um, yeah, I would probably say, uh, we do get a lot of widows that I would probably say, and actually, I would say from January on next couple of months. Um, uh uh, we, you know, as far as uh the expenses for for pension. So uh medical expenses. So that's gonna be a big uh uh issue for us, you know, from January, probably to March or further there on um uh next couple of months, because um, if i'm not mistaken in January, that's that's when they start submitting all the paperwork for um medical medical expenses.

80

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.820

Dave Pickett: Got it?

81

00:20:51.880 --> 00:21:07.890

Dave Pickett: Um! So thinking about um, you know, you obviously have familiarity with multiple benefit offices right oversee. You've been to different ones thinking about this facility. Is there any service that's provided here? That's maybe unique compared to other locations?

82

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:15.940

P1: Um, I think what makes us unique is the the the language. Um, that we can provide that service not only in English, but also in Spanish, and I think that's something that other stations might have. But I I I would probably say not to the extent that we do. I think um as far as um having that uh needed staff as far as to provide that service. It all depends on the amount of population Hispanic population that you get. Um. So you know I I i'm not sure that they have sufficient um staffing to actually address these um uh issues, or probably expand their capability to actually serve this type of population. Um, So that's something um like, I said, It makes us unique in that aspect.

 Um, i'm not saying that the other stations don't have it, but I would probably say it. They do have it to a limited extent.

Actually all the staff um present here, I would probably say in the um a whole ro They're all fully. Um uh, they're fluent in any English. So um you know, I wouldn't say um, we have any difficulty communicating, or anything like that, or or actually explaining any type of service that we needed to explain.

95

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.670

P1: So you got it?

96

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:51.619

Dave Pickett: Um, and the And then is there any sort of internal um, you know, policy or procedure around, you know, materials being, you know, produced bilingually, or anything like that because of you know, the needs of the population.

97

00:24:51.630 --> 00:25:19.419

P1: Um, Actually, we do have a quite a few in both languages, but we do have other documents that are in English, and actually our our our veterans and beneficiaries have requested, you know, if if possible, if it could be uh translated to Spanish. So yes, we do. We get that Um, And I think that would be very important, you know. Again, we will probably have to assess, you know. Um the population

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.810

Dave Pickett: Um. So again, thinking broadly, because you have,

102

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:28.209

Dave Pickett: you know, about other benefit offices through the Vba. Other types of offices. Are you aware of services that a veteran might access at um a different Vba location that they couldn't necessarily get at your location just because that's not you. You know what your population needs

103

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.969

P1: at this moment. I can't. Nothing comes into my mind.

104

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:44.330

P1: Um, i'm sure there is, but nothing comes to mind at this moment

105

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:57.359

Dave Pickett: That's totally fine. Um, all right. So now i'm going to dig in a little bit more on those different services that you listed out before. So i'm going to kind of cycle through those again. Um, So you know,

106

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:17.709

Dave Pickett: first thinking kind of in that public Contact Banner, because I think that's probably obviously where you the most expertise you listed out uh pension benefits, education benefits, and then uh disability compensation. We're kind of the three main categories you listed. Um. So let's start first. Talking about pension a little bit.

107

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.200

Dave Pickett: Um,

108

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:45.260

Dave Pickett: so um thinking about. You know all the different things somebody might need to do related to a pension benefit. So you listed that you know your You see a lot of uh widows who are kind of doing uh claims. Um, but um, you know what are some of the different, you know kind of things somebody might do around pensions. Um, whether they're a a veteran or a beneficiary.

109

00:27:45.270 --> 00:28:03.579

P1: 

Okay, actually, when uh uh a veteran beneficiary comes in for pension benefits. Um. Sometimes they're uh unaware of how to qualify for pension benefits. Um! I'll start off with the with the widow, for example. Sometimes they think you know um. They're married to a veteran. He passes away. And actually these better uh benefits transfer over to her, which is unfortunately not true unless you know it's. D I see, or anything you know they uh pass away due to a a service connected condition  which um they'll get uh compensation for that. 

But as far as pension um they, we explain, go go through the process with explaining how they qualifies, based on their income, and so on, and based on the income, you know. Um. Sometimes you know they don't qualify because they have access income based on uh the range. There, you know, required to qualify for this benefit. But then, again, even though we might have a number that throws them over that that limit we start, you know, actually like, I said, we go above and be on to actually see what things we can do, or what expenses they incur in that actually decreases this this um uh total amount, 

We've accomplished a lot with, you know, going doing this um with our um, our widows um, because at the end of the day they're paying for so many things out of their pocket that at the end of the day their income just throws them beef below that level, and actually makes them uh qualify for the benefits. 

Same thing happens with the uh with the veteran, you know, on sometimes. Um they don't qualify due to their period of of uh military service, and so on. Uh, or they don't qualify um uh for um for uh compensation, or sometimes their compensation is actually less than what they would get from pension. So um, you know. Um, we actually provide them that orientation, you know, if they uh, if it's better for them to get that pension instead of compensation. Of course, pension is, It's always going to be based on your income. So uh, if it you know uh, if in any moment that income should rise. You know there's a possibility that you might not continue with that type of benefit. But then, again, compensation is totally different. So But Yes, we do um provide that type of orientation on how to qualify, and if they like, I mentioned before it, see their their um income that actually doesn't allow them to qualify. We look for the options. Um! We start asking questions. What? Ben, What uh medical services or expenses you're incurring in, or it's type of care that you're um receiving that actually might help decrease the um that amount making them, you know. Um, so they can qualify for the benefit.

121

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:14.100

Dave Pickett: So. Um, you know, once uh so that's a lot of, you know. Help and support around. Do I qualify if I do qualify, maybe choosing between benefits. So they were kind of like two pieces. They are one kind of understanding what the eligibility looks like, and then maybe

122

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:35.290

Dave Pickett: a strategy understanding trade offs between. If you qualify for a couple of different benefits Um, once they're maybe, you know, in enrolled in pension benefits. Do you see? Is there any sort of follow up that maybe people come in for, Or is it kind of um once that it's really about getting them in That's the bulk of what you're doing.

123

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:51.680

P1: Um, I will probably say the bulk of what we're doing is actually getting them into um, receiving the benefits. Um. After that we'll probably seem like uh every year, like, I said, with with the medical expenses at the beginning of the year, that so? That's when we'll probably see them again.

 Um! But you know our main goal is to actually get them in the program uh or get them to benefit.:Uh, so they can actually qualify. Do we do any follow ups after that in public contact as far as hey? Um! Did you get your benefit? There is everything Okay? I wouldn't say we do that, you know, because you know, it's just the amount of uh of people that we get. But I Then again, you know, I think um. Our scope of work is just to get the ball running and see if um they qualify or not. Um, you know, as far as following up um, I think that would probably be some other department, I guess you know. Um.

 But you know, once we do get them here, you know, after us once they qualify and they come in for their medical expenses. Um! We do continue to explain to them. Hey, This is something that you should be saving this type of receive this type of service you you also qualify that can actually help you out or get you more benefits. So uh, so once they're in the in the program. You know the thing is we can actually dig, dig in more just to see. What else can we get this, this, this this person, this widow or veteran, what other type of service or benefits they can qualify for.

 So that's what we do. You know that I will probably say that'll be our follow up once they get into the program that they come in, you know, for their medical expenses. I'm reviewing all of that

129

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:35.689

Dave Pickett: got it, and um, you know, in terms of you know. Income, medical expense, are they? You know, once they're in the pension, are they coming? Maybe on an annual basis for something? Because uh, that might change. Or you know, I'm just curious. What's the frequency that you're expecting to see people again once they're kind of in that program.

130

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:52.259

P1: Okay, as far as um. We do explain, you know, if if by any chance during that period their income um status does change, it's important that they do notify, because if they do not it it it's a possibility that you have um a uh over pay and overpayment, and that's uh probably gonna uh bother them if we don't explain that that could be a possibility. If they don't report any type of changes in their income. Um! But as far as seeing them again, I would probably say, uh, we see them once they get the benefits like on a yearly basis. After that,

133

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:37.249

P1: unless you know the you know the the widow or the veteran passes away, and we get a family member notifying, or if their income status changes, you know, and stuff like that. But that's not the norm, and we don't get a lot of those um we do get the uh medical expenses on a yearly basis, and we do expect that at the beginning of the year.

134

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:51.489

Dave Pickett: Got it Um! Anything else kind of related to that pension, you know. Kind of line of service in terms of, you know, regular um expected visits, or you know things that veterans are looking for support with.

135

00:34:52.870 --> 00:35:08.190

P1: Um, I would probably say when they come in, you know, in addition to seeking that type of benefit, they also come and see, you know, like um medical assistance. You know any type of um care at home.

Um, you know that's something that at times, you know, like I mentioned before. You know that's something that we can probably recommend. Hey, you can, you know, try to seek this type of service. Then again, the Vha. Does have several type of services that they can provide the the veteran um as far as um patient care at home. So um uh, if they do have like a social worker, you know we we'll probably know that once, you know, when we start looking through through the um veterans file and stuff like that. So that's something that we can actually refer back to Va for assistance, or or make a a referral to um, but at at our end we try to, you know. Uh at least uh provide them the guidance of what they can see, and what type of services Um, they're entitled to

140

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:30.510

Dave Pickett: got it. Um! And now thinking about uh, you know, pension as a service uh line. Is that um something that you know somebody could walk in, you know, any day of the week, and that's going to be help, or there any limits on when people could get help with that.

141

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.310

So now let's talk about education benefits.

Dave Pickett: Um. So you listed that kind of as number two. Um, so tell me a little bit about again. Kind of the as we talked about with pension, you know. Maybe they're coming in for qualifying, and maybe there's that follow up annual meeting. What are some of the kind of what's the you know? Typical expected veteran experience, re-education that you've seen um of your time there?

144

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:25.679

P1: Okay, I would probably say as far as education we we do get some, but I wouldn't say that's the bulk of our work here. Um, we do get uh, for example, veterans that are a hundred percent of service connected. They get chapter thirty-five um for them and their family members, and and then you know, we do explain uh the process and what they qualify. Um, And as far as you know, um uh uh how much in the the term they they they're entitled to. Uh. So that's uh. We'll probably say that's the focus of um of our um orientations as far as education.

146

00:37:39.400 --> 00:38:01.919

P1: Um, we do uh a lot of my staff members. They're knowledgeable as far as any uh type of um educational um uh institutes here around the island that they can go to, and you know uh seek uh education of services. Um uh, we did have a uh education coordinator here at the Ro. Uh, but I think she retired. If i'm not mistaken like a year or two ago. So um anything that's in time, you know. I'm not entitled in reference to um uh education. We do have the age education, um contact number uh, because we're not expert in education, so we do make reference uh uh to the proper um uh department for further guidance. 

But as far as um, you know, as far as uh chap, thirty-five. That's part of that uh benefits you get uh being a hundred percent service connected. So once that veteran does get that entitlement of one hundred, you start getting all the benefits as far as uh commissary medical care. Um uh education, um uh benefits, and so on. So, um! That's our scope of actually providing that orientation of this is what the package brings. Um! And you know, as far as education.

Um, we do have, or I do have a a lot of employees that actually sort. You know the the veterans some uh, you know, sons or daughters, you know. Hey, you should take advantage, you know not. Everyone has this opportunity to get this type of benefit and actually study um. So you know. Um, we I think we do a pretty good uh job at a convincing these younger um generation to actually hey? It's true, you know. I should take advantage: of this opportunity. We're actually uh getting this benefit. Study something that I like. Uh, because if you didn't have it, probably your possibilities of studying something that you really wanted will probably be. I wouldn't say it possible, but it'd be a bit difficult, especially if your um parents didn't have that sort of income. Um, so you know. But, like I said, I think my step does a pretty good job as far as i'm promoting that um educational uh opportunities that they have.

152

00:40:01.210 --> 00:40:04.979

Dave Pickett: That's great. Um! And so it sounds like Previously there was more of an expert on staff who you might have been able to give a little more insight into different parts of it, like um how to actually maybe apply the balance working with schools or something like that. What's maybe some of the expertise that you you now have to kind of refer out for,

154

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:41.380

P1: uh uh main role here at at the Ro, as far as education, and like you mentioned, you know um as far as um benefits. Well, what are the requirements and stuff like that? She was the go to person and like, I said, we do know um just basic um information. But you know, I think we do a pretty good job as far as uh providing the the proper guidance to to the veterans and um his family members, his or her family members.

156

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:17.649

Dave Pickett: Um, and then um Another service that you listed out was um kind of that compensation. Oh, sorry first of all for education. Obviously it's You're mostly just providing that orientation. That's kind of the main You're serving that benefit. Um, Again, Is there any limitation on when a veteran could get

157

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:36.390

P1: that kind of orientation? Is that any day you're any day, any hour? Um, but yes, um, you know, as far as education we, you know, uh can actually um refer them to our our other department, which is,

158

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:53.919

P1: which actually does have that um education and and employment um uh service that we can actually um refer them to if they didn't qualify under this uh one hundred percent service connected um benefit. So that's uh, that's another route that they can take.

159

00:41:53.930 --> 00:42:02.250

P1: And like, I said, I think they have a very successful um um department and program um with this type of um service that they provide.

160

00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:04.649

Dave Pickett: Got it. Um,

161

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:24.520

Dave Pickett: let's talk briefly. Now about um. You know the compensation for you know hundred percent service connected. You mentioned. That was another big area that you you know you're supporting. And um tell me a little bit about. You know. What does that entail again? Is it mostly about qualifying, is it? Um, you know any follow up um throughout.

162

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:34.270

P1: Okay, Um, uh, This can be like on the previous to any time of the day, any hour, as far as um uh

 uh the service itself, I would probably say, we get more of uh veterans that are already have service Connecticut conditions, and they actually are trying to seek a higher compensation rate or benefits um. A lot of the veterans just don't know or didn't know, that they could actually uh request reevaluations for the conditions. So that's where we come. And actually, hey, this is you can actually get this condition, reassess.

 But you know, if you're also suffering from the from these other conditions, you can probably, uh make a a uh request for secondary conditions due to your primary service. Good. So um yeah, it's like a puzzle. We start, you know, helping the veteran out um, letting them know. Hey, you can do this so you can qualify, or you can. You know um submit this type of plane?

 And I would probably say, you know the majority of the veterans already have their benefits, but they're at trying to actually seek in a higher compensation due to their condition, you know, getting aggravated, or or worse than it was before, but, like I mentioned before, um a lot of the veterans, They know that they can submitted a reevaluation for the conditions in others just you know. Um, they know. And they're just coming into um. Actually. Um make that formal formal client to actually um. Get it? Um address.

169

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:32.760

Dave Pickett: Okay? And then, you know, in terms of uh adjusting that compensation or the um. You know the the disability rating for a higher compensation. Um, it's mostly you're supporting with a a claim. But obviously the actual evaluation happens in a different facility through different means. Or what are the pieces you kind of uh interact with on that.

170

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:48.559

P1: Okay, I mean, yeah, in public contact, like um, like I mentioned before, they come in, and they just um indicate, hey? I want to have um whatever condition it is. Um reassess, because it's getting: um worse. So we just fill out the paperwork to claim that goes to another department. That's um that the development which actually um submits a letter to the to the veteran. If there's any additional information that they need to submit, they'll let them know. 

But um at our end we just, you know, like I mentioned before, we just put the, you know. Put the ball rolling, and you know uh all the paperwork, and once that that's up and running, you know that's uh development takes over from there, and so on,  and I know better Veteran be notified. If there's any examinations to be performed, they'll be done by a contractors or at the Vha. Um, but that's nothing that we do or coordinate with

174

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:47.750

Dave Pickett: got it. So you're just kind of at that. That re-evaluation step getting that ball rolling and then you don't really kind of see the outcome necessarily, unless they come back for something else later.

175

00:45:47.760 --> 00:46:09.320

Dave Pickett: Um. So thinking across, you know, those three different things we've talked about compensation uh reevaluation education, um pension benefits. Are there any, maybe tasks that are common among those things like Maybe if somebody needs to, you know, connect a bank account or any information like that, any kind of basic utility service that you're helping people with.

176

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:28.300

P1: Um, yeah, as far as um once they do get the benefits. Um, they come, or uh like you mentioned uh, as far as open and bank accounts routing numbers. Um establishing the the the the account so they can get their benefits. Um direct deposit. Um,

 um! I think that's something that crosses over between all the services that I've mentioned before. Um any type of uh uh addition uh to a family member uh dependence. That's another thing that probably could cross over on all three.

179

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.830

P1: Um,

180

00:46:48.850 --> 00:47:00.579

P1: yeah, I would probably say, those are the most common ones that we could see on dependence or any type of um uh bank accounts. Um information or

181

00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:02.319

P1: establishment.

182

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:19.229

Dave Pickett: Okay, Great Um, I know we're. This has been a great conversation, and we're uh close. We only got about ten minutes left. So uh, but I have a bunch of other questions, so i'm gonna kind of get through some of these real quick.

183

00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:31.169

Dave Pickett: Um! But the next thing I'm going to do is i'm going to share my screen real quick, and i'm going to show you this list of Vba services. Uh, so are you able to see my screen?

184

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:40.260

Dave Pickett: Um. So this is a list of sixteen services that are currently kind of hard coded into va gov

185

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:56.949

Dave Pickett: um. So I just wanted to kind of walk through those one by one real quick and say, you know a is the how does this line up with what we've already talked about? Um! Is anything on here? Uh stand out to you. You know anything like that? So

186

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:20.290

Dave Pickett: uh applying for benefits. That seems like That's obviously one of the primary things you're helping people with. Um any notes or questions from that one. Okay? Uh, What about burial claim help? Is that something you've seen before? You're familiar with?

187

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:35.360

P1: Um. It comes along with the uh the burial on claim it itself, you know as far as um um making that type of claim. So um. So it does come with the with the widow, and in her request for um pension benefits.

189

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.319

Dave Pickett: Okay, Um: Disability claim help?

190

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:47.959

P1: Uh: yeah, I think that was under the compensation. Um aspect of um that I mentioned before.

191

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:52.809

Dave Pickett: Okay, Um, What about e benefits registration help.

192

00:48:53.160 --> 00:49:15.849

P1: Uh, actually I mean anything to you. No, I actually I I remember when it first started. It was very. We were very active as far as establishing that uh here at the Ro. Um right now, I will probably say, since I've been here two months on I haven't seen, or at least I haven't noticed any type of um uh interaction at at that level

194

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:34.579

Dave Pickett: for for that type of service.

195

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:45.050

P1: Um, that's something that uh like I mentioned before. We do provide them uh that basic information as far as education and career wise. Um! If it should go further than that, we probably make um get them the the contact numbers, or uh, like I mentioned before, Vr. And e will be an excellent um resource for them to actually go to. They could get better better guidance from them.

198

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:03.860

Dave Pickett: Um uh education claim help

199

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:18.329

P1: uh same thing. As far as education we can provide just the basic information as far as requesting educational benefits. Uh. But again, you know, if it came down to something that we are not familiar with, we'll provide them with the contact information so they can actually reach out.

201

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:40.139

Dave Pickett: Um. You know, family member we've obviously talked about, you know, uh widows we've talked about, You know. Um children taking advantage of education, any other family member kind of claim assistance. You'd want to call out

202

00:50:41.110 --> 00:50:42.669

P1: uh

203

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.009

P1: no, I will probably say um

204

00:50:48.380 --> 00:51:05.460

P1: fiduciary services. That's yeah, that's something that um being a fiduciary um supervisor in the past, I think that's something that uh a lot of veterans that get that one hundred percent are not able to manage their funds. So I think that's something that uh we do see a lot, and that's something that we do need to. Uh. This is my personal opinion needs to be me to be careful with, you know, especially um, i'm also respiratory therapist. So I worked at the Vhs. So I was able to see this type of um situation in which the veteran had certain benefits, and unfortunately, you know, when they knew he was at the end stage. That's when you started seeing family members um with fiduciary services. We see more or less the type of uh when It's the majority, though it's just like, I said. We just have to be careful. Um, and just just make sure that we're doing our our due diligence as far as assigning the the the the fiduciary um, in order to assist the the veteran with this needs. So that's something that that does stand out to

209

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:27.250

Dave Pickett: um. So you know, looking across uh this list, you know. Are there um any things that stand out in terms of, you know? Um, maybe something a term or a phrase a veteran might be using to describe one of these services. That's different from how you know the Va. Might describe something, or how this list is describing it.

210

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:47.049

Dave Pickett: Um, you know. Uh, in terms of you know, if a widow is coming right there's nothing that says widow here. Um! Would they know they could get help based on this list, or, you know, Are there any other kind of terms you you hear people using that might um shift how you list some of these things.

211

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:54.110

P1: If a widow came in, and for example, and looked at this list um,

212

00:52:55.050 --> 00:53:02.530

P1: I will probably say they could pick out a probably a handful of things they might be curious about or interested in.

213

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.819

P1: Um.

214

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:09.189

P1: But uh, i'm sure a lot of people would say, hey? What is? What is the height is?

215

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:28.540

P1: Yes, it is a very long word. What's What's that? You know that That's probably i'm sure it'll catch someone's attention just for the long word it is. And and what is it? Um, But I think you know, if people, or veteran or or beneficiary came up, i'm sure by looking at the list, I'm sure they can make out more or less, or pick up the type of service that they would need.

217

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:53.839

Dave Pickett: Okay, um. Well, in the last few minutes here, I want to, you know, Zoom out a little bit. Obviously, we dove pretty deep into just a few services, but you know thinking about uh, the experience veterans are having at your facility. Um! Is there any information that you feel

218

00:53:53.850 --> 00:54:01.579

Dave Pickett: they're not coming in prepared with that should be on a website. Um, as we're building out the website for this facility.

219

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:17.039

P1: Oh, definitely, I would be going back to pension, you know. Um, I think it's very important that they, even though we do provide them to you. The orientation of what documents they need to bring in when they do that. Um uh follow Review. I think that's something that does need to be, if possible. Um uh posted on on the website where wherever it is. Uh, these are the documents you should come into. The arrow with, You know. Um receives expenses, a home kernel, right?

P1: Whatever type of uh of um uh of documentation that's required for them in order to maintain or keep their um their benefits. So like. I said, you know we probably could provide them that orientation, you know, when they first came in, but more likely than now they're going to forget a year from now and and then they're gonna come in, you know um uh, you know, and then they'll probably make two or three visits because they're missing documents, or they need to request the documents and stuff like that. So? I think that that's something that's very important that

225

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.819

P1: it should be, if possible, should be posted out there.

226

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:28.469

P1: Yeah, as far as the other benefits, I think. Um, uh, I think it's straightforward, you know, as far as our compensation, you'd come on your Dt. Uh Dd. Two hundred and fourteen, and that's: uh, that's the initial. That's all we need, and you know, and we can get everything else rolling um when they start developing your um your claim, if there's any down else missing. Um, they'll let you know. Hey, we need this type of information, Or can you provide this this other um data and stuff like that.

228

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:52.180

P1: But yeah, I I I will probably say pension for me, my experience something that stands out

229

00:55:52.350 --> 00:56:03.729

Dave Pickett: Yeah, any other, you know. Maybe common frustrations, you see, with veterans coming in that might be able to be helped or supported by different information on the website.

230

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.640

P1: Um,

231

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:14.559

P1: I would probably say um, I don't know if it's information that could be provided in the website or not. But um you know, I will probably say the main complaints are that come out is just a waiting time sometimes, but that's something that. but you know that's due to sometimes, you know. I'm being short staffed and stuff like that. 

Um. Another idea that I've read in my surveys is actually they've uh having the possibility of setting up like some stations with the computer where they can actually go in, and you know um,

236

00:56:48.640 --> 00:57:16.030

P1: and actually um uh provide them uh like uh. This was one of from one of the service. Actually show them how it is that they can actually go in, make an appointment. Look at at the site, or look for some information. Um, that's something that was brought up in one of the surveys. Um! I don't know that's uh that's food for thought of for me so like like I said, um uh work in progress. I'll probably come up with something or that we can, because my intention is with the service like I said, just get their input but I also want them to see that this is what you want it. And this is what we done to actually accommodate, to make it easier for you, and make your experience with us unique, and want you to recommend us, or want to come back, you know,
