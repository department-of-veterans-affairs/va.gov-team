00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:30.499

Dave Pickett: Um. Before we dive, super into the the detail, just want to start out with a couple of general questions here. Uh could you tell me about uh what? What's your role at the Va.

7

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.699

P5: I am originally A. VSR But I'm. Assigned to the public Contact team because I'm. Also the president of the Union here at this at this regional office.

9

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:59.489

Dave Pickett: Okay, and Vsr: That's a veteran service. Yeah. And what? What's the difference in your role when you were at Vsr. Versus being on the public contact team, all of 

Vsr: I'm actually processing claims.

10

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.680

Dave Pickett: Okay versus kind of meeting with

11

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:11.589

P5: veterans to help them fill out their claims. Yeah, I like this. Yeah, pretty much A little bit of everything at the at the desk is

12

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.640

because

13

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.050

P5: quite a lot of

14

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.440

Dave Pickett: yeah uh, how long have you been in this role?

15

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.550

P5: Um, I came in. Twenty, about two thousand and thirteen. I've been doing it off and on, and it became I've been doing it

18

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.219

every day since.

19

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.759

Dave Pickett: Got it, and is that

20

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.959

Dave Pickett: when you were started as a Vsr. Or when you you kind of added public contact onto the

21

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.740

P5: and two thousand and thirteen I started to. They were shorthand, so they would just have people come up and and fill in. So I was one of one of the three that always filled in

25

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.939

P5: so to to that point. And then, when I became the President of the Union in two thousand and fifteen, the director's best to be at the desk, so they have more access to.

27

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.410

Dave Pickett: Yeah, um. And what's your favorite part of your job?

28

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:29.440

P5: The part I don't know. I I I think I take satisfaction when I help someone through their claim, and they get awarded like

29

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.670

a high percentage.

30

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.619

P5: It helps them all because a lot of these guys are homeless. We deal with their homeless popular a lot because we actually have a homeless um shelter down the street from our office. So we deal with them on a regular basis. So a lot of time. 

Well, that's that's the best product. Help with someone like a life change, and you know, amount of money. They get to do something.

34

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:48.529

Dave Pickett: Um. So my first set of questions is, you know, about that physical building that you work at. So um, you work, You said you work at the regional benefit office. Correct?

38

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:59.050

Dave Pickett: Um! And now is that uh, the only location. Would you work, or do you ever, you know, go to another facility, maybe part time?

39

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.390

Dave Pickett: Okay.

40

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:08.450

Dave Pickett: Um. Now this facility. Is it a standalone building? That's just the regional office, or does it share space with some other things?

41

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:18.069

P5: So it's A. It consists of two buildings that's connected. So it's a low rides and a high rise. The high Rise bill and we're in is twenty four floors. We currently occupy the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth floor. The public contact is on the sixteenth floor,

44

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.800

P5: and and within this building it's shared. You know It's different agencies in here we have two senators. Yeah, Elizabeth Warren on the twenty-fourth, and at marking on a group ninth floor, plus we have homeless carrying all all the different agencies. With

46

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:58.970

Dave Pickett: um. Now this the building itself is that easy to get to. People have any trouble finding it as a pretty obvious

47

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:10.640

P5: feats away. And um! The only difficulty is the parking issue, because it's very, very expensive to park. I've been opposing to taking public transportation

so generally, you know, parking is anywhere of twenty-eight to forty dollars a day, you know. It's not even you just be stopping here. You gotta pay a minimum of twenty-eight dollars.

49

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:42.470

Dave Pickett: Um! And you know your um, you said public contacts on the sixteenth floor do uh our veterans able to find their way once they get to the building up to the sixteenth floor pretty easily, or is there any confusion getting to. 

There was. There was a point where there's confusion, because most people they um confuse the veteran service organizations with the Va itself.

So when they do come into the building securities there. They ask them for Va. And the small secure. They just take sixteen if the person is looking for via, so they end up in the wrong place

But they came to the sixteenth floor and the Vs. On the fifteenth floor. But with the new renovations that they're doing. They're gonna kind of put everything on the same floor. So when the veterans come on, say the fifteenth floor, you'll have the public contact and you have the Vs: so  there will be more confusion that way. So

55

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.870

Dave Pickett: entry waiting room area. Yes.

56

00:06:48.950 --> 00:07:02.829

No, I mean, if i's for beneficiary. This is where the benefits we get monetary benefits. So I mean that's where I would start with them, and everyone understands that when it comes to money, and they're looking to get compensated for any injuries or for whatever it is. Um, that's That's how I would pretty much describe it. This is where the money begins.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:45.960

Dave Pickett: Oh, sorry. Skipped a question. Um, what? What's the normal operating hours for the public contacts uh office here that you know veterans beneficiary can visit would be eight Am. To four Pm.

68

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.770

Dave Pickett: Um. And then thinking about it,

69

00:07:51.780 --> 00:08:10.719

Dave Pickett: Bulk of veterans and beneficiaries that come in. How many of them are making appointments in advance versus just kind of walking in to get service without an appointment.

70

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:16.220

P5: We've been getting a lot of lot more of those, I'll say, probably, uh, as far as appointments which we really don't do too many. But we've been getting probably thirty forty percent with the Vera.

73

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.060

Dave Pickett: Okay, make an appointment and just showing up.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:50.589

 Yeah, Well, that's in the confusion is Once they go on to Vera, they make the appointment. It'll pop up in our system and going to have a name and a phone number, and then let's say um either virtual or you know. Um physical appointment.

 So the virtual really isn't a virtual. We just gonna call you back. It's not set up that way. 

And There's not enough information for the employees to prepare before we call. So It's just a name and a phone number There's no um social claim number. There's nothing for us to be able to look up the claim and uh Vms.  And then, you know, get the information we need. So the call can go through. You know a lot better with the questions they may have the answers already,

85

00:09:40.750 --> 00:10:00.430

Dave Pickett: and comparing that to a walk-in do you have like kind of like when somebody first checks in. You get some of that information. 

p5: So we have a signing sheet, and they'll just put their name social phone number, and they'll bring it up with the Id. And at that point, while you know they may be asking me questions. I'm plugging away at the computer to just pull up, you know. Pull them up in the system, and I can get a quick snippet of what what you know. They're They're rated at whatever percent and what they rated for.

So I have a a of what's going on with them already from just that quick part of it we get in the VERA. I I can't pull up anything, and I ask this person their social, and they want to know why i'm asking them for it when they put the you know to them. They they signed up in the system. I should know this already,

93

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:53.749

Dave Pickett: for people who are walking in for an appointment or without an appointment. Rather. What's maybe a typical wait time.

94

00:10:54.310 --> 00:11:03.369

we usually see them right away.

95

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:10.120

P5: No it I mean, it varies. I mean some days most days is slow. But then it all depends, you know, because we do also do um video hearings with Washington. So with that going on, and sometimes you just have folks coming from the center, and there's no telling when they come. You know they're outside hanging out. They may just someone say something, you know about benefits. And all of a sudden they're coming up. So there is no particular hot day.

100

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:33.890

Dave Pickett: Okay,

101

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.240

Dave Pickett: um

102

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:51.570

Dave Pickett: for veterans, you know, coming in? Are there any sort of pain, points, or common frustrations that you hear again and again from the veteran perspective of some things that are, you know, working or not working about um,

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.629

P5: Any other complaints they may have is usually They can't get certain things on the go when they have to come in here.

Okay, So they would prefer, maybe to do some of this online, and they can that that uh, savvy with the computers. There's a lot that older and they don't do computers, so they we must kind of have no choice but to come here.

00:12:51.180 --> 00:13:10.549

Dave Pickett: um. And in your opinion, are some of the things people want to do on v deck of, and can't do actually not on va dot com, or is it just It's confusing and complex, and they can't find it? And uh, or are things really they have to come in person to do.

114

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:22.639

P5: They would have to come in here, for they're certain, you know they're looking for Dd. Two hundred and fourteen. I don't think most of time they're going to get that will be it. Go and get it. Get a copy of it a certified copy which we stamped and sign off on.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.299

P5: They usually look for benefits letters, but they usually can call the eight hundred number and get one. But

119

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:47.639

p5: I think most no like the way it's set up. How the call center does it, because they it's a different format opposed to so it looks. It looks different, and most of them that do ask for the benefit letter. 

It's mainly for the housing. The house, and wants to know how much they make it. So their rent goes by, you know their income

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:39.880

p5: you know, getting a housing assistance and need. Yeah, I mean, in any way to this uh, most of the Federal programs, Hud, They They require those housing authorities to get how much money they get from the Va. So they all going to come to the Va. Whether college with state you, and if it's on the Federal program, hit the letter to show their income.

Okay, we'll print that letter form.

131

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:59.290

Dave Pickett: about, you know all the things that people come in for. I know there's

132

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:16.049

Dave Pickett: every visits a little bit different. It's hard to summarize what are maybe some of the top three things you'd say people come into the office for? Okay. Um, 

Most folks are looking for the tax letter which we which we send out is His computer generated once a year is sent out um, but most time, because people move the address change, or they got a new rating.

They look to come for that letter so they can get a break on their taxes, and because they send it out once you have most people either take it, they misplace it, they throw it away. Don't realize that what it is. So they have to end up coming back into the office to get one. So that's a big one.

136

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:47.990

Um!

137

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.290

p5: The benefit letter, which is we call on the money that it is about the income.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:03.480

p5: we get a lot of not receiving benefits.

p5: you know they have client for social security of time, for whatever else they apply, for they have to show that they're not receiving any money from the from the VA.

they need to for a State benefit.  prove that they're not getting money from a different source. They're not getting the money from the Va:

147

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.210

Dave Pickett: We also talked about previously coming in to get a copy of their DD-214, The housing benefit letter, You also have a high percentage of homeless veterans that are coming in to the facility for support.

153

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.549

Dave Pickett: Um! Are there any other kind of major services that you know you'd you'd list as you know what what gets done at this facility.

155

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:14.349

p5 Well, me yeah, I mean, you know, of course, applying for benefits for initial benefits or things like that. that's a lot of my work. 

People apply for the first time for claims. that's one of the biggest things as well.

160

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.050

Dave Pickett: Okay,

161

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.020

Dave Pickett: Um.

162

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:36.469

Dave Pickett: So uh, again, we're talking to benefit offices across the country.

163

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:58.450

Dave Pickett: Um thinking about your office, and maybe versus one in a different state. Are there any, you know, unique services that maybe because they're state or local, or just because of the population you serve that you you're dealing with. That might not be at another benefit office,

164

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.550

P5: which we call chapter one hundred and fifteen, which the State provides, and it's um: for those veterans that you know low income or not, they would have to come here, and that's where that no benefit letter, or they are receiving money.

This, if it's, fits the States criteria, they make it the least amount we would do that letter

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.390

Dave Pickett: Are there any um

175

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:43.239

Dave Pickett: benefits? The State offers specifically to veterans. For instance, some States have um license. I' to go with that. So yeah, that letter, Because the chapter one hundred and fifteen.

176

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.540

P5: If you are um rated one hundred percent, or even, you know, getting I, you could be sixty-seven you still get not you being paid one hundred percent. The State gives them a thousand dollars every six months, Which is I Here it's going to be raised up to fifteen hundred dollars every six months. That's in addition to what they get from the Va.

180

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.840

P5: Or not. Make it

181

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.270

Dave Pickett: right.

182

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.230

So that's uh yeah State specific,

183

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.490

how leather

184

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:41.599

Dave Pickett: um. And then again, maybe the opposite question, thinking about other benefit offices. If you know you're familiar with some other places on the country. Are there any services you you know of that veterans are getting that they wouldn't be able to get at your location.

185

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:52.979

P5: Well, that that fifteen hundred dollars is is is definitely one that other states Don't provide you here. So some people, you know they're in Florida, and they get other things, but they don't get that money. So a lot of them end up coming back to the State because they want to get that additional fund. This is to me, then that's it may tell you that the extra money helps them.

187

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:15.029

Dave Pickett: Yeah, no, that that makes sense. Um. But nothing else. I all paying. I can think of. Okay,

188

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:23.589

Dave Pickett: Um, That's that's okay. So um want to talk through a little more detail on some of the different benefit services we we've listed out here. Um,

190

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:36.250

Dave Pickett: just kind of understanding, you know, if a veterans looking for help with you know this kind of fit, what are some of the different things

191

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:47.779

Dave Pickett: that might be sub tasks, or, you know, forms. So let's talk a little bit about um support for um Homeless veterans.

192

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:58.639

p5: Okay, So we do have someone that handles it. Um. They are tasked with the homeless better than being a coordinator for that.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.770

p5: So normally: like, I said, it all depends on what they're looking for, you know they look at the shelter we normally um. The veterans shelter down the street normally wants them to have a d two hundred and fourteen or um verification of service, and we'll provide those lettuce to them so they can have a better sleep,

199

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.680

p5: So that's a big thing there, and that. And it was such a big thing that when we went through Covid we did close for a little bit. It was a few of us in this office decided to come back in because we were concerned about the veterans, because those you figures cold outside, and if if we can't give them the letter or the Dd. Fourteen. They're going to be in the streets. They're not going to get

202

00:21:52.840 --> 00:22:06.739

Dave Pickett: um. What are some other things aside from that Td. Two hundred and fourteen to get into the shelter that you know other things that a homeless veteran might be coming in. Yeah, over with

203

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:14.029

P5: um. Usually they're looking for some type of housing, I would usually refer them back to the hospital, the Jamaica playing campus. They have a HUD-VASH office, and they're the one at a system. There's a veterans. Um Section eight vouchers that they have strictly for veterans, and I would pretty much um refer them back to that hospital so they can out this the social worker. They can assist with that program.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:52.239

Dave Pickett: Um, You mentioned that you have a um, A coordinator who focuses on uh the homeless veterans right

208

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.189

P5: assigned to that. But that hasn't been done in quite some time.

209

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:02.060

P5: So pretty much this um the other person you doing as a collateral doing,

210

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.049

Dave Pickett: got it. That sounds like there's a

211

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:13.669

Dave Pickett: that's a a common thing happening going around.

212

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.869

p5: I don't know what it is, but we're not getting the you know the help we should have in.

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:25.120

p5: to be a secretary wants to push on, what you call it outreach, and we can't do much out. We said, we don't have the people to do it, and where we are right now you know we're extremely short-handed here.

220

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:40.900

Yeah,

221

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.730

Dave Pickett: um. So um,

222

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:54.170

Dave Pickett: if uh, you know, thinking about the normal operating hours. And again, um, you're there. Other people are there, or any of the services

223

00:23:54.180 --> 00:24:07.150

Dave Pickett: easier for a vet to get on certain days, because you know the the the homeless coordinator, or the person who's serving it in that role, even if That's not their official title, is there, or it's everything pretty much. Look at it

224

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:19.709

P5: Same level of service and day in the week day, because we're short when we Short Staff you may have one person at the desk, and they're not um able to go back in the in the um in the interview room and have a one on one with that person, but the door close where they're comfortable, and make it speak about whatever it is. You know some people come into MST different things. You can't just talk to them out in the at the desk.

226

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:39.689

P5: So yes, with with us, being sure that it does affect. You know those things, what we can do

227

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:50.520

Dave Pickett: got it. So if if there's not enough people working, you're not able to do some of those those one on ones um deeper support.

228

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.720

Okay,

229

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.170

Dave Pickett: Um.

230

00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:11.520

Dave Pickett: Anything else From the perspective of you know, the homeless veteran support we talked about shelters. You talked about referring them to the Hud office which connects back to that housing benefit letter. I think you talked about earlier.

231

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:12.860

Dave Pickett: Um,

232

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:31.450

Dave Pickett: you know. Maybe a one on one. If there's you know, something else. They want to get into any other types of you know, tasks that might be associated that somebody is trying to accomplish.

233

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:33.380

P5: I want it to be um

234

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:53.080

 To get qualified for those funds from the City, cuz the city and the State, they kind of work that out that chapter 115 and we refer them there, but they usually need that letter. The no-benefits letter, or the benefits letter to bring them to get that is, sometimes they'll give them emergency funds based on that.

235

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:54.360

Dave Pickett: Okay,

236

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:56.680

Dave Pickett: Um.

237

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:10.940

Dave Pickett: And then in terms of you know, some some forms are very complicated. Uh, maybe some tasks are a little bit easier. How would you rank Some of those things? Are these relatively easy things like they show up

238

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:18.360

Dave Pickett: you. You find the DD-214 you find a letter that's pretty easy. Um, or some of these more complicated.

239

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:36.490

P5: No, um. There's times we can find most times we can find A. V. Two hundred and fourteen. There's times we can so normally, if the veteran was living in the State  when they join service. Um, The State is the record, you know, there to keep up those records, and we have a number that we call, and we ask them if they do have it, and most of the time, if they do have it on on file, they would email it back to us, and we can provide it to the veteran. 

But if the in, and if they will reserve most time, we don't have  the the state won't, have one, so this times we can't provide one to them.

244

00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:05.080

P5: Um!

245

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:12.380

P5: Then they, you know there's other phones. We'll have them fill out and send in to the records management,

246

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.089

P5: you know, to uh have one mail to them,

247

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:33.209

Dave Pickett: and um, I know I've been talking to other public contact that a lot of times, you know. It's helpful for somebody have a photo, Id but I understand that might be a particular a little bit harder for a homeless vet. Um, you know, if they don't have a permanent resonance. Is that

248

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:48.749

P5: anything about? We haven't really had that because most of the the homeless veterans are at the shelter, and the shelter provides them with? Id. And then there's some that because they take public transportation, they the the um. The transportation authority here gives them a pass, and it has their picture on it and their name. So we kind of work with them on that

250

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.850

Dave Pickett: um

251

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:07.280

Dave Pickett: anything else that you know somebody might need to bring in aside from, maybe, an Id

252

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:18.649

P5: Well, all depends on what benefit, if they're you know they're doing. Add in a a spouse or something like that, and you know they may have to bring in a marriage certificate.

253

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:28.009

P5: I I was talking specifically about like in the homeless veteran case. No, no, there's not. There's not a lot they they actually have to bring it for us to help them.

254

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:29.650

Dave Pickett: Okay, Great

255

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:36.140

Dave Pickett: Um. So let's switch over and talk a little bit about um

256

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:45.410

Dave Pickett: more broadly. Just kind of the the compensation monetary benefits, she said. That's that's a lot of what people are coming in for. Right?

257

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:52.670

Dave Pickett: Um! So how would you kind of broadly categorize. What are some of the things

Dave Pickett: that people are talking about when it comes to monetary benefits

259

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:10.609

P5: they're talking about how much money they're gonna get for what disabilities they have. Everybody believe that should be a hundred percent, You know. Um, that's one of the big talks mainly

261

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.269

Dave Pickett: so that what what is their disability rating? Is it possible to to raise it? And then,

262

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:25.720

P5: Yeah. So you know, I I will look it over, and sometimes they may have a disability that you know they

263

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:42.270

P5: It was back in one thousand nine hundred and ninety, and I have to ask you, you know you you you've never asked for increase with this condition. Has it got to be worse? And they'll say yes, and i'm say, well, you haven't done anything since one thousand nine hundred and ninety. So why don't we put in for an increase in how we can get get those things in?

264

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.260

P5: So we'll file a new claim.

265

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.940

Dave Pickett: Um! So somebody's

266

00:29:47.950 --> 00:30:06.170

P5: looking to increase their disability, rating. Wh: What would they need to provide in order to to to get that done? Well, they wouldn't need to provide anything. All they're going to do is fill out. I I will provide the claim form they would. I, I give them a choice. They can fill it out in the office, but they can take it with them

267

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.299

P5: back tobacco, mail it back,

268

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:25.869

P5: or if they decide they want to come into the office, they can do that. So most people most people like to take it because they want to take their time, and you know things information they're not sure about they i'll do it for, and they'll they like to come into the office and uh and they bring the packet back.

269

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:38.010

P5: I mean, we have people coming couple of hours away to come into the office, and then i'll tell them, Why did you come to this office? It's a close to office and your end of, you know, and they say well 

270

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:44.569

P5: They are more comfortable. Our RO always does them well, or we take care. So

271

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:51.220

P5: that's a long way. That's a long way. You can drop two and a half hours to come here. That's it.

272

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:53.790

P5: But they're happy when they leave

273

00:30:54.530 --> 00:31:11.370

Dave Pickett: got it. Yeah. So you're You're hearing of people who are, you know, rather than going to, maybe a satellite office. That's a little bit closer to them coming to the main regional office because they know they won't. Go to a Providence or the for it. If they you know they they'll, they'll drive here.

274

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:12.790

Okay

275

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:18.449

P5: to them. That's it. That's the only game to them. I was like, okay,

276

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:38.789

P5: and and for you that they probably still get great service at those locations, but they just have a perception that this is going to be better because of this location,

277

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:53.499

P5: you know they may have had an issue, and then, when they came to this RO. They will. They liked how we treated them, but you know not to say any other place is bad, but you know every day is different for people you know that can't tell the experience they had

278

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.649

with someone when they were there.

279

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:08.649

Dave Pickett: Got it. So um thinking about, you know the task increasing their disability. Rating is that something a veteran could um fill out all the forms for themselves Online,

280

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:18.809

P5: uh, or is any of that require that in person visit, or is that they they can do it online. Usually we will send them back to V. It Go to them. There's no

281

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:24.650

P5: with they going to disability, disability. They can put following the claim, and

282

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:26.320

P5: you know, to walk them through it.

283

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.990

P5: So But a lot of them don't like to do that.

284

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:35.320

P5: Yeah, they want to see a person talk to a person, and if they got questions we can answer it.

285

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.939

P5: So they would rather come into the office

286

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:54.060

Dave Pickett: now uh and then this form is this, maybe more of a complicated Uh form compared to some of the others? Is this uh, not complicated, this one? It's not to me. I don't feel as complicated. I mean. It's um

287

00:32:55.130 --> 00:33:00.909

P5: it's it's the twenty one five hundred and two-six easy, which is what they would be filling out to to file the claim.

288

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.970

Dave Pickett: Um!

289

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:07.100

Dave Pickett: So, thinking

290

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:21.759

Dave Pickett: we were talking broadly about monetary compensation, Bennet services increasing disability rating. That's just one piece of that. What are some other pieces that somebody might be coming into the office for support with around compensation?

291

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.460

P5: Okay, So there's times that um,

292

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:28.140

P5: Either someone didn't get their check,

293

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:30.089

P5: you know they monthly check

294

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.290

P5: or

295

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:49.880

P5: um with compensation either. We, you know. Someone passed away, and they didn't take them off their um their award. And now we we're talking about. We're gonna reduce it. Those are the those are the times people come Anything but money. They're coming in. Especially we send a letter that says, Hey,

296

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:56.380

P5: you know we got a We got something from social security that says that you know your spouse passed away. Um,

297

00:33:56.950 --> 00:34:05.700

P5: you need to do X, Y and Z, and send us back this this form they don't do it until we send something that says, Hey,

298

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:16.860

P5: next month we're going to reduce your benefits, and then they're in here because you know it's like, Hold up. I mean, I had that today.

299

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.339

Dave Pickett: So um

300

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:32.040

Dave Pickett: yeah, no. That makes sense that that definitely seems like that. Would I? I'd be going in the next day if I got a left like that. But since we send stuff out before that, but they don't pay no mine

301

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.070

P5: until they just see that we're actually about to take the money.

302

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:44.159

P5: Um, Oh, yeah, So that, like, I said, folks still didn't get paid um for they, you know.

303

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:46.500

P5: Yeah, multi compensation.

304

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:49.719

What else uh

305

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.540

that kind of thing i'll be. And just quickly

306

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.250

P5: then you also have um

307

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:14.019

P5: veterans. X's. They may have children with them when they come in, and they want to file It's almost like, you know. They want to get an apportionment.

308

00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:18.339

P5: It's like child support, because they So we get a lot of that, too,

309

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.970

Dave Pickett: so that's like adding a

310

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:35.089

P5: a split on the payment or something, or it's. It's not a split. It's it's well, it's it's it's, I guess, exactly what it sound like. Portion and a portion of that conversation.

311

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:48.240

Dave Pickett: And um what what would be required to set up a portioning?

312

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:50.719

P5: We would process it.

313

00:35:53.340 --> 00:36:01.569

P5: Sometimes it's approved some. It's not, because if it's going to be a detriment to the veteran they won't approve it.

314

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:02.779

Dave Pickett: Hmm

315

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:07.540

Dave Pickett: um!

316

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:17.279

Dave Pickett: Anything else uh from kind of the monetary compensation, You know broad themes of what people might be coming in for

317

00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:34.319

P5: that was my dog whining in the background. Okay, Um, yeah, no. I mean, I'm just sticking with what's what's done on a daily basis here. This is the letter for the income tax letter. That's those are the Daily

318

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.130

P5: No benefits. Letter

319

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.870

on the D, two hundred and fourteen,

320

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:49.640

P5: and always a letter, for we get a lot of not correspondence mail,

321

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:52.609

P5: which is from the housing authority,

322

00:36:52.920 --> 00:37:02.090

P5: sending us to fill out the information on there, and saying how much money the better is currently getting so they can adjust their their rent

323

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.330

P5: recording.

324

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:14.820

P5: So sometimes veterans come in with their just asking for the letter. Both times the housing authority mail and their request or fax it into us, and we complete those things.

325

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.330

P5: But that's a local thing, I think, at this point.

326

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:28.180

Dave Pickett: Okay, Um. So i'm going to now share my screen and show you a list of benefits services.

327

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:38.310

P5: We used to have a bunch of services here, but now it's not so much because, you know, we have um education

328

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.850

P5: um satellite here, and then no longer really

329

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.049

here. So

330

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:49.919

P5: folks come in here. Look at the education, and we really can't help them with that as much. We have to

331

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:54.779

P5: pretty much refer to back to the Um Education Department of Buffalo,

332

00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:01.629

P5: and you gotta have them call, and they're square to wait. They I've never had anyone not get the help in you

333

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.710

P5: over here. We used to have a call on phone.

334

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:23.980

P5: Yeah, I heard. There used to be what for education centers, and that's send it to Buffalo and Muskoki. Yeah, both the So buffaloes who we have call, but we like, I said we had a satellite. We had a two two um employees that were under the buffalo office in here, but they're no longer in here, so

335

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:30.719

folks were able to go in and sit down and have one on one with them and get the information they needed to put

336

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.779

P5: no longer at this point.

337

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:38.990

Dave Pickett: Um. So I shared my screen. Are you able to see this?

338

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:54.960

Dave Pickett: But okay, So this is um. A list of benefit services that is currently hard coded into. Va. Gov. And if somebody goes on and searches for a benefit office um, you know, these are the things that

339

00:38:55.010 --> 00:39:13.009

P5: with it, uh could be chosen from that are available or not available at particularly different offices. So just want to kind of go through this list I saw this list I want from the last meeting I had, and a lot of these things on this is we're not really doing here.

340

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.779

P5: So Yeah, most folks will come here because they see this list.

341

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:35.150

P5: You'd be a home home loan, help you there. Only thing we do here with the be a homeowner to give you the application to put in for the certificate of eligibility, so that wouldn't be something I would have there, because most calls when they come in here thinking they can sit down and sit down with a counselor that's gonna be

342

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.940

P5: So that's misleading

343

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:39.259

P5: to me.

344

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:43.299

The folks in here all the time. Well, it says it on the website, and then you know you hate to turn somebody or turn somebody back because we don't do those things.

346

00:39:50.400 --> 00:40:06.530

Dave Pickett: So let's just go through like one by one, and you know, say, like, Yes, this is actually something we help with here or oh, we shouldn't have that listed uh applying for benefits That seems like that's actually true. Right? Yes,

347

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:11.389

P5: uh what about burial claim health? We we. We help them out with the paperwork

348

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:17.920

Dave Pickett: uh disability claim help which is applied for benefits is one in the same.

349

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:18.830

Dave Pickett: Yeah,

350

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:20.279

Dave Pickett: um

351

00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:25.220

Dave Pickett: e benefits registration.

352

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:32.320

P5: We used to do the benefits here, and then they they got rid of that and put it to just va gov

353

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:37.140

Dave Pickett: right. Do you help people with uh him? V. A. Do of accounts ever

354

00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:46.859

P5: we. They took a lot of things from us, so we can't do what we used to do. Um, we. We really can't do anything with that anymore, so I wouldn't even.

355

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.640

Dave Pickett: Do you know who who would.

356

00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:55.389

Dave Pickett: Is there a place where physically people will help? Veterans set up of the a doac of account?

357

00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:08.569

P5: I don't think it's that difficult. I I don't know who would do that, because I mean you got to be a Gov, and you're on it. And then all you doing is pretty much doing the verification process.

358

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:13.209

P5: So I don't really need anyone to help you with that. As far as I, you know.

359

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.490

P5: I'm looking at it.

360

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:35.210

Dave Pickett: Yeah, that uh, if if people don't need help setting up websites, that's that's good. That's a win right um education and career counseling. Uh. So you said, this is maybe something that the counseling is not something you really support here. Yeah. So educate. So if education and correct counseling that can go to.

361

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.040

I guess we can kind of

362

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:44.860

P5: work that out with the vocational rehab, which is part of our, you know, is within the Ro,

363

00:41:45.090 --> 00:41:54.060

P5: so we can kind of leave that because that falls on the under them. But that would be kind of under the Vr and e ban, or you would say yes.

364

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.319

Dave Pickett: Um. What about education? Claim help

365

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:03.490

P5: that we don't really do anything with education? We're going to forward that to

366

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:06.259

Dave Pickett: to Buffalo.

367

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:09.350

Dave Pickett: Um family member claim help.

368

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:13.200

P5: Yeah, it's just a a claim. They could come in here and

369

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.020

okay

370

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:28.430

Dave Pickett: uh help for homeless veterans. Obviously, we talked about that pretty extensively Home loan help you said, No, that's definitely not something we actually do here. The application for Yeah,

371

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:37.189

Dave Pickett: And they could just get that online. It's what they think that means in terms of counseling. That's not actually available.

372

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.720

Dave Pickett: Okay, what about insurance claim help and financial counseling? Don't. Do any of that?

373

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.910

Okay.

374

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:45.229

Dave Pickett: So what

375

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:49.559

Dave Pickett: what have you ever dealt with an insurance claim? No,

376

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:50.609

Dave Pickett: okay.

377

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:58.679

P5: If somebody came in asking for that, do you know where you would send them?

378

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:07.940

P5: I believe that the insurance claim was going to be the life insurance. That's who I would give them a number to call. They They could square them away.

379

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:14.340

Dave Pickett: And what about financial counseling. Do you know of a place in the Va. Where that Does that know?

380

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:15.649

Dave Pickett: Okay,

381

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:26.009

P5: uh integrated disability evaluation system assistance? Yeah, we do. I Just So we do have a person that handles that here in the office. Okay,

382

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:33.589

P5: uh pensions. That's no longer in this office. They took that away. Now, just pension Management Seven Has it?

383

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.419

Dave Pickett: Okay? So so that would be

384

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:41.539

Dave Pickett: you. If somebody is asking about pensions, you refer them to Pmc:

385

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:47.370

p5 : I mean, I can just application to fill it out. But Pmc. Would be the the one process and the handle it.

386

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:53.609

Dave Pickett: Uh pre discharge, claim, help,

387

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.069

Dave Pickett: transition, help,

388

00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.600

transition, as in

389

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:15.609

P5: transition from military to a I mean that's kind of a broad,

390

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:26.459

P5: you know, to the Va. Which would be part of like the ideas the pre discharge help. I think that kind of problem fall the same, if that's what that is.

391

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:39.520

P5: Yep. Well, i'll. I'll find out how about updating direct deposit information. Yes, we do that here. But it It has changed, though, because now

392

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:48.739

P5: we have to give them a form, and actually they have to actually bring it to the bank, and the bank is going to sign off on it and put the information in it. Now, then, they come back to us.

393

00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:55.250

Dave Pickett: Okay, and then that's something you have on site

394

00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:07.150

Dave Pickett: uh great anything you would add to this list, you know, based on some of the things people come in for um that maybe Aren't on here that you do offer and see a lot.

395

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.240

P5: I guess the burial plane will go with death benefits

396

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.040

death benefits with the burial.

397

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:25.979

P5: Yeah, I think it's a death benefits with burial.

398

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.020

So

399

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.299

Dave Pickett: and you also mentioned like

400

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:35.739

Dave Pickett: people are often looking for their tax letter. Um! If somebody is looking for tax letter.

401

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:47.160

Dave Pickett: What would you put that under? Or should that be a separate item? Because that's so commonly a thing people are asking for?

402

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:48.200

Dave Pickett: Mhm

403

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.939

P5: yeah, I guess you could put that as a

404

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:59.349

P5: uh tax letter. I think we there has to be another word to use within um as far as um.

405

00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:05.579

The letter in front of me. If I did, I couldn't

406

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.220

what it is.

407

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:11.279

P5: Yeah, but yeah, I I mean, I would put that.

408

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:20.699

Dave Pickett: And you know again, thinking of this as a list that a veteran is looking at to say,

409

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:36.510

Dave Pickett: Oh, I need to go somewhere to do this. What's the the closest place to me where I could get my tax letter or get xyz anything else. All the um r and V. Let it it's R and B. Thirty, five. Let it we do,

410

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:39.149

and um

411

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.000

P5: that so they can get their um.

412

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:49.429

Dave Pickett: Their veteran plate is the registry of motor vehicles. So we do that veteran.

413

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:55.350

P5: That's a big one. We get that? That's not about that. Yeah, that's a big one.

414

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:04.589

Dave Pickett: Great anything else that's coming up as you're looking at this list.

415

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:10.259

It four, two, five, two, four

416

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.719

P5: Yes, that's correct. You welcome.

417

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:34.770

Dave Pickett: I was just uh no worries, saying if there was anything looking at this list, any other things that came up for you. You want to.

418

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:50.190

Dave Pickett: I'm sure to come me up to get off this call. Well, you know, if something does come to you you can always send me an email like, Oh, hey, This, you know, this would be great to put it because i'm go through things. I'm saying, Oh, I can't believe I forgot that.

419

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.940

P5: Oh, good! What happened? I know It's gonna happen

420

00:47:54.570 --> 00:48:03.100

Dave Pickett: uh great. Well, um! You know we've just got about twelve minutes left here. But also, you know, uh don't want to keep you

421

00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:18.169

Dave Pickett: too long if we don't have to,

422

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:34.379

Dave Pickett: you know, and then they have to leave right, because they can't do the thing they wanted to do, and that if we just had something on the website that was reminding people always bring an X or something like that as your Id but we can we? We always work around it,

423

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:40.859

P5: you know, if I can ask you enough questions about your service, and and you know other information, you could answer it.

424

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:52.359

P5: Then I know you are who you are, and then we can work that we try not to to send anybody out, because the way I feel they made it all the way here we should be able to to help them out

425

00:48:52.410 --> 00:48:55.899

P5: and not send them back to to come back again,

426

00:48:55.990 --> 00:49:10.639

P5: because if that was me I would be upset.

427

00:49:11.790 --> 00:49:13.220

The other thing. Now

428

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:25.619

P5: I can't think of a word where they get compensation for going to the appointments for the the mileage. Um, They They use some some folks to ask for that as well. That's how we go through that

429

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:45.130

Dave Pickett: um anything else that's come up. Um, you want to mention uh right now. Um or questions you have for me about where we are in the process, or anything like that.

430

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:53.359

P5: I have no clue. Two different things going doing, you know, Because are you going to be able to do appointments

431

00:49:53.620 --> 00:50:10.920

Dave Pickett: to schedule appointments through this as well. So, um the website. My team is responsible just for kind of um things that don't require a veteran to log in, so we'll just be what's information you could see about the the, you know, uh

432

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:29.840

Dave Pickett: regional benefits office without logging into any system, whereas Vera is, you know you have to log into something right? Uh. So we probably link to that or whatever the scheduling tool is. But we won't specifically. Be the team that would be building, you know, an appointment system.

433

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.029

Yeah,

434

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.939

P5: that is the terrible system.

435

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.329

What else is there? Uh,

436

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:58.220

P5: I think that folks come in the file. They claims,

437

00:51:00.010 --> 00:51:12.630

P5: Yeah, definitely bring. If they're gonna. If they're looking to add dependence to birth certificates and marriage, you know, and marriage it gets uh two big things to bring. If they're trying to wrap things up.

438

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:14.390

Um,

439

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:18.540

P5: Also there someone's coming in about um

440

00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:27.829

P5: uh like a widow or someone coming in. They it's always good to bring a test certificate as well.

441

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:32.299

Dave Pickett: Okay, their benefits

442

00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:38.719

that I can think of right now

443

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:48.579

P5: that they come to me later. But I I i'm sure i'll be emailing you later. Sounds good. I look forward to it.

444

00:51:48.620 --> 00:52:06.049

P5: Well, it's been a pleasure talking to you. This has been super insightful for me. Um! And so I really appreciate you taking the time.
