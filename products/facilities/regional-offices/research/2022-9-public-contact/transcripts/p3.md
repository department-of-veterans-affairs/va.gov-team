P3: Yes, i'm comfortable with the recording

5

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:27.350

Dave Pickett: um. So before we dive into the real depths of this, just a couple, you know broad questions. Um, Could you tell me a little bit about your role at the V Eight?

6

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.540

P3: So i'm a legal administrative specialist? I do outreach um, you know public contact stuff. Um, No interviews. I started out as a claim assistance at one point.

8

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.810

Dave Pickett: And how long have you been in this role?

9

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.489

P3: Um since Two thousand and thirteen.

10

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.310

Okay,

11

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.459

Dave Pickett: Um. And then Um! What's your favorite part of your job?

12

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:10.550

P3: Just dealing with the veterans, you know. Um, especially when they get what they're seeking like their benefits when it goes through. That's um, you know, that makes it um worthwhile working there.

13

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.569

Dave Pickett: Um! So to give you a little background about my team and what we're interested in learning about.

14

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:34.400

Dave Pickett: So um! The Va. Is currently working with seven different regional benefit offices from around the country to design a new monitorized website that will later be rolled out to every regional benefit office. So your local regional office, volunteered to be part of that group.

15

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:58.979

Dave Pickett: Um, and so, um, you all are part of like kind of our core group of people who are kind of giving us uh experience from different locations around the country. Um! So we can get a better sense of what's the day to day reality at various different locations. Um. So my first set of questions is about. You know the specifically the facility you work at um day to day.

16

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:17.230

Dave Pickett: Uh that may be different than the regional office . Right? I believe you're actually located at the Satellite Office?

17

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:29.960

Dave Pickett: And then um, would you say that's where you spend most of your time? Or is there any other location that you may be? Go to part time? That's also another facility that you know you kind of

18

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.600

Dave Pickett: do your work at

19

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:42.080

P3: um, not anymore. Uh, we used to go to a Siapan. But uh, since we've hired somebody there, we've you know we got a body there. Um, we don't file out there anymore.

20

00:02:43.160 --> 00:03:00.880

Dave Pickett: Um. So thinking about the um guan benefits office. Um! Is this a facility, a standalone building, or does it share space with other offices.

21

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.489

Dave Pickett: Um! Would you say that it's easy to get to, or there any quirks that might make it hard for somebody to find this building.

22

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.330

P3: Oh, it's pretty easy to find.

23

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:26.009

Dave Pickett: And then, once they get into the building, you know, since there's multiple offices, is there anything? Is it signage to be clear. Do people find, you know, specifically the benefits office pretty easily, or is there any struggles people might have just finding their way there?

24

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.059

P3: No, it's pretty easy. Um: yeah. We have a big sign up in the front.

25

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.080

Dave Pickett: Great

26

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:38.189

Dave Pickett: um! And then what are the uh kind of opera standard operating hours that people could come in um for assistance.

27

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:47.929

P3: So our office ours are from eight to three, forty-five, that's where we take in our customers. Um! But we're here from seven, fifteen to three or

28

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:54.210

P3: four Pm. You know, answering phones if we have to.

29

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.880

P3: Yes, Okay.

30

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:13.850

Dave Pickett: Um. So if you were speaking to somebody who's then, if a beneficiary could receive benefits. But Isn't necessarily deeply familiar with the Va. Maybe they just got out of service. Maybe their family member, who doesn't really fully understand. How would you describe what they could do at this

31

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.929

Dave Pickett: this specific office? In contrast to you know the a medical centers, or anything? What? What what would you tell them about this office?

32

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:40.340

P3: So that's when we go into on the three different administrations, You know we discuss the three different administrations what we do. Um! And then um, we try to bring him in because it's better to speak with them face to face rather than over the phone, because that's again. The The The Federal Va offices are not located in the same building, like other regional offices where they have the medical center. They're co-located. So the ours uh with veterans get confused with the the different locations because of the clinic um  So So we try to bring them in, and then we just explain the difference between our offices. What we do, the benefits we adjudicate or administer,

35

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.010

Dave Pickett: and what are what are some of the benefits that you administer and adjudicate on?

36

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.330

P3: Um. So we deal with education benefits um Life Insurance, v. A. Home known just the general on the homelands and education we do. The biggest one we deal with is compensation and pension uh survivors benefits.

39

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:44.639

Dave Pickett: Um! So thinking about and again about the the facility. Uh when people are coming in, how often does somebody have an appointment versus just kind of walks in to get help?

40

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.240

P3: Um! So

41

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.980

P3: we have two slots every hour um for uh appointments, and then um

walk in. So I say, we get maybe like five to six walk in a day.

44

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:11.460

Dave Pickett: Um! Is there a typically wait time, or are people getting help pretty quickly? They're getting help pretty quickly. Got it. Are there any?

45

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.069

P3: Yeah, we we don't um typically have wait times. Um, I mean, unless we're down to like one counselor. But we always have to have two here, so

47

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:30.019

Dave Pickett: got it. Um! Are there any busier days or times of day that you notice

48

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.950

P3: um

49

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.950

P3: Mondays right before closing, and Fridays.

Then it starts to die down like once. They are kind of slow. But yeah, Monday and Friday the busiest. Got it.

51

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.290

Dave Pickett: Um,

52

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:57.560

Dave Pickett: in terms of you know how veterans are getting there. Do you have a sense of our people driving? Are they taking public transit? Um! Any sort of thing about how they're typically arriving,

53

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.949

Dave Pickett: driving, driving, and this parking pretty easy there.

P3: Oh, Yes, yes, got it. You have a huge park in here.

55

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.040

Dave Pickett: Um!

56

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:26.690

Dave Pickett: So um listed through some of the different services that you'll help out with you, said education, life insurance, home loan, um compensation pension survivors benefits. Uh, was there anything else that I missed that you listed out?

57

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.249

P3: Um both? We have. So we have two accounts here.

58

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.889

Dave Pickett: Okay, Anything else that um, you know.

59

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.299

Um, we do get a lot of um like defense increase, you know. Um. And so that so like that Yeah. So like like retirees and um and survivors, or you know the ones that are receiving survivors benefit plan. 

Um, they see the as being part of the military.: So we do get them coming in um, you know. And of course we're gonna give them the information and get a hold of somebody from the fast. So DFAS

63

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.970

P3: um we get

64

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.879

P3: those kind of customers set up. We kind of help them with uh everything uh a lot of stuff to outside the Va.

65

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:29.409

Dave Pickett: Um, and could you you? But is that d F. A. St. Or is, how how do you spell that?

66

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:48.699

Dave Pickett: Uh: d fast? D um f as defense financing and accounting services? Okay, And so you you can't necessarily help them with the specifics, but you help reroute them, because, you know you get enough in that. You kind of know who they need to talk to, or where they could go next.

67

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.780

Dave Pickett: Um!

68

00:08:50.090 --> 00:09:07.740

Dave Pickett: Thinking about um, You know your facility uh versus other places across the uh the country where you know veterans might be going in for benefits. Are there any kind of services that are maybe unique? Uh to your location? That, or that you might see a higher frequency of

69

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.629

P3: No, I can't think of anything. I mean,

70

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:21.629

P3: yeah, I haven't had like the opportunity to work at other locations to, you know. Compare Yeah.

71

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:38.310

Dave Pickett: So um. So you know, uh or you know, thinking about you.. You know you're probably in common conversations with anything you know about that, you know. Maybe those sites

72

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.810

Dave Pickett: deal with or Don't deal with, that. You have a particular different angle on something that makes your location unique.

73

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:58.259

P3: Hmm. That's tough, I I think, for our location, because it is such a small community, and there's many veterans. Um. The uniqueness is that uh, when they come in, we actually talk to these guys to our customers like family, because we treat each other here like family. So it's um, you know they come to us, and they tell us the difference between their experiences here versus the ones, and you know, when they go to the mainland so like we would help them. We would help our customers fill out their forms, and what I've got from other customer or from veterans is um depending on where they go in the um. The states of the mainland uh some locations don't help them fill out the form, so you just give them the form, tell the customers to fill it out themselves, and then submit it

78

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:45.109

Dave Pickett: so like they they're maybe getting a a a more full level of service here. Um,

79

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:54.520

Dave Pickett: because of either. You know you have a You're not overloaded with veterans coming in right. You said there's no way times, but but that also just kind of a cultural thing.

80

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.690

Yeah.

81

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:13.720

Dave Pickett: Got it? Um. So um thinking about, you know all the different benefits that veterans are eligible for? Are there any that? Um, you're you're not able to help them with where you might need to refer them to another location. Um to get deeper support

82

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:23.689

P3: For education benefits we can't provide like specific information to the customer. We can only provide general information, so we would have to refer them to the Education Call Center like Muskogee. So I mean, that would be helpful if we can get some sort of access to like. I mean just seeing the status of their application, or it's been received. 

Or, you know, if we're able to print out like their certificate of eligibility,

84

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:54.249

Dave Pickett: so that specifically run education that submit. You can't necessarily give them an update on this to claim status like you said for different other services.

85

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.410

P3: Correct? Got it? Yeah,

86

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.779

Dave Pickett: Um, And you said, there's a call center. You refer to them to for that.

87

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.079

P3: Uh, It's a mustogi regional office. Okay,

88

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.460

Scooby.

89

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.870

Dave Pickett: Um.

90

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:15.149

Dave Pickett: So you listed out a bunch of different services here. Um!

91

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:35.590

Dave Pickett: And so i'm gonna go through each of them a little bit and ask you some. Follow up questions. Um. But before I do that first. Uh, I just want to get your impression, thinking you know of the time you've worked there all the veterans and other beneficiaries you've seen come through what are maybe the top three things that people are coming into the office for help with

92

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:45.309

P3: top three would be um compensation education and a pension.

93

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.340

Dave Pickett: Okay,

94

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:53.439

Dave Pickett: Um. So let's start with um compensation.

95

00:12:53.670 --> 00:13:03.580

Dave Pickett: So um, when you're uh, when a veteran has, or beneficiary has a compensation related question or is trying to accomplish. Um!

96

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:22.359

Dave Pickett: Something is there? You know, one task that it's repeated that people are looking for help with, or they're a series of different tasks like applying for compensation, and then maybe some follow up uh on a regular basis. What are the different kind of sub pieces of the compensation picture you if you had this

97

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:24.909

Dave Pickett: paint that out for someone who's not familiar with it.

98

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:38.509

p3: Um, that's that's kind of tough, I mean, because it really did so. Um if you have a retiree coming in for the first time the initial compensation, and that's where we would discuss, like everything, all the benefits that we offer. Um, but it starts out with the application. Um, their medical records, you know. Service human records

101

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.359

p3: D: two hundred and fourteen. Um, but yeah, it's. It's kind of difficult to try and answer that question. I don't know, and then we have like um the veterans that are already service connected. Um, so it's different things that we do for different customers based on what they're buying for or

103

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:22.639

Dave Pickett: so. A retiree is one group that gets a a certain type of compensation benefit the service connected. That's a different group that has a whole different kind of set of norms and expectations. Is that what you're saying?

104

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:36.950

P3: Not not uh uh, certain compensation, but different processes. So um yeah, So like for a retiree they could be, they could fall under the BDD. Which is the benefits delivery and discharge.

 Um if they have ninety to one hundred and eighty days left of active duty. Right?

106

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.960

Dave Pickett: Okay,

107

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:52.990

Dave Pickett: um. So aside from retiree and service connected, Is there any other large category of um, you know,

108

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.419

Dave Pickett: veterans or beneficiaries who are looking for help with compensation claims?

109

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.990

P3: Oh, the the compensation, and especially with the new Oh, what is this? The Patronage Expansion Act? We've been seeing a lot of veterans coming in um to get that service connection so they can get access to base. So we've been getting a lot of that.

111

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.549

P3: Uh? Well, the patronage expansion.

112

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:22.180

P3: We're starting to see the Pact act as well. Um,

113

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:29.029

P3: but that was like the biggest One's pasture was the patronage expansion of the expansion.

114

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:44.440

P3: Um, Because, again, it gives veterans who are at least zero percent service connected uh the ability to shop on base and being here, Shopping on base is very helpful, because I mean the price of gas. It's like two dollar difference or a dollar fifty difference

115

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.809

P3: on base versus outside. The food is a lot cheaper.

116

00:15:49.210 --> 00:16:05.070

Dave Pickett: Um! And that patronistic expansion is that something that you know veterans can get across the country. I I This is the first I've heard of it. I'm very new to the ecosystem, so i'm I'm. I'm just curious to hear more about that benefit. And um where that applies.

117

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:11.939

P3: Yes, it applies to any better. That is, um service connected at zero percent.

118

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:19.560

Dave Pickett: Got it, and that was the the patronage, expansion or the patriots expansion. Sorry.

119

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:32.850

Dave Pickett: Just make sure patronage. So just basically allowing veterans to be able to take advantage of um shopping facilities on different military bases. Correct? Got it?

120

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:46.910

Dave Pickett: Um and um. So you said that was a when that rolled out. That was a big uh influx of people looking for, you know, uh compensation benefits or something along that line.

124

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:10.040

Dave Pickett: somebody who's uh in that retiree phase coming into apply for compensation benefits. Um, you know what you mentioned, Dd: Two hundred and fourteen. There were things they might need to bring in to be prepared for that initial meeting.

125

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:20.849

P3: Um, just to like copies of their service streaming records. Um, you know, on a list of conditions they want to claim because we won't, be able to tell them what to claim.

We get a system with their application. But we can't for them to claim got it,

127

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.680

Dave Pickett: and um

128

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:45.950

Dave Pickett: in terms of you know, there's a variety of different tasks that veterans, you know, might be working on. Some of them might be easier or harder. W. Is compensation on the easier side. Or would you say that's one of the more complicated processes?

129

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:54.069

P3: I I think it's um. It's come a long way. I mean from the time that I applied um, I think it's a lot easier and a lot quicker. I mean. I'm starting to see claims come back. Um, you know, within the timeframe our our goal, which is one hundred and twenty-five days right the same claims um coming less than that. So there's a there's a good turnaround time. So it's been. Yes,

133

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:22.190

p3: and it's easier. Um if you are um, you know, if you have like. If you're good with computers, not for veterans or veterans that are not as good, then it might be very, you know, it might be difficult for them, because again, that's where they get communication with, like the uh, the contractors that do our Cmp examinations, they would send them emails. And if the veteran don't have emails then.

136

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:48.099

P3: Oh, it's gonna be through snail mail and and mail here is, take some time.

137

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.740

Dave Pickett: Um

138

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.010

Dave Pickett: great, that's all super helpful. Um! Wanna

139

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:15.289

Dave Pickett: take some time to talk about some of the other services. So that was um, really about compensation and pension. You kind of think about those two things as connected. Correct. Yeah, um. So talking about um. Talk about vocational rehabilitation.

140

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:34.700

Dave Pickett: Um, sometimes. Vr and E uh, or you know, depending on who you're talking to. So they i'm sorry they actually changed that. It's not voc rehab. It's the veteran readiness and employment services. Right? Sorry I I um. You know, when I came in that it was vocally I when they changed it. Yeah, absolutely.

141

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:40.410

Dave Pickett: Um. So um tell me something a little bit about again. What are the um?

142

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:48.010

Dave Pickett: What are some of the features of somebody who needs help with V or any what they might be coming in for. How they get support um

143

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.270

Dave Pickett: different things they might need to do

144

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:54.989

P3: so for the VR&E program. We do have two counselors here.

145

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.639

P3: Um, I am a product of the Vrn program. I want your program. Um, that's how I ended up here, um, you know, and and that's a very good program. Um, you know they they gave me these tools. They? I uh so I did um. Was it on the job training here and got picked up? But that's what they're uh veterans that are coming in are looking for like independent living being and um employment opportunities or assistance with uh like employment.

150

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.639

p3: So just to give you a um picture. It's very small, and we don't have a lot of uh assistance when it comes to like um. Oh, we call that a resume noting, So that's one of the big things that um Vrni can assist with is connecting veterans with uh like resume, you know, helping them with their resumes and stuff.

156

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.490

Dave Pickett: Got it.

157

00:20:52.660 --> 00:21:10.439

Dave Pickett: Um, and you know, uh you mentioned there's two counselors who help out with that. Um! Is there always one onsite in those normal hours, or you know, or there may be different days where you know that is, you know somebody could get help with that versus other days. You know that's unavailable.

158

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.439

P3: Um, there's always someone here on site. Okay,

159

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:14.640

Dave Pickett: um.

160

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:25.000

Dave Pickett: Are there any services you have that might have a dependency on? You know, certain days of the week Somebody can help you with or or not? Or is everything pretty consistent throughout the week?

161

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.820

p3: Oh, that's so on Mondays. Here VBS goes downum! It goes down for maintenance. So it gets very difficult. So like, for some services like uh, like all the services that we provide uh compensation and pension right, we we're not able to go in and and see the status of the veterans claim. We kind of go in and review the veterans documents, so Mondays are is very difficult. Um

164

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:58.399

p3: vms is typically down from the time that we get into around nine Am. So there's like two hours there that we're kinda just guessing in the guessing game of the veteran. I mean, you know we try our best. We you share Udo again. When Vbms is down we cannot pull up um.

166

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.929

P3: We call this um

167

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:25.059

Dave Pickett: the Unified Service desk studio. Yup! I heard about that in a different call earlier today. I'm learning all the a whole bunch of new acronyms that's been.

168

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:27.639

P3: Yeah, we just started using that program, too.

169

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:29.080

Dave Pickett: Got it?

170

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:40.529

Dave Pickett: Um, anything. So aside from that, you know, kind of routine outage Monday mornings, any other kind of times where certain things are, or maybe harder to process.

171

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.670

P3: Oh,

172

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.510

Dave Pickett: got it? Um!

173

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:55.840

Dave Pickett: I just check my list here again. Um! So we've talked about compensation pension um the r and E. Um.

174

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:03.489

Dave Pickett: Let's talk a little bit about life insurance claims uh you mentioned that as one of the services.

175

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:10.889

Dave Pickett: So. Um! What are some of the tasks that a veteran might have associated with? Uh life insurance?

176

p3: like they're so when they come in, we just assist the veteran our customers with the application and mending it off. So that's another benefit that we don't have access to a direct access. So that's kind of where we just um a system with the application. Send it in, and with that again we kind of follow up. So we just give them the contact number to follow up with um

179

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.069

P3: prudential or pay life insurance.

180

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:49.849

Dave Pickett: So that's similar to maybe education, and where it's when you kind of just help them along. But then you have to pass them off to somebody else for updates. Correct.

181

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.140

Got it

182

00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.609

P3: uh those with home loan

183

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:02.220

Dave Pickett: um,

184

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.379

Dave Pickett: And then you know, thinking about uh

185

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:21.519

Dave Pickett: again. Um! A veteran who's coming in um for the first time might need help with a couple of different things. Um, uh, you know. How much are they able to um show up and maybe get help with

186

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:35.329

Dave Pickett: therne versus compensation and pension without making appointments? Do you know, Are there any sort of resource strains that you have where it's. You need people to be making appointments versus just join up.

187

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:39.230

P3: Yeah. So when it comes to um,

188

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:52.509

P3: so many of a time for compensation. We want a a set up, an appointment that way. We have time to actually, you know, go into the veterans file review it. Make sure that we're filling out the documents correctly. Um!

189

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.389

P3: Our veteran comes in again. I'll just walk in, and we have appointments that are already scheduled. It's going to be difficult for us to try and see the the walk in, and then also assist the the veteran that's so scheduled. So no, we try to schedule them, and if it's for compensation um like for a claim. But if it's just like a quick, you know education uh inquiry, you know, like. If they have some, have some questions, then we'll give them information. Set their appointment if they need to.

192

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.570

P3: Um.

193

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:36.760

Dave Pickett: So i'm gonna switch uh gears here for a second, and i'm going to share my screen and pull up a list of services.

194

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:45.189

Dave Pickett: Okay, Are you able to see uh see my screen? Okay,

195

00:25:45.320 --> 00:26:02.289

Dave Pickett: Yes. So this is a list of services that is currently uh hard coded into the Va Gov website. That is a list of services that may or may not be available at different Um, you know, via offices around the country. So

196

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:21.649

Dave Pickett: um just kind of want to go through these, and you know for each one, you know. See? Say, like Yep, that's you know something we offer, or you know this is something we don't offer, and might need to refer out, or just sort of any other thoughts that you have, as we kind of go through one by one sound good.

197

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:29.360

Dave Pickett: Yeah. So applying for benefits pretty broad. Uh, but I assume that's a lot of what you're helping with.

198

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.990

P3: Yes,

199

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.100

Dave Pickett: um

200

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.050

Dave Pickett: Burial claim help.

201

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:36.770

P3: Yes,

202

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:48.970

Dave Pickett: so that's that's something You support um pretty standard something that we assist the with the application process. We assist the

203

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:51.720

Dave Pickett: uh disability claim help.

204

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.180

P3: Yes,

205

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.570

Dave Pickett: E benefits registration help.

206

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.890

P3: Yes, okay,

207

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:01.620

Dave Pickett: Education and career counseling.

208

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:09.809

Dave Pickett: I that would full under folk. We have, I believe, our Vr. And I believe again, i'm not.

209

00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.840

Yeah.

210

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.150

Dave Pickett: Um. What about education? Claim help?

211

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:15.500

P3: Yes,

212

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:16.660

Dave Pickett: okay.

213

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.880

Dave Pickett: Family member claim help,

214

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:36.699

family number. I don't understand. 

Dave Pickett: Um, that that's great. If you don't understand, then you know, veterans might not understand. So what would you think that means versus um. You know what it might not mean.

215

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:43.080

P3: Um dependency uh like uh survivor benefits family number.

216

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.040

Dave Pickett: Okay.

217

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:52.540

Dave Pickett: So uh dependent benefits, survivor benefits which are two totally different types of things.

218

00:27:52.560 --> 00:28:08.569

P3: Um, it could include both of those things. But those are separate. Is that kind of what you're saying?

219

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:28.090

Dave Pickett: Yeah. So is, Yeah, if you're thinking about, you know the deb benefits that are available to family members. Do you think of that? Separate from education? Um benefits? Or is that family member just a type of person who's eligible for education benefits, you know.

220

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.340

P3: For me, I think it's just the type of person

221

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.370

P3: for benefits. Yeah,

222

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.650

Dave Pickett: um.

223

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:45.439

Dave Pickett: And then in terms of when you're talking to veterans or beneficiaries of either type, you know. How How do family members sometimes factor into those conversations

224

00:28:46.500 --> 00:29:02.309

Dave Pickett: like. How often are veterans just looking for support for their own benefits? Versus how often are they trying to maybe get benefits for their family and vice versa. How often do you? Are you talking to family numbers who are coming in, you know. Um for benefits from a veteran?

225

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:08.589

P3: Um, not often. You know we don't. Yeah, we don't get a lot of that like veteran looking for um benefits for family member. Okay,

229

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:21.840

Dave Pickett: that would mostly just be education if it was correct. Okay,

230

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.350

Dave Pickett: um

231

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.050

Dave Pickett: help for homeless veterans.

232

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.450

P3: Yes,

233

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:32.030

Dave Pickett: um V. A home loan help,

234

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:39.539

P3: general information and help with application. Yes, we just can't bring out their Ceos

235

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:50.299

Dave Pickett: um, which I wrote down earlier, their certificate of something. I have it in my other notes. Been learning a lot today. Um!

236

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.410

Dave Pickett: How about insurance, claim health and financial counseling.

237

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:02.289

P3: We assist with the insurance claim. Um, that's just uh applying for the claim like assisting them with their application, but not fine financial counseling.

239

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:11.210

Dave Pickett: Okay, So if I now. So those are two different services to you. Lumping them together

240

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.139

Dave Pickett: is maybe not true, because you can help with one, but not the other

241

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.060

P3: right?

242

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.080

Dave Pickett: Okay,

243

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:22.110

Dave Pickett: Um. Do you know of a place that does offer financial counseling?

p3: No, not aware of?

245

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:32.670

Dave Pickett: So you you're not even sure that that is a service that any Va benefits office actually offers.

246

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.009

Dave Pickett: Okay, I good to know that.

247

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:46.579

Dave Pickett: Uh we're talking to a whole bunch of people. So you know i'll we'll. We'll find out as we go through. Um. What about integrated disability evaluation system, assistance? Id Es:

248

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:47.890

P3: Yes.

249

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.849

Dave Pickett: So um.

250

00:30:51.670 --> 00:31:08.310

Dave Pickett: There are obvious. I think there are different sites where you could get. Do that integrated disability, evaluation. Um! Does that mean people can do that evaluation on site, or that you would be referring them to another location. What is that referring?

251

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:16.440

Dave Pickett: So if they were actually looking for a site, they could go. You can't offer it, but there are places they could go

252


00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:26.820

Dave Pickett: um

255

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.249

Dave Pickett: pensions. Obviously you talked about quite a bit.

256

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:34.079

Dave Pickett: Um. What about pre discharge claim? Help?

257

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.500

P3: Yes.

258

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.460

Dave Pickett: Okay.

259

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.460

Dave Pickett: Uh transition help?

260

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:41.290

Nope,

261

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.380

Dave Pickett: No, that's not something you offer.

262

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.200

Dave Pickett: What is transition help in your opinion.

264

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.259

Transition help is um like the TAPS,

265

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.579

: I think like going through different um, you know free things and what's available out there, you know.

267

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:08.319

Dave Pickett: And then if somebody needed that, where would they be getting that?

268

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:14.100

 Um! So they have uh in the Va. Contracting there's a transition assistance program out here uh with the Navy and um Air Force.

270

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:27.659

Dave Pickett: And so that would be maybe a on base or something that that

271

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:40.859

Dave Pickett: Have you ever had anybody come in looking for that, I assume not. But I know you also get people who are going to the wrong location. So not all around the possibility. Um updating direct deposit information.

272

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:42.120

P3: Yes,

273

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.930

Dave Pickett: okay, um. And then vocational rehabilitation and employment help. We already talked about

274

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.480

Dave Pickett: um looking across this list uh anything that jumps out to you as like.

275

00:32:53.690 --> 00:33:01.530

Dave Pickett: You know that doesn't really seem like it fits or clear things that you know are seem to be missing, that you would add to this list.

276

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:12.059

P3: Um, Nothing I can think of that's missing. But the it is not something that we directly deal with, and it's like uh regional office so I don't really see that here,

 so you wouldn't list it as something that people could get at your Sattelite Office. You would more say, Go to the Regional Office for that

280

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.520

P3: correct

281

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:26.990

Dave Pickett: Great

282

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:34.910

Dave Pickett: um. Thank you for that. Let me take a moment here. Reorient myself.

283

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:38.500

Dave Pickett: Um

284

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:58.939

Dave Pickett: thinking through some of the different services we've talked about um, you know. Uh, obviously, there are lots of acronyms and terms within the Va. That we use to refer to those things versus how veterans or beneficiaries may talk about them. There are any like big areas where you you know somebody comes in saying, Oh, i'm looking for this, and you're like, Oh, that's

285

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:10.640

Dave Pickett: that's this. Let me route them that way where there, if a veteran was looking at a list of services they'd be looking for a term that's different than how we would have listed it. You know, on that that list. If that makes sense,

286

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.390

P3: I think it's a accident that we use as dependency in that many compensation uh, but a lot of the survivors and veterans here uh refer to just the Ic. And not dependencies in that many compensation. So i'm in so so they want d I see. Help and right. That's not on that list. So

288

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:38.570

P3: they might be like, Well, can I get help with that if it's not on the West,

289

294

00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:07.590

Dave Pickett: So we talked uh we haven't really talked about survivor benefits, but that was one of the ones you listed. So I want to circle back to that for a second

295

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:19.330

Dave Pickett: um, And can you tell me a little bit about? You know what is the um again? Some of the steps uh around somebody who has wants to get uh survivor benefits

296

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.030

Dave Pickett: and how they might interact with your office.

297

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.779

P3: Um,

298

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:41.359

P3: so it can it We can Um! It can be either through a flag application, or they would come in directly to us, and we would a system with um like their D. Ic. Application their burial reimbursement application

299

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:46.459

Dave Pickett: um

300

00:35:47.510 --> 00:36:01.199

Dave Pickett: and Um! Somebody who's coming in for survivor benefits. Um, you know What are some as their paperwork that they might have to bring with them? Um, you know, for a first visit versus a follow up visit. Um,

301

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:11.939

Dave Pickett: You know any sort of thing you've encountered where you know, since survivors Maybe haven't been dealing with the Va. Directly. They They're not as familiar with paperwork that they need, or don't need

302

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:28.160

P3: um so for initial visit. Um, no, they don't necessarily bring anything uh just their photo, id, and of course um I mean they have the veterans DD-214 That would be helpful. But well, we don't necessarily need that for the burial. Um,

 They typically come back because they would need an itemized receipt for the burial reimbursement.

305

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.740

P3: Okay, we can still submit it. But yet.

306

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.979

Dave Pickett: Um!

307

00:36:50.120 --> 00:37:02.060

Dave Pickett: So thinking about um uh veterans coming in uh beneficiaries coming into the office, you said, there's no real wait times um. People are getting um, you know,

308

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:18.409

Dave Pickett: kind of helped relatively quickly. You help them as much as you can, and then you can refer them out. Are there any common, you know, frustrations that you know you hear veterans voicing at the office. Um! That might be good to know um as we're building out the website.

309

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.930

P3: Um,

310

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.240

P3: So

311

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.689

P3: the appointments like the you know. The the veterans couldn't just walk in um, and they would question why they need an appointment for like compensation.

But once we expand it to them, and especially the ones that um experienced our office before we went on to deployment basis, and we explain to them Um! When they get a better understanding of it. Then it's more.

I I guess the there they're good with it.

316

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:54.829

p3: Yeah, because I mean, I've I've seen. I mean a lot of uh before we had the appointment base. The wait time was like, maybe ten, fifteen minutes Um! And some would walk up because our lobby would be filled, and we only had, like two counselors at the time. So so, having the appointments is actually really helped with that, that, you know, people get in and get out as as long as they have an appointment, and if they don't have appointment, you kind of tell them why they need to make one

320

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.670

P3: help the veteran versus trying to rush to get the next customer in.

322

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.770

Dave Pickett: So

323

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.679

P3: yeah, I think it helps us as counselors with the appointment.

324

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:42.509

Dave Pickett: Great

325

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:44.259

Dave Pickett: um.

326

00:38:45.070 --> 00:39:00.869

Dave Pickett: So. Um! You've mentioned a couple of times when somebody's coming in, regardless of kind of what they're doing. Photo, Id dd two hundred and fourteen. Those are kind of common things that are are always going to be helpful uh any sort of other. Um, you know

327

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:05.090

Dave Pickett: typical things that people are going to want, regardless of why they're coming in,

328

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:29.600

Dave Pickett: or or you know another way to think of it. Um, you know. Can you think of experiences where you know somebody's come in. They want to get something done, but they're missing something that you know You kind of need them to bring uh. Is that a common thing, or people usually as well prepared as anybody else.

329

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:35.169

P3: No, we I that's common when it comes to a supplemental claim.

330

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.740

P3: Okay, um

331

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.709

P3: of no, they will come in and um that,

and we need to explain to them that in order for us to submit a supplemental claim, we wouldn't need you and material evidence. So we would go over that with them. And and that's where we would have, you know. Do it intent to file if they don't have the evidence, and then um,

you know, schedule a future exam with it. I'm gonna bring in those evidence.

334

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:07.599

Dave Pickett: And um again for somebody who doesn't know what a a supplemental claim is what's What's the difference between a supplemental claim and a I guess a primary claim

335

00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:15.469

P3: so, and then the supplemental is for is like a reconsideration for um uh denied claim denial. That's been over a year: or a decision that's within a year, and you disagree with it that something you disagree with. You can submit a supplemental to get reconsidered.

339

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:46.770

Dave Pickett: Um! And are those that process of you know this reconsideration? Is that true? Across multiple that benefit types. Uh? Or is that really, specifically just part of compensation and pension per se

340

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:54.600

Dave Pickett: compensation? Attention

341

00:40:54.670 --> 00:41:00.720

P3: claim supplemental claims that kind of stuff. Yeah. Survivor benefits and survivor benefits. Yeah.

342

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:15.600

Dave Pickett: Um. So for us, if they're coming in for a supplemental claim, which is maybe a subcategory of those, then they should have these additional pieces of information versus the initial claim. They don't need all of that.

343

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:25.980

Dave Pickett: Any other um, you know scenarios in which somebody needs kind of a additional things that they're maybe forgetting on a regular basis.

344

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.239

P3: No, we can't think of anything.

345

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:48.919

P3: Um, that's good. That means the things are getting yeah. Um, the e benefits portion. Um, Some don't have two forms of Ids.

Okay, I worked what I assisted one yesterday not to reschedule, because when you had one Id

348

00:41:58.420 --> 00:41:59.379

Dave Pickett: got it.

349

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:01.919

Dave Pickett: Um.

350

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.229

Dave Pickett: So um!

351

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.069

Dave Pickett: Let me just go back here.

352

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:22.659

Dave Pickett: Um! Anything else that you know you think uh would help veterans or beneficiaries uh prepare for a visit in advance. That should be, you know, kind of listen on a website as we build that out

353

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.650

P3: uh for the survivors benefit. Um! There is that a survivors Kit.

 I mean, if it was there on the website, where it's easy for a family, members or survivors to just, you know, locate it. That would be helpful because it gives them a step by step. What form you know gives them a pre-field. Um.

358

Dave Pickett: Yeah, and where do you get that survivors Kit. Is that off of um

360

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:18.739

Dave Pickett: B A. S, or Od. Something I you do. Uh, where do you get the survivors Get

361

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:23.580

P3: what is? What? What is the new acronym for for that?

362

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.760

P3: Oh,

363

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.349

Dave Pickett: okay, Ot:

364

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:33.669

Dave Pickett: E: D: Okay, I will find out what that means.

365

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:34.770

Dave Pickett: Great?

366

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:47.140

Dave Pickett: Uh, yeah. I was the last person I spoke to was also mentioning that you know when they have survivors coming in. That's they print that out, and that that is, you know, covers things so well that you know

367

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:50.139

Dave Pickett: it'd be great if that was more accessible. So

368

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.760

Dave Pickett: uh glad to hear that confirmation on that.

369

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.649

Dave Pickett: Um! Well, great um

370

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:08.029

Dave Pickett: anything else. Um! That's come up for you today that you wanted to circle back on, or had more insight on, or questions you have for me about. You know our process?

371

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:14.260

P3: Um, no. So well. So this website that you're building Is it like

372

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:19.370

P3: like what they're trying to do with va Gov. Um? You know they're

373

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:22.640

P3: integrate all that. Okay.

374

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:51.210

Dave Pickett: So yeah, we're um. Our team, you know, previously built the Va. Do of websites for the medical centers and vet centers. And so Vba is kind of next in line to get kind of this modernized thing that'll be, you know better on mobile devices. Um, and you know, have sort of integrated templates. Um, you know that. Apply again as much as each uh Vba regional office or satellite office fits into uh

375

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:57.219

Dave Pickett: a model that we can, you know, kind of standardize that, and make sure all the information is accurate, and up to date

376

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.950

P3: cool, cool.

377

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:14.640

Dave Pickett: Um, And you know you mentioned Obviously there's a a relationship between you and the Regional Office, right that that's kind of the bigger uh regional office that they might go to for Ides specifically.

378

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:22.039

Dave Pickett: Um, you know. Do you think of uh yourself as really deeply connected there? Or do veterans really think?

379

00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:41.099

Dave Pickett: Are the guan veterans really thinking about you first? And that's not even a consideration. How do you kind of see that relationship as satellite to regional office? Um, that's something we're curious about how much that information might be on a a, a combined page, or, you know, two separate pages, or

380

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:44.970

Dave Pickett: where there's connections, or you know, separations that are important.

381

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:56.910

P3: Yeah. So we're Uh, I guess there is a big separation. I mean, we're a public contact, more of outreach uh the regional offices where you have your um, your veteran service representatives, the ones that are actually working on the claim like making decisions. And we're just our office here is just um, you know, assisting with the application process, guiding them in the right direction. So when veterans come in um, and they see us um, they don't really look at us as being part of the regional office.

384

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.930

Dave Pickett: Good to know because of Yeah,

385

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:25.059

Dave Pickett: um, and um

386

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:41.179

Dave Pickett: uh anything else like uh from the veteran um experience when they're coming in, you know frustrations or pain points that you know. Uh, you want us to know about so we can, you know, see if we can alleviate any of them from a web perspective.

387

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.129

P3: We don't

388

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:50.679

P3: really get a lot of complaints here regarding Vba. It's mainly uh

389

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.580

P3: health care.

390

00:46:54.220 --> 00:47:04.109

P3: Yeah, that's you know. There that's trying to get into making appointments. Um. But with our office we don't really get that many complaints, you know. Yeah.

391

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.459

P3: So there they might have

392

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:14.710

Dave Pickett: frustrations about other parts of the Va. Or the Va. As a diffuse idea, but not specific to how your office runs

393

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.070

Dave Pickett: great. It's great to hear.

394

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:31.630

Dave Pickett: Um. Well, I really appreciate you taking the time today? Um, I think that's the end of my questions. Uh, Did you have anything else you want to ask me about? Uh happy to talk more about the web process, but also happy to give you some time back.

395

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:37.529

P3: No, um. Well, when when is it? Um! When do you project it, you know,

396

00:47:37.540 --> 00:48:04.070

Dave Pickett: putting this out this this? Yeah. So we're We're in the process now of you know, kind of talking to different people doing that research so that we can then put together the list of Here's the things we've learned that we definitely need to build out, and then, you know, we'll probably have an mpp sometime in the early two thousand and twenty-three that we'll roll out to. You know these first seven locations get some feedback, and then you know um roll out more broadly across the country after that. So

397

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:19.429

Dave Pickett: that's kind of the the general timeline. Uh, you know everything uh can be thrown off by other priorities coming up. But that's that's a harder and understanding. I'd say,

398

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:25.129

P3: Well, thank you so much.
