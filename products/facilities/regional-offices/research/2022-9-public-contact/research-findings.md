## Research Goals

7 Veteran Benefit Administration (VBA) Regional Office (RO) facilities will be involved in the launch of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for publishing VBA facility information in Drupal starting in early 2023.

The MVP will give the designated CMS editors a basic set of functionality to publish information about their facility operations on VA.gov so Veterans can successfully plan their next visit and perform other key tasks.

The Public Contact staff at these facilities provide front-line support to Veterans. We interviewed a sample of Public Contact staff to better understand the Veteran experience and service delivery models at the MVP Regional Office sites.  

Our goal was to understand from the perspectives of the Public Contact staff:

- **Service delivery model** for the facility (or group of facilities) for a geographic area
- **Common tasks** Veterans attempt to complete during in-person visits
- The **typical Veteran experience** (successes, expectations, frustrations, complaints) at these facilities

## Research Questions

1. What benefit-related **services** are offered at these facilities?
   * How do services differ by benefit types? 
   * Are any services shared across benefit types (e.g. updating contact info)?
   * Are all services available consistently throughout the week?
   * Do any services require referrals to other facilities?
   * Are there any services unique to this region/facility?

2. What **tasks** do Veterans typically try to accomplish during an in-person facility visit?
   * What are the most common tasks they complete?
   * What are the least common tasks?
   * Can these tasks be accomplished other ways (phone, web)?
     * If so, why do Veterans do this task in-person?
   * How complicated are these common tasks?
   * How do Public Contact Staff assist Veterans in these tasks?
   * Any regionally specific needs (e.g. state or region specific support, translation)?
   * Any problems?
     * Tasks unable to complete
     * Tasks that Veterans usually get hung up on
     * Frustrations expressed by Veterans
     * How frequently are these problems encountered?

3. What is the **typical Veteran experience** when visiting these facilities?
   *	Typical wait times?
   *	Busier days or time?
   *	Appointments vs walk-ins?
   *	Common frustrations? Complaints?
   *	How Veterans usually arrive at the facility? (drive, public transit?) 
   *	How long does it take for a Veteran to travel to a facility

4. What do Veterans need to know or do to be adequately **prepared** for a visit?
   * Does this differ by service? 
   * Could they have found that information on the website?
   * Most common thing Veterans are missing?

## Methodology 

* Semi-structured interviews 
* Remote via Zoom

### Participants
* Spoke to 12 participants total representing the 7 MVP regions
* Length of time working for the VA 
  * 2 - 9 years = 7
  * 10 - 19 years = 3
  * 20+ years = 2
* Job titles included:
  * Legal Administrative Specialist = 5
  * Veteran Service Representative = 3
  * Coach = 2
  * "in public contact" = 2

### Facilities Represented
* 6 Regional Benefit Offices
  * [Albuquerque](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_340)
  * [Anchorage](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_463) (located inside a VAMC)
  * [Boston](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_301)
  * [Houston](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_362) (located on a VAMC campus)
  * [National Capital Region](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_372)
  * [San Juan](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_355)  
* 2 Satellite Offices
  * [Guam](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_459h)
  * Saipan ([no presence in Facility Locator](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/12112))
* 1 VAMC outreach location (part-time)
  * [Raymond G Murphy VAMC in Albuquerque](https://www.va.gov/new-mexico-health-care/locations/raymond-g-murphy-department-of-veterans-affairs-medical-center/)
  * From the [Albuquerque RO teamsite](https://www.benefits.va.gov/albuquerque/): 
  * > In addition, we have staff at the Raymond G. Murphy VA Medical Center on Tuesdays/Wednesdays/Thursdays from 8am-3:30pm. They are located in the Eligibility department by the main entrance. 
* Regardless of the specific facility type, these can collectively be considered **Public Contact Offices**

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

* The existing VBA service taxonomy does not accurately reflect the breadth of benefit-related tasks that can be accomplished at Regional Benefit Offices
  * **TRUE** - The current taxonomy has clear omissions, misleading terms, and lacks nuance
* A more robust VBA service taxonomy could increase Veteran self-service and help Veterans be fully prepared for visits to Regional Benefit Offices
  * **NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION** - This would depend on implementation and should be evaluated during usability testing
* The typical Veteran experience at Regional Benefit Offices is generally positive
  * **PARTIALLY TRUE** - The Veteran experience at stand-alone ROs is generally positive. Proximity to a VAMC (e.g. same building, same campus) increases both wait times and the mismatch between services expected and services available.

## Details of Findings - Services, Benefits, & Tasks 

This first group of findings relates to research questions 1 & 2: 
1. What benefit-related services are offered at these facilities?
2. What do Veterans typically try to accomplish during an in-person facility visit?

### 1 - Services at Public Contact Offices can be categorized in at least four distinct ways: benefits, tasks, documents, beneficiaries 

- **Benefits** (e.g. compensation, home loans, VR&E)
- **Tasks** (e.g. file a claim, check claim status, 1-on-1 interview)
- **Documents** (e.g. award letter, commissary letter, DD-214)
- **Beneficiaries** (e.g. survivors, military retirees, caregivers)
- See the [appendix](#appendix) for full lists of terms

> Top three would be compensation, education, and pension. - P3

> Filing a claim is a big one, and then checking the status. - P12

> Most folks are looking for the tax letter. - P5

> Survivors’ benefits is a big one. - P2

### 2 - Public Contact staff primarily assist with the benefit of disability compensation

- Public Contact staff have end-to-end insight into the disability compensation process
- Can assist with many tasks: determining eligibility, filing claims, checking claim status, filing appeals, resolving payment issues, etc.
- 6/12 participants listed compensation in the top three most common services

> 90% of the Veterans coming in are concerned about "What’s my percentage and how much money am I getting?" - P7

> Everyone understands that… this is where the money begins. Anything for money, they’re coming in. - P5

> It’s usually tied around "Where is my money?" - P2

### 3 - Public Contact staff primarily assist with the task of applying for benefits 

- 9/12 participants listed “applying for benefits / filing a claim” as one of the top three most common services
- They are able to assist beneficiaries in applying for a wide range of benefits
- They have to refer beneficiaries elsewhere for support on follow-up tasks

> We're there to help Veterans fill out applications. - P9

> Probably filing new claims, you know, on the VA Form 21-526 EZ. Honestly, I could probably print 20 copies and go almost the whole week. - P10

> I can hand them an application to fill out. But PMC [Pension Management Center] would be the one process and handle it. - P5

> For education benefits we can't provide specific information to the customer. So we would have to refer them to an Education Call Center like Muskogee. - P3

### 4 - Providing beneficiaries official documents is a significant function of Public Contact Offices

- 6/12 participants listed “get a [benefit/award/tax] letter” as one of the top three most common services
- Sometimes they are printing new copies of documents that beneficiaries previously received
- Other times, a new document is being created

> To get qualified for those funds from the City… they usually need that letter. The no-benefits letter, or the benefits letter. - P5

> If they are a certain percentage, they get a letter where they can go to the commissaries on base and shop. We provide those letters. - P4

> Requesting a letter, like an award letter. That's pretty pretty common. - P11

### 5 - There are few (if any) tasks that require a Veteran to be physically present at a Public Contact Office

- During the COVID lockdown, any services that previously required an in-person visit were modified to have virtual option
- There seem to be lingering perceptions that in-person visits are required 
- Some beneficiaries prefer in-person (homeless, non-English speakers, older Veterans)
- Some sensitive tasks are better in-person (Military Sexual Trauma interviews)
- Some regions lack reliable internet access
- Veterans sometimes show up in-person for virtual appointments

> We get a lot of the older veterans. The younger veterans who are computer savvy... they can do it online. - P8

> I can't think of anything really physically where they would need to come in to the office. - P12

> Sometimes they want it in their hands. - P2

> A lot of the state does not even have accessible internet. - P9

> They'll show up and tell the guards, "I have a 10 o'clock appointment." And they go, "No, that is virtual" - P10

## Details of Findings - Veteran experience at facility
This second group of findings relates to research question 3:

3. What is the typical Veteran experience when visiting these facilities?

### 6 - A common source of Veteran frustration is a **mismatch between services expected and services available** at Public Contact Offices

- Veterans expect Public Contact Offices to assist with every benefit service
- VR&E staff are totally siloed from Public Contact staff
- Veterans are mistakenly directed to Public Contact Offices for tech support

> A lot of people think that we are just the catchall and know everything at the Regional Offices. Then they get disappointed when we say, "Oh, we don't offer that service. Sorry you had to drive all the way into the regional office to be told that that service is not provided." - P12

> On any given day at least 1 of my 6 appointments is really wanting to talk with the VR&E Counselor. - P10

> People having problems with their VA.gov accounts. They are sending them to the regional office to get them fixed. We do not do that. - P8

> The help desk for the website sends them to the Regional Office. We have no access or training to make any changes to allow them into the website. - P11

### 7 - Veterans sometimes conflate the VBA with the VA, VSOs, and other agencies  

- Veterans expect the three branches to be "one VA"
- Veterans conflate VSOs and the VBA due to them both handling benefit claims
- Veterans aren't always sure what is overseen by the VA vs the military
- This confusion is heightened when a VBA office is co-located with other agencies

> But I think the biggest thing is veterans coming in just thinking you're just one VA "How come you don't know this? How come You're not communicating?" - P9

> "I reported my divorce to the hospital. How come you don't know?" - P11

> We had to keep referring them to the National Cemetery. This office doesn't have the authority to exhume a body from a cemetery grave. - P12

> They think we do the Veteran ID cards. - P2

> If the person is looking for a VSO, they end up in the wrong place. - P5

> They'll schedule an appointment to come talk to us about an appeal. Something where we can't represent them or tell them which lanes to use. It's got to be with their Veteran Service Officer. And that's who they think they're scheduling it with. - P7

> We get a lot of veterans coming in and they think that we can update their DD-214 and we can't. - P4

> Wanting to come over here to deal with their retired pay issues from the military. - P7

### 8 - There is little standardization in how Public Contact Offices handle appointments

- Appointment only = National Captial Region 
- Certain days & hours for walk-in, otherwise appointment only = Anchorage
- Walk-in only = outreach site Raymond G Murphy VAMC in Albuquerque
- Other locations expressed a mix of appointment and walk-ins

> We've been getting probably thirty forty percent with VERA. - P5

> 90% walk in and then about 10% appointments. - P12

### 9 - Wait times at Public Contact Offices are primarily affected by facility location and staffing

- Many locations reported very short wait times (10 min or less)
- Offices co-located with a VAMC expressed higher wait times due to high demand and limited staff

> I would say, you know at most somebody will have to wait 5 or 10 min - P9

> We don't typically have wait times unless we're down to one counselor. - P3

> It's extremely busy and Veterans typically wait 30 min to an hour to see one of us. - P11

> Unfortunately we've lost so many people to promotions, retirement, whatever. If they don't have an appointment, we might not be able to see them. We're gonna try and get them in, but they have to understand it might be a couple of hours. - P2

## Details of Findings - Veteran Preparation

This third group of findings relates to research question 4: 

4. What do Veterans need to know or do to be adequately prepared for a visit?

### 10 - Having a valid photo ID and a DD-214 is helpful regardless of service

- Civilian medical records can be helpful for supplemental claims
- Surviving spouse = marriage license, the death certificate, the funeral bill, first notice of death
- eBenefits registration = 2 forms of ID
- Adding/removing dependant = birth certificate, social security cards,  marriage certificates, divorce decrees

>  They need to have an extra copy, because we're not going to copy the medical records while they wait. - P4

### 11 - Public Contact Offices often stop taking new clients prior to the official closing time

> I say 8:00 to 3:00, so people at least will get up here by 3:30, and we can serve them properly. - P8

> I try not to schedule anybody after 2:30. With traffic you invariably have people that will get there at 3:00. I'm still able to take them if they get there at 3:00. - P10

- - -

## Additional Insights

**12 - eBenefits registration is a declining service**

> We do some of that. But I only have one person that can do it - P9

> We used to, but it's slowly dying in our office - P12

**13 - "Insurance claim help and financial counseling" is not a single service**

> We assist with the insurance claim... but not financial counseling - P3

> I've never heard of financial counseling - P8

> We refer them to the number for Philadelphia for the insurance Office - P12

**14 - Parking can be a challenge for offices in dense urban locations**

> It's very expensive to park. You gotta pay a minimum of twenty-eight dollars. - P5
 
> Parking is expensive or hard to find or both. We have free parking, but it's a block away - P11

**15 - Some Public Contact Offices are located in Federal buildings with security checkpoints**

> They go through security as soon as they come through the door. That's a little hiccup for most of them. - P11

> Plus they have to go through security. So you know, if they show up at like 4:00, and then security, we're gone by the time they get here like at 4:15, 4:30. - P8

**16 - Most services are consistently available during normal operating hours** 

- Occassionally certain staff members may be better equipped to perform certain services (MST interviews, homeless Veteran coordinator)
- Guam has 2 hours every Monday morning where VBMS is down for maintenance

## Recommendations

* Update the VBA Service taxonomy to accurately reflect the services avaialable at Regional Offices
  * Include information about which services require making an appointment or bringing additional documents
  * Reroute Veterans for services that can't be handled at a RO (e.g. checking status of pension claim)
  * Explore ways to connect benefit service information across VA.gov so Veterans can choose their preferred service modality (online, virtual, in-person)
* Involve stakeholders from VR&E in MVP planning so we can accurately route Veterans to appointment tools for those services
* Consider how co-located VSOs might be displayed on RO pages to best prevent confusion
* Clearly indicate the distinction between virtual and in-person appointments
* Ensure Veterans can easily tell if a RO require appointments or not
* Indicate the last available appointment time in addition to the nomral operating hours
