## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today. My name is Dave, I am a web designer for the VA. How are you doing today?

My colleague [Blake/Jordan] is also with us to take notes as we talk. My colleague [NAME] is also here to listen in. I'm going to ask them to wave hello and then they will turn off their cameras to limit distractions while we talk.

Today we're going to talk about VA Benefit Offices. We're trying to learn about Veterans' experiences with visiting these locations so we can build better websites for them.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*   **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.**
*   **This session is going to resemble an interview where I will ask you many questions about your experience with VA Benefit Offices.** There are no right or wrong answers, this is purely to understand your actual experiences. If at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can move on to the next question.
*   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
*   **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
*   This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. When we present the results of this research, none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.

Just to confirm, are you comfortable if I record this session?

## Warm-up Questions - 2 min 

Before we dive into your facility’s operations, I’d like to learn about your work in general.
* What’s your role at the VA? 
* How long have you been in this role?
* What’s your favorite part of your job?

## Your Facility - 15 min

As you may know, the VA is currently working with 7 different Regional Benefit Offices from around the country to design a new modernized website that will later be rolled out to every Regional Benefit Office. Your local Regional Office, [INSERT RO] volunteered to be part of this effort so that we can make sure we're building the best possible web experience for Veterans. 

We are speaking with Public Contact staff like youself from these 7 different locations to get a better sense of the day-to-day reality of what Veterans experience when visiting Benefit Offices. My first set of questions is about the place you work.

* What facility do you work at? (Confirm both the location and the type of facility) 
* Do you work there full-time or do you split your time between multiple locations?
* (If multiple locations, repeat the next set of questions per facility) 

**Per facility**
* Is this facility a stand-alone building, or is it in a shared building?
* Is it easy to get to? Are there any quirks for parking or finding your way inside the building that might make it hard for people to get to? 
* What days and hours is this office open? 
* In your own words, how would you describe this office to a beneficiary unfamiliar with the VA?
*	Percentage of appointments vs walk-ins?
*	Typical wait times?
*	Busier days or time?
*	Common frustrations? Complaints?
*	How Veterans usually arrive at the facility? (drive, public transit?) 
*	How long does it take for a Veteran to travel to a facility?

**Services and Tasks**
* What different services does this location offer for Veterans?
* Are there any services this facility offers that are unique compared to other benefits offices?
* Are there any benefit services you know of that this facility doesn't offer? 
  * Where would you refer a veteran for help with that service?
* What are the top 3 tasks that you see Veterans completing here?
* Are there any tasks that are infrequent, maybe you've only heard about one or twice since working here?

**Per Service / Task**
* You listed [service, service, service] which all sound pretty specific to that benefit types. Are there services that apply across different benefit types?
* Conversely, [these services] seem broad, are there sevices that are more speicifc to different benefit types?   
* You mentioned this facility is open [these days], are all these different services available any time it's open?
  * If not, what are the factors for when something is available? Is there a staff member who only comes once a week, etc. 
* Can this task be accomplished other ways (phone, web)?
  * If so, why do Veterans do this task in-person?
  * If not, do you think that it would be 'simple' for Veterans to do in a different way? (elaborate)
* How complicated is this task?
* How do you assist Veterans in this task?
* Thinking about what makes your location different than other Regional Offices around the country, is there anything about this task that you think is unique to your region? Is it more common? Does it require additional support?
* What does success look like for this task?

**Service List**

Okay, now I'm going to share my screen and show you a list of services. (Begin sharing screen). Can you see that?
So this is a list of 16 services that are shown on VA.gov as available at different VA Benefit Offices. I want to go through them one-by-one to get your thoughts on them.

* How does this service compare to the services you listed? 1-to-1 match? Or is this really multiple services?
* Is this available at your facility?
* Are there other terms or phrases that Veterans use to describe this service?
* Is anthing missing from this list?

**Pain Points**
* Are there any common pain points that you see with Veterans? 
* For instance are there tasks they want to complete that they can't?
* Any common sources of confusion or frustration?
* How frequently are these problems encountered?

## Veteran Preparation - 5 minutes

Lastly, I want to talk about all the things Veterans might need or want to know in advance of visitng the office. 

* Thinking about the different tasks that we've talked about today, how many of them could be completed if a Veteran just walks in to the office empty-handed? 
  * How many of them might require them to have filled out forms in advance?
  * Or do they need to be sure to have a copy of something with them (e.g. License, DD-214, birth certificate, Marriage license, etc.)
* (Follow up on any tasks from earlier that might have unique requirements)
* How would a Veteran know they need to do that in advance? Could they have found that information on the website?
* Most common thing Veterans are missing? 
* Most important thing for every Veteran to bring?

## Closing - 2 minutes
* *Ask any additional follow up questions from #feedback-backchannel*
* That's the end of my list of questions. Is there anything we talked about today that you have additional thoughts you want to share?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you again, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
