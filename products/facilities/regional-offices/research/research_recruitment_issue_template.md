## Description

**Veteran-facing research** 
* The Research Lead should provide specific dates and time slots to Perigean as part of the Research Plan
* The Research Lead should create placeholder calendar events to block those time slots and invite other team members 
* After the Platform Research Review is complete, Platform will direct Perigean to begin recruitment
* Perigean will contact, screen, and schedule participants
* Perigean will create official calendar events and invite team members indicated in the Research Plan 
* If some Observers will only be invited to certain sessions, consider using an [observer sign-up sheet](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/observer_schedule_template.xlsx)
* The Research Lead should coordinate with Perigean to schedule a [pilot session](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#ResearchChecklist-4.Runapilotsession)
* The Research Lead should schedule 30-minute Daily Reseach Debrief meetings and invite Observer(s)

**Editor-facing research**
* The Research Lead should work with Product Manager, Product Owner, and Business Stakeholders to identify a list of potential participants
  * The pool of potential participants should be at least 2-3 times larger than the desired # of participants
* The Research Lead contacts and schedules participants 
  * Using their VA.gov email address or the shared VADrupalCMS@va.gov email address
  * Consider using Calendly or Microsoft Bookings to set up timeslots so participants can pick slots
  * The Research Lead should create placeholder calendar events to block those time slots and invite other team members
  * Ensure that teleconferencing rooms connected to the calendar events have correct permissions for Moderator(s)
* The Research Lead should create placeholder calendar events to block those time slots and invite other team members 
* Once participants are scheduled, the Research Lead invites other team members to official calendar events
* The Research Lead should schedule a [pilot session](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#ResearchChecklist-4.Runapilotsession)
* The Research Lead should schedule 30-minute Daily Reseach Debrief meetings and invite Notetaker(s) & Observer(s)

**Field Research** and **Unmoderated Studies**

* [Planning Unmoderated Studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/planning-unmoderated-studies)
* [Planning In-person Studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants#RecruitingParticipants-In-personmoderatedstudies)
