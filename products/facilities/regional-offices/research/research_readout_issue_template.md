## Description

**Crafting Recommendations**

Recommendations are key outputs of the research process. They connect your findings back to the product roadmap(s) and shape the experience of future users. Depending on the type of research conducted, recommendations might be narrowly focused on improving a specific interface component of your team's product, or they might have broad implications for multiple parts of the VA.gov ecosystem. Work with your Design team, Product Manager, & Product Owner to generate, refine, and categorize recommendations. PMs and POs also play a key role in socializing recomendations to other teams.

**Research Readout(s)**
- Work with PM & PO to determine audience(s) and meeting length(s)
- Default to a 30-min meeting with 20 min for presenting and 10 min for discussion
- [Research Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13G80avWGdY7tHU40PbP_l05W1yRpDr-opOk0u_AAhzQ/edit#slide=id.g892adcb623_0_141)
  - Consider slimming down this template based on your audience
  - Consider doing a pratice runthrough with Design Team or PM to ensure it flows
- After readout(s) with your immediate team(s) and stakeholder(s), consider presenting your research at Platform's weekly Design + Content + Research meeting
  - Message Naomi Marcussen on Slack to sign up

**Documenting Findings**
- Building off the Topline Report, fill out the [Research Findings Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md) and add it to your Research Folder
- Once your findings are fully written up, make sure they are linked to from the relevant research repository

- Editor-facing research: [CMS Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/research)

**Destroying and Archiving Research Materials**
- Once your synthesis is complete, you should destroy any [session recordings](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recording-user-research-sessions) saved to your local machine
- Review your notes and synthesis materials to make sure they don't contain any PII. Then make sure they are added to your github Research Folder for archival purposes
