## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks using a website that I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

*Click Live Transcript and **Enable**, or **Show Captions**.* 

*Click **Live Transcript > View Full Transcript***

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says **Share**. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
 
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a (*Veteran / Caregiver / Family member).* Is that right?

	- Thanks for confirming that.

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

1. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. *(NOTE how to share URL: dictate / Zoom chat)*

1. What do you know about VA regional benefit offices? 
1. Have you been to one before? 
1. If yes, can you describe your last visit to a regional benefit office? 
     1. When was it?
     1. What did you do there?
     1. What do you wish you had known *before going*?
     1. What might you do *before your next visit* to a benefits office?


## User Tasks
Now I'm going to ask you to do some things... ***Reassure if p nervous or says they feel dumb or embarrassed***

### Screen sharing
I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. You might want to first close any apps that you don’t want me to see.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 20 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do?
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?

Can you show me how you would find out whether it could help you with XXX (TBD--e.g., applying for disability compensation)?

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*


### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **https://bit.ly/3zuL4Be**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen and mouse control*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)*

### Task 3: [TBD task re service on the page]

Could you try to use this to find out if you could get help with XXX [TBD]? 

To make this happen, what would you do next? 
- *ck hours / mk appt / how to get there / what to bring*

How would you locate the benefit office in the building?

### Task 4: [TBD task re service on the page]

Could you try to use this to find out if you could get help with YYY [TBD]? 

To make this happen, what would you do next? 
- *ck hours / mk appt / how to get there / what to bring*

### Task 5: [TBD task re service NOT on the page]

Could you try to use this to find out if you could get help with ZZZ [TBD--whether the VA will pay for more school for you]? 

- *What do they do?* 
  - *Facility Locator?*
  - *call what number?*

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

1. In your own words, what do you think you can do from this VA office?
1. What worked *well* for you?
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
1. What would you like to *change or add*?
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

I want to let you know that the prototype I showed you may not be completely accurate about the benefits office it described. We're still working out the details, so I'm going to ask you to **NOT** *rely on the accuracy of the information that you've seen*, in case it's not correct.


## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute
