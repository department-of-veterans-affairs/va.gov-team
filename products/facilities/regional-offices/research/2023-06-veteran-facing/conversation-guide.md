## Intro - 5 minutes 
***(At first ONLY MODERATOR & PARTICIPANT, *not* notetaker)***

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

*(Brief conversation)*

Now I'll invite a colleague to join us in this session to take notes.

*(DELETE: I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes.)* 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks using a website that I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session?

*Click Live Transcript and **Enable**, or **Show Captions**.* 

*Click **Live Transcript > View Full Transcript***

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says **Share**. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
