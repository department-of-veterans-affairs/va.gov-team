This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on new Regional Benefits Office facility pages. 

- - -
## Participants
We talked to eight (8) Veterans and two (2) Veteran's family members/caregivers.

Half (5) of our participants used a smartphone during the session.

## Preliminary findings

**Usability successes**

1. Most participants understood basic information on the page, including
    - service categories. 
    - appointment types for different services.
    - hours for specific services.
    - how to get help if they canâ€™t find something (call).

2. Most participants had a positive reaction to Action links at the top of the page.



**Usability issues**

3. Most participants defaulted to using Action links for most tasks
    - even when this wouldn't work. 
    - and expressed confusion about the scope of services available from each of the links.

4. Participants didn't notice granular information within accordions, such as 
    - when building hours were different from hours in specific service departments.
    - when there were multiple service locations in one accordion.

5. Several participants complained the page was too long.

6. Many participants struggled to locate information about what to bring to an appointment.

## Next Steps
* Synthesize data
* Write research report
