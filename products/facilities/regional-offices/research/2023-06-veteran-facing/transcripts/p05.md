# Session notes: VBA Facility pages Veteran-facing Usability Testing
 
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a (*Veteran / Caregiver / Family member).* Is that right? A Veteran
	- *(If Caregiver, confirm:)* Are you a caregiver for a Veteran? Are you a Veteran?
	- Thanks for confirming that.

2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)* iPad

3. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. *(RECORD)* 

4. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? A lot. I get seen at the VA for healthcare, rehab, physical therapy, and different departments that I’m ill in. 
*(health care / education / career services / disability / housing loans / pension / life insurance / burial benefits / __________)*

5. How do you typically get information and benefits from the VA? Online- VA.gov
*(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / _________________)*

6. Are you familiar with VA regional benefits offices? Yes
  - If so, what do you know about them? I used them when I was getting my benefits package together. The service office and I’m familiar with the one in Houston.
  - What tasks would you expect to do at a VA benefit office? Apply for benefits, get updates on benefits, and learn of new benefits that I may qualify for. 
7. Have you been to a VA benefit office before? Yes
8. If so, can you describe your last visit to a VA benefit office? 
  1. When was it?
  2. What did you do there?
  3. What do you wish you had known *before going*?
  4. What might you do *before your next visit* to a benefits office?

## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do? Login and start searching. 
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?

Can you show me how you would find out whether a VA benefit office could help you apply for disability benefits? 

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3QwOn4F**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)* I like that making an appointment is the first bullet. I like the fact that it tells you where to park. I like that it tells you how to get there. The Houston office is easy but the Dallas one is not so easy. Having the link to VA forms is always good. I think this is very user-friendly. I like how it has all the links up.  I find that on the VA.gov page, I have to hunt.  I wish I had these service member benefits when I was getting out. When I was getting out, no one would tell you to go to the VA. Transition plus would have been a good help when I was getting out. The other service category is very beneficial. 


*(Below note if participant comments on; don't ask participant directly...)*

- *Any comments about the 2 phone numbers? If so, ask which they would use and why*
- *Any comments about the limited services and hours expandable alert?*
- *Any comments about the 3 action links near top of page? What do they expect from them?*

### Task 3: [Disability--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
Imagine that you have some hearing loss that's related to your military service. You’re not currently receiving monthly disability payments from the VA, and you’d like some assistance applying for benefits. Using the information on this page, how could you get help from the Boston Regional Office?
 The first thing I would do is make an appointment. After I would go to prepare for your visit section. Then learn how to get there, where to go, and what to bring. Then I think that would get me the starting information. I would also go to the VSO (if I knew about it). 


*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*

Suppose that you just switched banks, and you want to tell the VA so that any payments you receive will go to your new bank instead of your old one. Could the Boston Regional Office help you do this? 
Probably go to other services- direct deposit. I clicked the arrow on top of the page, highlighted that and it took me there.

*[Follow-up when they can’t find it:]* Since you didn't find that information on this page, where would you go to find it? Veteran benefits. It’s not there. Other services. But at this time, I would go to “can't find what I’m looking for. Then I would make a phone call. 

  - *RECORD what they do: Can't find service looking for > call hotline / Find a VA benefits location / ______________*
  
 
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes

*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

1. *(Did they interact with any of the 3 action links near top of page?)*
     1. *(If "Ask a benefit question")* Ask what happens after they click on it.
2. In your own words, what do you think you can do at from this VA office? A lot you can do there. You can see what different types you have, family have, and even other services that you may qualify for. 
3. What worked *well* for you? I like the hyperlinks. Especially the go back button. I like all the links and skip down to the section I’m looking for. It’s very easy to manage the page because of all the hyperlinks. Easy to find what you’re looking for. 
4. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?  No. I don’t think I had any. 
5. What would you like to *change or add*? Well, your life insurance would have been nice. I really liked it and it moved quicker than the VA.gov website.
