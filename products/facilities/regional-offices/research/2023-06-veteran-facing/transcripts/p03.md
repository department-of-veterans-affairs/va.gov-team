	- Thanks for confirming that.

2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)* iPhone.

3. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. *(RECORD)*

GI bill, chapter 34, and disability benefit and VA clinic 2 to 3 times and I use health benefits through my employer.

  - If so, what do you know about them? I know that they are there, but I haven’t gotten in to meet with a counselor.

## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do? 
I would probably look at Google Maps or google something. I’m in WA right now. Look at something nearby.
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?

Can you show me how you would find out whether a VA benefit office could help you apply for disability benefits? 
I looked on the side and looked for benefits. Looks like all that stuff is there. 

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything. 

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3QwOn4F**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 
I like that it’s got to make an appointment at the top and benefits where it will take me to the main website. Just standard stuff, link, and phone number. Everything I need and where to park. A lot of good information. 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)*

*(Below note if participant comments on; don't ask participant directly...)*

- *Any comments about the 2 phone numbers? If so, ask which they would use and why*
- *Any comments about the limited services and hours expandable alert?*
- *Any comments about the 3 action links near top of page? What do they expect from them?*

### Task 3: [Disability--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
Imagine that you have some hearing loss that's related to your military service. You’re not currently receiving monthly disability payments from the VA, and you’d like some assistance applying for benefits. Using the information on this page, how could you get help from the Boston Regional Office? 
I think I would click the “Ask VA” link. Maybe disability compensation, manage disability online. Maybe also go into the office or call somebody. 

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Imagine that your *[spouse/Veteran]* has some hearing loss that's related to their military service.

### Task 4: [Home loan > COE--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
You’re interested in buying a house, and your lender asks for proof that you qualify for a VA home loan. From this page, where would you go for that?

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* is interested in buying a house, and their lender asks for proof that they qualify for a VA home loan. From this page, where would you go for that?

One of the items is a DD214. If you don't have a DD214, could this office help you get it?

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*

*(Veteran only)*
Suppose that you just switched banks, and you want to tell the VA so that any payments you receive will go to your new bank instead of your old one. Could the Boston Regional Office help you do this? 
Yes, I would assume it would be under the Veteran pension. There is also disability compensation online. No appointment is needed.
I would go to disability If it was for my disability.

### Task 11: [VA life insurance--no accordion on page]

If you wanted help applying for life insurance through the VA, where would you go for that?  
Maybe compensation benefits. I would expect to find it under Veteran benefits. 


*[Follow-up when they can’t find it:]* Since you didn't find that information on this page, where would you go to find it? Other services or cant find the service your looking for or service hotline or I can go in too. 

  - *RECORD what they do: Can't find service looking for > call hotline / Find a VA benefits location / ______________*
  
 
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes

*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

1. *(Did they interact with any of the 3 action links near top of page?)*
     1. *(If "Ask a benefit question")* Ask what happens after they click on it.
2. In your own words, what do you think you can do at from this VA office?
3. What worked *well* for you?
4. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you? Nothing.
5. What would you like to *change or add*?
Looks like a full-service location. Anything I was curious; it looks like I can talk to a counselor. Once I figured out the organization, I was able to see what I needed. Might be nice to have a link on what to bring (for example for a home loan). 
Liked that it was pretty standard like the VA benefits website.

6. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
