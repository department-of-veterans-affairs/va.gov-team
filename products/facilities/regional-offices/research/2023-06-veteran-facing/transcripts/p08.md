## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do? I would call the information line at that specific VA and ask where it is. I would go online. 
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?

Can you show me how you would find out whether a VA benefit office could help you apply for disability benefits? I cant.  I don’t know how to do that. 

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3QwOn4F**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)* I think it is very detailed. It has a lot of information. I see about the caregivers. I know I need to go to that, and I can find it on the webpage. I have seen this page before but didn’t know that’s what you called it. 

*(Below note if participant comments on; don't ask participant directly...)*

- *Any comments about the 2 phone numbers? If so, ask which they would use and why*
- *Any comments about the limited services and hours expandable alert?*
- *Any comments about the 3 action links near top of page? What do they expect from them?*

I would call the main phone number.

     1. *(If "Ask a benefit question")* Ask what happens after they click on it.
2. In your own words, what do you think you can do at this VA office? I think I can do anything for myself or family members for my benefits. 
3. What worked *well* for you? I think I had good information from the drop downs, times, appointments.
