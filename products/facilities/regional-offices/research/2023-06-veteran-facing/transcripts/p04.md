# Session notes: VBA Facility pages Veteran-facing Usability Testing
 
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a (*Veteran / Caregiver / Family member).* Is that right? Yes, Veteran
	- *(If Caregiver, confirm:)* Are you a caregiver for a Veteran? Are you a Veteran?
	- Thanks for confirming that.

2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*chrome book and iPhone. 

3. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. *(RECORD)* 

4. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? Medical, medications, I’m having trouble with finding more veteran benefits, like VA compensation disability. I’m not in the system like I don’t exist anymore. 
*(health care / education / career services / disability / housing loans / pension / life insurance / burial benefits / __________)*

5. How do you typically get information and benefits from the VA? My VA.gov
*(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / _________________)*

6. Are you familiar with VA regional benefit offices? I can’t say like I’m familiar with that. 
  - If so, what do you know about them? 
  - What tasks would you expect to do at a VA benefit office?
7. Have you been to a VA benefit office before? 
8. If so, can you describe your last visit to a VA benefit office? 
  1. When was it?
  2. What did you do there?
  3. What do you wish you had known *before going*?
  4. What might you do *before your next visit* to a benefits office?

## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do? I would log on my healthy Vet. I know how to get in. 
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?

Can you show me how you would find out whether a VA benefit office could help you apply for disability benefits?

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3QwOn4F**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)*It’s easy to see and understand when you open it up it’s giving you the option to call. It’s easier to make an appointment online than the phone in my opinion. Towards the bottom- preparing for my visit, walk-ins are welcome. I like the tab with do you have the latest VA forms. I like having everything on one page. 

*(Below note if participant comments on; don't ask participant directly...)*

- *Any comments about the 2 phone numbers? If so, ask which they would use and why*
- *Any comments about the limited services and hours expandable alert?*
- *Any comments about the 3 action links near top of page? What do they expect from them?*

Imagine that you have some hearing loss that's related to your military service. You’re not currently receiving monthly disability payments from the VA, and you’d like some assistance applying for benefits.

I think that’s how I would do it.

Let's say that you’re exploring how to pay for college or other training, and you want to see if the VA can help. Using the information on this page, how can the Boston Regional Office help you? Maybe other services, maybe call the 1800 benefit number. I see the education benefit tab for veterans but not for family. But I think I would click there to see.

### Task 9: [Burial/memorial--accordion opens]

 If you wanted to honor a Veteran with a medallion on their headstone, could the Boston Regional Office help? Yes, Records or funeral services where they can give me a better answer.

- *(Other services > Direct deposit information)*


### Task 11: [VA life insurance--no accordion on page]

If you wanted help applying for life insurance through the VA, where would you go for that?  I saw a tab or possibly make a call to find out about life insurance. 


*[Follow-up when they can’t find it:]* Since you didn't find that information on this page, where would you go to find it? 

  - *RECORD what they do: Can't find service looking for > call hotline / Find a VA benefits location / ______________*
  
 
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes

*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

1. *(Did they interact with any of the 3 action links near top of page?)*
     1. *(If "Ask a benefit question")* Ask what happens after they click on it.
2. In your own words, what do you think you can do at from this VA office? I think , like a one stop shop. Like if someone needed a disability rating, or a way to find to pay for college, direct deposit information. My starting point. I would call and speak to a person if I didn’t want to do it online. 
3. What worked *well* for you? Everything is laid out to where you know what you’re looking at. Having information with a link, you don’t have to go back and forth. 
4. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you? I don’t think there was anything that didn’t work well. 
5. What would you like to *change or add*? Easier access to my VA paperwork. It’s almost impossible to get a copy of a military record. 
6. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? I don’t think so.
