# Session notes: VBA Facility pages Veteran-facing Usability Testing
 
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a (*Veteran / Caregiver / Family member).* Is that right?  I am the caregiver for my Husband. 
	- *(If Caregiver, confirm:)* Are you a caregiver for a Veteran? Are you a Veteran?
	- Thanks for confirming that.  

2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)* Laptop.

3. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. *(RECORD)* 

4. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? 
My husband is rated at 90% and paid at 100% disability and is unemployable. VA covers medical, mental health, and physical health. He has used the post-9/11 GI bill and I am in the caregiver program. 
*(health care / education / career services / disability / housing loans / pension / life insurance / burial benefits / __________)*

5. How do you typically get information and benefits from the VA? Go to the VA benefits website.
*(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / _________________)*

6. Are you familiar with VA regional benefit offices? Yes
  - If so, what do you know about them? 
  - What tasks would you expect to do at a VA benefit office?
7. Have you been to a VA benefit office before? 
8. If so, can you describe your last visit to a VA benefit office? 
  1. When was it?
  2. What did you do there?
  3. What do you wish you had known *before going*?
  4. What might you do *before your next visit* to a benefits office?

## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do?
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator? Go to the VA 

Can you show me how you would find out whether a VA benefit office could help you apply for disability benefits? Put in disability and then enter my zip code, then go the VA disability.

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3QwOn4F**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 
My first impression is that’s relatively simple and I like that it tells you location and city and ability to make an appointment. I’m in marketing and the section that says VA benefits, I would bullet this sectionand in my personal opinion.  I would simply click the hyperlink on the map because it would be simpler. I think it looks great overall. And potentially have a section having other options for veterans who are not savvy with the computers. 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)*

*(Below note if participant comments on; don't ask participant directly...)*

- *Any comments about the 2 phone numbers? If so, ask which they would use and why*
- *Any comments about the limited services and hours expandable alert?*
- *Any comments about the 3 action links near top of page? What do they expect from them?*

### Task 3: [Disability--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
Imagine that you have some hearing loss that's related to your military service. You’re not currently receiving monthly disability payments from the VA, and you’d like some assistance applying for benefits. Using the information on this page, how could you get help from the Boston Regional Office?  

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Imagine that your *[spouse/Veteran]* has some hearing loss that's related to their military service. They’re not currently receiving monthly disability payments from the VA, and you’d like some assistance applying for benefits. Using the information on this page, how could you get help from the Boston Regional Office? I would go into start a claim. I feel like im scrolling way too long to file a claim.  I would look for something that recommends, “ these would be you next few steps”. It would be nice if it stated, “ to move forward, click here for the following”. 
 If applying for VA benefits for the first time? 
I would go down to disability compensation and click on there and it gives you general information on what you can anticipate. I think it’s important to have “visit our office” and hyperlink and have a phone number here. It’s great to have office hours listed there. 


- *(Veteran benefits > Disability compensation)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - To make this happen, what would you do next? 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[in-person]*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[no but it’s preferred, per top-level accordion]* 
  - When will you go? *[check office hours for this task specifically]*
    - *Record any comments about*
      - *multiple sets of office hours*
      - *multiple hour blocks per day*
      - *notes about Thursday closures*

  - When you go, what should you have with you? *[photo ID, DD214, medical records]* 
If you were to go to the office for a DD214? It is one of the worst experiences. It’s a horrible experience, I tried helping a few friends. As I’m scrolling, it looks like my answer is no. I would go to military records. It would be nice to have an option DD214 to search. 


- Is there anything else you need to know before taking the next step?
  - *(No / Yes: what?________________________)*


### Task 4: [Home loan > COE--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
You’re interested in buying a house, and your lender asks for proof that you qualify for a VA home loan. From this page, where would you go for that?

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* is interested in buying a house, and their lender asks for proof that they qualify for a VA home loan. From this page, where would you go for that?
 That’s another piece that is missing. I would want to see something highlighted that that’s “VA Home Loans”. Maybe have a hyperlink. I would be stumped by looking at this page if I wanted to get a home loan. I don’t see what I need here. 

- *(Veteran benefits > Home loans > Get help requesting a COE or filling out paperwork)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - To make this happen, what would you do next? 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[in-person / virtual]*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[no but it’s preferred, per top-level accordion]* 
  - When will you go? *[check office hours for this task specifically]*
    - *Record any comments about*
      - *multiple sets of office hours*
      - *multiple hour blocks per day*
      - *notes about Thursday closures*

  - When you go, what should you have with you? *[photo ID, DD214]* 
- Is there anything else you need to know before taking the next step?
  - *(No / Yes: what?________________________)*
  
### Task 5: [Home loan - Need DD214]
*(Veteran only)*
Say you’ve decided to go to the Boston Regional Office in person to get proof that you qualify for a VA home loan. What do you need to have with you? [DD214] 
 It would make me frustrated if I left my house without seeing ahead of time on what I needed to bring with me. It would be great if I didn’t need to leave my home. I would go back to hyperlinking information that I would need to bring. I don’t think the blue arrows are enough to tell you what you need to know. 

One of the items is a DD214. If you don't have a DD214, could this office help you get it? 

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Say your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* decides they want to go to the Boston Regional Office in person to get proof that they qualify for a VA home loan. What do they need to have with them? [DD214]

One of the items is a DD214. If they don't have a DD214, could this office help them get it?

- *(Prepare for your visit > What to bring: office can request on your behalf)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[in-person / virtual / phone]*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[no but it’s preferred]* 
  - When will you go? *[check office hours for this task specifically]*
    - *Record any comments about*
      - *multiple sets of office hours*
      - *multiple hour blocks per day*
      - *notes about Thursday closures*

  
### Task 6: [Home loan > check status--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
Now some time has passed since your visit to the regional office, and you’re still waiting to get proof that you qualify for a VA home loan. How would you find out what’s happening? 

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member)* Now some time has passed since your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* visited the regional office, and they’re still waiting to get proof that they qualify for a VA home loan. How would you help them find out what’s happening?
I would love to have everything hyperlinked in the beginning and then continue to scroll to find words to home loans. I would have this unrelated information down because it’s unrelated to what I’m looking for. 
I can’t necessarily find what I need right away from this page. I think it can be frustrating for someone not to find information right away. And I might go right back to Google. 

- *(Veteran benefits > Home loans > Get help checking the status of your COE)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[phone]*
  - What phone number would you use? *[888-888-8888 is for this service task]*
    - *(vs. 844-872-4681 for other service task or Main / 800-827-1000 VA benefits hotline)*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[no]* 
  - When will you do that? *[check phone hours for this task specifically]*

- Is there anything else you need to know before taking the next step?
  - *(No / Yes: what?________________________)*

### Task 7: [Education (Veteran only)--accordion doesn't open]

Let's pretend that you live in Boston. 

Let's say that you’re exploring how to pay for college or other training, and you want to see if the VA can help. Using the information on this page, how can the Boston Regional Office help you? 
There’s just not enough information to learn about educational benefits. There’s just too much information to scroll, especially if it's on my phone. I would put all this information way up here. I would not scroll all the way down to see this information. But if you hyperlink them, you can jump down to the page. 

- *(**Educ benefits for Veterans** / Educ benefits for family members / __________)*

### Task 8: [Education (Veteran or family member, not caregiver if only role)--accordion doesn't open]

*(if didn't say above)* Let's pretend that you live in Boston. 

Imagine that you’re thinking about how to pay for your kid to go to college. You want to learn about scholarships that might be available to kids of Veterans. Using the information on this page, how can the Boston Regional Office help you? 
 It would be nice to have something that has “family“ as well because it looks like it’s just for service members only. 

- *(Educ benefits for Veterans / **Educ benefits for family members** / __________)*

### Task 9: [Burial/memorial--accordion opens]

 If you wanted to honor a Veteran with a medallion on their headstone, could the Boston Regional Office help? 
Initially, I would click on Burial and Memorials and see if it has the info I need. My next step would be the burial and memorials in family members. It looks like, yes. But I'm confused in the way this is worded. This is clearly talking about the Veterans. 

- *(Family member and caregiver benefits > Burial and memorials)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - To make this happen, what would you do next? 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[in-person only]* 
Looks like I have to call an 844 number it will be painful because it won't go directly to them. I would like to see a local number. 
  - Do you need an appointment? *[yes]* Yes it does.
  - When will you go? *[check office hours for this task specifically]* 
Between the office hours listed here. I would highlight this part and have a link.
  
- Is there anything else you need to know before taking the next step?
  - *(No / Yes: what?________________________)*

 
### Task 10: [Direct deposit--accordion doesn't open]
*(Veteran only)*
Suppose that you just switched banks, and you want to tell the VA so that any payments you receive will go to your new bank instead of your old one. Could the Boston Regional Office help you do this? 
It looks like the web page, I can update the direct deposit information if I click on that.

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member)* Suppose that your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* just switched banks, and they want to tell the VA so that any payments they receive will go to the new bank instead of the old one. Could the Boston Regional Office help you do this?

- *(Other services > Direct deposit information)*


### Task 11: [VA life insurance--no accordion on page]

If you wanted help applying for life insurance through the VA, where would you go for that? 
Probably up here scrolling to the top to double-check that it says life insurance. I feel like it's here but I’m missing it. Looking for similar words. These three boxes bother me. In my opinion, they are unnecessary. All the important stuff I need is below it. These blue boxes belong in the footer.  I’m still looking for life insurance. I have no idea where it is. 


*[Follow-up when they can’t find it:]* Since you didn't find that information on this page, where would you go to find it? Service member benefits and I would move it up and VA benefits. 

  - *RECORD what they do: Can't find service looking for > call hotline / Find a VA benefits location / ______________*
  
 
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes

*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

1. *(Did they interact with any of the 3 action links near top of page?)*
     1. *(If "Ask a benefit question")* Ask what happens after they click on it.
2. In your own words, what do you think you can do at from this VA office? 
The top portion does a good job on what I can find, questions about disabilities, benefits, and home loan information. We did buy a home but never went to the VA site for home loans. 
3. What worked *well* for you? 
The website made it easy to see where the facility was. There is a lot of great info but not listed in the best areas possible. 
4. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you? 
That we don’t use the right punctuation like “pension”, the P doesn’t need to be capitalized, and these blue boxes. The listing of info wasn’t done well and how much I have to scroll to get information. 
5. What would you like to *change or add*? 
One thing I thought was missing, getting into a new claim, or existing claim. It’s been difficult to check your claim. Also giving an option to find another building and having the VSO’s number up here. 
6. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
