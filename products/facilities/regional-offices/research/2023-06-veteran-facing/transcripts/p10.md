# Session notes: VBA Facility pages Veteran-facing Usability Testing
 
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a (*Veteran / Caregiver / Family member).* Is that right? Yes, Veteran.
	- *(If Caregiver, confirm:)* Are you a caregiver for a Veteran? Are you a Veteran?
	- Thanks for confirming that.

2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)* Smartphone.

3. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. *(RECORD)* 

4. What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with? Mostly on the medical side, I go to Dallas medical center a couple of times a year. The mail pharmacy. My disability payments. 
*(health care / education / career services / disability / housing loans / pension / life insurance / burial benefits / __________)*

5. How do you typically get information and benefits from the VA? Before I retired I was a software consultant. I went to the VA site and got information on how to apply. It was on paper at that time. Retired in 1995. I go to the VA or DAV for information. 
*(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / _________________)*

6. Are you familiar with VA regional benefits offices? Yes. 
  - If so, what do you know about them? I know they process disability claims, and I had some a few years ago. 
  - What tasks would you expect to do at a VA benefit office? I really don’t know. Help veterans get back into the civilian world. Maybe offer job assistance. 
7. Have you been to a VA benefit office before? No. 
8. If so, can you describe your last visit to a VA benefit office? I presumed they would have contact info- I usually go to VA.gov. 
  1. When was it?
  2. What did you do there?
  3. What do you wish you had known *before going*?
  4. What might you do *before your next visit* to a benefits office? 

## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do? 
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?

Can you show me how you would find out whether a VA benefit office could help you apply for disability benefits?

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3QwOn4F**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)* It seems simple enough. Decent explanation, not perfect grammatical. No reason to capitalize on Veterans. A little explanation of what they do.
It seems to have things I would hope for, make an appointment, check the claim status. Seems straightforward. 

*(Below note if participant comments on; don't ask participant directly...)*

- *Any comments about the 2 phone numbers? If so, ask which they would use and why*
- *Any comments about the limited services and hours expandable alert?*
- *Any comments about the 3 action links near top of page? What do they expect from them?*

### Task 3: [Disability--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
Imagine that you have some hearing loss that's related to your military service. You’re not currently receiving monthly disability payments from the VA, and you’d like some assistance applying for benefits. Using the information on this page, how could you get help from the Boston Regional Office? Looks like the best way is “ ask for benefit question”. 

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Imagine that your *[spouse/Veteran]* has some hearing loss that's related to their military service. They’re not currently receiving monthly disability payments from the VA, and you’d like some assistance applying for benefits. Using the information on this page, how could you get help from the Boston Regional Office?

- *(Veteran benefits > Disability compensation)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - To make this happen, what would you do next? 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[in-person]*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[no but it’s preferred, per top-level accordion]* Look at location and see if it’s close enough for me to go in person. Waco is a couple hours away from me and might have to a virtual appointment. I see address, phone number, office hours, close and open times, google maps, is all something good. 
  - When will you go? *[check office hours for this task specifically]* I would go to schedule an appointment online. I think asking a benefit question would be ideal to see what the next step would be. Maybe asking a benefits question to see what the requirements are for hearing loss exposure. 
    - *Record any comments about*
      - *multiple sets of office hours*
      - *multiple hour blocks per day*
      - *notes about Thursday closures*

  - When you go, what should you have with you? *[photo ID, DD214, medical records]* 

- Is there anything else you need to know before taking the next step?
  - *(No / Yes: what?________________________)*


### Task 4: [Home loan > COE--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
You’re interested in buying a house, and your lender asks for proof that you qualify for a VA home loan. From this page, where would you go for that? Again, I would go to ask a benefit question, presuming something about Home Loans and message without signing in. I would go and sign in. I don’t see anything specifically about housing. I probably have to physically go in and ask about Home Loans. I would go into “ start your inquire”.


*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* is interested in buying a house, and their lender asks for proof that they qualify for a VA home loan. From this page, where would you go for that?

- *(Veteran benefits > Home loans > Get help requesting a COE or filling out paperwork)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - To make this happen, what would you do next? 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[in-person / virtual]*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[no but it’s preferred, per top-level accordion]* Depends on the paperwork. If I could do it by myself, I would do it online. But If I had issues, I would call to make and appointment. I would click that and see whats available. 
  - When will you go? *[check office hours for this task specifically]*
    - *Record any comments about*
      - *multiple sets of office hours*
      - *multiple hour blocks per day*
      - *notes about Thursday closures*

  - When you go, what should you have with you? *[photo ID, DD214]*  Preparing for your VA appointment-click what to bring. An ID, DD214, birth certificate. I would bring this me at the time of appointment. 
- Is there anything else you need to know before taking the next step?
  - *(No / Yes: what?________________________)*
  
### Task 5: [Home loan - Need DD214]
*(Veteran only)*
Say you’ve decided to go to the Boston Regional Office in person to get proof that you qualify for a VA home loan. What do you need to have with you? [DD214]  

One of the items is a DD214. If you don't have a DD214, could this office help you get it? I presume they would help me. I would google search, and go to the government website. 
Or a link to the form to help me get it. 

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Say your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* decides they want to go to the Boston Regional Office in person to get proof that they qualify for a VA home loan. What do they need to have with them? [DD214] 

One of the items is a DD214. If they don't have a DD214, could this office help them get it?

- *(Prepare for your visit > What to bring: office can request on your behalf)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[in-person / virtual / phone]*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[no but it’s preferred]* 
  - When will you go? *[check office hours for this task specifically]*
    - *Record any comments about*
      - *multiple sets of office hours*
      - *multiple hour blocks per day*
      - *notes about Thursday closures*

  
### Task 6: [Home loan > check status--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
Now some time has passed since your visit to the regional office, and you’re still waiting to get proof that you qualify for a VA home loan. How would you find out what’s happening? Check the status of claims. That’s where I would go. I may want to try and call in or make an appointment if a substantial amount of time has gone by.

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member)* Now some time has passed since your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* visited the regional office, and they’re still waiting to get proof that they qualify for a VA home loan. How would you help them find out what’s happening?

- *(Veteran benefits > Home loans > Get help checking the status of your COE)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[phone]* I would go to check claims and call I would click- the three blue arrows.
  - What phone number would you use? *[888-888-8888 is for this service task]*
    - *(vs. 844-872-4681 for other service task or Main / 800-827-1000 VA benefits hotline)*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[no]* 
  - When will you do that? *[check phone hours for this task specifically]*

- Is there anything else you need to know before taking the next step?
  - *(No / Yes: what?________________________)*

### Task 7: [Education (Veteran only)--accordion doesn't open]

Let's pretend that you live in Boston. 

Let's say that you’re exploring how to pay for college or other training, and you want to see if the VA can help. Using the information on this page, how can the Boston Regional Office help you? Again, I would go to veterans benefits- education. 

- *(**Educ benefits for Veterans** / Educ benefits for family members / __________)*

### Task 8: [Education (Veteran or family member, not caregiver if only role)--accordion doesn't open]

*(if didn't say above)* Let's pretend that you live in Boston. 

Imagine that you’re thinking about how to pay for your kid to go to college. You want to learn about scholarships that might be available to kids of Veterans. Using the information on this page, how can the Boston Regional Office help you? I don’t see anything specifically unless there's a link for family members. I might go to education benefits for family members. 

- *(Educ benefits for Veterans / **Educ benefits for family members** / __________)*

### Task 9: [Burial/memorial--accordion opens]

 If you wanted to honor a Veteran with a medallion on their headstone, could the Boston Regional Office help? Yes, I saw something family care members under burials and memorials. That’s where I would go to get information and manage your burial benefits. 
I don’t see a link to manage someone else's, so I would click my own to see what might pop up. I don’t see anything, I would just call. 

- *(Family member and caregiver benefits > Burial and memorials)*

- *[if need prompting...]* 
  - To make this happen, what would you do next? 
  - How could you talk to someone? *[in-person only]*
  - Do you need an appointment? *[yes]* 
  - When will you go? *[check office hours for this task specifically]*
  
- Is there anything else you need to know before taking the next step?
  - *(No / Yes: what?________________________)*

 
### Task 10: [Direct deposit--accordion doesn't open]
*(Veteran only)*
Suppose that you just switched banks, and you want to tell the VA so that any payments you receive will go to your new bank instead of your old one. Could the Boston Regional Office help you do this? There should be. I recently got divorced and changed bank numbers and I went to the VA website to make the change. It’s not an instantaneous change. 

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member)* Suppose that your Veteran family member *(the Veteran you care for)* just switched banks, and they want to tell the VA so that any payments they receive will go to the new bank instead of the old one. Could the Boston Regional Office help you do this?

- *(Other services > Direct deposit information)*


### Task 11: [VA life insurance--no accordion on page]

If you wanted help applying for life insurance through the VA, where would you go for that?  Benefits Veterans section, I don’t see anything specifically on life insurance. I would submit a question about it if I didn’t see it on the website. I would call the Boston office, 844 main phone number, or the benefits Hotline. That’s probably a call center where you can get information on it- what I need. 


*[Follow-up when they can’t find it:]* Since you didn't find that information on this page, where would you go to find it? 

  - *RECORD what they do: Can't find service looking for > call hotline / Find a VA benefits location / ______________*
  
 
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes

*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

1. *(Did they interact with any of the 3 action links near top of page?)*
     1. *(If "Ask a benefit question")* Ask what happens after they click on it.
2. In your own words, what do you think you can do at from this VA office? It seems that they cover most benefits that they offer. I didn’t notice anything on medical. Might be different way to do that. Again, I haven’t dealt with the service center in a while. I’ve used education, and home loans benefits. 
3. What worked *well* for you? Limited number of clicks needed for the user. Scrolling was easy, good font, size, laid out well.
4. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you? Seems to be fairly easy. 
5. What would you like to *change or add*? I didn’t see anything. Bring your direct deposit information- maybe being more specific on some things (routing, account numbers). 
6. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?
