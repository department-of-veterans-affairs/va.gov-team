## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do? I would go to maps, go to VBA, and type it in, scroll down and I’m familiar with that building and they have a local college.
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?

Can you show me how you would find out whether a VA benefit office could help you apply for disability benefits? I would probably just go google- apply va benefits, Austin, TX and (scroll until found) ( cant find what he’s looking for). I noticed the sites on the VA are slow. I would go to claims and the VA sends me to the PVC.

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3QwOn4F**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)* I like to char or ask a lot of questions and I would as a benefits questions first. I would see if it’s a real chat, and email for if it would take a few days. I would look for “Chat now” or “Send msg for response”. 
I would look for office hours and main number. I would check parking; I would want to know if its free parking. I like Forms and I know the benefits are at the bottom. I would like to see if it’s mask mandated at the hospital. 

*(Below note if participant comments on; don't ask participant directly...)*

- *Any comments about the 2 phone numbers? If so, ask which they would use and why*
- *Any comments about the limited services and hours expandable alert?*
- *Any comments about the 3 action links near top of page? What do they expect from them?*
