## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
If you wanted to visit a VA benefit office near you, what would you do? 
I would just google the nearest VA to me and then my local VA comes up and is 30 minutes away and I would give them a call if appointments were needed. 
- * wayfinding via google? VA.gov > facility locator?

Can you show me how you would find out whether a VA benefits office could help you apply for disability benefits? 
I used the maps and clicked the menu and then clicked VA benefits, service member benefits at the bottom. 

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

Let's suppose that (Google/VA.gov) led you to the page that I'm going to show you. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3QwOn4F**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)* It looks to be the VA page it tells you what Benefit office on the top and it looks like there some self help and drop downs that makes it easy, maps, phone number, and office hours. Looks like everything is on the first page which makes it easy. 

*(Below note if participant comments on; don't ask participant directly...)*

- *Any comments about the 2 phone numbers? If so, ask which they would use and why*
- *Any comments about the limited services and hours expandable alert?*
- *Any comments about the 3 action links near top of page? What do they expect from them?*

### Task 3: [Disability--accordion opens]
*(Veteran only)*
Imagine that you have some hearing loss that's related to your military service. You’re not currently receiving monthly disability payments from the VA, and you’d like some assistance applying for benefits. Using the information on this page, how could you get help from the Boston Regional Office? 
I’m looking down here and see my options, Veteran benefits is where I would click and now, I would click disability compensation, then there’s an option to click VA benefits online- I would click that.

*(If not Veteran but caregiver or family member:)*
Imagine that your *[spouse/Veteran]* has some hearing loss that's related to their military service.

      - *multiple sets of office hours*
      - *multiple hour blocks per day*

One of the items is a DD214. If you don't have a DD214, could this office help you get it? Military records I would click.

Let's pretend that you live in Boston. 

Let's say that you’re exploring how to pay for college or other training, and you want to see if the VA can help. Using the information on this page, how can the Boston Regional Office help you? I see where it says education benefits ( the other one says family members)- looking to see if there is one specifically for veterans. I would probably just click the one that says family members.

Could the Boston Regional Office help you do this? I either didn’t see it or I missed it. 

- *(Other services > Direct deposit information)*


### Task 11: [VA life insurance--no accordion on page]

If you wanted help applying for life insurance through the VA, where would you go for that?  


*[Follow-up when they can’t find it:]* Since you didn't find that information on this page, where would you go to find it? Either call the number for the VA there or click the link “can't find what you're looking for. I would start there for sure. 

  - *RECORD what they do: Can't find service looking for > call hotline / Find a VA benefits location / ______________*
  
 
## Post-Task Interview - 7 minutes

*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

1. *(Did they interact with any of the 3 action links near top of page?)*
     1. *(If "Ask a benefit question")* Ask what happens after they click on it.
2. In your own words, what do you think you can do from this VA office?
3. What worked *well* for you? It was nice to have to click not so many times with the expandable menus. The main stuff was right in front of you. Having options works well for me. 
In a perfect world or system, yes. Easy to have a check status button. 
Looks like I can do quite a bit. But I have the option to go into the VA. Some of the options said to schedule an appointment in person. It was nice that it was broken down that way.
4. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you? The information was there for me to find it. 
5. What would you like to *change or add*? It was all pretty easy. 
6. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? I don’t think so. 
7. Mobile data vs. cellular service? I have not had trouble switching.
