# Research Plan for Usability Testing, VBA Facility pages Veteran-Facing, August 2023

## Background

VBA regional office websites are being modernized in order to replace the legacy pages maintained in Teamsite. This effort is intended to incorporate a consistent content model, as well as provide better support for mobile usage and accessibility.

### OCTO Objectives

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

Goals:
1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey 
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and benefits from the VBA throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Finding something to do, Finding a place to live)
- Taking care of myself (Managing primary care and chronic health issues > Disability Compensation)
- Putting down roots (Revisiting housing, Taking care of my family, Saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the new modernized design for VBA regional office sites**.

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine the design of the pages before piloting an MVP with 7 sites.

### Research questions
#### Before seeing the prototype:
1. What do Veterans (and others) know about VA regional benefit offices?
1. What tasks do Veterans (and others) expect to do at VA regional benefit offices?

#### From the prototype:
3. Do Veterans (and others) understand **which services** are available at this location?
     1. Categories of services *(i.e., Veteran benefits, Family member & caregiver benefits, Service member benefits, Other services)*  
      10. Service offering accordions that have multiple locations inside them 
      8. What if they _don't_ find an applicable service on the page? 
    
1. Do Veterans (and others) understand **how** services are delivered at this location?
     1. In-person, virtual, or by phone (do people open the appointments accordion unprompted?)
     1. With or without appointments (any comments about location of appointments information?)
     2. Hours of operation--for the office _vs._ only for a specific service
     3. Hours of operation--2 sets of hours in a single day (i.e., morning and afternoon but closed for lunch hour), comment about one of the days
     1. Notice different hours/appointments per service *vs.* regional office in general?


12. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on **content, organization, and length** of the regional benefit office web page?
     1. Do Veterans (and others) interact with any of the *Prepare for your visit* accordions?
     1. Do Veterans (and others) interact with any of the 3 action links near the top of the page? If so, which ones?
     1. How do Veterans (and others) react to seeing 2 phone numbers? Which phone number would they use and why? What do they expect when they call?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans (and others) will understand **what they can do** at a VA benefit office from the new web page.
1. Veterans (and others) will understand **how services are delivered** at this location from the new web page.
2. Veterans (and others) will understand **how to prepare** for a visit to a VA benefit office from the new web page.
3. Veterans (and others) will know **what to do if they _don't_ find** the kind of help they need on the new web page.

## Method	
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide research participants through a click-through prototype. We would like most participants to be on mobile devices. We will be unable to accommodate screen reader users because the prototype won't be accessible.

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**.

## Timeline

### Prepare
Before recruitment starts, I would like to **request a kickoff call with Perigean** to align on recruitment criteria and terminology for screener questions in the survey and emails that will be sent to Veterans. Alexis Logsdon (alexis.logsdon@a1msolutions.com) and Dave Pickett (dave.pickett@civicactions.com) are available for a kickoff call during any of these times: 
- **Aug 17: 12-5 ET**
