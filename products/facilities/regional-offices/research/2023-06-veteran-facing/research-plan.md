# Research Plan for Usability Testing, VBA Facility pages Veteran-Facing, June 2023

## Background

VBA regional office websites are being modernized in order to replace the legacy pages maintained in Teamsite. This effort is intended to incorporate a consistent content model, as well as provide better support for mobile usage and accessibility.

### OCTO Objectives

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

Goals:
1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey 
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and benefits from the VBA throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Finding something to do, Finding a place to live)
- Taking care of myself (Managing primary care and chronic health issues > Disability Compensation)
- Putting down roots (Revisiting housing, Taking care of my family, Saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the new modernized design for VBA regional office sites**.

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine the design of the pages before piloting an MVP with 7 sites.

### Research questions
#### Before seeing the prototype:
1. What do Veterans know about VA regional benefit offices?
1. What tasks do Veterans expect to do at VA regional benefit offices?

#### From the prototype:
3. Do Veterans understand which services are available at this location?
     1. Do Veterans understand and use the categories of services *(i.e., Veteran benefits, Family member & caregiver benefits, Service member benefits, Other services)* to find the service they're looking for? 
1. Do Veterans understand how services are delivered at this location?
     1. In-person, virtual, or by phone (do people open the appointments accordion unprompted?)
     1. With or without appointments (any comments about location of appointments information?)
     2. Hours of operation--for the office _vs._ only for a specific service
     3. Hours of operation--2 sets of hours in a single day (i.e., morning and afternoon but closed for lunch hour), comment about one of the days
3. Do Veterans understand the actions they need to take to receive the service (make an appointment, walk-in, bring required documents, etc.)?
11. What do Veterans expect to find under the service accordions?
     1. Do Veterans understand the different categories of service offerings?
     6. When prompted with specific tasks, do Veterans navigate to an appropriate service accordion?
     8. What happens if Veterans _don't_ find an applicable service accordion on the page? 
     9. Do Veterans expect to find different details for different services?
     10. How do Veterans interact with service offering accordions that have multiple locations inside them? Do they click on links for more info?
8. Do Veterans interact with any of the 3 action links near the top of the page? If so, which ones? 
     1. What do they expect from "Ask a benefit question"? Probe about what happens after they click on it.
10. How do Veterans react to seeing 2 phone numbers?
     1. Which phone number would they use and why? 
     2. What do they expect when they call?

12. What feedback do Veterans have on content, organization, and length of the regional benefit office web page?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans will understand what they can do at a VA benefit office from the new web page.
1. Veterans will understand how services are delivered at this location from the new web page.
2. Veterans will understand how to prepare for a visit to a VA benefit office from the new web page.
3. Veterans will know what to do if they _don't_ find the kind of help they need on the new web page.

## Method	
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide research participants through a click-through prototype. We would like most participants to be on mobile devices. We will be unable to accommodate screen reader users because the prototype won't be accessible.

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**.
