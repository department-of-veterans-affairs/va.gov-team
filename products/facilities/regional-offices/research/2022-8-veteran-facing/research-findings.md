# Research Goals

## Veteran Journey

Benefit Offices touch on the following stages of the Veteran Journey:

* Getting out (engaging VA to access benefits and services)
* Starting Up (Finding something to do, re-establishing and creating relationships, balancing finances, finding a place to live)
* Reinventing Myself (Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials)
* Putting Down Roots (Revisiting housing, taking care of my family, saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
* Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Goals

The goal of this research is to understand a Veterans' experiences, impressions, and relationships with Benefit Offices.

# Research Questions

1. What benefit-related tasks do Veterans complete at Benefit Offices?
   * Is visiting a Benefit Office necessary/sufficient to complete the task?
   * Do Veterans have preferred modalities for doing this task?
   * If in-person/phone/online were all available, which would they choose?
   * Do Veterans' mental models of benefit tasks align to the actual processes?
2. What is the Veteran experience of visiting a Benefit Office?
   * How do Veterans travel to Benefit Offices?
   * How do Veterans find their way to appointments within Benefit Office buildings?
   * What is the reception experience at Benefit Offices? (i.e. check-in, waiting area)
3. What information do Veterans need when preparing for a visit?
   * How do Veterans prepare for their visits?
     * What tasks do they complete? (i.e. directions, paperwork)
     * What modalities do they use? (i.e. web, phone)
   * Do Veterans feel prepared before their visits?
     * Are they actually prepared?
     * Retrospectively, what would they have needed to be prepared?
   * Do Veterans understand the different types of Benefit Offices?
     * If yes, do Veterans understand the relationships between Benefit Offices?
     * Are these relationships important to Veterans?
4. To what extent do the answers to questions 1-3 vary by:
   * Facility type?
   * Benefit service?
   * Geography?
   * Veteran demographics?

# Methodology

* Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. What benefit-related tasks do Veterans complete at Benefit Offices?
   * We expect high variance by facility type and benefit service
     * NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: our sample was primarily from one facility type (Regional Benefit Office) and one benefit type (disability) 
   * We expect moderate variance by Veteran demographics
     * FALSE: not much variance between demographics
   * We expect little to no variance by geography
     * TRUE

2. What is the Veteran experience of visiting a Benefit Office?
   * We expect high variance by facility type and geography
     * FALSE: most people had good experiences with the actual logistics of the visit, such as parking, wayfinding regardless of facility type or geography
   * We expect moderate variance by benefit service
     * FALSE: most people had good experiences regardless of benefit service sought
   * We expect little to no variance by Veteran demographics
     * TRUE

3. What information do Veterans need when preparing for a visit?
   * We expect high variance by facility type and benefit service
     * NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: our sample was primarily from one facility type (Regional Benefit Office) and one benefit type (disability)
   * We expect moderate variance by Veteran demographics
     * FALSE: Most vets did not do much prep for their visit, regardless of demographic
   * We expect little to no variance by geography
     * TRUE

# Key Findings

1. Veterans would like to use the website to complete tasks when the steps are clear
2. Veterans prefer to speak to a person on-site if they can’t find clear information online
3. Veterans expect Regional Benefit Offices to be “one-stop shops” for services
4. Veterans aren’t sure of what tasks they can complete at the various VA offices

# Details of Findings

**Finding #1: Veterans would like to use the website to complete tasks  when the steps  are clear**

* Most Veterans (10 / 12) prefer to complete their tasks online if the information and instructions are clear
  * Veterans cite convenience as necessary for completing their tasks
  * No one rated phone as their #1 preferred contact method
    * 7 / 12 rated phone as their last preference for contact
* Most Veterans used the website first to get information about their benefits and tasks to be completed
  * Half of the sample expressed that the information they need is not easily found on the website

> _“If they offer it online, I would do it online. I do everything online. I have done request for records online, and that is way easier because before you had to go to the VA.”_ -p4

>_“I guess I wish that information was easier found out there [the website]. It may be, but I haven’t found it.”_ -p3

>_“Depending on what the task was I would rather do it online if I trusted it would get done properly”_ -p17

**Finding #2: Veterans prefer to speak to a person on site if they cannot  find clear information online first**

* Veterans are more likely to visit the benefits office when they need additional information to complete their tasks
* Half of the Veterans interviewed attempted to find answers to their questions online first
* When Veterans couldn’t complete every step in the process themselves, they had confidence that the in-office staff could help them figure out next step(s)
  * Veterans expressed a high level of trust with the staff at the Benefits Office

> _“I did go to the benefits website and it gave me a little information on what programs are available, but I do like sitting down with someone to get the information.”_ -p14

> _“One-stop shopping is why I picked this one [regional benefits office]. I knew I could do everything in this office. I did some researching, and you could click on a toggle and this one popped up with everything I needed to handle I could do it at this site.”_ -p2

**Finding #3: Veterans expect Regional Benefit Offices to be “one-stop shops” for services**

* Veterans used the website or Google prior to visiting a location to get a baseline understanding of offerings
* Veterans have a high level of trust in staff at the Regional Benefits Office and most expressed satisfaction with their experience in-person
* Veterans understood what they could expect at a Regional Benefits Office, but were less familiar with other types of locations
  * Note: 83% of Veterans sampled had never visited another office
* 9 / 12 Veterans visited a Regional Benefits Office and had no problems getting information on  the services they needed while there

> _“I think what gives them a 5-star rating is that they are a one stop shop. They can help you with everything that you may need assistance with”_ -p1

> _“There is one [satellite benefits office] that is closer to my house, but I prefer to go to the one I went to initially because I have always had success there.”_ -p1

> _“The thing about going to the regional office is that is where all the information is available.”_ -p9

**Finding #4: Veterans aren’t sure of what tasks they can complete at the various VA offices**


* The differences between offices and what Veterans can accomplish at each isn’t obvious
  * When in doubt, Veterans default to the Regional or Satellite Benefit Offices
* Veterans were most confident about what they could accomplish at Regional Benefit Offices

> _“I would think that the information is pushed from Regional to Satellite and that they would recommend other offices if they thought it would benefit you more”_ -p1

# Additional Insights

**Many Veterans cited frustration with phone assistance** 

* 7 / 12 Ranked as their third preference out of receiving assistance via web, in-person, or over the phone
* Phone trees and directories posed a level of frustration for Veterans, therefore they would rather show up in-person to ask questions about their specific needs
* Phone assistance often left the Veterans without the answers they need to complete their task

> _“I did check the website, and I did try calling and I was on hold forever. I think after 30 minutes of being on hold I gave up.”_ -p13

> _“I haven’t always had good experiences with talking to people on the phone with giving out incorrect information. I just don’t trust that over reading or talking face to face.”_ -p14

> _“When I called to get clarification, I got no answer. You still find yourself trying to get there in person so you can get clarification.”_ - p17


**Benefit tasks Veterans sought to complete**

* Increasing disability rating was the most common in our sample - 9 / 12 participants
* Seeking VA license plate
* Seeking guidance with education needs
* Seeking help getting name change
* Securing a home loan
* Seeking education funding
* Job placement services
* Forms assistance
* Determining access to mental healthcare benefits

# Recommendations

1. Create VBA Regional Office pages to follow existing facilities patterns
   * Most Veterans got preliminary information from VA website or Google
   * Veterans were comfortable looking up information on facility pages

2. Implement clearer content when the steps to complete a task are complex or multi-step
   * Veterans consistently cited a desire to speak someone if they felt their situation was complex
   * Clearer content about what the requirements are for each benefit could save time and frustration for Veterans
     * Share insights with Content Team and Benefits Team

3. Follow up with research into the types of services available at each facility
   * Make further distinctions about what services are available at what facility type

## Further Research
* Deep dive into what Veterans are visiting facilities for
  * What do Veterans need to accomplish most often?
  * What questions are they answering?
  * Do their websites have the appropriate information for frequently asked questions?
  * What is the Veteran experience at each facility type?
* Additional research on how and when Veterans use their peer network for support
* Forms usability and accessibility discovery
* Content audit on accuracy and completeness of benefits processes listed on VA website
