Medically retired in April 
Once you reach a certain point. .6 months on a medical profile.. i that doesnt get any better. ur stuff gets reviewded. .to see if you're going to get med boarded.. out of the army> based on medical condition.. 
go through the ??? process?  Based on what your trying to claim for?
track all your inital disablity VA .. what VA might give you.. if you think youre good.. do paperwork. then they get back yes i'll take that disabilty ?
Then i could connect with RO in Syracuse.. and my local watertown ny.. local clinic.. army installation 

Went to IDES

The guy i had.. dont know how heavy his caseload was.. seems like i was just n.. u would try to follow up . how's the process going.. you would have to remind him of who you were. .and what your issues are ..
Counselers were talking to him on daily or weekly... DD214 - they give a copy to hte VA rep .that never happened.. 

A shitstorm happened.. VA sent email to IDES - hey man . you're the one who had the records ...I hand deliver everything..
im gonna wait about 2 weeks so I can update the records. .gettign my final disablity in the mail .. can't do anything else. .very salty situation .. esp with that counselor 

Mainly face to face.. updating records, hardest part was getting records from civlian providers 
My guy never answerd the phone.. gave me two differnt numbers.. never worked ... eamil or face to face 

scheudling was quite iffy at the time . COvid made things tricky. had to travel 2-3 hours away 

**when you were getting ready . did you look up anything on the webiste..

the med board provided all the info .. address phone number.. med board people are DoD people 

they give you a cool flow chart. .day 1 day 61 - cool 2-3 months 

I was integrated into that system end of august.. 2021   then sep- Jan ish . i was in that system 
then had to wait after holidays.. wait a couple extra weeks. .approve / disapprove. that's whne i got my initail ratings. .mid jan

Take whole packet then sit down with disability laywers.. keep that rating fight for a higher rating .. 80%  

Nothing least useful . pretty good accurate timeline . vary on soldier.. how much he's claiming. . if you're only claiming one or 2 things. . I claimed 13 diff things on my form 

these dr's travel to specific locations ..majority .. they would travel cause they're contracted 

Fort Drum new york . 16 miles away .. i was stationed at fort Drum
no issue finding. .anyone come with you ? 
no pretty much had to do all that stuff on your own.. once your chain of command knows that youre in this system they leave you alone
no issues finding the building
Once youre inside the building .. recept is right out front.. write yourself in... u wait til your scheuled time to see ur counselor..
was seen on time .. 
Initial appt was scheuled thorugh the IDES itself
followed up appt were scheuled with them through recept out front..before leaving 

not many scheudled. was a lot more walk in . when he got updates. .hey man . what time were ur availbe to come in

anyting u wish you had brought?  not really, worse part was getting records from civilian ..medical ofices were just plain closed 

**Online in phone or in person .. .
1. Face to face, 2 phone, 3 email 

why face to face? it's such an impt process .. jumping from career in army to unkonw.. they are supposedly the SMEs at this 


Packet is THIS thick... just give me the summary. .everything else was all generic cookie cutter stuff 

**Category of locations 
RO - the one i dealt with is in Buffalo .. everyting I ususally get from Buffalo . (just started classes) 
   Sports management.. coaching related.. going for 2nd masters
   Don't know if that will change 
Satellite. is prob gonna be syracuse.. going to number 2.. heard about it .. yaeh
IDES - obviusly
Pre discharge - no
Vet read and emp . .out of buffalo as well . did hte initail steps to apply . they sent me back all these forms. it;s like reinvinting the wheel again . all these forms   Screw this im not wasting my time. . I had an appt scheudled at the end of Sept...  Glass half empty guy   I would spend 3 days filling out form 
  Estonia .. 
  VRE .. i was military police in amry . i don't want to be in Law Enforcement .. it's a program where they can set you up in different career field
  Havent heard much usage out of it
VSOC - seen it.. but not really up to speed on it.

** Whats the connection/interaction bewteeen VRE and RO?  seems like thats where verything gets processed?  the VRE rep was out of Buffalo NY.. thats where al the checks and balances are 

** Are you involved in V S Orgs

DAV 
Need to get somewhere stable.. once i get settled in PA? 
lot of local stuff 

WHen i move.. i make the call .t hen i get in the system in like na hour... will go to main medical cneter in Wilkes Barre 

Medical .. behave health is broken . not enough counselors... but lots of psychiatrist..  they prescribe meds.. sick of hearing Evertyhings gonna be OK.. and that's all they hammer   had a counselor. had 2 2 minute phone calls, then a cal saying she's leaving .. pych was supposed to put in a referral.. havent seen that yet.. 
them doing all this non in person...  or video conference..  .. it's not really personal at all..   more professional face to face. .than over a phone.. where u can't look at someone's emeohtions ..
talk to a psych once a month . .30 mins tops
Referrals .. part of the community care.. .waiting on referrals for specialyt care for VA can't provide. waiting months and m onths. . for a referral to a dentist to fix a cap on my tooth .. wiating almost 2 months 
Just in gneeral . time frame is way too long.. 2-3 months to see a specialist. .issues are getting worse 
Even in miliatry .. system was broken
