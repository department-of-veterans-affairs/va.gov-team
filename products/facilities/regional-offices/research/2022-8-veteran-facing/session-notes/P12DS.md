**Tell me about your experience
Horrible experience
Talking about a party .. after 20-30 secs. .they acknowledged me.. it was nope nope. 
Tried to get some more direction.. and everything was .. i felt like i was there interrupting them and wasting their time
I had gone
1. see if i can copies of stuff - "our printers down"..
It was not a positive expeirence 
They wanted me gone - not the experience I was hoping for?
I checked website, tried calling, on hold forever. .after 30 minutes of being on hold I just gave up
The website did not have what I was looking for, or I couldnt find it
1. Could I get a copy of the case file.. 2. can I find out if my benefits were static or not.?

**How did you first learn about this office? 
WHen I first got the disability I recalled there was a RO here in North Carolina. can't remember exactly but I probably googled.. 
I don't recall

**Did you consider any other locations? Weigh different options?  
I new the VSO couldnt do anything as far as the case file
there was different forums..I'm a member of .. folks said it was hit or miss.. going into your RO.. it matters who u got and what kind of day you were having.
Had to be there becuase 
Had to be there for personal reasons
what number did you call . pretty sure it was an 800 number?

**Did you see any info about benefits specific.. 
I believe i just did a search for the Regional Offices for NC. .and the one up for Greensboror.. and wahtever info popped up.  . i don't remember if it was google or the VA site 
After talking on forums. .I found my VSO could tell me if it was static 
I did a FIA trying to get my case file.. back in January. .  I sitll hadnt received, ,,i said let me stop in 
It's been 23 yrs since I been out .and knowing where some of that stuff is at. .i have no clue..
Greensboro NC - thats a 4 hour drive

** traveled by car?
** any trouble with prking or directions?
parking was a little difficult, it was a federal building

**Did you see any signage or receptionsits
. .after going thru security, they directed me straight aheaqd. . ithink they were marshalls. cuz i think it was acourhouse also..
straight ahead.. glass front,, reception desk.. Once I walked in you couldn't miss it

**ANything u wish you would have had in advance?

**were you able to complete.. 
not with them

I since did get my sheet for teh codes what was static and such, I'm stil waiting on receiving my case file from them..
The county here has a couple VSO Offices.. i contaced her and she was like Oh Yeahr i can get you that.

ALternative plan . just watiing.. went thru VSO,, FOIA .. she told me it would take 6-8 months. .everbody still backed up from Covid. .it was a crapshoot.. but walking in 

**Are you aware of Satellite office?
. .not that Im aware of. .clinic here and in wilmington, not that I'm awaer of. my VSO was the only thing.. 
IF theyre static. .not reevaluated 
How did you hear about the distinction .. between static benefits?  it was through Reddit. .they have a Vet Ben - have some  guys on there that run the stuff and have got some really good break down.. break everything down.. wealth of info.. 
subreddit veterands benefits

**IF you had an option . online, phone, person.. .   
ONLINE, PERSON, PHONE
any specific reasons.. telepone, u don't get anything in writing . with today's tech it's real easy.. sign in safegruards.. a lot of that stuff should be avaialbe.. in person... you've got distances to drive. 

** In addtion to this task. any other services you might want to access?  
I don't have any idea

**List of office types
Regional office vs others - No .. don't have a sense of differences
Satellite.. never heard
IDES ? _ nope ..first time ever seen that
Pre discharge site. . im guessing it has to do with .. my memory not hte best. .during our discharge stuff.. an hour or so where VA came in ..during our transition .. had a 2 week deal on that
Veteran readiness and employemnet - nope
Vet Success of Campus. . not those words - back when i was doing college .. i had a person that was there ..  had aperson.. 

I have the number/name of lady I reach out to  

I think what were doing here.. reaching out.,trying to f ind.. what the experience is from the veterans point of view.. the VA had def come a long ways,, they def could do better
