i called,, they werent really taking appts at this time..  just trying to get some info on Junior college.. take some classes.. just to get out of the house.. 
The guy there. .he had a lot of info, very helpufl.. once I get in to the appt.. told me all the steps wnet pretty well
I have friends... 
Right now I'm unemployable.. a lot of my injuries are pretty bad... just feelinlg out.. how to get va to pay for education

Starting 2 year, psychologoy.. maybe transfer to 4 year?

**Did you go online before visit
.. yes i went on site, gave me a little bit of info.. 
I like to sit down and talk to somone.. tell me what's covered, what to expect..  I think it's called ebenefitrst.. takes some clicking.. u get there tells you what htey have to offer.. post 9-11  

It's the same office.. the Tax offic.e. when you become 100%  , maybe 3 miles
