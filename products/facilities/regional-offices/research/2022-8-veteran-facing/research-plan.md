## Background

Veteran Benefits Administration offices (Benefit Offices) provide clients (Veterans, service members, family members, caregivers, etc.) access to non-medical benefits. This can include things like:

*   education and training
*   pension
*   life insurance
*   home loans
*   special services for elderly, homeless, or Veterans who are members of other marginalized groups.

The Benefit Office webpages seek to give important information about physical locations where beneficiaries can apply for and receive benefits. Benefit Office pages are accessible through the public unauthenticated web. These pages expand on prior work done with Facility Locator, VAMCs, and Vet Centers.

### OCTO Objectives

This research aligns with the following OCTO objectives:

North Stars:

> 1\. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
> 
> 2\. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
> 
> 3\. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

> 1\. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
> 
> 5\. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
> 
> 6\. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:

> *   Usage of digital, self-service tools
> *   Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
> *   Benefit use and enrollment
> *   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:

> *   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

Benefit Offices touch on the following stages of the Veteran Journey:

*   Getting out (engaging VA to access benefits and services)
*   Starting Up (Finding something to do, re-establishing and creating relationships, balancing finances, finding a place to live)
*   Reinventing Myself (Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials)
*   Putting Down Roots (Revisiting housing, taking care of my family, saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
*   Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Goals

The goal of this research is to understand a Benefit Office clients' experiences, impressions, and relationships with Benefit Offices.

### Outcome

It will give us a fuller understanding of what Benefit Office clients need, and allow us to make design recommendations for the [Regional Benefit Office MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/design/README.md). 

### Research questions

1.  What benefit-related **tasks** do clients complete at Benefit Offices?
    *   Is visiting a Benefit Office necessary/sufficient to complete the task?
    *   Do clients have preferred modalities for doing this task? 
        *   If in-person/phone/online were all available, which would they choose?
    *   Do clients' mental models of benefit tasks align to the actual processes?

2.  What is the client experience of **visiting** a Benefit Office?
    *   How do clients travel to Benefit Offices?
    *   How do clients find their way to appointments within Benefit Office buildings?
    *   What is the reception experience at Benefit Offices? (i.e. check-in, waiting area)
  
3.  What information do clients need when **preparing** for a visit?
    *   How do clients prepare for their visits? 
        *   What tasks do they complete? (i.e. directions, paperwork)
        *   What modalities do they use? (i.e. web, phone)
    *   Do clients feel prepared before their visits?
        *   Are they actually prepared?
        *   Retrospectively, what would they have needed to be prepared?
    *   Do clients understand the different types of Benefit Offices?
        *   If yes, do clients understand the relationships between Benefit Offices?
        *   Are these relationships important to clients?

4. To what extent do the answers to questions 1-3 **vary** by:
   *   Facility type? 
   *   Benefit service?
   *   Geography?
   *   Client demographics?

### Hypotheses

1.  What benefit-related **tasks** do clients complete at Benefit Offices? 
    * We expect high variance by facility type and benefit service
    * We expect moderate variance by client demographics
    * We expect little to no variance by geography

2.  What is the client experience of **visiting** a Benefit Office? - 
    * We expect high variance by facility type and geography
    * We expect moderate variance by benefit service
    * We expect little to no variance by client demographics

3.  What information do clients need when **preparing** for a visit? 
    * We expect high variance by facility type and benefit service
    * We expect moderate variance by client demographics
    * We expect little to no variance by geography

## Method

*   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research

### Location

Remote, via Zoom. 

## Research Materials
