# Research Plan for Facilities, Regional Offices, August 2022

## Background

Regional offices and their children, benefits offices, provide Veterans with access to non-medical benefits. This can include things like:

*   education and training
*   pension
*   life insurance
*   home loans
*   special services for elderly, homeless, or Veterans who are members of other marginalized groups.

The regional/benefit office pages seek to give important information about physical locations where Veterans can seek help and receive benefits. The regional/benefit office pages are accessible through the public unauthenticated web. These pages expand on prior work done with the facility locator, VAMCs, and vet centers.

### OCTO Objectives

This research aligns with the following OCTO objectives:

North Stars:

> 1\. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
> 
> 2\. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
> 
> 3\. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

> 1\. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
> 
> 5\. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
> 
> 6\. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:

> *   Usage of digital, self-service tools
> *   Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
> *   Benefit use and enrollment
> *   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:

> *   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

Regional/benefit office pages touch on the following stages of the Veteran Journey:

*   Getting out (engaging VA to access benefits and services)
*   Starting Up (Finding something to do, re-establishing and creating relationships, balancing finances, finding a place to live)
*   Reinventing Myself (Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials)
*   Putting Down Roots (Revisiting housing, taking care of my family, saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
*   Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Goals

What are Veteran use cases for researching regional/benefit office locations?

### Outcome

It will give us a fuller understanding of what Veterans need, and provide a baseline experience for empathizing with their goals. 

### Research questions

*   Do Veterans understand the different types of facilities?
*   What are the top tasks that Veterans seek out a regional/benefit office for? 
*   How important is the child location relationship to the regional office for Veterans?
*   What are the questions Veterans want answered by calling the phone number(s)?
*   Is a list of Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) located at that facility important?

### Hypothesis

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? 

*   We believe that Veterans will have similar goals as Veterans using the facility search tool, VAMC, and Vet Center pages, and will be operating with familiarity with industry standard design patterns for location search and details.

What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)

*   I think they will find having clear local location information, especially contact, hours, and description of service information extremely useful.

## Method

*   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research

### Location

Remote, via Zoom. 

## Research Materials

*   [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-8-veteran-facing/conversation-guide.md)

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

Recruit through Perigean.

### Recruitment criteria

*   Veterans who live both in urban and rural locations.

## Timeline

*   Early September - Research Review & Approval
