## Description

- Veteran-facing research must go through Platform's [Research Review Cycle](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#ResearchChecklist-2.Researchreview)
- Editor-facing research must go through the [CMS Collaboration Cycle](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/1791459333/CMS+Collaboration+Cycle)

Note: This step is a hard blocker for Veteran Recruitment, but less so for Editor Recruitment. 

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Incorporate any feedback from the Review Cycle into the Research Plan and Conversation Guide
- [ ] If there are significant alterations, consult your Product Manager or Product Owner
- [ ] Once approved, move on to Participant Recruitment & Scheduling
