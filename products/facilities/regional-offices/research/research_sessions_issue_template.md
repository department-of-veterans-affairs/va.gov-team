- Editor-Facing research should track participants in the [VA.gov CMS UX research base](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv9nYvS8HoNGoZpu&inviteToken=7d5d76876f2b9f45c44a18ad316f6989c54017e5504ef23742f4153d8b658df3&utm_medium=email&utm_source=product_team&utm_content=transactional-alerts)

**No-shows and rescheduling**
- If a participant hasn't shown up within 5 minutes of the scheduled start time, they should be contacted as a reminder
  - In Veteran-facing research, the Perigean Notetaker will handle contacting the participant by phone and email
  - In Editor-facing research, the Moderator should contact the participant through email or Microsoft Teams
- If the participant hasn't shown up within 15 minutes of the start, consider it a no show
  - Contact the participant to see if they can reschedule for a different available slot 
  - If unable to reschedule, mark them officially as a no show in the recruitment tracker 
- Keep the PM and PO in the loop about no-shows in case additional sessions need to be scheduled
