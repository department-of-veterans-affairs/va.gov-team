# Participant 01

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 10 minutes

Before we go into Drupal, I'd love to learn a little more about you and the work you do. Can you share a bit about your role at the VA?
- Ask about range of duties outside editing site information
- Ask about work environment [remote, onsite]
>I work in the director's office. I am a liason between local initiatives and HQ and help to deploy them. Our area of jurisdication is quite large and includes smaller satellite offices.
>Mostly a public affairs officer. Look after the website. Liason for VSOs, one of our stakeholders.
>Work environment: Hybrid, in office one day a week or as needed, sometimes an entire week if required. Works on 2 display monitors. 

## First Task: Complete task in Drupal - 15 minutes

Before you start entering anything in Drupal, can you tell me which information you'll be adding today? 
>I have a photo.
>Already logged in, has CMS bookmarked for this session, previously did not. Has only been in the CMS during trainings so far.  

Now, can you walk me through how you'd get started? Narrate what you're doing and why as much as you can. I will remind you along the way, too.
>Goes to Regional Benefit Office in CMS. Sees broken link error at top. entire background is pink. Opens red error message and see broken Twitter link, ignores. Appears "I can't do anything here, huh."
>Earlier I was going to try to put up a new photo. I was scrolling down and expecting to see where I can update photo and didn't. (on View tab)
>Clicked Edit tab, Looked for Facility image section. Likes link to alt text help info and how it opens in a new tab. Clicks on ADD MEDIA, opens library. It's seems intuitive. I want you to see everything I'm looking at. Because in prepartion for this meeting, I have the folders setup for easy access to the photo. I would drag the photo over into ADD MEDIA modal. Usually, I go to where the photo is on my desktop and drag it from there. Uploaded wrong photo, was able to find REMOVE and upload correct photo.
>I would put a description here (in DESCRIPTION text field). Would I put 'photo' here? I guess 'photo of the front of the regional office building' would make sense to the user if its read to them. Section dropdown, 'select who will manage this content', saw his location and chose that. Was expecting a list of individual's names until saw dropdown list of office locations.
>I remember hearing that every submission we make has to be approved. An approval process is pretty quick. That person is in VACO. 
>Mod: Can you tell me what the word section means to you?
>P: It doesn't say person. If I would have thought about it more it makes sense. This was covered in training. 
>I'm one of those people that just starts putting IKEA furniture together and read instructions as needed. That's what I'm doing here.
>Alternative text: maybe I need to add more information to description, this is meant for someone who can not see so I'm not over burdening someone. Opens Tips for Alternative text, that seems helpful to know. Sees tip to not use the word photo... all very useful information. These tips would be helpful up in DESCRIPTION as well.
>adding alt text: front entrance of building
>That's what I would put there
>I'm debating whether the alt text should go in description and then alt text wouldn't be needed. Deleted alt text, sees error message "Alternative text field is required." He now notices the red astrisk next to alternative text field label that is was required.
>I could leave Description blank and just put in alt text field.
>Deletes description, copy and pasted description into alt text field.
>Spelling, punctuation... I'm being conscious of that
>That's pretty cool, you can make alternative text field bigger/smaller. When it's bigger, I feel like I have to fill it in.
>Mod: How do you determine how much to fill in
>P: I see character counter, I don't have to write a novel. I think it's pretty clear.
>Now the crop image, this is something I'm not familiar with. Selects all of the different ratio options and sees how it is cropped. Opens every drop down. P: I'm not really sure what to do with this. It looks like a preview. Looks like i can reset crop in each view. The way it's cropping seems to be good enough. Whatever AI is cropping looks to be pretty good.
>Notices Reusable option selected. I guess someone could download it and could be reused by other editors.
>This is where I would Save and Select because its blue. I assume the next option would be to select something. Save and Insert would be to save and insert something else.
>Huh, what happened. I guess what it did is save it to the bank of photos. I would click on INSERT SELECTED right away. I assume if I want to put up other photos I could do that here since it's giving me the option to upload more photos. Let me see if that is accurate. Attempts to select additional image from desktop by drag and drop. Sees that it works but then removes, was just testing. Selects INSERT SELECTED.
>I don't know where it's going to go. After selecting sees Facility Image section in Edit tab. 
>Shows old team site. Assumes new photo will be in top of new website.
>Pulls old RO Figma prototype to show where he expects new photo to appear.
>Maximum number of images makes sense.
>Scrolls through Edit tab page.
>To finish this, I'd go to the bottom and hit Save.
>The person at VACO would get a notification, review and submit on their end and w/in a few minutes
>Editoral Workflow, notices it's required after hitting save and seeing error message.
>Updates this section with revision log message, hits save again
>Sees green success message: your operating status message has been sent to the Facility Locator
>P feels confident it went through correctly. Shows new site and sees new image. 

>RECORD things to note:
>- Does P know how to get to the content they're editing?
>- Does P comment on the names of sections?
>- Does P interact with help text at all?
>- Does P refer to knowledge base materials?
>- Does P have questions about any interactions (buttons, checkboxes, etc)?  
>- Does P rely on any resources outside the Drupal interface to complete their tasks? What kind of resources? (Word doc, web page, knowledge base articles, etc)

## Post-Task Interview - 15 minutes
>Moderator may not ask all the questions below or frame them exactly the same way. Record responses to any that apply.
1. Have you been able to attend the training sessions offered by the Facilities team? Which ones?
>I like that the training was recorded so I can go back to them. 
2. Did the trainings offer enough support to get you started on your editing?
>They were sufficient for what he needed. 
3. Have you made use of any of the self-service support materials in the knowledge base? If yes, which ones?
>I haven't really needed to yet but I like that they are there. 
4. Did the KB articles provide the support you needed to complete your tasks?
>RECORD
5. Thinking of the process overall, were there any specific parts you found particularly challenging or confusing? 
>I just need to get more familiar with it. Upon reflection if I slow down it makes sense.
6. How do you feel about the guidance and error messaging provided? 
>Nothing I would change. Alt text dropdown helpful.
7. Do you have any suggestions on how the overall process for adding regional offices to Drupal could be improved?
>Right now, we are just doing it for pilot locations. Would be good to do them by districts because you'll get more people who are familiar with it and we can help each other. Sometimes we don't want to reach out to you guys, would prefer to reach out to the guy next to us, our colleagues. 
8. [Ask any additional follow-up questions from #feedback-backchannel]
>RECORD
9. Is there anything else youâ€™d like to share about your experience? 
>I compared this to the old site and this is 100% better, very intuitive, easy to follow. I do offer one thing. We are going to have all these videos, it would be nice to have snapshot videos. At times, some things are going to be like we are doing it for the first time all over again because it's not updated often. Would be great to have 1-2 snapshot videos of specific tasks in KNOWLEDGE BASE OR SHAREPOINT.
