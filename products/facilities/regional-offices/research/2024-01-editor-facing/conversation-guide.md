# Conversation Guide for VBA RO pilot editor-facing research

## Moderator logistics

### Before the session starts
* _Mute Slack and all other notifications_
* _Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants._
* _Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/)._
* _Make sure notetakers and observers have access to Mural board where group feedback will be collected_
* _In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is muted and cameras are off._
* _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro_

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Alexis and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 
[Ask observers and notetakers to briefly turn cameras on and wave or say hello]

Today we're going to talk about your experiences so far entering regional offices into Drupal. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take no more than 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **We want to hear your honest opinions.** We're not testing your ability, we just want to improve these tools to better meet your needs. You won't offend me by expressing your honest opinions; I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with the actual Drupal pages during this session.** I'll be observing you as you complete your tasks and asking questions along the way. I'll also ask you some general questions about your experience with the training and the self-service support documentation provided to you.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- I'd like to be able to record our session today so that I can make sure I'm capturing your opinions accurately. I won't share the recording with anyone else, and if I use any quotes from you in my research report, I'll first remove any personally identifying information. When I'm done with the recording and transcripts, I will delete them from my computer.
**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
    - [If yes]: **Once I start the recording, I'll confirm that you're ok with me recording this session.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. Just to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record the screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 10 minutes

Before we go into Drupal, I'd love to learn a little more about you and the work you do. Can you share a bit about your role at the VA?
- Ask about range of duties outside editing site information
- Ask about work environment [remote, onsite]
## Screen share - 5 minutes
* Now let's go ahead and get into the CMS. Do you have tasks to complete in the CMS?
  If yes, get them to share their screen in Zoom.
  If no: That's okay, we can still talk through the process and you can show me any areas where you've gotten stuck when entering things in Drupal.
* I'd like to observe your screen while you're completing tasks. If possible, I'd really like to be able to see your full desktop and not just the browser window. This can be helpful if you need to open another window for any reason and gives me a better sense of your working environment. Before you share, I can give you time to close any applications and/or tabs you don't want to share.
* Whenever you're ready, please go ahead and select the Share screen button on the bottom of the Zoom window. You should then see a lot of options for what to share. Select the desktop where you have your browser open [or select the browser itself if they don't want to share their desktop]
* Great, now I can see your screen!

## First Task: Complete task in Drupal - 15 minutes

- Before you start entering anything in Drupal, can you tell me which information you'll be adding today? 
- Now, can you walk me through how you'd get started? Narrate what you're doing and why as much as you can. I will remind you along the way, too.
[RECORD] Task(s) to be completed: (Prepare for visit/add image/spotlights/services)

### Things to watch for:

- Does P know how to get to the content they're editing?
- Does P comment on the names of sections?
- Does P interact with help text at all?
- Does P refer to knowledge base materials?
- Does P have questions about any interactions (buttons, checkboxes, etc)?  
- Does P rely on any resources outside the Drupal interface to complete their tasks? What kind of resources? (Word doc, web page, knowledge base articles, etc)

## Stop sharing screen
Now that you're done with your editing task, I have some questions for you about your experience with training and support documents. Before we move into those, you can stop sharing your screen. 

## Post-Task Interview - 15 minutes

* Have you been able to attend the training sessions offered by the Facilities team? Which ones?
* Did the trainings offer enough support to get you started on your editing?
* Have you made use of any of the self-service support materials in the knowledge base? If yes, which ones?
* Did the KB articles provide the support you needed to complete your tasks?

* Thinking of the process overall, were there any specific parts you found particularly challenging or confusing? 
* How do you feel about the guidance and error messaging provided? 
* Do you have any suggestions on how the overall process for adding regional offices to Drupal could be improved?
* [Ask any additional follow-up questions from #feedback-backchannel]
* Is there anything else youâ€™d like to share about your experience? 


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for editors such as yourself.

Well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
