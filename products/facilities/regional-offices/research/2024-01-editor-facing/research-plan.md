# Editor-facing research plan for Facilities, VBA regional offices, January 2024

Publish final research plan in the [CMS research repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/research) and add a link in the [UX research airtable](https://airtable.com/appmAWA5qxKq9qxFX/tbldzfPsD87QtCmQK/viwFTiq16RNmlQ3GM?blocks=hide).

## Background
The Facilities team is ready to launch MVP VBA regional office pages in Drupal. A pilot group of VBA RO editors are currently (January-March 2024) attending training so they can start editing these pages. This is an opportune time to get early research insights about the editorial experience and Drupal training. Insights gained in this study will help us identify potential pain points before launching the national roll out of RO pages. 

## OCTO Objectives 

### North stars [based on draft goals at time of writing]
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
- Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome

### OCTO Goals [based on draft goals at time of writing]
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

### Increase ðŸ“ˆ
- **Usage of digital, self- service tools**
- **Benefit use and enrollment, across all business lines**
- **Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population**
- **Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov**

### Decrease ðŸ“‰
- **Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution**
- **Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery**

## Research Goals	
There are two goals of this research:
1. To determine whether the current design of the Drupal interface meets editors' needs.
2. To collect feedback on the training and support materials provided to new regional office editors.

### Outcome
The findings from this research will influence design iterations before the national rollout of RO pages.

### Research questions
For research goal one, "To determine whether the current design of the Drupal interface meets editors' needs":
- Are labels, help text, error messaging, and other text in interface clear?
- Are widget interactions intuitive (buttons, checkboxes, etc)?
- How easy is it to get to the content they need to edit?

For research goal two, "To collect feedback on the training and support materials provided to new regional office editors":
- How might we change the training (or the documentation) to better support new VBA editors?

### Hypotheses
- Editors will find content (including labels, error messages and help text) in the RO editing page clear and actionable.
- Editors will find widget interactions in the RO editing page intuitive.
- Editors will be able to easily navigate to the content they need to edit.
- Editors will find the training offered adequate to complete their editing tasks.
- Editors will find current knowledge base articles adequate to complete their editing tasks.

## Method	
This study will use a hybrid approach, with a mix of interview questions and task observation, where participants will perform tasks that are part of the editorial process while being asked questions related to the task. This method is appropriate for the timing of the study and accounts for variation in tasks editors will be completing. 

### Location
Sessions will be remote over Zoom. 

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials â€“ including this plan â€“  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type of participants for this study. What experience, geographic location, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 


### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is optional. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)
