### Methods
- Not a formal research process with a research plan, conversation guide, etc.
- Conversations with VBA employees
- Analytics 

### Timeline / Dependencies
- Began in July 2022 - will be ongoing
- üõë Some business research is a blocker for other research processes

### Research Questions

**Meta Project Questions**
- What are the intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope for MVP)?
  - Some VBA facility types? 
  - Leadership list?
  - Veteran Service Organizations?
- üõë  Which Regional Offices are going to be the MVP locations?
  - Change Management Agent (editor) and back-up
    - Need to validate CMA is the right role for the task
    - Need to validate CMA sevres this role at most VBA locations
  - Teams‚Äô responsibilities beyond the website
  - Priorities for upcoming Q3, Q4
  - Capacity for MVP
  - Key business stakeholders
  - Champions for this work
  - Advocates for future rollout
- Other VBA stakeholders not at MVP facilities
  - Regional oversight similar to VISNs?
  - By benefit business line?
- Is there a VBA-specific veteran journey map?
- What are the content governance pipelines? 
  - For facilities
  - For services / benefits

**Detailed Questions for MVP Definition**
- What other top tasks are available (e.g. Talk to someone online?) 
- How different are the types of facilities? Important to reflect?
- Prepare for your visit - What to bring
  - How does this vary by service?
  - How does this vary by facility?
- What else do Veterans need in order to be prepared for a visit (e.g. link to find a form?)
- What are the questions Veterans want answered by calling the phone number(s)? 
  - Is there a Call Center employee who could provide insight?
- How do we elaborate on the taxonomy structure to better explain the services?
  - How do services relate to benefit hubs?
- Is the service delivery the same across all locations nationally or locally nuanced? (Is the service description hardened nationally?)
- Per service 
  - Is there an online version of this tool? 
  - Are there benefits that Veterans already avail predominantly or entirely online? What tools/sites are these? 
  - Which tools result in work for a local benefits office, vs some central/national office? 
  - Should some benefits (Changing Direct Deposit?) be encouraged/promoted to be done online?
- Are Events National? Local? Hybrid? And what is the maintenance load?
- Are Spotlights National? Local? Hybrid? And what is the maintenance load?

  - Do we need additional research with veterans on service descriptions vs what has already been done?
