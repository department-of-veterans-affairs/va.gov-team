## Description 
There are 58 VA Regional Benefit Offices and hundreds of out-based (satellite) facilities. In 2024, the Facilities team launched an initiative to modernize the legacy Teamsite Regional benefit office pages with a  Drupal-powered template. The roll-out of these pages continues on a rolling basis subject to editor content entry and Web Admin approval processes. Only Regional Offices had dedicated facility pages in the Teamsite experience although all other locations are discoverable in the Facility Locator with a minimal detail page. 

How might we leverage what we've learned from the Regional Office modernization process to complete modernization for the full list of VBA locations? 

## Background 

Except for the Regional Benefit Satellite Offices, the remaining VBA locations deliver specific services to targeted populations, based on their type. 
> More information about each facility type is available via links in the table below. 

Because of these differences - and because they are frequently co-located - the approach used for Region offices may not make sense for the satellite locations.

## Desired outcomes 
 
### Desired Veteran outcomes 
- Target populations can search for and find relevant information about the satellite location, including the services available and how to access them 
- Target populations understand how and where to get assistance and services which are not available at a satellite location near them
 
### Desired editor outcomes 
- Editors are able to easily create and maintain information about the satellite facilities associated with their main Regional Benefit Office
  
### Desired Business Outcomes 
- The services available at the remaining Satellite locations are mapped to the VA service taxonomy to support typeahead searches in the Facility Locator
 
## Project Scope and Scale 
_What's in and what's out?_ 
 
## Outstanding Questions 
- Should all VBA locations have a presence on VA.gov?
  - And if so, what level of information is needed to support the needs of the Veterans, service members, and beneficiaries who access their services?
- How might we automate the process of creating and maintaining content for these locations? 
- How might we leverage VA.gov existing facility pages for co-located satellites? 
- How might we connect between presence on VA.gov and the website for the campus or military installation?
- Since Pre-discharge and IDES sites are frequently found on the same military base, should they be represented together? 

## Primary problems to solve  
 (TBD)

### Not in scope 
 (TBD)
 
## Approach 

- Determine the most appropriate stratey for VBA satellite locations
- Map services from database to new VA service taxonomy and identify if any additional services apply
- Design and build appropriate templates, if needed
- Train and support editors in their creation of Drupal content 
- Facilitate data availability in Lighthouse

## Measuring success 
 
Bets - As a result of this work,  (TBD)
 
## Dependencies 
_Are other features dependent on this one? What do we need from partners? What do we need outside of engineering?_ 
- VBA SME and editor availability
 
## Assumptions and risk factors 
 
## Definition of Done 
(MVP definition TBD)
