## Overview 
VBA Regional Office sites will be modernized, similarly to the modernization of VAMC sites and Vet Center sites. Modernized VBA sites will leverage existing CMS design patterns, improve accessibilty, provide an efficient moblie experience, and give Veterans and beneficiaries seeking access to their benefits more consistent, accurate, and timely information.

## Problem Statement
The legacy VBA RO sites are authored in Teamsite, have a dense and unweidly presentation, are not mobile optimized, are prone to accessibilty issues, and do not have a rigorous content model. 
How might we leverage what we've learned from VAMC and Vet Center modernization, and apply some of the same processes to produce RO pages consistent with other pages in the modernized experience. 

## Desired User Outcomes
* Veterans and beneficiaries visiting RO sites can easily find accurate and timely information they need to plan for a visit and to access their benefits
* Veterans and beneficiaries with accessiblity issues can navigate the site and find the answers they need
* Veterans and beneficiaries on mobile devices can accomplish all the tasks available on the desktop experience
* Veterans and beneficiaries have access to a consitent experience. Visiting one RO site informs visiting any other RO site, vistors know where to find the information they're looking for and do not have to learn new patterns at a different RO site

## Undesired User Outcomes
* Veterans and beneficiaries become frustrated using a RO website
* Site information is inaccurate or out of data
* Veterans and beneficiaries can not find the information they need to plan a visit
* Veterans and beneficiaries can not easiliy find a facility that offers the benefit they are looking for near them
* Veterans and beneficiaries travel farther than needed because they were not easily able to determine a facility nearer them offered the benefit they wanted
* Veterans and beneficiaries make an unnecessary visit to a VBA facility when they would have preferred to have their need met with online information or an online tool

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Reduced 508 issues 
- Decreased cases for the call center 
- CSAT consistent with or better than other pages in the modernized experience
- Well-defined services and consistent COPE text for VBA services 

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increased 508 issues
- Increased call center cases 
- CSAT lower than the average of other pages in the modernized experience
  
## Description

This is the new VA.gov facility product for VA's Facilities that offer Benefits Services

- VBA runs 58 Regional Offices, with hundreds of child facilities (i.e., intake sites, VocRehab sites, Vet Success on Campus sites, and others?)
- Like VAMCs, ROs are a network of facilities; the Regional Office is the parent facility, and other benefits facilities are children
- VBA's facilities are unique because they provide VA benefits help for all three administrations (i.e., they will help you apply for health care and get burial benefits)

## Approach
- Research, design, and define the facilities hierarchical structure as it relates to Veteran needs and understanding
- Research, design, and write new content/create content guidelines for field editors for location-specific content, for example "prepare for your visit" section and others
- Research, design, and write new content/create content guidelines for national editors for national COPE content
- Research, design, and extend the VA services taxonomy to include VBA services; write as-necessary
- Research, design, and write (first draft/pilot) local facility content for each benefit service
- Build pilot VBA facilities in Drupal
- Build and publish new front-end VBA facilities product(s)
- Sunset legacy sites
- Integrate VBA facilities from Drupal into the Facilities API as source of truth
- Identify current users of VBA_facilities CDW database, create sunset plan and deprecate VBA database

## Old/legacy Regional Office/benefits websites
We need to reach parity with our new Regional Office/benefits products so we can turn off all the old sites.
- Regional Office website: https://www.benefits.va.gov/ROWINSTONSALEM/index.asp
- Facility Locator RO facility detail page: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_318
- Facility Locator benefits facility detail page: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_318c

## Assumptions and early discussions
- VBA want to adopt the same facility system product template as the new VAMC product
  - Like VAMCs, ROs are a network of facilities; the Regional Office is the parent facility, and other benefits facilities are children *and this structure is important for the Veteran* (if this is the case, then it needs to be represented hierarchically in the Facilities API and Drupal)
- We need to design a Make An Appointment page that applies to all ROs
- VBA has "Satellite" Regional Office sites often located at VAMCs or Vet Centers
  - We need to figure out the user flows into VocRehab facilies and services, since users will be able to get to them from a VAMC site, RO sites, and Facility Locator
- VBA's Veteran Readiness and Employment sites are both stand-alone but also often times located at VAMCs or Vet Centers(VocRehab is built into the VHA health services taxonomy for this reason)
  - We need to figure out the user flows into VocRehab facilies and services, since users will be able to get to them from a VAMC site, RO sites, and Facility Locator

## Testing
We created a set of scripts to populate content, based on Drupal build for the end of Pilot: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/tree/main/scripts/content/vacms-17969
(These will only be useful until the VBA content model changes.)

### To use them to populate a Drupal instance with content: 
Go to Tugboat, you can use the VBA Staging review one if it hasn't been torn down / errored out: https://tugboat.vfs.va.gov/6658992b17e38363d35596a2

If it needs rebuild or you need to start a new tugboat, you can use the script to re-generate content:
* Tugboat instance page > Services section > php, far right column: Click Terminal link
paste in drush scr scripts/content/vacms-17969/VACMS-17969-vba-test-data-processor.php (This should take less than a minute.)
* In the browser, go to https://cms-`[tugboat-id]`.demo.cms.va.gov/admin/content/
* Confirm that content has just been created or updated of the following types: 1) Service region, 2) VBA Facility, 3) VBA Facility Health Service
https://cms-[tugboat-id]`.demo.cms.va.gov/admin/content/deploy to Release content
