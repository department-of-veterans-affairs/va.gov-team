## Overview

The **VA services taxonomy** is the official, customer-facing list of services offered across VA's 1,200 health care facilities (VHA), Vet Centers (VHA), and Benefit offices (VBA).

The VA Services taxonomy was originally designed to create a centralized naming system for VA Services, in order to ensure a consistent Veteran experience across VA facility locations and offices. This inclusive taxonomy represents a range of benefits and services, and allows for naming consistency and the ability to map overlapping services delivered by different types of facilities, and allows searchability, improved findability, and reduces the cognitive load on Veterans. For example, counseling services are offered at VA medical facilities _and_ Vet Centers. Some readjustment services are delivered at Vet Centers _and_ VBA locations _plus_ by VBA representatives inside VA medical facilities. 

The content structure of the taxonomy is built intentionally to accommodate the nuances of complex services.

- The taxonomy is maintained (i.e., edited) in [Drupal](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/structure/taxonomy/manage/health_care_service_taxonomy/overview) (requires VA network connection and _Drupal credentials)
- The taxonomy is consumed by the [Facilities API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/facilities/docs/facilities?version=current) for use by all VA digital products, and public third-party products

## Contacts / Content Governance
Proposed new taxonomy terms or naming changes to existing terms should be reviewed by the "taxonomy council" which consists of the contacts listed below.
