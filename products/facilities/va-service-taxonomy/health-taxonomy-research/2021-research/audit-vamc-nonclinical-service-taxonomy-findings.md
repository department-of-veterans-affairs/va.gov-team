# Audit VAMC non-clinical service taxonomy

This work [Audit spreadsheet](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/services-taxonomy/taxonomy-research-2021/audit-spreadsheet-vha-health-services-Oct2021.xlsx) is for Github issue [#30839](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30839#issuecomment-947816525)

## Scope of work
This is a first draft audit of non-clinical VHA services referenced on VAMC pages. It also includes some top task/services referenced on the VA.gov homepage as well as some top call center call topics. The services identified should serve as hypotheses to be tested for plain language and in wayfinding user tests (e.g. a tree test, card sorts) to understand how Veterans might expect to find them. 

## Definition of a service
For purposes of uncovering new and future services, this audit assumes that common Veteran tasks will need to become or be mapped to services in order to be found. Veteran tasks were identified in the “New Services” tab if there wasn’t an obvious, existing service taxon with which it could be associated but a corresponding person or process is offered or required by the VA in order to accomplish it. In other words, I need to do a thing and the VA offers a phone, feature, or person (service) to help me do that thing.

## Findings & Recommendations

1. “Specialty care” category is too long to be scannable or easily browsed. Consider sub-categorizing specialty services into more meaningful, human readable and plain language areas of care and then offer more specificity in a progressive manner instead of one long list of specialty services. e.g. eye care as a sub-specialty, which is a term already used on VA pages.

2. Some services seem to exist for internal or data purposes, like "outpatient surgery", "surgery", “Anesthesia”. Could they be suppressed unless a Veteran searches for them so that they don't overwhelm pages? 

   - Consider building a simple search/filter feature that gets tested on a few pilot sites in different areas of the country. This would look like a search box that Veterans can type into to find services. This feature would need to track and capture all the search terms over a certain length of time. These search terms could then be analyzed to help inform the evolution of the taxonomy to help answer, “what does a Veteran need and want to know?” in the most natural and informative way, which is under real circumstances.

   - Consider a tagging system of official words that can be paired more flexibly so that “surgery” and “__” can be found later with filtered searches.

3. "Other services" category doesn't provide any meaning.  Services that don’t fit neatly into existing categories should be recategorized under new meaningful labels.

   - Conduct card sorts and tree test studies with Veterans to understand how they might group and find a broad variety of services. It would be more useful to intentionally include some services outside of VHA so that Veterans (and researchers) can think of benefits and services holistically when categorizing which is more natural than a siloed health view of VA, which is a business perspective and not likely representative of Veterans journeys and their actual mental models. 

   - Some initial ideas of categories that could be useful: “Ways to access care”, “Prepare for your visit”. For services provided by dedicated people like "MyHealtheVet coordinator", "Patient advocates", "Advice Nurse" and all the other VA coordinators, a “People that can help me” or “Navigating the VA” category could be useful.

     - How do "Patient advocates", "Advice Nurse" and “Nurse line” services differ? These services should be researched and names tested. (see tab “#30839 Audit” for names and categories tagged for research)

4. "Pharmacy" is currently the official health service taxon for refilling a prescription on VAMC pages. However, the natural phrase “Refill and track prescriptions” found on VA.gov is a separate service that is only provided by MyHealtheVet. Co-opting natural language a Veteran would use risks eroding trust by Veterans since the page reads like a marketing campaign to get them to sign up for MyHealtheVet rather than providing a quick list of ways to take action. This leads Veterans to a dead end if they simply want to find a number to their pharmacy.

5. The following service NAMES have been flagged for further research:
   - "Registry exams" not self explanatory. Would non-military people, like a caretaker, know how to find this?  
   - “Social work” - research is needed to understand who is offering this service and what it is. Veterans who may be comfortable with the term "Social worker" may benefit from cross promotion with mental "health care".  Social work could become “social worker” to be grouped under a "people could can help me" type of category.
   - “Advice nurse”
   - “Community engagement”. Hypothesis is that it should morph or merge with “Events and outreach” as a more useful-to-Veterans service.
   - "HIV/hepatitis care" is a current taxon. "Hepatitis C screening and treatment" is offered by Pittsburgh Health care system. Is this a separate service? Should HIV and Hepatitis be divided into distinct care services?
   - “Hospital Medicine” not self explanatory. 
   - "Whole health" seems more appropriate as a category than a service. See [previous taxonomy research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/initiatives/2021-03-services-taxonomy/taxonomy-study/research-findings.md)
   - Women Veteran care - should this be a category instead of a service?
   - COVID-19 vaccines - should this become a more generic “vaccines” under primary care?

6. The following services have been flagged for further research for RECATEGORIZATION:
   - Women Veteran care - should this be a category instead of a service categorized under social programs? The meaning of this phrase changes depending on its context and can confuse Veterans. At a clinic it can mean Gynecology but at a Vet Center, it confused Veterans because they did assume it meant women's primary care even though Vet Centers do not offer primary health care. 
   - “Advice nurse” - candidate for a "people could can help me" or “Navigating the VA” type of category.
   - “Caregiver support”  - candidate for a "people could can help me" or “Navigating the VA” type of category.
   - “Community engagement”  - should be renamed but also candidate for a “Navigating the VA” type of category.
   - Couples and family counseling  - under “mental health”
   - COVID-19 vaccines - should this become a more generic “vaccines” under primary care?
   - Grief and bereavement counseling  - under “mental health”
   - Military sexual trauma care - could also be under ”Social programs and services”
   - MOVE! weight management - This seems like it could fall under a 'wellness' category of some sort. Less "I'm going to see a specialist" -vs "Bariatric surgery" which feels more straightforward as a specialist you'd go see.
   - My HealtheVet coordinator - candidate for a "people could can help me" or “Navigating the VA” type of category.
   - Patient advocates - candidate for a "people could can help me" or “Navigating the VA” type of category.
   - "Returning service member care" could this be a category of its own? This service cuts across VA business siloes.
   - "Telehealth": under “Ways to access health care” 


7. The following services have been flagged for further research for PLAIN LANGUAGE:
   -  "Nephrology" - On VAMC pages some list a number for Kidney disease / dialysis, which is more patient friendly.
   -  “Pharmacy” needs to add plain language actions that have been co opted by MyHealtheVet such as those used on HP & VAMC: "Refill and track your prescriptions"
