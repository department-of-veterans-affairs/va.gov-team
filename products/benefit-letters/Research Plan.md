# Research Plan for IAM with eBenefits
As a product owner, I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	Benefits & Memorials 1 and eBenefits
2. Background: eBenefits is putting Identity Access Management protocols in place to allow Veterans, their dependents, and VSO's to use multiple credentials to log in to eBenefits. We would like to work with users to verify that the work that was done allows users to log in and complete tasks, as identified in scenarios below.
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? Can a user log in successfully and obtain the desired outcome for each scenario 	
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? Testing to verify that IAM works properly	
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  Remote moderated observation where the user will be given specific steps to follow 
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	It will allow us to validate if the IAM code worked when a user can complete the task
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? Remote
4.	What will you be testing? Access to eBenefits	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use? Zoom	
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	There are specific login requirements as follows:

--Veteran with existing DS Logon Premium account and is receiving benefit payments from the VA

--Non-Veteran dependent with existing DS Logon Premium account and where the Veteran is receiving disability payments from the VA

--Veteran with existing ID.me account where the Veteran is receiving disability payments from the VA

--Non-Veteran dependent with existing ID.me and where the Veteran is receiving disability payments from the VA

--Veteran with existing My Healthy Vet (MHV) Premium account where the Veteran is receiving disability payments from the VA

--Non-Veteran dependent with existing MHV Premium account and where the Veteran is receiving disability payments from the VA

--Veteran with DS Logon but no existing ID.me credential where the Veteran is receiving disability payments from the VA, and the Veteran will be willing to create and ID.me credential

--Non-Veteran dependent with DS Logon but no existing ID.me credential where the Veteran is receiving disability payments from the VA, and the dependent will be willing to create and ID.me credential

We'd like to get ~3 people for each of these login requirements. There are no restrictions on age, geographic diversity, but the person will need access to a computer.

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
Existing recruiting contract

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
Desired start date for research sessions is April 20, 2020 for one week
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? April 10, 2020
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 30 minutes maximum
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Any time that works for the Veteran or the dependent during the week of April 20	
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	As this is more of a verification with specific steps to follow, I don't think we need to pilot it
