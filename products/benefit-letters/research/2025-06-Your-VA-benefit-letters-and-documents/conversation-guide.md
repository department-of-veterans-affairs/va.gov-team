### 2-3 days before the session

> [!NOTE]
> Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist).

### Day of the session

**Before all sessions**:
- Review the participant list for participant name and screener question responses
- Check Settings > In Meeting (Advanced) > Automated captions, Full transcript, Save captions are all ON
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Sound notification when someone joins or leaves OFF
  - In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Screen sharing > Who can share > All Participants
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Hide participant profile pictures in a meeting ON
- Mute Slack and all other notifications
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.


### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, ensure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked.
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.
- If the participant is using a screen reader, wear headphones to prevent the user's screen reader from echoing back to them *(recommendation from Cindy).*
- When users share their screen, the “Share sound” box must be checked if we want the recording to pick up screen reader announcements. This box is on the right pane when the screen share is started. [Need to confirm if the moderator can check this box for their participants or if the participant has to do it themselves.]


# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Shawn, and <mark>[NAME]</mark> will be taking notes. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today, we're going to talk about VA Benefit Letters and Documents. These types of letters include the Benefit Summary and Service Verification Letter, Proof of Service Card, Commissary Letter, and others.

Before we start, I have a few logistics to cover:

* I have [number] colleagues who are interested in observing this session to better understand the Veteran experience. Would you be okay with them observing?
    * <mark>[If no,]</mark> Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * <mark>[If yes,]</mark> Admit observers.
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

* This will take around 60 minutes (or 90 minutes for AT). I want to keep us on time, so I may occasionally prompt you to move on to the next topic.  
* We want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we’re not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome all your feedback, and I won't take anything personally.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You don’t have to participate if you don't want to, and your choice to participate will not affect your benefits in any way. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you’ll still be compensated for your time.  
* I want to assure you that, although I work on the VA.gov website, I do not have access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the authority to change your claims or benefits in any way. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website  
  
* Today, you'll interact with a live demo on our staging server. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.  
* I’d like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today. We use the recordings to ensure that we have accurately captured your opinions. After we complete the analysis, the recordings will be deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed directly to you. We either report findings in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we remove any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing this, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  
* <mark>[If yes,]</mark> once I start recording, I will confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
➡️ Start recording.
* "I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you okay with me recording my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right?  
   * Thanks for confirming that.  
2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Smartphone)*  
   * *(If not the expected device, ask to rejoin that way)*  
3. I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, or *(for smartphone users)* text it to you?  
   * *(If text or email)* Could the notetaker please text/email the link now? ([https://bit.ly/4lXVLTV](https://bit.ly/4lXVLTV))

### For only assistive tech users

   * *(if no AT)* Do you sometimes use assistive technology while using VA.gov?  
     1. If so, what do you use and when?  
        1. Would you be willing to start using it now in this session?  
        2. *(If not, run session w/o AT, or stop and ask Perigean for a replacement participant)*  
5. How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader, screen magnifier, or voice command software--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?  
6. How long have you used a screen reader, screen magnifier, or voice command software?  
7. Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen reader or magnifier? *(Yes / No)*  
   * If not, we can help you do that.

### For everyone

8. Have you ever used VA.gov to get copies of VA benefits letters or documents?
  * <mark>[If no]</mark> "Are you aware you could do that on the website?"

### Follow-up questions (If needed)
* "What did you think about that process?"

# Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
[**Type into #feedback-backchannel**: "Any questions you want me to ask?"]

* Overall, about everything on the website in this session...What worked \*well\* for you?  
* What was \*unclear or didn't work well\* for you?  
  * \[If they say nothing, could ask:\] What, if anything, did you find annoying?  
* What would you like to \*change or add\*?

## Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and ask one more question about the video recording. \*\*Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners?\*\* We’d want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) and other digital experiences.   
  * If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?  
* \<mark\>\[Record answer here\]\</mark\>


## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well, we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks\! Lastly, Perigean will send you a thank-you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to give them the chance to participate in future research.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!
