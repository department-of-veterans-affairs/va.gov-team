### 2-3 days before the session

> [!NOTE]
> Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist).

### Day of the session

**Before all sessions**:
- Review the participant list for participant name and screener question responses
- Check Settings > In Meeting (Advanced) > Automated captions, Full transcript, Save captions are all ON
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Sound notification when someone joins or leaves OFF
  - In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Screen sharing > Who can share > All Participants
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Hide participant profile pictures in a meeting ON
- Mute Slack and all other notifications

**10-15 min before each session**:
- Sign onto Zoom website as Perigean and start Zoom meeting
- Slack Perigean notetaker a link to the notes doc in GitHub
- Post p# and "[observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html)" in [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)
  - @mention observers
  - Share brief summary of participant demographic info
  - Mural link for notetaking
- Wear HEADPHONES to prevent the user's screen reader from echoing back to them (recommendation from Cindy)
- Paste the staging link into Zoom chat
- Do Not Disturb ON, so no notifications
- Make sure everyone is muted except me and the participant
- When users share their screen, the ‚ÄúShare sound‚Äù box must be checked for everyone to hear the screen reader and for the recording to pick up screen reader announcements. This box is on the right pane when the screen share is started.
  - If they're on mobile, you will not be able to hear the screen reader, so the above doesn't apply.

When the participant is ready, turn on your camera and begin session with the intro

CHECK SLACK for real-time feedback or questions from observers

# Intro - 5 minutes

"Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Shawn**. How are you doing today?"

"I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes."

*(if applicable)* "[accessibility specialist] is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology during this session." 

"I also have [specific number] teammates who would like to observe this session. Is it okay with you to have them join us to observe this session?"
* <mark>[If yes,]</mark> Admit observers.
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
* <mark>[If no,]</mark> Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

"Today, we're going to talk about VA Benefit Letters and Documents. These types of letters include the Benefit Summary and Service Verification Letter, Proof of Service Card, Commissary Letter, and others."

"Before we start, I want to go over a few things:"

- **"This entire session may take 60 (or 90) minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic."
  
- **"In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express."
- **"Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You don't have to participate if you don't want to, and your choice to participate will not affect your benefits in any way. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you‚Äôll still be compensated for your time."
- **"I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way. I am not a specialist in benefits.** My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website."


- **"Finally, I‚Äôd like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.** After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7. Knowing this, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"
  - <mark>[If yes,]</mark> "once I start recording, I will confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more."
  - <mark>[If no,]</mark> "are you ok if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.



- "I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you okay with me recording my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says **Share** *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click **More...**)*
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says **Share**. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

### Let‚Äôs start with a few questions...

1. "I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right?"  
   * Thanks for confirming that.  
2. "What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Smartphone / tablet)*"
   * *(If not the expected device, ask to rejoin that way)*  

### For only assistive tech users

3. "What assistive technology are you using right now?" *(screen reader, screen magnifier, or voice command / speech recognition / speech to text software)*  
   * *(If using Dolphin screen reader, you won't be able to share screen on Zoom)*

     1. If so, "what do you use and when?"  
        1. "Would you be willing to start using it now in this session?" 
        2. *(If not, run session w/o AT, or stop and ask Perigean for a replacement participant)*  
4. "How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader, screen magnifier, or voice command software--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?" 
5. "How long have you used a screen reader, screen magnifier, or voice command / speech recognition / speech to text software?"
6. "Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen reader or magnifier?" *(Yes / No)*
   * If not, "we can help you do that."

### For everyone

7. "I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, or *(for smartphone users)* text it to you?" 
   * *(If text or email)* "Could the notetaker please text/email the link now? ([https://bit.ly/4lXVLTV](https://bit.ly/4lXVLTV))"
8. "Have you ever used VA.gov to get copies of VA benefits letters or documents?"
  * <mark>[If no]</mark> "Are you aware you could do that on the website?"
  * <mark>[If yes]</mark> "Which letters have been the most valuable to you? Did you know the purpose of the letter before coming here to download or learn about it on VA.gov?"

# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

"I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your own screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now."
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through this if you need help. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
1. Navigate to the screen share button
1. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
1. Activate the screen share

**(If we can't hear the screen reader)** "Since I can't hear your screen reader and don't want to interrupt it, after I ask you to do something, I'll try to not say anything until you say that you're done or need help, OK?"

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** "It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off?" (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

## Task 00: Open prototype

"Now I'd like you to open a website that I'm going to share with you."

"I will *[email/text/dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* the URL: **https://staging.va.gov/**"
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

**"This is a test version of VA.gov.** It is similar to the real website, but with some special features enabled for our session. ** It's all test data, so nothing we do here will impact your own VA information or benefits."


## Task 1: Navigating to the benefit letters page - X minutes
**Goal:**  Observe where and how Veterans expect to find benefit letters from the homepage.

### Scenario

"You are on the homepage ([staging.VA.gov](http://staging.VA.gov)) and want to view and download your VA benefit letters."

### Steps

1. "Take a look at this homepage first, before you interact with it. Where do you think your benefit letters are located?"  
2. "Now, go ahead and navigate to where you think they are." <mark>[Let them explore naturally without guidance]</mark>

<mark>If the participant attempts to sign in, then we need to send them the credentials (email/text/dictate/Zoom chat)</mark>

### Things to watch out for

* Do they expect benefit letters to be under profile, MyVA, or benefits sections?  
* Do they use the main navigation menu or search?  
* Which top-level categories do they explore first?

### Follow-up questions (If needed)
* "Tell me about your thought process there."
* "What made you think of going there?"
* "If you couldn't find what you needed, where else would you look?"

## Task 2: Understanding the page and the different letters and documents - X minutes
**Goal:** Observe how Veterans orient themselves to the page and understand available options.

### Scenario

"You‚Äôre on the public-facing ‚ÄòDownload VA benefit letters‚Äô page, and you need to sign in with a verified account to access your VA benefit letters and documents." 

### Steps

1. "Now, please sign in, I‚Äôll send you the test credentials you should use to sign in (email/text/dictate/Zoom chat)‚Äù <mark>[With staging user 54]</mark>
2. <mark>[Arrives on authenticated page]</mark> "Before clicking on anything, take a minute to explore the entire page and tell me what you see. What do you think this page is for, and what do you think you can do here?" <mark>[Allow ~2-3 minutes for exploration]</mark>

### Things to watch out for

* Do they notice the mailing address card?  
* Will Veterans feel they need to edit their address before downloading a letter?  
* Do they understand the different types of letters?  
* What are their initial expectations about the page?
* Do they expand the accordions? 
* What do they do if they don‚Äôt find a letter that they were expecting to be on this page?

### Follow-up questions (If needed)

* ‚ÄúIs this where you expected to find your benefit letters? If not, where would you expect them to be?‚Äù
* "Are all the letters you‚Äôd expect to see here? If you didn‚Äôt find the letter you needed, what would you do next?"
  "Tell me more about [specific behavior you observed]"
* "What would you expect to find in [specific section]?"

## Task 3: Updating the mailing address - X minutes
**Goal:** Test the address update flow and messaging comprehension.

### Scenario

"Imagine that your community's zip code boundary recently changed, and you want to update your mailing address with the new zip code before downloading any benefit letters. Please update the zip code to 20811."

### Steps

1. Update the zip code to 20811.  
2. Save the new address <mark>[Let them work through the process naturally]</mark>

### Things to watch out for

* Do they understand the information about how changing the address affects their VA.gov profile?  
* Do they successfully save the new address?

### Follow-up questions (If needed)
* "What did you think about that process?"
* "Was anything unclear about how this affects your VA.gov profile?"
* "Imagine you didn‚Äôt have a mailing address."
  * "What would you expect to happen?"
  * "What would you do?"
  * "How do you think that would impact your ability to get your letters?"

* "What would you like to \*change or add\*?" 
* "Is there anything we haven't discussed that I should know?"

## Consent to use video clips

"I want to circle back and ask one more question about the video recording. **Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners?** We‚Äôd want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences."  

* \<mark\>\[Record answer here\]\</mark\>


## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

"Well, we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans."

"Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will send you a thank-you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to give them the chance to participate in future research."

"Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!"
