# Product Outline – Income Limits Web App

## Overview

Income is one aspect that determine's a Veteran's eligibility for benefits from VA. An [existing application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) allows Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the financial thresholds based on location and number of dependents.

[See Mural of existing application here.](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1657807571797/ee2497db0a9c637538f51e38546ffe3eaea508c0?sender=ua604735c5cf1162b042a4310)

## Problem Statement

The [existing Income Limits web application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) is difficult to maintain the data to accurately provide information to Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the financial thresholds based on location and number of dependents. In addition, the current application lacks plain language or clearly defined use cases/usability design and testing to validate that it is intuitively aligned to problems for the Veteran and providing information that is clear and easy to understand.

How might we rebuild this application so that we clearly define the Veteran use cases for this application and modernize the application to better align with how Veterans need to make use of income, location, dependent information as it relates to VA benefit eligibility?

- *As a Veteran I need to understand how income, location, and dependents are a factor in my eligibility determination for VA benefits so that I can understand how this is part - but not all of - the calculation for my eligibility for VA benefits.*
- *As a Veteran I need to be able to find the income threshold for my locality so that I can understand whether or not my financial threshold contributes to or detracts from my eligibility for VA benefits.*
- *As a Veteran I need to be able to model changes in my life circumstances to see if such changes may impact my eligibility for VA benefits.*
- *As a Veteran who determines that they are eligible based on income/location/dependents I need to know what next steps I may need to take to determine additional eligibility criteria.*
- *As a Veteran who determines that they are eligible based on income/location/dependents I need to know what next steps I may need to take to apply for a VA benefit or service.*
- *As a Veteran who determines that they may be ineligible based on income/location/dependents I need to know what, if any, next steps I may need to take to determine additional eligibility criteria*
- *As a Veteran who determines that they may be ineligible based on income/location/dependents I need to know what, if any, next steps I may be able to take to protest the ineligibility criteria*

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veteran understands in plain language how income/location/dependents are used as a component to their eligibility for benefits.
- Moving on from “What might I be eligible for?” to action (applying) with a better understanding of the evaluation process.
- In the case of an optional life change, Veteran has more information on which to base a decision.

## Undesired User Outcomes

*I'm not sure these are right* 

- Confusion or frustration with tool itself.
- Feeling confused by the information presented by the tool.
- Discouraging a Veteran from pursuing benefits.

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increase the use of VA’s self-service tools, and reduce phone calls to the VA.
- Better serve veterans by helping them get faster access to information about some factors affecting benefit eligibility.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Increased phone call load to VA about income limits (caused by confusion, etc)
