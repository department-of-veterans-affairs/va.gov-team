This research study was initially planned as broad discovery research on eligibility for VA health care. Following the first four research interviews, we realized the recruitment criteria did not identify participants who could provide the information needed to inform the design of a new income limits wizard as desired. We cancelled the 10 remaining interviews, and this topline report is a summary of what we learned from the four interviews.

# Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **learn about Veteran use cases for determining eligibility for VA health care**.

# Research questions
- What events drive a Veteran to consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- How do Veterans first determine eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- Do Veterans think about/consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions? 
  - If they do, when and how do they consider their eligibility?
- What problems do Veterans encounter when trying to determine eligibility?
- What do Veterans need to do after they understand their eligibility?

# Method	
We conducted **semi-structured interviews** to guide Veterans through a chronological re-telling of their experiences determining benefit eligibility. Sessions were conducted over Zoom on **October 19-20, 2022**.

## Participants
We talked to **4 Veterans** who all had VA health care. 

# Findings
## Eligibility for VA health care
1. All 4 Veterans **assumed they were eligible for VA health care because of their disability or the length of service**. 
     1. Two participants were 100% disabled, and another participant served in a combat zone--all of which affected their [VA priority groups](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/) for VA health care.
     1. Only one ever considered income, and that was not when initially applying but later when she was concerned that her increased income might disqualify her from the VA healthcare she had because it was above the stated income limits. Later, she found out that because she’s in Priority Group 5 (for Desert Storm combat), she’s eligible for VA health care no matter what life changes happen.
> *"Had no doubt [of my eligibility]. Had enough experience in the military...Knew I had to establish eligibility but wasn't concerned...knew health care was free" (p1).*

> *"Just knew I was eligible...I've always known it was free [told by other Veterans]...just provide a DD214 and scan a copy of my retired ID" (p3).*

> *"Assume you're eligible and find a way to get through the bureaucracy" (p4).*
2. Three of 4 participants said that they **got information about VA health care and eligibility from other Veterans**. Two participants specifically mentioned hearing this from other Veterans at the American Legion.
> *"A retired Colonel in the American Legion tells everyone how to get things done with short cuts without getting frustrated. You need to circumvent the system...[learn] how to get around the roadblocks to get to the right person" (p4).* 

3. Participants shared a few **barriers around eligibility**:
     1. Getting told "no" by someone at VA, when you know that you're eligible
     2. Not knowing your assigned priority group and what it means (e.g., you might be eligible even if your income increases)

## Applying for VA health care
4. Participants gave different **reasons for deciding to apply for VA health care**: 
     1. Heard that you could get a free annual physical at the VA (2 participants)  
     1. Encouraged to get care for PTSD (1 participant)  
     3. Had a medical problem that wasn't covered by their current insurance and heard that the VA would cover it (1 participant)
> *"A gentleman really pushed me to go get help through the VA for my PTSD. It was a combat Veteran taking care of another combat Veteran. 'Even if you don’t think you have an issue you do. Just go get checked out.' That was years before I applied" (p3).*
5. Participants discussed the following **barriers around applying for VA health care or considering whether to apply**:
     1. Broken online application process in which you apply but never receive any communication about enrollment or making appointments (from a participant who used to work for the VA in 2016-2020 following up on complaints from visually disabled Veterans; she would get their application materials and go to an Eligibility Specialist in-person at the VA to re-apply on their behalf)
     1. Closest VA medical center is too far away from where you live
     2. Not knowing where you can get VA care and where you can get care at a civilian/community care location locally
> *"I also knew there was a geographical issue to where you could receive care. I was not sure if it is by time or distance. After so long I didn’t want to fool with it...It would be handier if I could have been able to plug in my miles and driving distance and they would tell me if I had to drive to Richmond or get care out in the community because the person [on the phone at VA] could not tell me for sure" (p3).*

6. Participant **suggestions for making the VA health care application process easier** are listed below (each suggestion is from one participant):
     1. If VA had sent an email with a link and encouraged me to sign up
     2. More straightforward, simple, easy-to-answer questions in simple English with clear-cut answers 
     2. Knowledgeable people you can talk to at the VA and hear back from within 48-72 hours
     3. An arbitration board so there's an appeal process if you're told that you're not eligible for something that you think you qualify for
     4. An exit program when you leave the military where someone sits down with you and says, "based on your time in the service, here's what you're eligible for..."
     5. If the VA had electronic access to DD214's so Veterans don't have to request them (can take 6 months to receive) but instead Eligibility Specialists could look them up
    
## Recruiting for this research study
7.  NONE of the 4 participants we talked to had met the intended screening criteria of having recently enrolled in health care, being currently in the process of applying for health care or interested in applying, or currently receiving health care and having recently experienced a change in dependents, income, or location. 
8.  NONE of the 4 participants had applied for VA health care *in the last 3 months*, which was another recruiting criterion. All had been enrolled in VA health care for at least a year (some much longer), but they all had some memories of the process.
     
# Recommendations for recruiting
1. If we want to learn more about how Veterans think about eligibility for VA health care in terms of income limits, we need to **narrow our recruiting criteria to focus on Veterans in the [VA priority groups](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/) for which income is considered**. We would need to talk with Veterans who weren't sure going in whether they would be eligible for VA health care.
2. We should **talk to some people who don't currently have health care benefits** because we didn't get this perspective at all in this study.
3. If we reuse any of the **screening questions** from this study, **revise** as follows to make them more clear:

Screening Question #1. *(For everyone)* How often do you go online to access VA benefits and services?
- At least once a month *(recruit 3)*
- Once a year or less *(recruit 3)*
- Never *(recruit 3)*
     
Screening Question #2. (For everyone) Are you currently receiving VA health care benefits?
- Yes *(skip to screening question #3)*
- No *(skip to screening question #5)*
- I don't know *(disqualify)*

Screening Question #7. *(For Cohort 3 only)* Since receiving VA health care benefits, have you experienced any of the following *in the past 3 months*?
 - A change in number of dependents *(recruit 1-5 for Cohort 3)*
 - A change in annual income *(recruit 1-5 for Cohort 3)*
 - A change in geographic area *(recruit 1-5 for Cohort 3)*
 - Other: _________________ (??) 
 - None of these apply *(disqualify)*
