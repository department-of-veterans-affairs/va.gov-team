## Research Goals
The new Income Limits application enables Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to **look up the income limits for VA health care benefits** by answering several questions.

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) when they might want to know whether they may be eligible for VA health care with their current income:
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the newly designed income limits application**. Learnings will help refine the design of the application before launch.

## Research Questions
1. What are Veterans' expectations of income eligibility for VA health care? (ask before showing app)
     1. **Half of the participants (4 of 8) hadn't heard of income eligibility for VA health care**. One of these participants assumed that income wasn't relevant because her husband receives VA health care with his service-connected disability (and so probably not subject to income limits).
3. Where do Veterans expect to find this app? (i.e., Costs of Care page, Eligibility page, etc.)
     1. **VA.gov** (5 participants; 3 of whom said under health care > income eligibility)
     2. VA mobile app under benefits (1 participant), 
     3. VBA site (1)
5. Do Veterans understand the questions in the app? Is anything unclear or confusing?
     1. Yes, but some terminology unclear: VBA, dependents, Aid and Attendance, Housebound allowance 
7. Do Veterans find a summary page helpful for verifying the information entered?
     1. Yes
8. Do Veterans understand the income limits presented in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
     1. Yes, but one participant expected the range breaks to be at even thousands of dollars
10. Do Veterans understand the relevant year of income for their eligibility? 
     1. Only one participant mentioned understanding it. No one else commented.
12. Do Veterans understand the health care benefits shown in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
     1. Confusion around "VA health care", "most types of care", "copays" vs. "full copays", and the lack of consistent bullets across the different ranges.
14. How far do Veterans scroll down the app results page?
     1. Most participants scrolled all the way to the bottom, but 2 did not.
16. Do Veterans understand deductions and how that affects their income? (Did they see the details about this?)
     1. No. Only 1 participant mentioned deductions. No other participants said anything about it and may not have known they were relevant because they didn't open the _How to estimate your income for this tool_ additional info component. 
18. After seeing the information presented in the app results page, what do Veterans want to do next? 
     1. Click on _Find out if you may be eligible for VA health care_ link in the _$90,090 or more_ accordion (4 participants), though this didn't work in the prototype. It was intended to link to the [current Eligibility page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/).
     1. Apply for VA health care (2 participants) = what we wanted people to do
     1. Call or visit a nearby VA facility (2)
     1. Do more research to find specific coverages (1)
     1. Apply for disability because probably won't qualify based on income limits (1)
20. Do Veterans understand that they can use this to find the income limits for a previous year (not 2023)? Reaction to it not being part of the flow?
     1. Participants completed the task using the "past income limits" link they found on the app results page, but not sure whether they really understood the use case. No comments about accessing from the results page.


## Methodology 
We conducted **usability testing** on April 5-11, 2023 to get feedback from research participants using a click-through prototype over Zoom. Perigean recruited the participants.

**We talked to 8 Veterans**, one of whom was also a Veteran's family member.
- 6 of 8 used a smartphone for the session, and 2 used a computer
- NONE use VA health care
- NONE receive a pension from the VA
- NONE get VA disability compensation for a service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher

For more details, see [Who we talked to](#who-we-talked-to).

Participants were asked about the following:
1. Wayfinding--Find out if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income, with no guidance for where to start
2. The landing page in the prototype, which you can use to get to the income limits app (Note: The landing page is a screenshot of the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) page on VA.gov)
3. The intro page in the app
4. The question pages in the app
5. The results page in the app
6. What they would do next after seeing the results
7. How to check whether they entered their location correctly
8. How to see the income limits for a previous year


## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Veterans will be able to answer the questions in the app for themselves.
     1. LIKELY TRUE: Participants were able to answer the questions, but some terminology clarifications would be helpful.
3. From the information presented in the app results page, Veterans will understand how the different income thresholds affect the health care benefits they might qualify for, including if their income is higher than all of the thresholds.
     1. LIKELY TRUE: Participants talked about the benefits in each income threshold but had some questions about them.
5. Zip code is sufficient/comfortable for Veterans to specify the location where they live.
     1. MAYBE TRUE: Participants didn't comment explicitly on this, but also weren't able to enter their own zip code due to the nature of the click-through prototype.
6. After seeing the summary page with information entered, Veterans will have confidence in the accuracy of the results page.
     1. LIKELY TRUE: All participants verified that the information entered was correct and then talked about the information on the results page as if it was true.
7. Veterans understand the difference between the desired year for benefits and the year that they need to use for income (the previous year).
     1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Only 2 participants talked about this explicitly, and we don't know whether the others didn't understand or did and just didn't talk about it.
8. Veterans understand that thresholds in the app are not final answers, and only by applying for VA health care can they learn what benefits they're eligible for.
     1. MAYBE TRUE: 4 of 6 participants thought that the benefits were not certain because of the phrase "may be eligible" above each of the lists of benefits. However, only 2 of 6 participants said that they would apply for health care. 
9. Veterans don't need to see their answers to the questions while looking at the results page (i.e., having answers only on the review page is enough). 
     1. DEFINITELY TRUE: None of the participants tried to look back at what they entered while reading the results.
10. The results page is an intuitive place for Veterans to seek information about historical income limits (_vs._ earlier in the interaction flow).
     1. LIKELY FALSE: Two participants had difficulty finding this link on the results page. 
11. The intro page communicates that income limits apply to only some Veterans.
     1. MAYBE TRUE: Some participants mentioned disability being a factor; however, one participant expected to be asked about their disability and service history in the income limits app, which doesn't happen because those kinds of qualifications are what make income limits irrelevant.

## Key Findings

1. All participants understood the purpose of the app and found it easy to use.

1. Participants missed that the app results are not the final answer.

1. Participants didn't know about deductions from income.

1. Participants had some confusion with terminology used in the questions, especially the word "dependents".

1. Participants had difficulty understanding the benefit descriptions for the income ranges.

1. There were a few navigation issues within the app.


## Details of Findings 

### 1. All participants understood the purpose of the app and found it easy to use
- All participants understood what the app was for--to find out before applying if they might be eligible for VA health care based on their income.
> *"Figure out even if I'm eligible by income before I continue on to do further research" (p8)*.

> *"See if I qualify or not based on income" (p9)*.
- All participants found it **easy to answer the questions**, which were posed one question at a time (the subtask design pattern). A few participants commented that it was really easy to answer the questions on their phone. There were 3 yes/no questions, and two short answer questions (zip code and number of dependents) in the app tested.
- All participants **used the *Continue* button without any hesitation**, and some used the *Back* button, too (others didn't need to).
- All participants **understood the income ranges** and figured out which one to open. One participant did say that they expected to have ranges with even thousands of dollars (i.e., _$82,000 - $89,999, $90,000 or more_ instead of _$81,900 - $90,089, $90,090 or more_).
> *"Not a lot of reading, not a lot of choices...As your income goes down, the more benefits you would receive" (p7)*.

- Once they found the _Get past income limits_ link, participants didn't have any difficulties doing the **Past Income limits task**. One participant wanted to try a different zip code for the city he's considering moving to in order to learn if he would be eligible for VA health care there. Another participant said they might look at past income limits to see if there was a pattern of increases each year so they could get a sense of what they might pay for copays in the future.

### 2. Participants missed that the app results are not the final answer
We have data from only 6 of 8 participants because the other 2 participants didn't get to that task (due to arriving to the session late or dropping off the internet during the session). 
- 4 of 6 participants thought that the **benefits were not certain because of the phrase "may be eligible"** above each of the lists of benefits. None of these participants had opened the _How to estimate your income for this tool_ additional info component, so they were guessing based on the content on the page. 

- **After seeing the app results, here's what participants planned to do next** (some participants said multiple things):
  - Click on _Find out if you may be eligible for VA health care_ link in the _$90,090 or more_ accordion (4 participants), though this didn't work in the prototype. It was intended to link to the [current Eligibility page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/).  
  - Apply for VA health care (2 participants) = what we wanted people to do
  - Call or visit a nearby VA facility (2)
  - Do more research to find specific coverages (e.g., copay amounts), though if income is over $90,000, wouldn't do too much more research (1)
  - Apply for disability because probably won't qualify based on income limits (1)
  > *"From what I read, I would not be able to receive health care unless I have a disability...I may need to figure out if I would have a disability rating because I may not get anything from the VA in terms of healthcare on my own based off income" (p7)*.
  
  > *"I didn't apply for disability because I feel bad. Other people came back missing limbs, and I'm pretty OK compared to them. But now my hearing is bad, and I'm wondering if it's because of the firing ranges. How do I prove that?" (p7)*.

- 4 of 6 participants **didn't realize that you needed to apply for VA health care** in order to find out for sure if you qualify. 
- 2 participants figured out later in the session that they needed to apply--only after they opened the _How to estimate your income for this tool_ additional info component in the Past Year task.
> *"Oh! You need to apply. So not take this information at face value" (p1)*.

**One problem is that the results page has two calls to action**:
1. Select your household income range
1. Apply for VA health care 

All Veteran participants did #1, but few did #2. WHY?
- #2 doesn’t seem worth doing if you’re in the highest income bracket.
- #2 is lower down on the page so not prominent visually.
- The instruction to apply is not prominent visually–in the second sentence of the note–and is sandwiched between instructions about #2.

RECOMMENDATION: Clarify and sequence the two calls to action on the results page by focusing first on selecting an income range, and second on applying for VA health care. To do this, consider moving the "Note" text ("You'll still need to meet basic eligibility requirements to enroll. To find out if you're eligible, apply now") and the _Apply for VA health care_ link to **inside _every_ income accordion**, right after the benefits description.

### 3. Participants didn't know about deductions from income

Most participants (7 of 8) **didn't open the _How to estimate your income for this tool_ additional info component**, which describes household income and deductions that may apply. Two of them later opened it during the past limits task.
3 participants said they expected to use the AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) number from last year's income taxes, assuming household income but no additional deductions. 

> *"I automatically went to the numbers"* [without opening the _How to estimate your income for this tool_ additional info component] *(p6)*.

- RECOMMENDATION: Because Veteran participants didn't realize that they could deduct expenses from their income, try to more explicitly incorporate the word/concept of "deductions" into the text on the results page. Consider doing this in the first sentence and also by showing the text under _How to estimate your income for this tool_ without using the additional info component (because it wasn't opened by most participants).


### 4. Participants had some confusion with terminology used in the questions, especially the word "dependents"
3 of 8 participants didn't know what **"Aid and Attendance benefits"** were but assumed that they didn't have it.
1 participant didn't know what **"Housebound allowance"** meant, but assumed they didn't have it.
In the question *Did you get a VA pension from VBA last year?*, 1 participant didn't know what **"VBA"** meant and said that they felt embarrassed about it and also distracted from the task at hand.

> *"I get embarrassed when I don’t know what things mean when they are asked. It also makes me start questioning if I should be receiving these other things, and it gets me off track. Makes me want to look into those things" (p7)*.

- RECOMMENDATION: Delete the text "from VBA" in the pension question because it's confusing. Also, this wording didn't get approved by Content and will be removed because it goes against current Content standards. Potential revision: "Did you get a VA Veterans pension?”
- RECOMMENDATION: Add more description to the "Aid and Attendance" and "Housebound allowance" pages and/or provide links to details because some Veterans don't know what they mean and want to understand before answering the question.

Participants had different interpretations for the **dependents** question. Some said they would enter what they put on their income taxes, and others remembered this information incorrectly or might have been thinking of the VA's definition of dependents, which includes your spouse.
- Half of the participants entered what they put on their income taxes, though one said that he'd ask his wife what that was because she does their taxes. 
- Two participants wanted to enter 1 for their wife, with whom they file taxes jointly.
- One participant entered 2 for his grown kids, which are likely not dependents in the income tax sense.
- One participant wanted to enter 1 for himself. Was he maybe thinking of income tax exemptions?

- RECOMMENDATION: Clarify the meaning of "dependents" in this question per income taxes or VA rules, and add details to the question so people will know how to answer. According to a VA subject-matter expert (in an email dated 4/17/2023), dependents include *your spouse*, unmarried children under 18 (or 18-23 if attending school full-time or disabled prior to reaching age 18), and parents if in the Veteran's direct care and whose net worth and income are below a fixed limit.

### 5. Participants had difficulty understanding some of the benefit descriptions for the income ranges
Participants found some of the text to be confusing and/or ambiguous, which made it difficult for them to understand the specific benefits and compare them across income ranges. Each of the phrases below generated questions by 3 of 8 participants (but not the same participants for each): 
- **"VA health care"**--medical? dental? vision? only at a VA hospital?
- **"most types of care"**--outpatient office visits for routine appointments? appointments for illness? lab work and screenings? inpatient care? surgery? dental? vision? for dependents, too?
- **"copays" *vs.* "full copays"**--dollar amounts? how much for surgery and is there a limit? 

> *"I don't understand. I would have to ask someone or look it up" (p8)*.

- RECOMMENDATION: Add more description to the benefits and/or provide links to details for "VA health care", "most types of care", "copays", and "full copays".
- RECOMMENDATION: Consider making the bullets for each benefit more consistent so it's easier to compare them across income thresholds (which all participants tried to do): 
  - Outpatient and inpatient visits
  - Prescriptions
  - Travel pay (if applicable)


### 6. There were a few navigation issues within the app
Participants were able to navigate through the design prototype fairly smoothly, except for the following three interactions:

a. ***Review the information you entered*** link--Two participants did _not_ use this link to go back from the results page to the summary page. They used the _Back_ button in their browser instead, though one participant was concerned that this might exit them out of the app (it didn't). A different participant thought this link would take them to information that they filled out previously on VA forms (which is incorrect). Notice that the placement of the _Review the information you entered_ link is sandwiched between the instructions for the page and the CTA to select your income range, and not near any other navigation items.
- RECOMMENDATION: Consider making the *Review the information you entered* link into a breadcrumb at the top of the page where it won't separate the instructions and the CTA to select your income range. Maybe check how other VA.gov pages enable you to navigate to the review page.  

b. **_Get past income limits_** link--Two participants had difficulty finding this link on the results page. One of them looked in the _How to estimate your income for this tool_ additional info component, but this wasn't relevant. They also wanted to click _Expand all_ above the income ranges. One of the participants was looking for a search tool but never found one.
- RECOMMENDATION: If we want the _Get past income limits_ link to be easier to find, consider moving it up higher on the results page, or possibly add a year selector to the app flow right before asking any questions. Another approach would be to place the link on the intro page under the _Get started_ CTA and instrument it for analytics so we will be able to track its usage in Production.
 
c. After one participant used the **_Review Info_ page** to return to the zip code page and **then clicked the _Continue_ button**, they said they were surprised to see the _Dependents_ page. They expected to see the _Review Info_ page again. Other participants saw this, too, and said that they must be going back through all the screens.
- RECOMMENDATION: If someone navigates from the _Review Info_ page to another page, the _Continue_ button should take you back to the _Review Info_ page instead of to the next question (which was intended as the design but wasn't implemented in the click-through prototype).

## Additional Insights

### Content feedback on the app intro page
We heard **additional feedback on the app intro page**. Each of the comments below is from only one participant, but could still be helpful to potentially tweak the content on the page.
- Based on the first sentence ("You may be eligible for VA health care based on your VA disability rating, service history, or other factors"), 1 participant **expected to be asked about their disability rating and service history**, but those are actually reasons that you would NOT need the app. This participant appeared to be confused about what the app was going to ask about, given the eligibility factors of both disability rating and income mentioned in the first paragraph. 
  - RECOMMENDATION: Clarify and differentiate the eligibility factors of disability rating, service history, and income limits better in the first paragraph on the intro page because it's confusing as is. Instead or in addition, consider adding qualifying questions to the app to screen out people who have a service-connected disability rating of at least 50% or other factors that result in automatic eligibility for VA health care.
  
- 1 participant was **concerned about how long this income limits app will take to go through** because they'll probably need to create a password and gather a lot of documents (e.g., investments, W2s, DD214). After going through the app pages, this participant was relieved.
>  *"Wasn't overwhelming with requiring a ton of info, such as finding a DD214, and creating a new password. It was quick--that's important" (p7)*.
- RECOMMENDATION: To inform Veterans about the minimal amount of time and effort needed to use this app, consider adding some content to the intro page about it being quick, and that you only need to answer a few easy questions.
  
- 1 participant who had a cognitive disability said that the block of **text was too much to read and understand**.  
> *"Too much text and not enough separation of it [with formatting]. Want a TL;DR" (p1)*.

- 1 participant suggested adding a little more text to **encourage Veterans to try to get these benefits** if they need them.
> *"Maybe there is some small wording that you can put in that encourages Veterans to get these benefits if you need them...I don't want to take away from someone else who needs it more. 'Hey, we encourage you to do this. Let's find out if you're eligible'--like selling it to me. You really want me to find out if I'm eligible. A little positive affirmation. Just don’t add  a lot more reading. It's very cut and dry...not warm and welcoming" (p7)."*
- RECOMMENDATION: To support Veterans' exploration of VA health care, consider adding to the intro page some friendly encouragement to invite them to use this tool to find out if they're eligible for VA health care.

### How participants looked for income limits before seeing the new app
Before showing participants the design prototype for the income limits app, we asked how they would find out if they are eligible for VA health care with their current income.
- **7 of 8 participants started with a search**--6 of them from Google, and 1 from their phone home screen. 
  - 5 of the 7 who searched sucessfully found the [Annual Income Limits table](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/annual_income_limits_health_benefits.asp). 
  - 2 participants couldn't find anything relevant after several google searches. They kept landing on the [non-modernized benefits.va.gov page](https://benefits.va.gov/benefits/) and not finding anything about income limits there.
- 1 participant went straight to VA.gov, looked in the Health care box of links, but couldn't find anything relevant. Then they used site search, and found the [Annual Income Limits table](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/annual_income_limits_health_benefits.asp).
- 1 participant who found the [Annual Income Limits table](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/annual_income_limits_health_benefits.asp) said that they would contact an attorney to find out which group they're in.
> *"Better to ask a professional, rather than spin your wheels" (p1)*.

</details>

### The landing page was very long to read on a phone, and participants had difficulty finding income limits  
The **landing page** in the prototype was a static version of the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) on which the only working links were _Check our current income limits_ in two different places on the page. When the participant clicked on one of those two links, they saw the income limits intro page.

Scrolling down this very long landing page on a phone took a while, especially for the 3 participants who were reading everything on that page. The two income limits links were several scroll distances down the page, and there was more to the page below these links. 
- 2 participants seemed lost in the long page while scrolling. 
- 1 participant never found either of the income limits links. 
- Another participant found one of them but continued reading down the page, and when they scrolled back up, had trouble finding the link again. 
- 2 other participants missed both links on their first look through the page but found one later. 
- 6 participants clicked on the first income limits link (in the section _Will I need to pay for any of my care, tests or medications?_), and only 1 participant clicked on the second income limits link (in the section _Does VA verify the information I provide?_) and remarked:
> *"Kind of far down on the page" (p9).*

- RECOMMENDATION: To make it easier to find information on income limits, consider restructuring the content on the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) page to put all income limits info closer together and move one of the income limits app links closer to the top of page.


## Recommendations
Recommendations are listed below, with team decisions noted in *ITALIC CAPS*.
### For the app design and functionality
1. **Clarify and sequence the two calls to action on the results page by** focusing first on selecting an income range, and second on applying for VA health care. To do this, consider moving the "Note" text ("You'll still need to meet basic eligibility requirements to enroll. To find out if you're eligible, apply now") and the **_Apply for VA health care_ link to inside _every_ income accordion**, right after the benefits description. *ADD APPLY CTA INSIDE EVERY INCOME ACCORDION*
6. Because Veteran participants didn't realize that they could deduct expenses from their income and didn't open **_How to estimate your income for this tool_** on the results page, **remove the additional info component** and change this into a heading or plain text to make the content below visible without requiring any user interaction. _See Content recommendation #9 below._ *DONE*
8. **Consider making the *Review the information you entered* link into a breadcrumb** at the top of the page where it won't separate the instructions and the CTA to select your income range. Maybe check how other VA.gov pages enable you to navigate to the review page. _Need to discuss with the Sitewide Content/IA team._ *REPLACE LINK WITH BACK BUTTON AT BOTTOM OF PAGE*
9. If someone navigates from the _Review Info_ page to another page, the **_Continue_ button should take you back to the _Review Info_ page** instead of to the next question (which was intended as the design but wasn't implemented in the click-through prototype). *DONE*
10. If we want the **_Get past income limits_ link to be easier to find**, consider moving it up higher on the results page, or possibly add a year selector to the app flow right before asking any questions. Another approach would be to place the link on the intro page under the _Get started_ CTA and instrument it for analytics so we will be able to track its usage in Production. *MOVE LINK TO INTRO PAGE*

### For content in the app
6. **Clarify the meaning of "dependents"** in the question per income taxes or VA rules, **and add details to the question** so people will know how to answer. According to a VA subject-matter expert (in an email dated 4/17/2023), dependents include *your spouse*, unmarried children under 18 (or 18-23 if attending school full-time or disabled prior to reaching age 18), and parents if in the Veteran's direct care and whose net worth and income are below a fixed limit. *DONE*
3. **Delete the text "from VBA"** in the pension question because it's confusing. Also, this wording didn't get approved by Content and will be removed because it goes against current Content standards. Potential revision from Danielle: "Did you get a VA Veterans pension last year?” *DELETE QUESTION* 
4. **Add more description to the "Aid and Attendance" and "Housebound allowance" questions** and/or provide links to details because some Veterans don't know what they mean and want to understand before answering the question. *DELETE QUESTIONS* 
6. Because Veteran participants didn't realize that they could deduct expenses from their income, try to **more explicitly incorporate the word/concept of "deductions" into the text on the results page**. Consider doing this in the first sentence and also by showing the text under _How to estimate your income for this tool_ without using the additional info component (because it wasn't opened by most participants). Potential ideas for doing so are listed below: *ALL DONE*
     1. In the first sentence, for example, we could add some new words (in _italics_) to the first sentence: "We use your last year's _household_ income _minus deductions (such as out-of-pocket medical expenses, education costs, and funeral/burial expenses for a spouse or child)_ to determine..." 
     2. Consider changing the additional info component _How to estimate your income for this tool_ into a heading or plain text that includes the word/concept of "deductions".
     3. Consider whether to use the longer bulleted version of Danielle's copy under _How to estimate your income for this tool_, as documented [in slack here](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C52CL1PKQ/p1678918537793539?thread_ts=1678914092.806529&cid=C52CL1PKQ).
8. Add **more description to the benefits and/or provide links to details** for "VA health care", "most types of care", "copays", and "full copays". *DONE*
9. Consider **making the bullets for each benefit more consistent** so it's easier to compare them across income thresholds (which all participants tried to do): *DONE*
     1. Outpatient and inpatient visits
     1. Prescriptions
     1. Travel pay (if applicable)

1. **Clarify and differentiate the eligibility factors of disability rating, service history, and income limits better in the first paragraph on the intro page** because it's confusing as is. Instead or in addition, **consider adding qualifying questions to the app** to screen out people who have a service-connected disability rating of at least 50% or other factors that result in automatic eligibility for VA health care. Potential ideas for doing so are listed below:
     1. Could reword the first sentence to lead with a clearer distinction between income limits and what factors make them relevant or not:  "_Not everyone is affected by income limits._ You may be _automatically_ eligible for VA health care based on your VA disability rating, service history, or other factors. If you're not eligible based on these factors, you may still qualify if your income is within our limit." *DONE*
     1. Pension is already a question in the app, which participants found easy to answer (1 of 3 yes/no questions in the app tested). Perhaps we should **add other simple yes/no questions in the app, which would likely be more intuitive for Veterans**, as compared to understanding a block of text summarizing all the cases in which income limits don't apply. How do we decide which automatic eligibility criteria get their own question _vs._ just get listed somewhere? *NOT DOING BECAUSE OUTSIDE SCOPE OF APP*
      1. If the pension question gets removed, how/where would Veterans learn whether income limits are relevant for them personally? Would pension need to be added to the content about eligibility factors on the intro page? An issue is how explicit should we be in the app about who should use the app and who doesn't need to.
12. To inform Veterans about the minimal amount of time and effort needed to use this app, consider **adding some content to the intro page about it being quick, and that you only need to answer a few easy questions**. *ADD NUMBER OF QUESTIONS*
14. To support Veterans' exploration of VA health care, consider **adding to the intro page some friendly encouragement** to invite them to use this tool to find out if they're eligible for VA health care. *DONE*
15. To make it easier to find information on income limits, consider **restructuring the content on the [Your health care costs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) page** to put all income limits info closer together and move one of the income limits app links closer to the top of page. *DONE*

## Next Steps

- Present readout to project stakeholders and Veteran Digital User Experience Weekly Design Sync meeting.
- Annotate the revised design for implementation.
