This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the redesigned income limits application**.

## Participants
We talked to **8 Veterans**, one of whom was also a Veteran's family member (spouse). 
- *Most (6 of 8) used a smartphone* during the session.
- *None* of them had VA health care, a VA pension, or disability compensation of 50% or higher.


## Preliminary Findings
### Usability Successes
1. All participants **understood the purpose of the app**--to find out if they might be eligible for VA health care based on their income before applying.
2. All participants found it **easy to answer the questions**, which were posed one question at a time (the subtask design pattern).
3. All participants **used the *Continue* button without any hesitation**, and some used the *Back* button, too (others didn't need to).
4. All participants **understood the income ranges** and figured out which one to open.
5. Once they found the "Get past income limits" link, participants didn't have any difficulties doing the **Past Income limits task**.


### Usability Issues
6. Participants found the **landing page** in the prototype ([Your health care costs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/)) to be **very long**--especially on a phone--and it was **difficult to locate the "Check our current income limits" link** in it (which was in two places).
6. Some participants were **confused by the mention of cases where income limits don't apply**, wondered whether income limits applied to them, and thought the app might help them figure this out. 
7. Participants had **different interpretations for the dependents question**. Some said they would enter what they put on their income taxes, and others remembered this information incorrectly or might have been thinking of the VA's definition of dependents, which includes your spouse.
8. Most participants **didn't open the "How to estimate your income for this tool"** accordion and didn't mention any deductions. They simply used the salary number from the moderator to select an income range to open. 
9. Participants found **parts of the benefit descriptions under each income range to be unclear** and wanted more details (e.g., "most types of care", "full copays").
10. Most participants believed the results they got from the app and **weren't inclined to apply for health care** if their income was in the highest bracket.
11. Some participants had **difficulty navigating back to the _Review information_ page** from the _Results page_.

## Next Steps
- Synthesize data
- Write research report
