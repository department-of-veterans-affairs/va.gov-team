# Design Intent 
Aug 11, 2022

## Why are there two locations for two versions of the app?
- From Dave: OCTO-DE contacted us 2 years ago to modernize: their old database has tanked, they have no idea how to put 2022 data in to the existing web app
- So part of this work will be figuring out: where will this data live? how will it be used? 

## Info contained is more than static info in table now: lots of diff factors come into play
 - Trying to understand: how do veterans think about their eligibility as regards to each of the different factors?
 - HMW they understand how that might impact their eligibility?
 - What are their needs around this tool in terms of initial application, as well as modeling for life changes.

## Platform feedback: 

Sean Sewell - design
- Advocate for mobile, especially when talking about tables

Allison Christman - design
- No comments

Clayton - research
- Noted that said "we're about to log you out" when he wasn't logged in
- Disclaimer that anything we discuss today, still need to go through research review process to kick off recruitment (Dates within the research plan will need to be revised so you have time to go through research review process)
- Who do you live with? Who were you with? Wrestling with these questions: Is this info needed? Could be triggering for someone that has lost a loved one or going through divorce (these are reasons someone may need to revisit this)
- These questions are important enough to ask, so make sure that you review page about "research safety and emergency exit strategies": would recommend putting emergency exit strategies w/in conversation guide, so you can easily scroll down into that
- Make sure to look into that (document) ^
- Question 5 in main guided storytelling section: felt a little bit vague, unsure if asking about VA benefits
- Were you receiving other benefits at this time? not clear if asking about VA benefits or other types of healthcare benefits

Jim Ryan - information architecture
- Suggest the memorable instance technique: Tell me about a time that stands out in your memory ...
- One thing that might be helpful: Go into existing app UI and do UX testing of the UI for the current app and create a user journey to show the mental/emotional state at each stage

Accessibility rep was not present. Will send over feedback, comments, questions by EOD tomorrow, Friday Aug 12.
