## Overview

Income is one aspect that determine's a Veteran's eligibility for benefits from VA. An [existing application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) allows Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the financial thresholds based on location and number of dependents.

## Problem Statement

The [existing Income Limits web application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) is difficult to maintain the data to accurately provide information to Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the financial thresholds based on location and number of dependents. In addition, the current application lacks plain language or clearly defined use cases/usability design and testing to validate that it is intuitively aligned to problems for the Veteran and providing information that is clear and easy to understand.

How might we rebuild this application so that we clearly define the Veteran use cases for this application and modernize the application to better align with how Veterans need to make use of income, location, dependent information as it relates to VA benefit eligibility?

- *As a Veteran I need to understand how income, location, and dependents are a factor in my eligibility determination for VA benefits so that I can understand how this is part - but not all of - the calculation for my eligibility for VA benefits.*
- *As a Veteran I need to be able to find the income threshold for my locality so that I can understand whether or not my financial threshold contributes to or detracts from my eligibility for VA benefits.*
- *As a Veteran I need to be able to model changes in my life circumstances to see if such changes may impact my eligibility for VA benefits.*
- *As a Veteran who determines that they are eligible based on income/location/dependents I need to know what next steps I may need to take to determine additional eligibility criteria.*
- *As a Veteran who determines that they are eligible based on income/location/dependents I need to know what next steps I may need to take to apply for a VA benefit or service.*
- *As a Veteran who determines that they may be ineligible based on income/location/dependents I need to know what, if any, next steps I may need to take to determine additional eligibility criteria*
- *As a Veteran who determines that they may be ineligible based on income/location/dependents I need to know what, if any, next steps I may be able to take to protest the ineligibility criteria*

 
## Desired User Outcomes

*I'm not sure these are right - where is the "learn" part of this.* 

- In the case of an eligible Veteran: Quickly move on from “What might I be eligible for?” to action (obtaining benefits).
- In the case of an ineligible Veteran: Understand what criteria were used to render a negative result, and provide a path to resolve questions.
- Self-service tool: no need for wait times associated with calling the VA


## Undesired User Outcomes

*I'm not sure these are right* 

- Confusion or frustration with tool itself
- ~Feeling that unwelcome news (lack of eligibility) is opaque/unjustified, unfair, or wrongly determined.~ I don't think that this application is the sole determinant of "lack of eligibility" so this use case is potentially invalid.
- Incorrectly discouraging an eligible Veteran from pursuing benefits. (per my note above, this is not the only determinant so we would want to provide routes for Veteran to get more information and/or advocate for their case with the other criterion)


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increase the use of VA’s self-service tools, and reduce phone calls to the VA.
- ~Maintain a single source of truth for income limits instead of the variety of documents currently available in disparate places (some of which are out of date).~
- Better serve veterans by helping them get faster access to the benefits they are entitled to.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Increased phone call load to VA about income limits (caused by confusion, etc)

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |

| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
