This research summary of four interviews conducted is the result of a partial synthesis process.

# Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **learn about Veteran use cases for determining eligibility for VA health care**.

# Research questions
- What events drive a Veteran to consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- How do Veterans first determine eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- Do Veterans think about/consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions? 
  - If they do, when and how do they consider their eligibility?
- What problems do Veterans encounter when trying to determine eligibility?
- What do Veterans need to do after they understand their eligibility?

# Hypotheses
- Veterans will likely not know the current application exists, and the VA.gov may not be Veterans' go-to source of information around benefit eligibility.
- Veterans with benefits will have worked with someone in person or over the phone to get help determining eligibility and applying for benefits.
- Veterans may not be aware of when or how their eligibility for benefits was determined.

# Method	
We conducted **semi-structured interviews** to guide Veterans through a chronological re-telling of their experience(s) determining benefit eligibility. Sessions were conducted over Zoom on October 19-20, 2022.
