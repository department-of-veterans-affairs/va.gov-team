# Research Plan for Usability Testing, Income Limits App, January 2023

## Background
An [existing application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) allows Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the income limits for VA National medical benefits and prescriptions based on location and number of dependents. 

However, there are multiple issues with the existing application, which lacks:
- Reliably accurate data
- Plain language
- Clearly defined use cases, usability design, and testing to ensure that it is aligned to Veteran needs and is intuitive for Veterans to use

We are rebuilding and modernizing this application, and would like to get user feedback on our designs.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
1. Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
2. Starting up (Attending to health needs, Finding something to do/Balancing finances, Finding a place to live)
3. Putting down roots (Starting, growing or maintaining my family)
4. Retiring (Taking care of my health)
5. Aging (Not listed in journey, but dealing with death of spouse)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the newly redesigned income limits application**.

### Outcome
Learnings will help iterate the design of the application.

### Research questions
- Are participants 

### Hypotheses
- 

## Method	
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide Veterans through a click-through prototype. 

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**. Plus, we would like to request that **Perigean calls each participant** to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them.

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
