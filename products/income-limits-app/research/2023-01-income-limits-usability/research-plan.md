# Research Plan for Usability Testing, Income Limits App, February 2023

## Background
An [existing application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) allows Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the income limits for VA National medical benefits and prescriptions based on location and number of dependents. 

However, there are multiple issues with the existing application, which lacks:
- Reliably accurate data
- Plain language
- Clearly defined use cases, usability design, and testing to ensure that it is aligned to Veteran needs and is intuitive for Veterans to use.

We are rebuilding and modernizing this application, and would like to get user feedback on our designs.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the newly redesigned income limits application**.

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine the design of the application.

### Research questions
1. What are Veterans' expectations of income eligibility for VA health care? (ask before showing app)
1. How do Veterans expect to "wayfind" this app?
1. Do Veterans understand the questions in the app? Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. Do Veterans expect a summary page that shows information entered?
1. Do Veterans understand the income limits presented in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. Do Veterans understand the relevant year of income for their eligibility? 
1. Do Veterans understand the health care benefits shown in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. How far do Veterans scroll down the app results page?
1. Do Veterans understand deductions and how that affects their income? (Did they see the details below all the income thresholds?)
1. After seeing the information presented in the app results page, what do Veterans want to do next? 
1. Do Veterans understand that they can use this to find the income limits for a previous year (not 2023)? Reaction to it not being part of the flow?


### Hypotheses
1. Veterans will be able to answer the questions in the app for themselves.
2. From the information presented in the app results page, Veterans will understand how the different income thresholds affect the health care benefits they might qualify for, including if their income is higher than all of the thresholds.
3. Zip code is sufficient/comfortable for Veterans to specify the location where they live.
4. After seeing the summary page with information entered, Veterans will have confidence in the accuracy of the results page.
5. Veterans understand the difference between the desired year for benefits and the year that they need to use for income (the previous year).
6. Veterans understand that thresholds in the app are not final answers, and only by applying can they learn what benefits they're eligible for.

## Method	
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide Veterans through a click-through prototype. 

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**.
