## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks using a website that I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

*Click Live Transcript and **Enable**, or **Show Captions**.* 

*Click **Live Transcript > View Full Transcript***

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says **Share**. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose **"Screen"** (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: **Broadcast screen**

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## User Tasks
Now I'm going to ask you to do some things... ***Reassure if p nervous or says they feel dumb or embarrassed***

I would like you to share your phone screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. You might want to first close any apps that you don’t want me to see.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 20 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
*(if they DON'T have VA health care)* Let's say that you're wondering if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income.

*(if they already have VA health care)* Let's say that your income just changed, and you want to know whether you're still eligible for VA health care or if your benefits might change.

*if they have 50% or higher disability rating, do they say that income limits don't apply to them? Y / N / ____________*

*if they have a VA pension, do they say that income limits don't apply to them? Y / N / ____________*

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. 

Can you show me how you would find out if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income?

- *RECORD where they go on VA.gov: Cost of care page / Eligibility page / ______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

I have a web page that I'd like you to look at while you're sharing your screen with me over Zoom. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive–some things work, and many things do not. I'd like you to talk to me about what you want to do BEFORE you click anything.

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **https://bit.ly/3zuL4Be**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Do you see the link? 

- *If see “unsupported browser” error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen and mouse control*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)*

Could you try to use this to find out if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income? Please explain what you want to do before clicking anywhere.
- *(Click: income limits--under "Will I need to pay..." (w/other links) or "Does VA verify..." (lone link)?)*

### Task 3: [Intro page of app] 
Let's talk before you click anywhere...What are your impressions of this page?
What do you think you can do here?

*(does p think this tool will ask about disability rating and other factors, or income limits?)*

Do you think this tool would be useful for you or not? WHY?
*(want to get a sense for HOW useful it might be for them)*

If not, who would it be useful for?

*click "Get started"*
- *(RECORD all comments*)

### Task 4: [Answer questions in app] 
How would you use this? Please talk me through what you would do, but **do not** click anywhere yet.

- *(when click on an entry field and then see different info)* This prototype isn't interactive enough to let you enter your own information, but it will jump to a new screen with some information already filled out. I'd like you to tell me what you would enter for yourself or what questions you have about it.

- *(RECORD all comments and anything confusing re the interactions on each screen of the prototype:)*
  - *Pension--*

Can you explain what this page means to you?

How is your income involved here?

- *RECORD: Understand that it's your previous year's income that's relevant? yes / no*

If your salary last year was around $40,000, what might that mean for your eligibility for VA health care? *(RECORD)*

Can you tell me what benefits you might get? 
- *PROBE on meaning of "Free VA health care for most types of care"*
- *PROBE on meaning of "copays"*

If your salary last year was around $28,000, what might that mean? *(RECORD)*

If your salary last year was around $83,000, what might that mean? *(RECORD)*

If your salary last year was around $90,000, what might that mean? *(RECORD)*

How sure are you that these benefits *would apply* if your salary was around $90,000?

- *(Could probe)* How certain are you that you *don't qualify for more benefits*? 
- Is there anything that might affect the income number that you use here? *(e.g., deductions)*

What if your salary was around $100,000? *(RECORD)*

*RECORD any comments about...*
- *benefits (in bullets)--*
- *income/deductions--*

- *RECORD what they say: definitive answer / only part of the answer / need to apply to know for sure / _____________*
- *Make sure that participant is talking about what they're seeing in the app,* and NOT *what they knew before this session!*

How would you decide what to do next? 

What would you do next?

  - *Any difficulty finding the “Review info entered” link? Y / N*
- *If surprised by dependents screen, ask what they expected to see (Continue button --> Review page?)*

### Task 8: [Change year]
Suppose that you’re in the process of appealing a health care claim from 2021, and you want to see the income limits from that year. What could you do? Again, please tell me where you want to click before doing it.
- *(RECORD: click on "Get past income limits" / _________________________________)*

## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
