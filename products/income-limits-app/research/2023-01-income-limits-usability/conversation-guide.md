## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session and take notes. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

Today I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks using a website that I will share with you.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

*Click Live Transcript and **Enable**, or Show Captions*. 

*Click Live Transcript > View Full Transcript*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

## User Tasks
Now I'm going to ask you to do some things... 

### Screen sharing
I would like you first to share your screen with me--a web browser please. You might want to close any apps that you don’t want me to see.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
*(if they DON'T have VA health care)* Let's say that you're wondering if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income.

*(if they already have VA health care)* Let's say that your income just changed, and you want to know whether you're still eligible for VA health care or if your benefits might change.

How would you get started?

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

I have a web page that I'd like you to look at while you're sharing your screen with me over Zoom. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive, and so before clicking anywhere, I'd like you to tell me what you might do.

While you're looking at the prototype, I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/3whFCA2**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test.)*

Do you see the link? 

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)*

Could you try to use this to find out if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income? Please explain what you want to do before clicking anywhere.
- *(Click to start income limits app)*

### Task 3: [Intro page of app] 
What are your impressions of this page?
What do you think you can do here?

- *(RECORD all comments*)

### Task 4: [Answer questions in app] 
How would you use this? Please talk me through what you would do, but not click anywhere yet.

-*(when click on an entry field and then see different info)* This prototype isn't interactive enough to let you enter your information, but it will jump to a new screen with some information already filled out. I'd like to you tell me what you would enter for yourself or what questions you have about it.

-*(RECORD all comments and anything confusing re the interactions on each screen of the prototype:)*
  - *Where/zipcode--*
  - *Number of dependents--*
  - *VA Aid and Attendance--*
  - *VA Housebound benefits--*
  - *Summary screen of information entered--*

### Task 5: [Results screen]
What are your impressions of this page? *(RECORD what they say)*

How is your income involved here?

*RECORD: Understand that it's your previous year's income that's relevant? yes / no*

If your income last year was $40,000, what would that mean for your eligibility for VA health care? *(RECORD)*

If your income last year was $25,000, what would that mean? *(RECORD)*

What if your income was $100,000? *(RECORD)*

*RECORD: any comments about benefits (in bullets)*

*RECORD: any comments about deductions*

### Task 6: [What next]
What would you do next? *(RECORD: apply for VA health care / go back / ________________)*

### Task 7: [Check info entered]
Now you want to check whether you entered your location correctly. How could you do that? 
- *(RECORD: go back to summary screen / zip code entry screen / ________________)*

### Task 8: [Change year]
Suppose that you’re in the process of appealing a health care claim from 2021, and you want to see the income limits from that year? What could you do?
- *(RECORD: click on "income limits search" / _________________________________)*

When in this app would you prefer to specify the year? 
- *(RECORD: as is at end / earlier when answering questions / _________________)*

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

1. How or where would you expect to find this app that you just used?
1. What worked *well* for you?
1. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
1. What would you like to *change or add*?
1. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
