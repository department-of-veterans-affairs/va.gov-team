## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes.  

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the notetaker and observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

Today I'm going to be asking you some questions about VA benefits.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I really just want to learn from you/your experience. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** If you aren't comfortable answering some of the questions that I ask, please let me know and I'll be happy to move on.

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We wonâ€™t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

*Click Live Transcript and **Enable**, or Show Captions*.

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we jump into talking about VA health care benefits, I have a few questions to get to know you a bit more. 

1. Where do you live?
2. Would you mind if I ask who is part of your household right now? I don't need to know names or anything that you feel uncomfortable sharing.
     1. *(If sense hesitation)* Knowing how many dependents you have can help us better understand your needs around healthcare. You don't need to tell us their names or even your relationship with them. 
4. What do you like to do for fun?

_Note: We discussed possibly changing these questions to be more applicable to the VA, i.e. "What do you like about being part of the veteran community?" I think that's probably fine, though having thought more about it at this point, I do like the more general, open nature of these questions. I believe they open the conversation trying to see the participant in a more holistic way. Will participants think it's strange that we ask questions that touch their personal life, outside of their status as a veteran? I would think no, and that these types of more general questions opens the door for them to share things outside of what they see as specifically part of their experiences as a veteran._

## Guided Storytelling - 40 minutes

_Note about the following questions: 
Moderator is not expected to ask all questions as written below. These questions are more like guidelines to help the moderator if they're unsure what to ask next, or unsure how to phrase a question. Overall, this time should be used to get participant to explain their process of applying for health care benefits to see if, when, how, etc. eligibility comes into the picture._

Great to know a little bit more about you! Let's now turn towards talking about health care benefits. 

0. How often do you go online to access VA benefits and services?
1. Do you currently receive VA health care benefits? 
#### *If yes, ask 1a-1b. If no, skip to guide for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.*
1a. When did you first apply for health care benefits?

1b. Have you applied for VA health care benefits more than once?
#### *If yes, ask 2a-2c. If no, skip to 3.*
2a. How many other times did you apply for health care benefits?

2b. What was it that caused you to apply more than once?

2c. When was the most recent time you applied?

3. Since applying (that most recent time), have you experienced a change that might affect your benefits, such as number of dependents, amount of income, or you moved?
#### *If yes, ask 3a-3b. If no, skip ahead to guide for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.*
3a. What exactly was the change?

3b. When was that?
#### *After 3b, skip ahead to guide for Cohort 3*

For the rest of our conversation we're going to talk about _______ (the change) in the context of your VA health care benefits. I don't care at all whether or not a change was reported to VA. I don't really even know the rules around reporting a change. I'm just here to learn about how you think about the change in context of your benefits.

13. When if ever did this topic come up again? (repeat as needed)

###  (If p doesn't fit into any cohorts and there wasn't a change, could ask hypothetically...)
- Suppose that your income changed a lot. What might you need to know about whether that would affect your eligibility for VA health care?
- How would you learn more about that?  

### Things to watch for:
- Does participant demonstrate awareness of eligibility as part of benefits application process?
- What words or phrases does participant use to talk about eligibility/income limits?
- What type of emotional experience is associated with eligibility?

## Concluding questions - 10 minutes

- Looking back now, what do you wish you had known about _______ (eligibility) that you didn't know back then?
- What, if anything, does the phrase "income limits" mean to you?
- Is there anything else we didn't cover that you'd like to share about health care benefits eligibility?

## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the tools and services that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
