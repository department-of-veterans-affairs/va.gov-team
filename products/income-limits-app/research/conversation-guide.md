## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Florence and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about VA health care benefits.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.**
- **In this session, there is no right or wrong.** I'm not looking to test you or your ability, or make sure you're doing something the right way. Chances are, if you've experienced something or done something a certain way, others have too! I really just want to learn from you/your experience. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - X minutes

Before we jump into talking about VA health care benefits, I have a few questions to get to know you a bit more. 

1. Where do you live?
2. Who do you live with?
3. What do you like to do for fun?

## Guided Storytelling - X minutes

_Note about the following questions: 
Moderator is not expected to ask all questions as written below. These questions are more like guidelines to help the moderator if they're unsure what to ask next, or unsure how to phrase a question. Overall, this time should be used to get participant to explain their process of applying for health care benefits to see if, when, how, etc. eligibility comes into the picture._

Great to know a little bit more about you! Let's now turn towards talking about health care benefits. 

1. So just to start, do you currently receive VA health care benefits? 
### If yes, ask 1a-1b. If no, skip to guide for cohort 1 and cohort 2.
1a. When did you first apply for health care benefits?
1b. Have you applied for VA health care benefits more than once?

2a. How many other times did you apply for health care benefits?
2b. What was it that caused you to apply more than once?
2c. When was the most recent time you applied?
3. Since applying (that most recent time), have you experienced a change that might affect your benefits, such as number of dependents or amount of income?
### If yes, ask 3a-3b. If no, skip ahead to guide for cohort 1 and cohort 2.
3a. What exactly was the change?
3b. When was that?
### After 3b, skip ahead to guide for cohort 3

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future usabiility research session? 
If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
If emergency occurs, follow protocol to initiate assistance:
1. Stop research activity to attend to participant
2. Contact Perigean over Slack immediately. Use the direct message set up at the start of the study so everyone is notified:
- Included detailed description of scenario (e.g. the participant stopped responding and became listless, or the participant vocalized intent to harm)
- Perigean will be responsible for calling 911 or the Veteran Crisis Line as appropriate
When emergency is stabilized:
1. Update the Slack channel with any relevant basic details
2. Loop in your project point of contact (usually your OCTO lead)
