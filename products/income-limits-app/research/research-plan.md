# Research Plan for Public Websites, Income Limits App, Sept 2022

## Background
An [existing application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) allows Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the income limits for VA National medical benefits and prescriptions based on location and number of dependents. 

However, there are multiple issues with the existing application, which lacks:
- Reliably accurate data
- Plain language
- Clearly defined use cases, usability design, and testing to ensure that it is aligned to Veteran needs and is intuitive for Veterans to use

How might we rebuild and modernize this application using clearly defined Veteran use cases to better align with Veterans' needs?

### OCTO Objectives 

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme))

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

5. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
7. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
1. Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
2. Starting up (Attending to health needs, Finding something to do/Balancing finances, Finding a place to live)
3. Putting down roots (Starting, growing or maintaining my family)
4. Retiring (Taking care of my health)
5. Aging (Not listed in journey, but dealing with death of spouse)

## Research Goals	
What are Veteran use cases for determining eligibility for VA National medical benefits and prescriptions?

### Outcome
Learnings will inform redesign of the application, taking into account context surrounding Veteran use cases to make the application experience as intuitive and seamless as possible.

### Research questions
- What events drive a Veteran to consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- How do Veterans first determine eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- Do Veterans think about/consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions? 
- If they do, when and how do they consider their eligibility?
- What problems do Veterans encounter when trying to determine eligibility?
- What do Veterans need to do after they understand their eligibility?

### Hypothesis
What do you already know about this problem space? 
- I know nothing/very little about this problem space.
- As of 2016, about 60% of Veterans are eligible for VA care and fewer than half of those eligible use VA health benefits. [Source.](https://www.rand.org/pubs/periodicals/health-quarterly/issues/v6/n1/12.html) 

What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Veterans will likely not know the current application exists, and the VA.gov may not be Veterans' go-to source of information around benefit eligibility.
- Veterans with benefits will have worked with someone in person or over the phone to get help determining eligibility and applying for benefits.
- Veterans may not be aware of when or how their eligibility for benefits was determined.

## Method	
Semi-structured interviews to guide Veteran through a chronological re-telling of experience(s) determining benefit eligibility

### Location
Interviews will take place remotely to ensure participation by Veterans from a diverse range of geographical locations. Zoom is preferred video conferencing software.

### Research materials
- [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/income-limits-app/research/conversation-guide.md)
	
## Recruitment
