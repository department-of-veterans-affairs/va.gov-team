# Creating Links to Online Tools #
## 1. New Online Tool Awareness ##
- As of 12/28/2020, a weekly reminder is posted in the [#vsa-product channel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CLSD51H7U) on Slack at 1:00 PM ET each Monday asking product teams to notify John Hashimoto and Marci McGuire whenever a new online tool is close being launched.  We will also ask in the weekly Team of Teams meetings.
- A GitHub template will eventually be created by the Decision Tools team and linked to the above Slack reminder.  That template will request the URL, the name of the form(s) it replicates, launch date, and will automatically assign a new issue to the Decision Tools team and tag John Hashimoto and Marci McGuire as owners.
## 2. Add the URL to the form record in Drupal CMS ##
- Follow the *Edit* instructions in the [add-edit-delete-landing pages instructions.md](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-va-forms-redesign/form-detail-landing-pages/add-edit-delete-details-page.md) to add the new online tool URL before 2 PM on the day you want the link appear on the Find a Form search result.  Remember that, due to the way the CMS currently works, the modified form record must be published *on the same day it is edited* so that it doesn't interfere with other form records being published.
## 3. Record in the VA Product Directory ##
- Add the link to the [Product Directory spreadsheet](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/VAgovProductDirectory-SharedLibrary/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BA7445DE2-B970-474A-A5E8-6676ABD1D87D%7D&file=VA.gov-Product-Directory-11-13-20.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) currently housed on the VA's SharePoint site (Note: must be logged into the VA's network to access).
