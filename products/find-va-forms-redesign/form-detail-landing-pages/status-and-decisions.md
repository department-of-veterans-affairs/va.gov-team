Call w/ Stephanie, Nick, Mikki, Andrew Fichter, Jen Lee, Beth Jacobson, and John Hashimoto. 

__Confirmed:__ PW can use Lighthouse forms api credstash to connect Drupal to VA forms db. Nick will get that from Andrew's team. 

__Confirmed:__ After Drupal connects to the VA forms db, and new data fields (online tool, related to, related forms...) are available in the CMS, Lighthouse can begin pulling all forms data via Drupal graph ql for both search and form detail landing pages. 
Beth showed iteration so far of Drupal content model of data fields and how each one maps to the form detail page UI. 

__Decision:__ RE Drupal data field labels. We agreed and decided to map the Drupal field labels to the FE form detail page UI label. This reduces potential confusion and eliminates having to comprehend 3 variations of labels (VA forms DB field label, Drupal label, front end UI label). 

__Next steps:__
Beth and Jen need more working sessions to work out CMS field labels and mapping. 

We need another sync to go over IA and URL generation with Drupal.
