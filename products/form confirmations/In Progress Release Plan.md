# Release Plan In Progress Reminders

---

## Phase I: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

We will utilize feature toggles to manage a staged rollout.

| Phase | Population |  Timing |
| --- | --- |---|
| Stage A | 25% | 2 days
| Stage B | 50% | 2 days
| Final Stage | 100% | Complete Rollout |


### Planning

- Desired date range: _\[04/25/22 - 04/29/22\]_
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: \[_We will employ a phased rollout (utilizing percentage based feature flags - ie start with 10% of relevant users), to limit our initial audience._\]
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: \[_We will focus on delivery rates to show the emails are triggering correctly. Then click through rates to see if the users are getting back to the forms from these reminders. We will also look at open rates to get a guage on roughly how many users are opening these reminders._\]
- Links to dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: _\[[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:www.va.gov~2Fview-change-dependents~2Fadd-remove-form-21-686c~2Fresume~2F) Delivery Rates are on our internal application]_

_The stages and number of users below are provided as example values recommended by VSP, but can be customized to your team's needs._

### Stage A: small population

_Test the first population of users to make sure there are no issues exposed._

#### Planning

- Length of time: 2 Days
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 25% (87 users per day)

#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?

### Stage B: larger population

_Test a larger population of users to make sure there are no issues exposed by larger usage patterns._

#### Planning

- Length of time: 2 Days
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 50% (174 users per day)

#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
