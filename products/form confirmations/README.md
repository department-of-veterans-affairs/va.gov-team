# Form Submission Emails

## Overview
*When a veteran submits a form the will recieve an email confirming VA has received their application. The email contains a link back to the appropriate location to check the status of their application.*

## Problem Statement
*It is common practice to recieve an email after making a purchase or completing an application. Without this email the user can be unsure whether they have completed the application process correctly. By providing these form submission emails the user can be confident that their application has been recieved.*

## Personas
*Veterans or their caregivers that are completing forms/applications.*

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* To send digital forms communications to Veterans, including confirmation and in-progress reminders, and more.
* To provide Veterans with timely, actionable, and personalized notifications.
* To add value to VA business line users for them to be able to gain insights on their notification use cases.

### Metrics
* We’re tracking form performance in Google Analytics (GA), and it's integrated with a VA Business Line-facing VA.gov VA Notify KPIs dashboard in DOMO.
* Our top metrics include Total Notifications Sent, Delivery Rate, and The Top Reasons for Notifications Not Retrieved, etc.
* We support VA Business Lines to customize analytics campaigns around notification use cases, e.g., the Education-Learn-More page campaign with VBA Education, where we set up UTM tracking on email templates to measure click-through rate by Veterans to access the page.
* We launched User Researches to learn about Veterans feedback on notifications style and content.
* We’re expanding our metrics and analytics tracking to understand our Self-Service User Interface usage by platform users.

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
