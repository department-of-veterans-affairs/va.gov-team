# Form Submission Trigger for 686c

## Overview
The Chapter 31 submission process has two workflows. Two submission confirmation emails were created to support both of these paths.
- The Happy Path process: after the Veteran submits the Chapter 31 form, the VBMS table is updated successfully. A request to email the Veteran is made through the VA Notify system. The email the user entered when filling out the form is utilized for these notifications.
- The Central Mail process: after the Veteran submits the Chapter 31 form, if the VBMS table is not able to be updated then the form is sent to Central Mail. A request to email the Veteran is made through the VA Notify system. The email the user entered when filling out the form is utilized for these notifications.
