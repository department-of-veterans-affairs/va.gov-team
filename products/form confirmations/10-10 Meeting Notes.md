## Meeting notes from our talk with 10-10 EZ Team
- Meeting: 12/8/2022
- Attendees: Patrick Bateman, Heather Justice, Zach Law, Megan Siddle

## Concerns on current notification use cases:
- PII information is included
- Look and feel isn't consistent with other notifications being sent out from VA

## Questions:
* What is currently sent out? 
  - Two use cases are currently sent out. One for confirmation that the application was recieved and one failure notice when an error happens in the submission process
* How would that notification be ended?
  - Just deleting the current template (in the old system, not 100% sure the provider here) removes the notification
* Where is the current notification triggered from?
  - It's coming from the enrollment system, outside of Vets.api. Since the Strike team doesn't have access to that system we will not be able to write the trigger.

## Next steps:
- Patrick and Heather will be reaching out to Josh from the enrollment team to determine when they would like to prioritize this work.
- 10-10 EZ team would like to get onboarded to the SSUI (Notification Portal) so that they can manage the templates and work themselves.
