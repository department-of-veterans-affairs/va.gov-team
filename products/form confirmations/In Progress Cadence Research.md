# In Progress Reminder Cadence Research
In order to determine which reminder cadence was the most utilized, an age parameter was added to the 686c In Progress application resume link. This allowed for tracking of the click through and submission rates in Google Analtyics. Based on these findings, it was clear that the reminder sent at 7-days was the most highly utilized and the most successful at leading to completed forms. 

## Research Period

Results from July 20th to August 20th, 2022  were analyzed.

| Cadence | Sessions |	New Users | Submitted Application | Rate of Submissions to New Users | 
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| 7 days      |    1,149 |         452        |         273           |     60%   |
| 21 days      |     462 |         200        |         92           |       46% |
| 35 days      |     164 |            78      |         30           |       7% |
| 49 days      |      56 |            30      |          9          |        2% |

## Key Findings

1. Vast majority of utilization appears to be coming from the 7-day reminders

### Recommendations Based on Findings

  * Do we need to:
    * Iterate? 
      *  Yes, changing our cadence to only sending 1 reminder and triggering that at 7 days.
    * Further research? 
      *   It might be worthwhile to test out a cadence that is sooner than 7 days.
      *   It would also be beneficial to follow up on reporting after the 7 days only cadence was implemented to get a better gauge on the overall funnel (ie. emails sent, links clicked, applications submitted)
