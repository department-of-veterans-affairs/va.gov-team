### Introduction
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Emily, and I'm joined on the line by some colleagues who are observing the session and helping me take notes. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn how to make one section of our website more useful to you.

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

We are not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.

I won’t be offended by any opinions you express, nor will anyone else present.

This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

I’ll be recording the audio and screen as we talk today, so that we capture your opinions accurately. We will not be using video.

If for any reason at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

Okay. I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.

[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording.]

### Warm-up Questions 
Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)

Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, are you considering using VA benefits in the future?

Have you ever applied for a Veteran ID card? Which ones? What was your application experience like? 
When do you find yourself using it?
What do you know about the Veteran ID card options available to you?

Extras:

Have you ever had a good experience with the VA? What made that a positive experience in your mind? If not, what would make a good experience?

What kinds of communication do you currently receive from the VA?


Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You'll see a page on Vets.gov.

### Task: Evaluate landing page
Page: https://vetsgov-pr-8159.herokuapp.com/ID-card-types/

Take a moment to look around this page, and use the amount of time you normally would when visiting a web page for the first time.

- What's the purpose of this page?
- Read through the content on this page. How would you determine if you're eligible for any of the cards?
    - Based on your experiences so far, what do you expect the application process to be like?
    - Let's say you wanted to apply for one of them. What step would you take next?
- How do you feel about the options that are displayed?
- How would you describe this page to a fellow Veteran?
- If this page were live on the website, would you personally be prompted to take any actions from here?
- How would you decide which ID card to pursue? How have you decided that in the past?
- What would you expect to happen after applying for an ID card?


Watch for:
- Confusion, feeling overwhelmed
- Desire to apply for more than 1

### Thank-You and Closing 

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the team building Vets.gov based on your experiences today?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $50 gift either as an Amazon Gift Card or through Paypal. Do you have a preference?

Great, is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address we used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? If no: Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
