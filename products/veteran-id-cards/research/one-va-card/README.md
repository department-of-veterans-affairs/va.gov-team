The aim of the One VA card project is to determine if VA could consolidate the various Veteran identification cards and letters into one ID card for Veterans (and their Caregivers), to design the card and/or the key processes involving obtaining and using the card, evaluate the need for a digital version of the card, and to recommended next steps for developing any designs into implementable solutions.

There are currently a wide range of “Veteran ID cards” that Veterans can receive or apply for to meet various needs. VA offers several of these documents, including the Veteran ID Card (VIC), Veteran Health ID Card (VHIC), eBenefits Proof of Service Card Letter and Service Verification Letter, and Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) Letter for VA Designated Caregivers. Veterans who qualify for Community Care may also receive an authorization letter, which also includes important information pertinent to their individual identity and qualifications for VA benefits. These cards and letters show their status and allow them to access privileges, ranging from getting discounts at private retailers to easing their check-in for VHA appointments. Today, the Purple Heart and Disabled Veteran Equal Access Act of 2018 and subsequent Patronage Expansion Program, which took effect in January 2020, have increased privileges allotted to certain Veterans and Caregivers, allowing them to access military bases for use of the commissary, military exchanges, and recreation facilities with certain VA-issued identification.
