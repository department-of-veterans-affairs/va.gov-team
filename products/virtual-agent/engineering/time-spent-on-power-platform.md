|Diagnosing unplanned outage|2 business days|2 developers on day 1 3 developers on day 2 Issue was caused by bug in PVA and we still have not received any logs surrounding the issue|
|Manual deployments|6 business days|The built in export feature does not work well. We had to change a lot of things to get it to work at all. Permission problems where exporting is impossible for some people who should be able to export|
|Automatic Deployments exploration|3 business days|Abandoned effort because not doable on trial account|
|Manual import investigate flakiness|2 business days|Importing has random silent failures. Using a step by step guide will sometimes yield different results. No explanation for the above|
|Waiting for QnA Maker Access|5 business days|Trial expired so we moved to a more permanent place. Just waiting on the right person to give us the information|
|Waiting for PVA Access |2 months|Finally got access to a trial account which has to be moved/extended every 30 days|
|Migrating bot to new PVA Trial|1 hour|Must be repeated before trial expires (every ~30-60 days). Could take longer than an hour if random errors occur during the export or import of the bot to the new trial|
