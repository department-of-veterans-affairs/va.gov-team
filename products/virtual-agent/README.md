### VA Virtual Agent

This repository contains research, documentation and diagrams for the virtual agent. This virtual agent fits within the VA.gov's goal of helping the Veteran self-serve.

In case of a DDOS attack or inaprropriate use of the Virtual Agent, disable the `virtual_agent_token` toggle in flipper/features to block new connections to webchat. When the endpoint is healthy again, you can enable the `virtual_agent_token` toggle.
