# Product Outline: Ask VA on Chatbot - POC
---
## Overview

In the long term, the VA.gov Chatbot will be the front door for Veterans and their loved ones in accessing asynchronous support from Ask VA routing queues.
To prove out this vision, we propose a limited Proof of Concept, allowing Ask VA users to ask questions in the "Sign in and technical issues" category (see below) on the VA.gov Chatbot and route them to the appropriate routing queue for response from a VA agent.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
|          |             |                    |                    |        |
