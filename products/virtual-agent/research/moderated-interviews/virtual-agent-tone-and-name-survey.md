# Research Plan for [VA-Virtual Agent, Virtual Agent, 4/13/2021]
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
**1. What product & team are you doing this research for?** 

This research is for the VA-Virtual Agent team, for the Virtual Agent product. 	

**2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?** 

This product will be hosted on VA.gov as a virtual agent, colloquially known as a chatbot, to assist and answer veteran questions on all topics currently located on VA.gov. It is part of the larger Omnni-Channel strategy to provide veterans easier and self-serving access to their care and benefits.	

**3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?** 

We want to learn if veterans and other users will prefer a more anthropomorhic chatbot with a friendlier personality and name, or if a more professional, service driven, generic named chat bot like, VA or Omni, would better serve their needs. We also hope to learn about the likelihood of veterans adopting a chatbot as their primary way of contacting the VA.

**4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?** 

As a veteran myself, I hypothesize that a professional, polite and service driven tone using existing plain language content from VA.gov will be preferred, and that whether it has a name or not is secondary to the quality of serice it provides. It needs to be helpful, open and inviting or else it doesn't matter what it is called. 	

## Method	
**1.	What method of research are you planning?** 	
  
  Directed interviews (remote moderated)
  	
**2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**

It will also us to ask the same set of questions to easily discern patterns in answers. 

**3.	Where are you planning to do your research?** 

Online, Perigean's Zoom

**4.	What will you be testing?** 

Not testing, but gathering sentiment and opinions about chatbot experiences.

**5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use** 

Perigean's Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment	
**1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

25 people, all ages, no accessibility preference, located within continental U.S., no login requirements, half with benefits/half without benefits, has used computers and internet, has used a chatbot

(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

- Veteran must have used computers and internet. 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

- Has used a chat bot.

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

- Perigean

## When? 	
**1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?** 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	

April 26-30, 2021

**2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)**

Not testing anything, only interviewing to gather info/opinions on chatbots.

**3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.**

45 minutes with 15 minute buffer.

**4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?** *Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time*. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

Monday, 4/26 9-1pm, 2-5pm; Tuesday, 4/27 9-12:30pm, 2-3pm; Wednesday, 4/28 9-5pm; Thrusday, 4/29 9-4pm; Friday, 4/30 9-10am, 12-2pm, 3-5pm
