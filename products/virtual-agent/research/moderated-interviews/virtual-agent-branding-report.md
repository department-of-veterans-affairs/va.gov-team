# Chatbot Branding Interview Report 

#### Shane Strassberg and Rachel M. Murray, [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/virtual-agent/research/moderated-interviews/virtual-agent-tone-and-name-survey.md)

## Research Goals
This study was to surface Veterans and other users' opinions on chatbot tone and personality. Would they prefer a more anthropomorphic chatbot with a friendlier personality and name, or a more professional, service driven, generic named chat bot like, VA or Omni if it would better serve their needs? We also hope to learn about the likelihood of Veterans adopting a chatbot as their primary way of contacting the VA.  We conducted an internal survey with VA stakeholders about chatbot branding but wanted to learn from the opinions of Veterans, family members and caregivers about their experience with chatbots. While the internal survey shaped what we wanted to ask Veterans, the focus for this study was to explore Veteran preferences and opinions about the value that a chatbot can provide. Those outcomes would inform our product roadmap in the future. 


## Research Methodology
Interviews were conducted remotely with Zoom between April 26th to April 30th. A remote moderator began with an introduction on the purpose of the session, and participants were asked a series of questions about chatbots and usage of them and relationship to them in general and potentially to the VA. Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance. 


## Hypotheses 
As a veteran myself, I hypothesize that a professional, polite and service driven tone using existing plain language content from VA.gov will be preferred, and that whether it has a name or not is secondary to the quality of service it provides. It needs to be helpful, open and inviting or else it doesn't matter what it is called.         


## Participants
* Role
   * 10 Veterans
   * 7 Veteran family or caregivers
* Gender: 
   * 9 women
   * 7 men
* Geographically diverse: 
   * AK, CA, FL, GA, MD, NC, PA, TN, TX, VA, WA
* Age range
   * 1 participant  25-34
   * 7 participants 35 - 44
   * 4 participants 45 - 54
   * 1 participant 55-65
   * 2 participant over 65
   * 1 participant no age stated


## Key Findings

1. Conversation with the VA
[a]
* Vets, care-takers and family members want communication between the VA and them to be personable, curious and empathetic.

2. Current use of VA channels
* If they already have an account, they generally sign in to have a more personable and tailored experience.
   * This hints that Vets will assume the chatbot can provide the same personal experience if they are signed into their account on the website.

3. Participants overwhelmingly used chatbots (94%) and would use one again despite often having a mixed experience and lacking confidence in the responses. 
   * One person who had not used a chatbot was because they preferred speaking with an actual human due to low expectations of chatbots.

4. There is some tension to using a chatbot because the general experience is that you must use very specific phrasing to get an accurate response, or 
   * for chatbots that take you down a logic path, if it ends up not being the correct one, are frustrating experiences because it isn't respectful of their time while also providing an inaccurate response.
   * Most were confident that a chatbot can point them in the right direction, but were disappointed in the lack of nuance or accuracy in their responses. This negatively impacts their value of timeliness.

5. Participants did not use the Coronavirus chatbot, but this was not necessarily tied to the value of the chatbot, but rather they felt that they had enough info on coronavirus from other channels outside the VA. 

6. Future chatbot at the VA; People have low expectations for a VA chatbot but are open to trying it and using it as their first point of contact. 

7. Naming may require a compromise. The VA can provide a name for context, like VA chatbot, so it is clear Vets are not speaking with an actual person, but still be able to use a conversational tone that is not dry or bureaucratic. 

8. An emerging expectation with Omni-channel ramifications is that Vets increasingly want a personalized experience regardless of the channel it started in. They don’t want to retell their story or the reason why they are interacting with the VA that particular day if they start with a chatbot then move the conversation over to a live agent.


## Details of Findings

1. Because Vets share a lot of personal info with the VA, they expect that info to be readily available to VA customer reps regardless if it is in-person, over the phone or through automated digital channels to streamline communication. They shouldn't have to retell their story everytime they interact with the VA.
   - This hints that a chatbot should "know" their story, and that it should be able to ask empathetic questions to help Vets find the info they need or get them the help they need based on their story.
   
2. More frequent visitors generally have health care reasons as the purpose for going to the website.
   - The less frequent users would probably benefit more from using the chatbot to quickly find information, as opposed to Vets who already know where they need to go on the website.
   - For people very familiar with the website, they generally know how to navigate to the page they need or have a bookmark saved.
   - When they need to locate new information, most use the website search tool, but also may rely on Google as a more reliable method to get to the right page quicker.
   - The homepage and sitemap are also used fairly often to help navigate.
   
3. Some called it "chatbox," which makes sense because it is a "box" and can have a chat with it. 

4. Expectations for chatbots to provide nuance accurate responses is generally low. This creates an opportunity to exceed expectations for the VA chatbot.

5. The general expectation is that a chatbot should be able to direct you to the right information faster than using a search engine. It should provide more context than a basic search results list, i.e., if they need a form it can get it for them quickly and either be able to fill in online or download from the chat window. 

6. Most expect a VA chatbot to provide personal information about benefits, health care, prescriptions, etc., and be able to service their needs in those areas, i.e., "fill my prescription" should allow a user to fulfill this need through the chatbot. 

7. Most want a professional but friendly tone that projects confidence but can also display humility when it is wrong or inaccurate.

8. Related to tone, it should be service-driven since the Vet community is broad, spanning multiple generations, and therefore different levels of tech-usage.

## Additional Insights

**Future research areas:**
* What is the drop off point until people lose patience and move to another channel
* Outreach to a generation that believes in ‘people first’ channel
* Metrics for desktop vs. mobile interaction rates
* If they are ‘signed in’ will the conversation carry over if they switch devices?
Results of Hypotheses
Veterans, caretakers and family members prefer service-driven conversational tone with accurate responses that will build trust in the product, especially since they know that they will not be interacting with an actual human. Providing a name for the chatbot should remain generic (i.e., VA Chatbot, Virtual Agent, etc) and only establish context for what it is, what it can do, and how it fits into the other products and services the VA provides. This will personalize the experience for some while maintaining its true ‘bot’ nature for all. 


## Next Steps

* Conduct controlled study of the chatbot in staging environment with 100 participants to research if: 
   * More Veterans will attempt to find information that requires authentication (e.g., claims-status). 
   * We will see a high number of questions that the bot has not yet been trained to answer. 
   * There is a niche-market for this product. We wonder if:
      * Caretakers (likely more women) may give a higher satisfaction rating, or be more interested in a virtual agent/chatbot. 
      * Veterans who may be seeking anonymity (e.g., LGBTQ+, housing or food insecurity, mental-health crisis) may be more comfortable utilizing this tool over speaking with a human. 
   * Veterans will attempt to sign in order to use the bot for their specific information.
   * Veterans will want the chatbot to transfer their conversation directly to a human agent. 
   * Veterans will expect that the chatbot cannot answer in depth questions.
