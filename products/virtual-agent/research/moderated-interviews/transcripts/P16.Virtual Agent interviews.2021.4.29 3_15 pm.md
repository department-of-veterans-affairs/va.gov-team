1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* If I don't give enough description of what I'm asking for to the customer service rep they should ask questions - ask about the subject - service records etc.  they should ask the questions that will get them to understand what i’m actually asking, so they can see the text of what i’m asking, submitting.  So they can understand me applying for benefits - a subject I’m asking about.
* (There should be a unifying experience no matter the channel, your background, the last channel you communicated with and about?) Yes, there should be a record of times I’ve contracted the VA and gone through a history of some of the things I've asked about.  If I'm using my GI Bill benefits they should see the problem I’ve been having.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* It should be open or direct questions and even if I ask a wrong question - they should understand what types of questions and how I’m asking.
* (descriptor or adjective?) Inquisitive at first and then confidence in obtaining the information and what I'm asking about, confidence in answering the questions I'm asking.  
* (Confidence in response is important to you) yes


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* When I first got out I was using it a lot, GI bill benefits.  Then there was a prolonged to get the benefits started for disability, and only time i got ahold of a VA - my status change, and my sons left school and restarted, and getting the right status of all times
* Lately I haven't used it as much - exhausted my GI Bill benefits and have a disability . Once I got married I submitted my application and don’t have new kids or not in school.






4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* I always logged into my user account.  I have a common access card for work  - but I would use the DS login when not at work.
* (why is it important for you to sign in?) checking on my status of my disability claim when i was going to school it was referencing how much i had left or if i had to provide a letter. 


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* (When do you need to find the certificate of eligibility? How did you find it on va.gov?) I logged in, then listed the topics, my documents and it knows or has form letters if you need a letter of eligibility and retirement benefits to provide form letters to do self service.  Or if I can't find it, I use search.
* (Search on va.gov or Google?) I would login to the benefits website portal first and search there. 


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* Yes, I have - USAA has one.  


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* It’s very short and usually if I type into a question, ‘are you referring to this topic’ response - sometimes when I use those it provides a link to topics or further topics.  I was looking at refinancing mortgage - looking at refinance rates.  It would ask me if I had a mortgage and it needs to know the specifics.  If it could show me the current rates.  They’re very brief because they need specifics and then take you to a link on page to get more information on that topic.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* Responses weren’t helpful but the links took me to where I needed to get to the information.  It’s often limited in the ability to receive information.  As long as I don't have to search for ebenefits websites.  If I type in the chat box, it should give me a list of pages that refer to the topic instead of hunting drop down boxes for a page.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* Yes it was helpful.  More than likely it took me to their products page - the USAA page.  It didn’t give me the price in the chat box - just took me to the page without me having to search.
10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* If it’s a page I've been on multiple times I wouldn't need it.  But if there’s new info on the ebenefits portal I would use it.  I would spend 10 minutes to find it and then use the chatbot.
* (Want to be confident to navigate the page first before a human?) yes


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* No.  I haven’t seen it.


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Provide a link to the information I was looking for.  If  I type in VA benefits, it should show me a link to VA benefits - take me to another link to the site without me having to search for it myself. Same for GI Bill and Home Loans. 


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* If you know it’s a computer if it repeats questions.  I was a recruiter. I would give confidence to a person by repeating (job interviewing). It could say something like based on your information you can look here. It could sound confident but can’t sound too confident if the information you’re looking for isn’t there.  It should be confident but… hard to explain.  It should repeat the question you asked, here’s the link I believe you’re looking for.  It should be helpful and provide the information. 
* (how would you feel if the chabot directed you to a link without the right information?) I wouldn’t feel confident about the chatbot if the link wasn’t accurate.  It should clarify - are you talking about this topic; it should provide a narrowing down of the topic and take me to the information I needed to get to.
* (Why is it important to have it be accurate?) If an org is trying to help people find information faster.  I like to be self sufficient - i expect the tool to work, if the tool is going to be there it should work, 80-90% accuracy.


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* I don’t think it matters - sometimes you can't tell based on the information it provides.  I don’t think it should have a human name.  Some people might feel like they’re talking to a human person without knowing it’s a bot - if they call the org and say ‘i was talking to a human’ and it’s actually a bot
* (would they feel stupid?) Yup. I don't want that.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* Something to do with the military, VA.  you can come up with something silly like Sergent Helper.  It would let them know it’s there to help.  It’s a military org so it needs a rank.  Not Major Pain :)  Could come up with a character for it later on - but definitely a military name.
* (What do you think of a name like VA chatbox)? That would work.  VA chat assistant or VA chat helper.  They understand they’re going to the right page with the va., and you want the helper in there.  That would be suitable.


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* I think where it normally pops up - bottom right corner. Click on it and be able to use it actually on the site.  If it provides a link you can refresh the link to the page in the chatbot.


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Yes that would be fine.
