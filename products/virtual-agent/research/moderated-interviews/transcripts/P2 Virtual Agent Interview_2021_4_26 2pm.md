P2.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.26 2pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* Expect to find information I require from whatever source - or if it's an incorrect source that i can find it in the right location - education benefits, or disability etc. rather than oh sorry i can’t help you!’


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* In person or over the phone I would expect the niceties - hey how are you doing - i don’t expect it with the chatbot.  The reason i’m using a chatbot is not having the niceties


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* I do use it when there’s info I'm seeking.  The VA in Alaska is efficient and friendly. One of the few veterans who don’t have a bad experience with the VA. 
* (Thinking of VA.gov how often you visit) twice a month.


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* I don’t, always. If it’s general info that i wouldn't need to sign in then i wouldn’t.  If I can access it without signing in.  Because I type passwords for work I try to avoid it.
* (only sign in when you need important info).  Correct


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* I usually go to a table of contents and follow it or follow it via search using keywords.
* (Table of contents - sitemap?) yes


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* Yes, more for businesses - amazon, best buy, USAA.  never the chatbot between VA.  


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Some have been very good, some just pick from the menu and go down a path.  The automated ones are frustrating - you think you’re going down the right path and it’s not there.  The ones with the live person have been more beneficial


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* If it’s vague - where’s my delivery, my tracking number.  If I'm not sure what I'm trying to find with a chatbot you bang your head against the wall - then ask it 20 questions.  If it’s concrete info then chatbot isn’t a bad thing, otherwise an exercise in frustration.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* If it’s status or pending, satisfaction is fine.  Otherwise it get frustrating, the virtual chatbot won’t get it across
* (what action do you take if the chatbot doesn’t work).  If it’s a company I don't have to do business with I say I won't bother giving you my business because I can't get what I need.  If it’s amazon i’ve gone to customer service and give them the feedback it didn’t work.


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* I would prefer that if i’m doing a chat, it’s not a chatbot.  If I'm interested and a bot comes up, I'll go somewhere else and interact with something and not a computer saying I want to play a game.


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* No
* (did you know there was a coronavirus chatbot/) Yes.  I’m at the state level ESP (?) so i have enough information and research about covid.


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Navigate through the sitemap for me - if i said check my claim status, it would take me to that location on the web site.
* (What about providing a response with a link to the correct page.) yes, direct you to it.


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Hi welcome to VA gov and it be more ‘did you mean this’? Vague here you go - did you want this?
* (What adjectives would you describe it?) To the point


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* No - then am i talking to a chatbot or a person.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* No idea


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Put it up by the search - most people by the search and you could go from.  Or the contact us button.  Upper right corner.
Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

I pushed it out to all my folks.
