1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* For me I talk through every medium possible and I’m very attuned that people do not take the time to do research before they speak. They come on, be brusque, why are you contacting me, what do you need - very minor exceptions.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* I think it would be a blanket across the board - digitally and in person.  Need a level of care and concern and knowledge; nothing more irritating to see a doctor and having to run around to get appointment and they're rushed, they don't'  look at everything ahead of time, and it’s not a welcoming conversation 98% of the time
* (unwelcoming the norm - what should be the norm?) with the understanding that they're seeing a lot of people they should show decorum and concern - it’s my health issues that have to explain what’s going on when they could have looked at the notes and this is what they can do.
* (Descriptor or adjective in that tone, what would that be?) conciliatory, caring - right now it’s brusque and rude.


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* I was on it 2 minutes ago because of medical appointments and talking to people - i’m on it a lot.


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Yes - always. To me it means I'm looking at things specifically geared to me.  Going to va.gov is like an 1800-877 number if you don't have a purpose you’re going to be lost.


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* My Healthevet - ds logon - the va.gov web site is a clusterfuck - can’t even find the right phone numbers for places.  I’ve been to the Miami VA phone list - they don’t connect to where they’re supposed to be.  They need to blow up the site and start over by a company that knows what they’re doing.
* Process: i tend to google whatever comes up to VA to get started; the va.gov’s search tool - don’t remember seeing one.  Like 90 percent of the world I use to search.  Search on va.gov leads me to Neurosurgery when they mean neurology.


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If not, any particular reason why?
* I’ve used them on a bunch of sites - can't remember them.  I have a brain injury sometimes I forget.  I’ve used them in the past.  They tend to be less than useful.  Pre Programmed responses.  If you’re not asking something specific 90% of the time they’re wrong.


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Overall experience - I know it’s supposed to be easier to get basic information but the majority of the time it tends to be specific and I can't get that through a chabot/box that was right.  Once I got something right.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* Very little.  Maybe 5% of the time it would be right.  


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* Not helpful at all. The exception of the one time.  I realize that chatbots are created by humans but if you don't have the answer to nuanced questions it won’t work, and if you don’t have the right answers that tends to be the VA’s problem.


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* Probably not. I get better answers and a better than 5% chance that talking to a human will get me to the right place.  Of course if they don’t have the right information they won’t help either.


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* I did use it once 


12. How confident were you in the bot's responses?
* I believe that - ‘this time we don’t know’ - you may want to check with your primary care provider - also got the texts - can’t get this time and time, tried to confirm time and got a sorry i can’t confirm the time.


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* I reached out there when i was looking for a shot, and johnson and johnson at the miami VA.  They said i’m sorry we don’t know -you can check with your primary care provider but it wasn’t super helpful.  These were responses I got from the chatbot.
* (Satisfaction level) at least it didn’t blow smoke up my ass.  Didn’t say ‘oh yeah, we got it’.  They tried to give me quasi right answers. They couldn’t have the answer to very simple questions - do you have j and j shot
* I gave the chatbot a whirl but if the only way to find out an answer is to call a human i’ll call a human.  


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Ideally if they can’t answer the question maybe get my contacts and the last four out of my social circle to transfer your request to your doctor.  So that someone gets it routed right away.  I don't expect it in 5 minutes.  If it goes to my doctor I hope it goes by the end of the day rather than 24-48 hours.  You’re asking if I want a covid shot but i have to wait to hear from someone else if you have the shot available.  
* (Expectation that there’s some level of self service on va.gov?) ideally yes - you’d want to have a chatbot to answer the routine questions and if you can’t why have it?
 
15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* It should be welcoming and accommodating and not patronizing.  Om my god the VA loves to patronize - almost as bad as the 1-800 number.  I understand - no you don’t.  Nothing more disgusting to a service member than ‘i can help you’ but you can’t.
* (why is it important to you, the tone?) It’s hard enough to go to the VA and not just because I'm a woman or younger.  It’s tough to go to the Miami VA - it’s cumbersome to go there, parking spot, anything that can help avoid in person, get your questions answered, that’s why online things should be there.  They’re not there yet, might be a while.
* (if a chatbot worked well to your expectations, that could be a time saver, so not on the phone or going to a location for things you can answer online).  Exactly.  If you want to make a change, blow up with the va web site and start with a super chatbot.  What are you here for and all the departments listed.  Then you’re connected to that department or who can answer the question and rebuild the whole web site.  Would help the staff too - if they're not coming in to get routine questions, get someone actively managing that chatbot from that section. 


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* It’s funny because we get calls all the time, and clearly their name is not Bob.  if you have a person who’s dedicated specifically to online queries for that section.  Could plug it into wholever’s working on that section.
* Should a non-human chatbot have a name? No - that’s extra work.  It’s going to be the subject of jokes, we all know that.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* I would say Tracey (could be male or female) from the Tampa VA - where can i help; you or guide or assist you.


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* If I was coming up to the web site - pops up in the middle - help you get you to where you need to go - if you say no, hide them.  If yes, Start them in the middle of the page in the horizon, and if they say ‘if you don’t want help, i’ll be in the lower right hand corner.  If it’s in the middle then move it down to the lower right.


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.
