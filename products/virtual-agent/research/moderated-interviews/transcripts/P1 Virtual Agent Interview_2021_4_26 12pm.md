P1.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.26 12pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* Phone - expect answer right away. Written communication - email - expect response in reasonable amount of time.  24 hours is reasonable.
* Emergency i wouldn’t call them anyway


2. What conversational tone do expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* Some kind of understanding of who I was as opposed to having no idea who i was, my concerns.  It would be nice if they had some info about me and my medical history with the VA
* Authenticated with VA? Yes.  Should they have info about background? Yes - would be nice if they had some knowledge so I wouldn’t have to explain everything over again.


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* Half a dozen times a year, can be half a dozen times in a month if some incident was going on.  Once a month is a good average


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* (Had to explain what we meant by Sign In)
* Yes, yes i do sign in so authenticated.  I do sign in so they do know who i know so info on screen applies to me


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* Once i log in, the information on screen is generally related to me.  I usually have to update prescriptions or reorder, test results - have to find those buttons someplace.  Generally i can find them without too much trouble.
* (Sign in with purpose of info to know it’s going to be on that first page or a link to what i want  is on that first page).


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* Usually tied to ordering.  Usually it’s because theres’ been a hiccup and something i didn’t expect happened


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Usually slow.  Varies from site to site.  I usually do something else, waiting for person on other end ot respond.  Generally the waits aren’t too bad. I assume people are answering more that one person than me. Occasionally the person on the other end the person can seem distracted and not focused on what my questions are.  Maybe too much reexpalining. Generally the chatbots are pretty good and people are responding well.  Tehre’s usually a delay in the bot and the person responding
* Non-human ones don’t understand what i’m asking if i don’t use the right words in there. Don’t get the right responses.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses
* 50%.  It’s a tossup if they really capture what I’m looking at.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* Less than average, happy response.  Generally satisfying. Generally less than a complete response, not all the info i’m looking for.


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* Sure i would try it but not as high expectations as with a human on the other end.  Definitely lower.


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* No I did not.  The reason was there was so much information about coronavirus it seemed unnecessary for me - i assume it was necessary and useful for some.  I’m inundated with coronavirus, so i didn’t need it from the VA
* (Co-pays were canceled - would you have used a chatbot?) I had received communications from the VA about it so i didn’t have any questions.  I got enough info from the VA so i didn’t have questions


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* I don’t have any expectations beyond a good search engine - just freeform write questions, i would assume a chatbot was essentially the same.
* Used search on va.gov? I’m sure I had - wasn’t real satisfied with results.  I have but don’t remember.
* (If you weren’t able to find via search, what would you do?) If it was something really needed, I would send a message to local clinic provider.  It would depend on exactly what.


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Interesting question - i’m not sure i would think about tone too much.  I’d be more interested in the content than the tone  if the content was what I was looking for then not having any reaction to what would be called ‘its tone’.  Call me by my first name? There’s not a person on the other end.  Maybe it would pass the turing test! I don’t really care about the tone.


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* Wouldn't bother me if it didn’t have a name - seems gimmicky.  I don’t need a picture of a puppy dog.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* Barney - for no reason at all.


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Upper right corner 


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.
* Any others to participate? I do know a few.
* What was your MOS?  Was going to do make it a career but I did 24 years. Was too lazy to get out.
