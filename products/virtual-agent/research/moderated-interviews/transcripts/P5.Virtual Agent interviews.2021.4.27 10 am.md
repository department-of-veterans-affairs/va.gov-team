Veteran family member


1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* Hoping they can answer my questions and get me to where I need to be.  Mainly answer my questions. With other companies i get frustrated when i’m calling and they’re very vague - maybe you should try this location.  I also get cut off a lot - I try and use the chatbot.  I can express myself in words and they’ll be able to see what i’m writing  sometimes when someone speaks a different language it’s hard. Writing is less stressful for me.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* I am a sensitive person - if they’re snippy.  If they’re nice in greeting, that puts me in a great mood, even in a chat box.  How's your day going?I want a greeting to get me started. If i talk to them, patience.  With chat boxes i can tell when they understand - did you mean this. I like them having a little patience. With military things, I'm not educated on things, the wording and they help me with the words.
* (Tone is patient and any other adjectives?) Friendly, soft tone, not harsh, i’ve been on phone calls and they’re really abrupt.  I like when someone gets to the point but doesn’t make you feel stupid about it.i don’t want to have to keep saying what did you mean. Being thorough would be nice.  Patient, though friendly.
* (Would being a guide be a way to describe it - guide you through info). Perfect, explaining things. I like to be led in a phone call or chat.  I Don't want to expect to know things.


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* A few times a year
* (what are you looking to do) DOes that include medical or anything? Getting medical info for my family - instead of getting to hospital i will get medical info on va.gov.


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* (Do you have your own account or use a veteran’s account?) I do have my own - but i know my husband has his.
* Usually looking for info on his behalf. Also my youngest daughter will go in for her.  I’ve saved all my passwords on my private computer. Occasionally a password won’t work.
* No, I don’t sign in.  I will try to save the password. (Seems confused by what signing in and password is).  


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* Of course I sign in - I go to my folder and sign in.
* We’re moving to Florida in the future, so what I would do is find locations in the area.  I use that front page a lot.  Also the box where you type something in - the search bar? Yes.  I use it a lot, for a lot of sites. 
* (Web browser search bar or va.gov search?) If i”m on a page and see search thing i will click on that first


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* I have used a virtual one before. I like to have a real person.  I find the robotic ones aren’t as helpful - narrow in the questions. And sometimes i want to have some other questions.


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* (Do you feel the robot is limiting and why?) I want a question about something, but want to dive in. normally if someone else is there and i can get an answer, the robot gives me a generic answer, but hard to get a specific answer.  I find I can't get a specific answer with a robotic one.
* (If the failure occurs) I’ll try the search or I have to call someone.  If I know there’s a live chat, I'll go to that before searching. I’ll go to live chat first
* Re: search: it gives me more options at the end.  The robot is kind of limited.  Maybe I worded it differently.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* I believe what I read.  I can never seem to get my answer the way I want it.  It’s not I don't trust it, it’s just never enough.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* ‘For a robotic chatbot’ - yes, I will try, I’m a patient person.  I will get more excited with a person though. 
* (if you feel lost, then you’ll resolve to use a chatbot). Yes, one of my last choices.


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* No, I did not know that.


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Give me a few options to my question - not just one section.  A lot of times it says ‘go here’.  If this doesn't work, try this.  It would give me a ‘ok good’.
* (moving to florida… if you typed in where are Florida VA locations - what would your expectations be like). That it would ‘here are the locations, and here are the websites and give me the options of how many are there’.


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Good morning, good afternoon, here are the answers to your questions. Rather than getting the bam, bam bam.  We found 4 locations.  I like to have the links there.
* (Why would this be an important tone to you?) It puts me at ease, I like good customer service.


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* I never thought about it, but more like a human-like name, so it will make me feel like I'm talking to a human.  A space name will feel weird.  A name I recognize will make me feel more comfortable to use it.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* Any basic name - ‘Collette’.  As long as it’s something I recognize.  I don’t care if it’s a man or a woman’s name


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Bottom right of my screen
