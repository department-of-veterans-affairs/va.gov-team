P7.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.27 2pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* straightforward - the usual and questions. 


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* Professional is what I expect. Sometimes casual is ok - depends on what kind of setting, and what you’re kind of discussing
* (Professional but friendly)? Yes


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* 2 or 3 times a year


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Yes, I have an account.  Yes I sign in.
* (Why?) Just so I can see stuff that’s more specific to me as far as whatever pertains to me.
* (More personalized experience?) yes


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* I’ll go through the drop box - if it’s to do with my medication or a conversation with a primary care provider.  I know where I need to go.
* (If you were looking for info on benefits you haven’t used before, how would you use it?) I usually do the same thing - prescriptions and medications.  I know there’s other things I can do on the web site, but it can get lost or confusing so I don't explore that much with the other things.  Usually the same thing.
* (Comfortable with reason why you go to the web site - you don’t explore that far out) Right yeah


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* I haven’t used a virtual agent.
(any reason why?) I kind of do with what I’m familiar with.  I don’t know.
* (what does he usually do - what’s preferred channel…)?
* (If he was on Verizon, would he use it?) No, I don’t talk to it.  
* (Why hesitant?) it’s not really useful - I’m talking to a computer as opposed to a real person.  The answer they use is some general basic stuff, not particular to my questions. 
* (If you knew it was a human, would you be more likely to use a chat window if it was an actual person?)  Yea, I probably would if i knew it was a human


   7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
   * n/a


   8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
   * n/a


   9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
   * n/a


   10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
   * n/a


   11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
   * I probably didn’t pay attention to the last couple of times - i was trying to do a specific thing and didn’t pay attention to other things.


   12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
   * n/a


   13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
   * n/a


   14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
   * My expectations are kind of low - just go over the general stuff, go over what’s on the web site.  I wouldn’t see it as being too specific or personal.  
   * (if you were signed into your account at va.gov about prescriptions or appointments, how would you feel about chatbot being able to source that info for you?) Again, it would feel like it’s just giving me a generic answer.  I don't know how I’d interact because I’ve never used it before.
   * (Would you feel confident or secure if the chatbot surfaced it for you. Prescriptions.  Would you feel secure?’) yea, I’d feel secure.  
   * Signing in makes you feel comfortable that your information is safe? (yes)


   15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
   * A little more friendly and casual.  (Have it be more friendly and human like) Yes
   * (Why would it be important to you?) Because I personally like it if I'm signed in and I feel like it knows a little about me so conversation can be a bit more personal.


   16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
   * Yeah i think so.  Again go along with the making better connection and making me feel secure and safe. A name to go back and forth with


   17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
   * People respond to more feminine qualities.  A mother or sister or something like that.  Can’t think of a name off top of my head


   18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
   * On the left side where you can actually see it - pop up from top or middle.


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Yes, send me the blurb
