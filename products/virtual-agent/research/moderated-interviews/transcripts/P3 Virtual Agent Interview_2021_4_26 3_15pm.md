P3.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.26 3:15pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* Clear communication so that any questions so they can answer them or direct me to the resources I need 


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* Tone shouldn’t change no matter the medium - stay professional.  If i’m talking to the doctor i’ve been in the last 10 year - yes sir, yes ma’am


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* Was using it every month but they changed medical to a new system and can't even log into the new account.  Prior to that lot of experience with va.gov.


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Yes, I'd sign in to myva.gov or myhealhevet.  I’d sign in for disability or claims - if i can’t sign in i cant access it


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* If I know the specific subject, I'll go by department.  Or i’ll use search. 
* (If the search fails, what do you do?) I usually call the VA


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* Normally Verizon when I have to.


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Frustrating.  


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* General responses that were applicable, but never specific response


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* About medium.  Usually suggestions or comments pertaining to the questions.  Usually point me to resources I can use.  3.5 out of 5


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* Yes - chatbots don’t have the answers but can point me to resources, or phone numbers or department.  
* (difference between chatbot and search engine).  Chatbot is taking what I enter and doing a search on that and doing it better than what I could.  
* (Pointing you in the right direction?) yes, an advanced search engine that can predict where i need to go for it


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* No, I haven't used it.  I’m fully vaccinated.
* I was aware it existed. (Any reason to interact with it?) My wife works through Kaiser and gets info.  As soon as I found out via my field (teacher) - I was at VA for something else they got me vaccinated.


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Answer basic questions - what department to go to, retirement or disability - general info on phone or departments or websites to go to for benefits.  That’s a big one for me and veterans - where to go and apply for benefits.  Also I work with VetCorps - with a university.  I’m a resource for them.
* (Is the expectation that the chatbot will point you where you need to go, or that it surfaces your personal info?) I don't know if I want a chatbot to get my benefits.  More get me a link to that information.
* (even if signed in your expectation is that the chatbot should service your info). Don't know how comfortable I’d feel about automating that info.


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Feel like I have a customer service rep at the other end - same tone and language. Shouldn’t feel like a chatbot at the other end - have it be conversational.


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* I’m not sure about that. It would put people at ease.  From my experience I want to know if I'm talking to an actual chatbot.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* Can’t think of one on the spot.


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Top left - anywhere we have a drop down, there should be a link to a chatbot.
Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Yes email me the blurb
