P11.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.29 9am
Does this require being connected to any technology? No? Whoo-hoo!
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* It should always be professional - that should be on the top of the list.  Should be empathetic people, not just people working on the other end of the phone getting a paycheck
* (What does professional mean to you?) Sometimes people can be real short and abrupt or explain thing really well - they’re kind of rude


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* I don’t know if I've ever really thought about that before.  I don’t like talking to hyper people, is that what you mean
* (would formal or informal tone be a better way) Hyper is someone rushing through a conversation trying to get you off the phone
* (having empathy, not to just be too short in response, does that should right?) Yes


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* Two to three times a week.
* (What are the reasons you’re visiting?) For ebenefits  that's how i get there.  
* (Specific benefits?)  They have a lot of forms on the web site.  I recently filed a claim so i was checking claims status.  I went on there and changed my address, ried to change my direct deposit but that's part of the system does not work, so it’s time consuming so i back out of it and sometimes i go back
4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Yes, I signed in.  it’s important so that its my information that comes up
5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* I would go to Google first and ask it to take me to the VA site.  Don’t think it’s a drop down box, you click on it.  You go through the process of logging in and it asks you three or four ways to login - myhealthevet - i usually chose DS login then ebenefits then end up on the eBenefits site, if i need something if it’s not on that page i add it to the search box and click enter.
* (When you use the search box, does that generally work for you?) For the most part I do.  I think some things are harder to find if you put in the wrong thing.  It gives you the error message that it couldn't be found
* (what do you do to resolve) i try again or get frustrated and back out of the web site. I get busy so I try it a different way.
6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* Yes, products I buy online. Victoria’s Secret has one.


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Sometimes the bots are ok if it’s simple like it was the wrong size, and they get you to where you need to get to.  Sometimes that’s not always the case.  Put you on hold to find the real person.  Then you have to start over with the new person.  Conversation isn’t carried over to the live agent.  And you can see what you just told the bot.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* Personally I like the chatbox.  I look for it on a web site.  It’s an easy way to get a quick answer.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* Yes.  you tell it you want to return something it was the wrong size, adn the more boxes pop up - was it this, or this? Then you can send it back and get to the next level of what you’re asking.  
* (If the bot is able to walk you through a scenario to answer your question or get you to answer questions - then you’re satisfied with the level of service) Yes


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* Yes I would and again, if it’s just the bot you can say a whole sentence and the bot is probably looking for certain words and it sends you back responses to be able to ask.  You pick something, send it back and it takes you further in the process.  Get you what you need or a real life person at the end of it. So yes, i’d say they’re helpful


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* No


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* I don’t know if this is a thing or not but myhealthevet should be connected to it, the helpful part would be to say is medicine on the way, do i need to reorder, do i need to send a note to the doctor about the medicines, can i look at appointments, the mhv stuff connected to ebenefits or va.gov
* (if you’re authenticated, the chatbot should be able to answer questions about personal information?) If you’re logged in, yes.


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* I don’t know that there could be one.  It’s not something I'm going to listen to, I’ll type it.  Be direct and to the point.  Type what I need and get my answer and get out of there.  
* (Timeliness is important for you?) It is


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* I don’t necessarily think - I don’t know.  I don’t think it’s necessary.
* (Any reason why?) I think the expectation of chat is that a bot is going to be the first part of it and if they can’t answer it they go to a live person - Fred, Sam, Julie.  


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* I’d call it Devil Dog Bot.  Veteran Bot


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Logins are usually on the right side of the screen so i think chatbot should be on right, with a box that floats that moves up and down available for us. 
* (Should it be centered, right, or lower?) Center,  Should float with you with the web page.  
* Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Yes, that would be fine.
