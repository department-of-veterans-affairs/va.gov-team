P14.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.29 12pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* In general if I'm trying to find out what benefits are covered or how to set up something I would hope that I could get a referral to a link or a person who can give me that information if it’s not available on the person who’s on the chatbot.  I did use one about 6 months ago on aid and attendance allowances and they were able to get me a link to the va page that outlines that program.


2. What conversational tone do expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* Lately in general there are some extra steps to be honest when i send a message to my provider it seems like they’ll - there’s a secretary that reads something then talks to the provider, it seems like i don’t get anywhere, it’s a waste of time.  At a certain point if I need to take 5 steps to get an appointment then that’s my frustration lately.  It feels like its a waste of time to even send the message
* I would hope that i would be able to message and get a response with ok we need this lab or concrete plan instead of now we have to start over - it might be my provider specific  it’s definitely frustrating
* (Do you want it to be timely and efficient?) Yes.  I say that with myself and a lot of my friends who are veterans, it’s kind of a funky thing, my ptsd manifests in anxiety and bureaucracy builds into that so I won't even get into the steps, almost a probe - i’m going to try.  And if it goes through, yes. And if it doesn’t I'll try again in 6 months.  Just showing a little bit of that perspective
* (the conversational tone, in person or other channels?) The big thing is if’ i’m speaking about my care, i want them to have access to my records, i’m just spinning a wheel when talking to someone
* I’m service connected, rated on x y z and trying to get a prescription, but we need to start tests etc. - why can’t you look at my history and see it’s there and start from there rather than reinventing the wheel every single time to talk to the VA.
* (Adjective - not friendliness, but expectation that they know you?) At least have access to my records.  Be able to look into my history with the VA, can’t go through 20 years of notes, but at least the bullets of VA identified treatments where they can say i see you’re already service connected and build on that vs. starting over.


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* At least once a month, if not as often as once a week and for various things - appointments, prescriptions for refills, to request an appointment or refill, printing off benefits certification when I'm doing some admin paperwork.  Researching more information from the VA


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Almost always - I'll usually sign in using ID.me because it's quicker and simpler.  Once you go to certain things like benefits you have to sign in again.  MHV and VA.gov separate - have to sign in separately.  Go to both of those quite a bit.
* (Why is it important for you to sign in?) Some things are specific to my profile - what my specific info is for appointments, prescriptions. It seems like it cuts out some of those steps vs. having to search for the place I'm going.  I like to go to it, sign in and then sometimes i’ll even bookmark my appointment links and go to them or update and see what’s on there.


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* I’ll pull it up, login and check what appointments I have coming up, then start searching for what i need.  Sometimes I'll do a search - sometimes going through the menu to see what’s new, looking through menu tabs, what comes up on the first page (benefits or different little tabs).  I’ll look through those and say I'll look at that today, that’s interesting, that’s new. 
* (navigate through page and see if there’s new info that you weren’t aware of) yes, definitely true
* (If you can't find the info you’re looking for, what actions do you take?) Sometimes I will search but I don’t know how to word it to get the right information.  I have gone into a little contact with the chat.  When I was looking at Aid and Attendance, I did go on there.  I did send emails and that's been pretty successful - usually a response within a day or two.  


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If not, any particular reason why?
* Yeah i ‘ve used them pretty regularly through Sprint, USAA, Amazon, lots of different ones.


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* In general, because I'm an old fogey it’s kind of frustrating.  It reminds me of the old joke you’re on with the robot menu and I hear you said french toast… random stuff.  I don’t talk the same way the things are programmed, and sometimes it’s frustrating and I just want to cut straight to a real person. Some things like tracking a package is convenient.  If it's relevant or recent, then that might be super convenient and easy.  For my particular profile if maybe i could say list my appointments or track prescriptions, that might be convenient, or message my provider.  That’s most of my experience.  Sometimes about getting routed to the right person.  Being actually connected to a person is helpful.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* Depending on what information I put in, I'd say 30-40%.  With USAA they have me put in my member number then one of 5 things and check insurance and then it goes down from where you go from that.  It’s better than with another company ‘tell me what i can do today’ and I get the ‘we can’t understand that’.  The confidence would change significantly based on the level of personalization.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* Probably about 60% - just because you can put in some information adn get to that point, and I'd say about 40% I have to speak to someone.  50-60% of the time I get the answer.
* (The chatbot can sometimes get you halfway there) Yes, that’s about right.


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* I’m pretty likely to use them.  A low threshold of anxiety - sometimes it’s a ‘oh that’s a waste of time, but it’s only a few seconds compared to the waste of time for having to find the phone number and listening through ‘for this, click one’.


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* I think I did notice it there - I didn’t have any concerns or questions so it wasn’t relatable to me.
* (No interaction with it?) No


12. How confident were you in the bot's responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* If you put in your service number, to get my appointments, if I select prescriptions, see what needs or is able to be renewed, track a package kind of thing.  Route through what i’m going to today - prescriptions, appointments ,more information about benefits, print out my letter, contact my provider.


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Well especially if you’re logged in, it would be nice if that were personalized to your profile, benefits - I don’t know
* (By personalized, if it used your name in responses or something else?) That would be nice, but as far as being able to - if you’re logged into your profile, it would be useful to ask about your specific appointments or prescriptions
* (Why is it important for you?) Because these are the most common needs.  I know we’re shifting from the old Web sites and systems.  There’s also Vets from every generation - some people with lots of experience.  Sometimes the website can be daunting or a little confusing.  What benefits mean to me might not be the same to the programmer - or even different services.  Even if you could bookmark to be your priority.  Being able to navigate it quickly without getting lost - which website is it today? MHV or VA.gov?


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* Honestly I would probably say no, because for older Vets it might be confusing - was really talking to Lydia.  Maybe something general - your VA chatbot would probably be more straightforward.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* I’d probably say something like Your VA Chatbot - yoru virtual assistant could work.  Your VA virtual assistant so that it relays it’s not a person
* (What do you think of the VA Chat Box?) That’s cute


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* In general they’re usually on the right hand side, floating in the bottom corner.  It differs on your phone and computer.  Readily available would be handy, so if you’re on a tiny screen you can see it
* Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


definitely!
