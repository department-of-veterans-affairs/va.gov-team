P6.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.27 11am
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* It should be that you get a reasonable follow up - if i sent an email or called, someone returns call or email.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* It doesn’t depend on the method.  Email should be professional.  Hard part with the phone is certain tones - expressing feelings, can come out even if words are professional.  It’s easier to have a black and white conversation over email rather than phone
* Any phone calls with VA? Haven’t had a lot - appointment center.  Providers are phenomenal - let me help you with that.  The appointment line can be hit or miss - occasionally get someone abrupt. 


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* Not that often - one or two times a month.


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* As a veteran family member, do you sign in with your own credentials or veteran? Usually i use mine - but i’ve had login issues.  I might use my husband’s if I get frustrated. 
* (Are you looking for info on his behalf or you as a member)? It’s not usually for me - it’s other family members.


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* Generally I use google to find things on the web site.  Not often am i going to be using search - it’s not as good as Google search.


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* yes


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Apex chat a lot - also used a chat box - city leads? Apex is on our web site - it’s a business marketing company.  It has an agent 24/7, collects info, finds out why someone is chatting with a web site.  Or direct them to right


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* Fairly confident - depends on what it returns to you.  If the bot doesn’t understand the question i’m asking.
* If you don’t get answers, I would find another resource.  Or reach out in some other capacity.  I used to ask 3 people and if 2 agree, you have the right answer.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* 8/10 is usually helpful.  Usually hosting companies does a good job answering questions over chat.


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* Yes. Why? I spend a lot of time on the phone with medical device manufacturers, I don't want to be on hold for an hour.  Never sure if someone’s going to email me back and when to respond.  I want to have a chat and have a ‘we will respond within x amount of time’. 
* Timeliness is an important factor for you? Yes


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* I did see it but didn’t use it - didn’t have specific questions.


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Resources - forms, link to the forms.  What would be helpful is to help me find phone numbers
* What about educating myself with topics I wouldn't be familiar with? Not the first thing I would be thinking of.  If it was asking questions about VA benefits.  I Don't think it’s the first use of the chatbot.  First use is more basic things, finding resources etc.  


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* In a lot of settings people are in a stressful situation - being overly friendly is good.  CHick Fil A ‘my pleasure’ works.
* (Making sure you’re providing service - different people are coming to it for different purposes and different emotional states, correct?) Yes


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* Yes, I think so.  People are more willing to interact if it is a person.  The chabot on our site has a photo of an employee


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* Victor with the VA - alliterative name.  Victory - ethnically nebulous, maybe something like that.


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Bottom right corner.


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Yes, send blurb
