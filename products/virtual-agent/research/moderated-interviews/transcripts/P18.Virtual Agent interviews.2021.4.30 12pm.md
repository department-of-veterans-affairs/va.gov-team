P18.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.30 12pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* I hope rhwy’cw answered my questions, they're direct. address me as a female less it’s my directo physician
* (Why important?)  Most of the time I get mr. dep… I know the female population is small, but it's important to remember that there still is a female population. It takes 2 seconds to see if male or female.  It can direct how the whole conversation is going. 


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* In person they can see I'm a female after they call my name after.  Generally I get a more soft response, not always what I want but at the same time it’s somewhat soothing.  It can be somewhat demeaning. At some points they treat me less - like I did less from my country, when you need to calm someone down over the phone.  Wanting to be addressed right.  As a nurse, to calm down the different sexes.  In emails it doesn’t really matter.  Just when I see that in an email that automatically  makes me angry  they couldn’t take the 3 seconds.  They’re obviously not looking at the rest of my chart.
* (degrades your confidence in how they may treat me)  yes, if they’re treating me medically.  If they can’t see i’m a female how are they going to know they’re give me the right care


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* At least weekly.  I read my provider’s notes.  


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Generally.  I have a premium account.  
* Why do you choose to sign in?  Look at the provider's notes to see if they did what they said or prescribed what they said.  Make sure meds are right.  Even if i’m just browsing, i like to start from my sign in to compare it


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* Through my healthevet even though i have the other logins.  There I'll go to the VA.gov symbol.  I’ll search through that looking for info that I need, I'll bookmark it, or send or share with my text message or email so I have that to go back to. 
* (if you don’t find the info what other actions) I just Google or go to facebook to Veteran to Veteran group is very helpful.  Google will throw me right back at VA.gov or to some random thing that has nothing to do with what I'm looking for.  In general I'll keep trying to find on va.gov or ask one of my friends.  I have a couple of friends who work for the va.
* (Existing personal networks or find another network?) yes


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If not, any particular reason why?
* I’ve used a few on various web sites.  T-mobile, Microsoft.  I like them - they get you to the right spot.  Microsoft sometimes does.


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Generally positive.  Sometimes I forget the wording of stuff.  That’s my biggest trouble using a chatbot - I describe something wrong and it takes me off base.  It doesn’t get me where I need to go. Whereas if i was with a human or a friend’s networking i get a ‘oh you need this’.  With chatbots I've had decent success.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* I have high confidence in them with someone with a normal brain


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* They are helpful


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* Oh definitely.  They always serve their purpose to get me right to where I need or closer to what I need.  Always an option to what I'm getting at.  Before reacting out and annoying someone.
* (TBI - any screen readers?) No.  had 9 concussions - moderate TBI.  I have different shaped lenses, that’s the main thing I use. Still working with my team on what helps me the best
* (In general read text in a chat window - laptop or mobile or both?) bOth - equal amount of time.
* (differences of experience web vs. mobile).  Desktop is better - mobile it ends up popping the screens, going between screens, easier on laptop, i can see that screen and rest of other screen whereas on mobile chatbot takes whole screen and losing it and getting frustrated
11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* no


12. How confident were you in the bot's responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Questions about benefits, helped with appointments - you’d have to be signed in for that. General medical stuff, ratings stuff, how does this affect me, I'm Worried about smoke pit stuff, if that’s getting covered, agent orange - take them to an article about that.  Not a web md type thing.  Anything with dependents and forms. We know DoD and VA love all their annotated forms - add dependent forms and take me to that.
* (take fragmented sentences and keywords and be able to interpret what you're looking for) somewhat like a search engine, yeah basically.  Or do yes/no’s to narrow down what you’re looking for. 
* (So a logic tree - if this then that) yes


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Nonbinary - it’s a computer.  There isn’t a tone - it might say hello how might i help you today.  It won’t treat you differently whether you’re a man or woman.
* (Why is non binary important?) First of all it's about and it’s not there to decipher your mood like a person would.  You’re there to get a bit of information from it, and not there to diagnose or age you like a human would. Even when you go on amazon and you’re chatting with one of them, if you get nasty with them they close the chat down, not that i know from experience.  There to help you get more info. 
* (Descriptor or adjective for this tone) THis is where I have issues.  A flat affect, maybe it’s not going to get you any type of mood or anything but the basics.
* (it should remain a professional tone at all times) it should remain a computer
16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* Maybe. It has to be something quick - my son goes to shop and I get texts from Shop Charly reminding me of his appointment schedule.  Something synonymous with VA.  Add VA (Capital letters) (ask VA?)


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Usually see these in the right corner, mainly where we see them.  Sometimes it’s good quite a bit… a big elderly population, but if it was a rolling thing - would you like to chat or whatever, push rolling (?) screen


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Yes, I can pass it along.
