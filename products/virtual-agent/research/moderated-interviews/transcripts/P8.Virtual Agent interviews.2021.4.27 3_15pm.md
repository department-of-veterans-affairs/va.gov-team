P8.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.27 3:15pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* Everyone's time is valuable.  The VA has a tremendous workload. What we have to expect is a prompt quick answer. I use the website more than anything.  Just use it once a year.  Interaction is very limited. It’s always been efficient as far as I'm concerned.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* I would think in person it should have a friendly demeanor.  Hard to do that in email or a chatbox to a point.  They should project that they want to be helpful.  I work in the service industry and I expect that.


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* Probably monthly.


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Yes, I signed in. I signed in because I have a premium account - I can see more and more direct information in regards to myself.


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* I use an ID.me to sign in.  It's quick.  I have an appeal pending so that’s what I've been looking at - how many hundred thousand are ahead of me.  Site is easy to navigate. I do see if health records are updated, if I went to a private doctor to make sure he gets my blood work.  It’s very easy to navigate.


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* The most recent was Comcast/Xfinity. You seldom talk to a human - they put you on hold and kick you off. I’ve resorted to chatbox, but their prime purpose is to sell you another program, so they’re not effective.  The chat box itself is convenient if you can get through the person you need. 
* I have used staples’ chatbox program. With the VFW I handle a lot of paperwork and supplies.  If there’s a problem I go to the chat box and it’s fixed.


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* pretty much productive.  I’m not a patient person as far as the telephone was concerned.  I felt I spent half of my day on the telephone for much of my career.  I don’t answer the land line.  The chat box is good but it’s only as good as the people working at the other end.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* I would be confident.  I’ve only had unsatisfactory ones with Comcast.  I’m never satisfied with them no matter the way I contact them though.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* With the exception of xfinity, yes.


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* When you’re trying to make a call, you are on an extended hold or explain everything to one person and they transfer and get to another person.  If I get to a chatbox it’ll close.  To me it’s simpler to use and more direct than… a couple of weeks ago I was on hold for 30 min.  It’s frustrating for me, I don't have patience. Chatbox gets my questions answers - in and out
* (More control over your time)? Yes, exactly.  I had three calls to this one company.  I listened to the canned music for almost 45 minutes, but 12 seconds to fix the problem on their web site.  If I could do that with a chat box instead of the 1 hour with the 3 phone calls.
* (Have you ever called into the VA)? I’ve never had a bad experience with the VA.  they did call me about the covid shot.  Because I volunteered I needed to get the shot but was scheduled to get my shot the next day.  


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* I believe I did.  It was information and they were trying to make sure all the vets were vaccinated.  I didn’t interact with it - i was waiting for a shot to become available. I didn’t see any need to - we’ve been plastered with info for the last year - i’m sure relatively sure they didn’t have new information.  And my wife is a nurse so we keep up to date with that stuff.


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* I do a lot of my own research, so can’t think specifically - a direction to go to get an answer.  In other words if it was benefits or healthcare, or appointments.  I suppose if there’s a question that needs answered, we should be able to get it directed to someone who answered to get it to the person it needs to get to.
* (view a chatbot as a possible link between you and another live human who can assist you or answer a question?) In my experience with chat boxes, your chat is open and you ask your question and when you put in account information it brings up a menu of what you want to do in your account, benefits.  So I guess if that’s what you want to do, a menu of that sort.  Info on benefits - retirement, etc.  and trigger the AI to trigger to the right direction


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* It should be positive - hard when you’re using text, can’t inject a lot of emotion. Project that this will be helpful for you.  You can’t express emotion whether it’s your eyes, mouth , smile or showing interest - can’t do that with a chatbot. But you can have a polite direct tone.
* (why is that important?) It makes people more receptive to the technology.  There’s a lot of people who don't have anything to do with tech.  I’m 71, I use it everyday, at every opportunity.  Just like these surveys.  It’s important you get my perspective who’s been around the block a few times.


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* Yeah, it would make it more personable.  John, Joe, Bill - have it feel like personality.  Some people wouldn’t be able to tell you’re dealing with artificial intelligence. A common name will make it more acceptable.  ‘Hi Jim how ya doin’. 
17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* John, Joe, Bill. (‘how you doin’)


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


ok!
