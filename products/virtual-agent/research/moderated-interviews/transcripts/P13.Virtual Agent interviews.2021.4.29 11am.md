P13.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.29 11am
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* If It's over the phone a lot of times you have to go through a lot of prompts because they have a lot of different departments they want to get you through to the right person.  Chat i would expect to get to it a lot sooner, get to whatever you’re looking for a lot sooner.  If it’s a bot I don't know, it’s not a person, it’s a program?
* (any channel - what expectations?).  To get a response back as quickly as possible.  Secure messaging, email, phone, snailmail - i usually get a response back quickly with doctors.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* Polite tone, don't expect anyone to be very quick and anxious to get me off the phone, listening and trying to help me solve the problem.
* (Why is it important to you?) Lets me feel like someone’s listening to me. I’m probably going to be irritated at the same time, so going to make that conversation uncomfortable.
* (Is an empathetic tone you agree?) Definitely


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* At least once or twice a week, looking for benefits, going to myhealthevet, order prescription, secure messaging with physician


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Yes I do.  When I sign in it’s more tailored to me, whereas if I don't sign in it’s giving me information for everyone.


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* I go to va.gov I'd use the search box and type in whatever I'm looking for.  I would think disability benefits would come up.  I would use google before i call.  If i call, I'll be on hold for a while, going to take a little more time. A lot of times when I do that I have to search. 


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* I have used it but don’t remember which one - most of the time I've used one with the state of North Carolina.
7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* When i tried to get license plates when you pay your taxes and it pretty much walks you through the steps.  If for some reason it can’t find it, then you’re out of luck and have to wait after hours, waiting until the next day until you talk to a live person.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* I was very confident - once you put the info in it would proceed you to the payment options.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* Yes it was very helpful


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* It was very helpful, the only time it wouldn't be helpful - if it required a loved person.  That’s probably not going to be a lot of questions.  The chatbot would be answered with general questions
* (what would elevate the questions to require the live person to take over) VA wise or in general? If a number on an account was wrong or wasn’t showing up, the chatbot would probably tell you they couldn't’ tell you as well you have to call customer service.


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* No i didn’t


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* I would say if i was looking for a form, it would direct me to the right form or right direction i needed to go.  
* (It would be able to answer questions accurately, get you to the right info the first time?) Correct


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Older citizens in general may not understand it’s a real person - it should have a real tone that doesn't seem quick or definitely don’t want to be typing in all caps or anything like that.
* (Should the chatbot reflect a professional empathetic tone?) yes


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* Yes, because it makes it more personal when you’re communicating with it.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* GI Joe


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Lower right hand corner


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Yes, pass it along
