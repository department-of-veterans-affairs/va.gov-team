P17.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.30 9am
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* Expect they’re going to be able to answer whatever question I have with the pertinent information they have.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* In any method, it seems friendly and helpful.


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* It takes you to other web sites depending on what you’re using - myhealthevet has been moved over.  I’ve used it more frequently than any other way of contacting the VA or if I'm trying to find information on benefits. 
* (How often is it?) Couple of times a month for secure messaging.


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* I sign in via DS login.  That’s just the login that I've used all along.  I have it saved so I can remember it easily.  It’s out of habit.  


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* I usually navigate there and based on whatever I'm looking for if it’s beneficial information or whatever I try to find based on whatever links or drop down boxes, things like that.
* (Use the web site’s information architecture - the navigation of the site?) Yes
* (If you can’t find the information through the drop downs, are there other methods?) not typically - i basically try to look around and find it.  I’ve gone to the site map before if i couldn’t find something.


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If not, any particular reason why?
* I’ve used it with some delivery services like FedEx and UPS


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Truthfully they can be frustrating, especially when you know what you want to find and have to talk to a person because you have to figure out what word combination to talk to someone.
* (The language the chatbot expects you to use is a frustrating experience) yes


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* In most cases it can give you fairly decent information, but it's not information I couldn't haven’t found myself.
* (You view a chatbot as a secondary tool if you can’t find it yourself?) Yes


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* In the end I’m typically able to resolve the problem, but not always via chatbot
* (It acts as an intermediary before you talk to a person?) Correct


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* No problem using them, but sometimes there’s a point they can’t provide an answer.  I have that expectation going in that they may not be able to answer it.
* (The expectations are pretty low proficient in answering my questions?) No, I think they can come up with the answer, but the time I'm chatting with someone it’s in order to get a problem taken care of and a chatbot can’t always solve it.


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* No


12. How confident were you in the bot's responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Help direct me to where I need to go if I can't find something.
* (help guide you to the right place? Yes


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Friendly and helpful.  It’s important because when you’re trying to get help from someone or something you expect it to not be abrupt and negative.  Does that make sense


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* Yes it makes it easier to interact if it has a human name.  I understand when I click the chat with us button that it might be a chatbot, a computer based type system answering me but not all people do, it’s especially important to interact like if they were interacting with another human.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* No idea what a good name would be.


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* Usually the lower right edge of the screen.
* (Does that make it easier to interact with the bot)? Usually when the screen pops up for chatting it’s on the right.


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Ok to send it
