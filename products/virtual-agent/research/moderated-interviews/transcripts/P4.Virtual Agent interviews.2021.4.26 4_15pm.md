P4.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.26 4:15pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* I’m not entirely sure - I’m used to different communications, going to a Web site and encountering a Chatbot - or I go to a contact screen and see if I can get a chatbot or voice.  I’ve gotten used to chatbots and their effective for basic.  Being able to call someone for more detailed things.  If it’s not urgent I'll call the email.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* Friendly professional tone.  Someone who knows they’re here to help the veteran, that’s their duty .  different customers have different expectations depending on their experience.  A colonel is going to have different expectations. 


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* I would use it once every 2-3 months.  When I first retired I set up VA appointments.  Once I had that established I would only go there for medical appointments.  If i got something in email something i’d follow the email link.


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* Yes. i found that not login in you get basic information - i log into get this stuff.  There's an elevated account level.  I don’t want to stop what I'm doing to have to log in again. 


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* I have a bookmark - I don't remember what I can do, but I can pull up a browser. Since I've mostly been doing medical stuff I'll go to that link. I usually just click on va.gov and I go to the home page because usually it’s up front otherwise i use the search (on va.gov).  Search depends how successful - i’ll follow primary links on the home page and if that’s not adequate i’ll do the search or then go to Google to find the direct pages.  
* (Default is to go to Google to see if it can find the direct page?) yes


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* USAA, Hello Fresh, those are the two most recent.  Used a few others.  
7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* For HelloFresh, they’ve compiled a number of common complaints or issues, it prompts you if it’s one of these categories.  Usually it will be a missing item from the recipe.  Missing food or missing meals, or something leaked.  It’ll ask you.  The chatbot can’t fix it but it’ll connect me directly to someone who can - to give me a phone number and hand moe to someone else 
* (Drill down to a specific need and hands to live agent)? Correct
* USAA: search for credit limit or my insurance policy.  Insurance changes to where you move around. Categories predefined - separate banking or insurance and branch you down, or direct questions. This is both their website and mobile app.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* Pretty confident - captured enough complaints and categorized them without having to hand off to a person.  Able to hand off a lot of things without a person.  Or put in a live person queue.  Whereas chatbot handles things and you don't have to handle talking to someone.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* Yes, 90% of the time they’re helpful.


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* They weren’t effective a few years ago - now much more effective.  Before it was calling a phone number and getting a voicemail - or press this button, you’d get frustrated - now chatbots better with human responses and finding what you need.


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* I have not.  
* (Did you know there was one).  I got an email and a flyer in the mail.  I work in a hospital now so I’m pretty up to date on info so didn’t need the info.


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immedialetly be able to do for you?
* Being able to access educational benefits, and healthcare.  Chek  prescription, schedule appointment, find VA clinic nearby if i’m traveling.
* (expectation is it can assist you with personal details of your experience as a veteran?) Yes.  accessible to pull from a database or put something in - it can look in a database and not needed a human interaction.  Maybe schedule appointments based on a provider.  


15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Something that’s able to ask questions of a veterna that’s not computer literate.  People like my father just want someone to call him and talk to him.  He wants to say every little detail.  Have a chatbot break down what’s being input and verify what’s being input and ask that upfront - what are you here for or a couple of prompts and disability.  Ask questions from there, like a child
* (Not just catch-all response - should respond to particular user): right
* (if you could attach an adjective, what kind of conversational tone?) Helpful.  Usher or concierge.  Asking the most basic questions to separate the rest of the questions out.


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* I don’t think so - I've seen it on a lot of chatbots.  I find it deceiving - am I talking to a human or a bot? I’d rather know if I'm talking to a chatbot.  I can see people not understanding they’re talking to a chatbot.


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* That’s hard because personally - I'm of Asian descent, just having an Anglo name makes an assumption.  Having a name might not fit all cultures and genders
* (Not naming a chatbot is most inclusive?) yes.


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* I’ve seen it on a big bubble in the bottom corner - hey if you need help.  I find it out of the way, but good if I do need help to let me ask the bubble for help.


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Yes, send it out to you.
