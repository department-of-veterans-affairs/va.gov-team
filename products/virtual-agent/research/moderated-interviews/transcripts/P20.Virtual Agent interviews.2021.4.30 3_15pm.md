P20.Virtual Agent interviews.2021.4.30 3:15pm
1. When you interact with the VA, whether in-person, over the phone, online or written communications, what expectations do you have for the conversation?
* Boilerplate governments speak trying to understand the point of what they’re trying to say.  It usually has all the information I'm looking for.


2. What conversational tone do you expect when interacting with the VA? Does it depend on the method? If so, why?
* Bureaucratic - words that are unnecessary for conveying info - heretofore - written by a legal department. Could be much simpler.  
* (more plain language is better?) Yes.


3. How often do you use VA.gov?
* Once a year or twice. 


4. Do you always sign in? Please describe why or why you do or don't.
* I want to say I do, not sure - one so the secure verification ones.
* (Why sign in?) I had to sign in to get to the pages I needed to get it.  Am i caught up on vaccines (not covid related).


5. How do you normally find information you need on VA.gov?
* Windows 10 has spoiled me - i can start typing and search populates it - fastest way to get to a site.


6. Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online? If yes, do you remember which one? If no, any particular reason why?
* I use them all the time.  Most recently HP.


7. Can you describe your experience using this bot?
* Hit or miss.  Above average - it can be read for context, if i don’t phrase it right it i'll say ‘don’t understand what you mean’.  If it errors out it’s good at saying ‘did you mean this or this’.  It’s decent.


8. How confident were you in the bot’s responses?
* Pretty confidence - they’re pretty good at keeping its databases up to date.  Occasionally wrong answer.


9. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* Good bot but better if I had searched for information on their page - ask HP directly. I work IT for the government so I don’t have a HP rep, I need this tech doc for security and getting the layers of smoke and mirrors. 


10. Based on your experience, would you use a chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not?
* Sure, do find them useful.  I may or may not use it but at the end of the day do see them as another search option.
* (more advanced search query): yup


11. Over the past year, have you used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov? If yes, please describe your experience.
* I’m going to say no, last time it stood up.  
* (you didn’t interact?) Not at VA.gv


12. How confident were you in the bots responses?
* n/a


13. Based on your experience, describe your satisfaction level with the service of this bot? Was it helpful to answer your questions or accomplish your task?
* n/a


14. If the VA were to build a more general chatbot for VA.gov, what would you expect it to immediately be able to do for you?
* Take typical questions people ask and guide people to the right page - don’t know what it would do for me.  I’m able to search on my own.  Half the time as long as it’s not in the way of me searching that’s the nicest thing to do.  Can be useful for those not internet savvy. 
 
15. What type of conversational tone should it have? Please describe why this would be important to you.
* Less bureaucratic is going to be helpful.  I like chatbots to be borderline friendly and also professional.  As long as it’s not sounding like a machine.  I learn towards friendly conversation.  


16. Should a VA chatbot have a human or human-like name? Please describe why or why not.
* Yes
* (why is that - for the identification.  Have people identify for VA Fred is - I can see Fred’s looking.  If it doesn’t identify itself with a name I can assign a face and personality too.
* (If a chatbot has a name it’s more personable to the end user) yes


17. If it should have a name, what should it be that would be representative for all veterans, care-takers, and family-members who would interact with it? No worries if you can't think of one on the spot.
* Honesty, the only broad strokes would be a pun on the VA but no idea.  Fred.


18. Where on VA.gov would you expect to find the bot to begin a conversation?
* I would expect it on va.gov and it loads ‘hi, hey’.  I’m used to having them popu lower right - as long as it doesn’t pop up in the middle and take up a third of the read estate


Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.


Sure that would be cool - I do work in the Navy so sure
