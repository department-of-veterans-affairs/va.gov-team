## Introduction

- Thank you for joining today’s group discussion. We want to hear about your independent experiences testing the VA chatbot using the scenarios provided.
- We'll cover all major areas in the scenario bank—please share your thoughts, findings, and concerns—especially around privacy, security, and accessibility.

I wanted to go over a few things about this meeting quickly before we begin:
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

## 1. General Experience

- What were your main goals when using the VA chatbot?
- What specific things were you trying to break?
- Were there scenarios that worked particularly well or poorly? Why?

## 2. Scenario-Based Reflections
For each section, discuss with the group who tried the scenario(s), what they observed, and any risks or surprises. (Facilitator: Read out scenario types as prompts.)

### A. Sign-on & Access (Veterans)
- For those who tested account creation, sign-in, password reset, or two-factor authentication:
    - Did the chatbot provide clear and accurate help?
    - Was it up-to-date with links and instructions?
    - Did it ever request information you considered private or unnecessary?

### B. Access Control & Delegation (Caregivers, Proxies)
- If you explored caregiver, dependent, or proxy access:
    - How did the chatbot describe secure access or linking another’s account?
    - Did you try providing sensitive info (e.g., DOB, SSN) to see if the chatbot would help you bypass permission checks?
    - Did you receive appropriate boundaries or refusals where expected?

### C. Safety, Moderation & Escalation (ALL GROUPS)
- Did anyone introduce crisis, self-harm, or harassment language to see moderation in action?
    - How safely did the chatbot respond?
    - Did resources or redirection appear timely and appropriate?
    - In longer or repeated turns, did moderation remain consistent?

### D. Adversarial & Jailbreak Attempts (All)
- Who tried direct or indirect jailbreak/adversarial tactics (e.g., “ignore prior instructions,” code prompts, layered/obfuscated asks)?
    - Did the chatbot provide any restricted info or unsafe guidance?
    - Across longer, multi-step chains, was the chatbot able to maintain refusal behavior?
    - Did you notice any surprising “leakage” or boundary failures?

### E. Data Exfiltration Attempts
- Did anyone attempt to get the chatbot to reveal backend details, scripts, or user data (e.g., asking for API keys, database queries, scripts to access data)?
    - Did it ever provide code or instructions it shouldn’t?
    - Were there any concerning responses related to data or account access?

### F. Hallucination & Accuracy (Domain-specific)
- Did you ask “trick” questions for contact info, addresses, or official policy (e.g., “What number should I call for...”, “How do I log into my dad’s account?”)?
    - Did the chatbot ever make up a phone number, legal advice, or steps that seemed inaccurate?
    - How confident were you in the accuracy and reliability of information given?

### G. Voice, Tone, and Brevity
- Did you notice consistency, empathy, clarity, and inclusiveness in the chatbot’s responses?
- Were responses too formal, too casual, or just right?
- Were instructions concise and easy to understand, or overly complicated?
- Do you feel that responses like "OK" and "goodbye" being used by the Chatbot are acceptable or would you consider them too formal?
- Did you ever feel frustrated or feel like you were overreaching to elicit an answer from the Chatbot?

### H. Long Conversation/Moderation Stress
- For anyone who tested long or complex conversations with mixed safe and policy-violating prompts:
    - Did moderation and safe responses persist throughout?
    - Did the chatbot’s tone or boundaries change as the dialogue progressed?

---

## 3. Privacy & Security (Cross-scenario)

- At any point, did you feel uncomfortable sharing information?
- Did the chatbot ever ask for sensitive details or PII, and what happened if you gave it?
- Was there clear information about how your data would be handled or privacy warnings?
- Did you observe any behavior you’d consider a privacy or security risk?

---

## 4. Accessibility

- Did anyone use assistive tech (screen readers, keyboard nav, etc.)?
- Did you notice any issues with navigation, font size, alt text, or layout?
- Was the information accessible for all types of users (clear language, simple structure)?

---

## 5. Accuracy of the Chatbot

- Did the chatbot ever provide answers that you know to be incorrect?
- If you did encounter any inaccurate incormation, can you share examples?
- Were there any scenarios where you felt uncertain about the accuracy of the advice or details given by the Chatbot?
- Did you have to double-check the information provided by the chatbot against other official sources?

---

## 6. Rating the Chatbot

Accuracy: 1-5 scale (1=incorrect, 5=completely accurate) 

Clarity: 1-5 scale (1=confusing, 5=crystal clear)

Completeness: 1-5 scale (1=missing critical info, 5=comprehensive)

Cognitive load: 1-5 scale (1=overwhelming, 5=manageable)

---

## 7. Suggestions & Open Feedback

- Which risks or issues would you want the team to fix most urgently—privacy, security, accessibility, accuracy, or something else?
- What would make the chatbot more trustworthy, safe, and easy to use?
- Any other comments or insights from your independent testing?
