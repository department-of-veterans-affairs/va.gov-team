*Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Ensure participant has been emailed the correct staging link and fake username/password: https://staging.va.gov/virtual-agent-study/ 


## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Shane Strassberg] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about and interact with our VA Virtual Agent chatbot currently in development. Last year we ran a proof of value study to gauge interest in a chatbot for Veterans, and your input today will directly impact the future development of this tool to help Vets better self-serve and get faster outcomes to their questions.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [30-45 min].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your knowledge or ability to use chatbots. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your honest feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototype chatbot.** This prototype chatbot may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What's has your general experience with chatbots been like? 
- When you need general VA information, what actions do you normally take?
- When you need specific information about yourself from the VA, what actions do you normally take?

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

## First Task: [Screen Share] - 1-2 minutes

- I'd like you to share your screen with me. Can you click on the green share screen button, located at the bottom middle of the Zoom window.
- Please select your desktop window to share so we can be sure to see the web browser you're using.

### Things to watch for:

- Are they able to find the share screen button?

## Second Task: [Open Chatbot URL] - 2-3 minutes

- You should have just received a link to your provided email to access the chatbot. Can you please open it now? 
- Can you take a moment to familiarize yourself with the webpage you just opened?
- Next I'd like you to use the provided username and password from the same email to sign into to the chatbot.
- Take a moment to read the intro text and let me know if it is clear or if there is anything confusing. 
- What do you think about the crisis disclaimer?

### Things to watch for:

- Are they able to find the provided link and open it. If not we can dictate the url or in worst case, share our screen and sign in to demo the tool.
- Do they sign in using the button in the chatbot or the regular sign in button on the upper right corner of the webpage?
- Do they read the intro text to the chatbot?

## Third Task: [Ask General Question] - 5 minutes

- Now that you have read the intro text, I'd like you to ask the chatbot a general question about benefits. Please type in "Am I eligible for health benefits"
- Next copy and paste which response you would like to view for a link, preview or full chatbot response.
- Please take a moment to read the chatbot response and click any links that may be relevant to your question. What do you think about the info provided? Is it helpful? Why or why not? If not, what would you expect to see as a response instead?
- Please copy/paste the next view you want to read
- And lastly please copy/paste the remaining view to read the response.

### Things to watch for:

- Which view do they choose and in what order?
- Do they automatically click provided links in the response?

## Fourth Task: [Ask 2nd General Question] - 5 minutes

- Please ask the chatbot another general topic question.
- Please take a moment to read the chatbot response and click any links that may be relevant to your question. What do you think about the info provided? Is it helpful? Why or why not? If not, what would you expect to see as a response instead?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant use a whole question or keywords?
- Do they automatically click provided links in the response?

## Fifth Task: [Ask about Claims] - 5 minutes

- Ok, now I'd like you to ask the chatbot about the status of your fake users disability claim.
- Please take a moment to read the chatbot response. What do you think about the info provided? Is it helpful? Why or why not? If not, what would you expect to see as a response instead?
- What step would you take next based on the buttons provided in the chat window? Why would you choose that button?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant click the Speak with agent button? What do they think of the response after they click it?

## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes

- When the bot tells you it does not have the answer, how does it make you feel?
- How do you feel about the voice and tone of the response you received?
- If the chatbot couldn't answer your question but could connect you to a live agent chat, would you prefer that over speaking by phone with the VA help desk/contact center?
- Was it clear what all the buttons did (button labels) or where all the links went? Would you rephrase any of the buttons?
- Based on your experience today, are you willing to use the chatbot again?
- What additional feature to the chatbot would improve your experience?
- Do you have any other feedback you'd like to share?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this virtual agent chatbot and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Notes

About user: 
- 65+ years old
- little to no experience with chat bots
- Generally knows where to get information already through myHealthyVet

Third Task: "Am I eligible for health benefits?"
- User chose "full" option first. They described it as lengthy but gives all the info you could need instantly. Content is easy to understand and they would utilize the links in the message to learn more.
- Next they chose "link" option. They liked the link option more than full because it is all the same info but faster and displayed faster. This is potentially less intuitive than the full because there is one extra step to get all the information.
- Lastly they picked "preview" which they thought was uncessary since it provides info that is already known and then just the link from the "link" option.
- Overall "full" is most helpfu because it has everything you need without leaving the page.

Fourth Task: Genearl Question
- Asked about prescriptions. They liked the way this worked because it provided links from the bot to the page that would help them most.

Fifth Task: Claims
- The user said that there was sufficient information on each claim.
- Response was good because it was simple, concise, and had links for more info.
- They like this feature overall a lot because it removes being put on hold and passed around on the phone.
- They would most likely try to speak to a live agent if they wanted more information.
- The user said that they would like an other way to verify once connected with a live agent for security.
