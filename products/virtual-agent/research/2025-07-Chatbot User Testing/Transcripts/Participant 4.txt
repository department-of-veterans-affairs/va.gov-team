Participant 4 Ð July 23, 2025 Ð 9:00 AM ESTParticipant: Cool.Moderator: Got the recording started, and we've got the transcript started. And now thatModerator: now that we do have that, I'm gonna just once againModerator: confirm that you did have we? Do have your permission to to record.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: Let's see here, all right.Moderator: Now that we're done with that, let's move on to the pre-testing questions. 1st question is, are you using any assistive technology today like a screen reader.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay? And could you please tell me what device, what operating system and browser you're using for this testing.Participant: I would use Microsoft edge currently on a laptop with aParticipant: Intel I 7 with the Nvidia Geforce like 1090 graphics card.Moderator: Cool sounds good next. How familiar! Familiar! Excuse me, are you with Chatbots? Have you used chatbots before.Participant: I would say yes.Moderator: Okay, do you know specifically the name of the chat bots? You've interacted with.Participant: I mean, IParticipant: chat bot to me is just vague. So I mean, if we're talking about like chat gpt, then I've used chat, Gpt, I've used grokParticipant: but I mean, we can go all the way back to America online. And there was chat bots with that. So I was using back in the day.Moderator: Yeah, absolutely. So let me get your gauge on. How many times would the frequency, I guess, of your use? How many times would you say you use them in the last month?Participant: Maybe like what? Like going to a website and then clicking the the chat bot likeParticipant: I've I've used it like once once in the past month, probably.Moderator: Once in the past month. So how many would you just guess? In the last 6 months.Participant: You know 2 or 2 or 3.Moderator: 2, 3, okay, perfect.Moderator: So next, I'm going to give you a link here in the chat.Moderator: And what this link will be is one of our prototypes, and I'm going to ask that you would click on this link and then share your screen so we can go through the the questions and the tasksModerator: for this user session.Moderator: So 1st of all, did you, did you get my link there.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Participant: And I should just be able to do entire screen shareParticipant: should be able to see the the website here, right.Moderator: Yep. Just pulled up perfect. Okay, so my 1st task will be to go ahead and familiarize yourself with the page, read any notes or any warnings, and when you're ready, click, start, chat to begin.Moderator: And as you're doing this, pleaseModerator: Feel free to speak aloud your thoughts, your actions, and kind of explore this chat, bot.Participant: AlrightParticipant: so there's pretty much it's telling you what Chatbot can't do.Participant: and obviously a little helpful stuff down here to kind of just FAQ. Which is typical with most of the things I see in the Va.Participant: For how they lay everything out which is good,Participant: how to use as a screen, reader.Participant: So if I'm blind or I have low vision, I can't read this, but I would be using it, and it would read down that so.Moderator: Yeah, exactly. A screen reader would just read through that.Participant: Record what I typed. Answer surveys cool most of the times.Participant: I figure all that stuff is already happening. Anyways. So start chat, Chatbot camping. Yep.Participant: based on type personal information. Okay, alright. So it looks like it's open. And thenParticipant: it can help me find general information.Participant: What's the pack deck, and what's my claim? Status? Alright.Moderator: Perfect. So what I'd like you to do then is for the 1st question, can you please type? How can I sign into VaModerator: and then take a few minutes to interact with the response the Chatbot gives, and once again feel free to speak out loud your thoughts and actions as you explore.Participant: Sign in support steer messaging. So I do sign in support is what I would click.Participant: Which login service do you need help with? And we want to learn more aboutParticipant: I mean, I I use id dot me so I'll click that.Moderator: Yeah. Go ahead.Participant: So obviously, if I needed an account, I could do that. But let's just say I need help with my account.Participant: And then obviously I can click, forgot password.Participant: duplicate, duplicate account, verify my identity, see more options. What are the options?Participant: Help with security options can't sign in.Participant: There's more options.Moderator: Yeah, it. Looks like it.Participant: Can't send my documents Id. Help center none of these.Participant: and I can ask a new question. All right.Moderator: Yeah, maybe maybe.Participant: It gave me. It gave me plenty of answers.Moderator: Right, but not the right one. Right? SoModerator: maybe maybe try rephrasing it in a different way.Participant: Okay.Participant: So you want me to just come up with something different, or or am I supposed to go through with that.Moderator: No, you can click whatever once again. Just, however, you feelModerator: there's no wrong or right answers. Just how, however, you feel, whatever your 1st instinct is.Participant: How can I? How can I sign the Va. Gave me options? I mean, there is no other workaround for that. You just gotta sign in that way.Participant: And then obviously, I can click contact vaParticipant: contact. Id me, I mean, I know that would be like the end of the line for someone like me right? There's obviously either have to log in.Participant: What if I just do this?Participant: How do I sign it to me and then back through it.Participant: See if it gives me the same stuff sign in support.Participant: Id meParticipant: Then just say help with my account, and then forgot my password.Participant: You can reset your password. Click forgot. Reset on the website.Participant: Alright?Participant: So yeah, it would. Just it would just bring me to where I needed to go, which is fine.Moderator: Okay.Participant: You want me to say yes? No.Participant: it did answer my question. Yes.Moderator: Yep.Participant: 5 stars.Moderator: All right, perfect. Let's go ahead. Then. I'm going to ask you some questions around this 1st interaction.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Question is, did this answer make sense to you?Participant: Yeah, yeah.Moderator: Okay was, do you believe all information was provided.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, and how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It was easy, in my opinion.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?Participant: No.Moderator: Alright great for my next task I would like you to type in. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: or I can just copy and paste it here in the window.Participant: Hmm.Moderator: Whatever is easiest for you.Participant: I need to help my dad log into what.Moderator: Yep, to get his benefits. Information.Participant: Oops.Participant: And wow! I can't spell benefits today.Moderator: But I always fat finger. I always fat finger something. SoModerator: all right, and once again go ahead and feel free to interact and speak out loud as you do so.Participant: Alright. So I needed to help my dad get his benefits. Information.Participant: Obviously I can sign in there's veteran benefits and be accredited. Representative.Participant: So if IParticipant: needed somebody, I'd probably say because I already kind of know what the benefits are. But I needed somebody to help me.Participant: Rather than sign in.Participant: So I mean I don't know. I I mean I could. I would pick between the 1st one and the 3rd one, just for the sake of.Moderator: June.Participant: What I'm trying to ask in that question, but I know I know what sign in support brings me to. So do you want me to try the 3rd one.Moderator: Yeah, click! Whatever whatever floats your boat, I guess.Participant: Yeah, alright. So that's claims agent.Participant: Yeah, that helps you file.Participant: So that wouldn't really help me. It'd probably lead me down a path that I didn't want.Participant: So I'm gonna say, no.Moderator: Right.Moderator: We've come to the end of this task. Then I'm going to ask some more questions. Same basic follow-up questions. Did this answer make sense to you?Participant: I would, I would say, I would say, probably no.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: Would you want more information provided.Participant: I probably would. Yes.Moderator: Okay, and how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: I think I would feel it was difficult if I wasParticipant: a 3rd party coming on behalf of somebody that would was part of the Va. Trying toParticipant: to get in or talk to somebody.Moderator: - absolutely okay.Moderator: And finally, did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: All right. Can you think of any other way to improve this interaction, or the answer for either of these 2 questions?Participant: The 1st question was fine. That gave you what you expected, and put you down the right path.Participant: But when you're trying, when you're a 3rd party, and you're trying to help someone else likeParticipant: the veteran that's trying that has a login or needs a login. The system obviously doesn't.Participant: doesn't realize or recognize that you are that 3rd party.Moderator: Right.Participant: So I mean, clearly the 3rd party would never have a login. They wouldn't create a login for that person.Participant: unless you know they needed to. Therefore, I think, like they would need much more like specialized navigatingParticipant: through the sort of like customer. Support. Something a bit more of a okay? Clearly, you're not the person that needs to log in.Moderator: Right.Participant: And you need to do something on their behalf. So it's it's gonna need a little bit more assistance.Participant: That's that's me. If I just I came here, and I had no idea what was going on.Moderator: No, that's that's wonderful feedback. Thank you.Moderator: All right. So now we're going to move on to our Poc number 2, I'm going to send you a linkModerator: in the chat once again, and for thisModerator: you have to. There's 2. There's 2 factor authentication. So what's what will happen is you'll click on the link. And it'll ask you to. Yeah, go ahead and put your email in there. And it's the one that you use to sign up. Yep.Moderator: And what happens is you'll be sent a code at that email address.Moderator: And.Participant: Yep.Moderator: Once you enter that code, then we can. We can progressModerator: all right, perfect. It's loading.Moderator: Now. Same thing. Go ahead and kind of familiarize yourself with the screen. Most of it's kind of the same. There may be some different messages, so go ahead, and whenever you're ready, let me know.Participant: Yep, Chatbot. Pre alpha, so generally looks the same. Clearly. Number 2.Participant: Welcome to va chat version. Don't enter personal information.Participant: and how can I help you today? It's a bit more receptive there, on just the whole, like it's ready to go.Moderator: Oh, okay, good, good feedback.Moderator: we're going to do the ask the same question that we did the 1st time. How can I sign into Va.Participant: Alrighty.Participant: They gotta scroll up a tad. Thanks for asking the question. Here's what I found how to verify your identity.Participant: What if I can't sign in to be, because my password doesn't work. How to create a login.Participant: how to verify my identity.Participant: Alright, yeah. And that's this seems like more typical where I just get the answers directly. I'm not sent downParticipant: a crazy list of continuation like a ladder ladder response system. It's just here's here's what you can do, and then otherwise rephrase it. So I mean.Participant: you give a thumbs up or down.Participant: Yeah, that answers my question.Moderator: Perfect.Moderator: all right, going to ask you the same series of questions, then did this answer make sense to you?Participant: Yes.Moderator: And do you feel that all information was provided.Participant: Yeah, from? Just looking at it. Okay.Moderator: And how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It was easy.Moderator: Okay? And did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay. Finally, then, what we're going to do for this version is, I want you to type the same question that we did last time I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: I included typos. Thank you for asking this question. Here's what I found. WhatParticipant: to do. If you haven't switched to login.gov, okay?Participant: Ds login. Faqs, okay?Participant: What if I can't access va.gov, because my password doesn't work and managing my profile.Participant: All right.Moderator: Okay, so again, does this answer make sense.Participant: It. It gave me better responses than the previous chat. Bot. Oh, definitely, yeah.Moderator: All right. Do you think all information was provided.Participant: Yeah, yeah, I would say, Yeah.Moderator: Alrighty.Moderator: And again, was it easy or difficult to find exactly what you needed.Participant: Thank you as right in the middle, becauseParticipant: once again, this is, it's not really.Participant: I mean, it's just giving you me places to go.Participant: And it's I have to still go deeper into those places, and I don't think it understandsParticipant: specifically like I'm the 3rd party.Moderator: Gotcha.Participant: So I mean those those have to be very specific instances which are common. But I mean, I'd probably go to the Faqs and then hopefully read through the FAQ. And list see something there that says I'm trying to help my parent or somebody log in what to do, orParticipant: because I'm not sure it's a password issue. I don't believe it's a you know, a a login.gov or an id dot me issue managing your va profile would kind ofParticipant: insinuate that I have it already.Participant: And then, if you know, if I just don't know where where to start with this.Participant: Then I would probably just look at the Faqs. That's for me.Moderator: Right.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay? And once again, I'm going to ask you, can you think of any way to improve this interaction or answer.Participant: If if there was justParticipant: something there that would link youParticipant: closer, or to like a human representative or something that's a bit more like once again. Clearly, I'm a 3rd party. Clearly, I don't even know where to start. If I have to go click in through, like, you know, 5 to 10 different links, and search through all this information to to figure outParticipant: my next step. I just feel like I'd be encumbered withParticipant: just getting lost on on the website.Participant: I've done it myself before.Participant: you know, I'll go into the website. And that just be, I feel like I'm clicking into the next into the next window, and I'm climbing this ladder of you know. It's kind of getting close to the answer, but it's just not the answer.Moderator: Got it. Okay.Moderator: it's good feedback. Thank you. So let's see if you scroll to the very top of this page, thenModerator: you will notice that there is a says component 3 in the gray header at the top. If you could click on component 3,Moderator: and once again you see.Participant: Yeah. Window there refreshed it. Yep.Moderator: Yep, and whenever you're ready, let's go ahead and do the same question, how can I sign into Va on this version of the chat box?Participant: How dare it make me wait!Moderator: Yeah, right.Participant: To sign in. You need to use login, Doc. Alright cool, I mean, that's just telling me you need to do this in order to sign in. So it gave me a direct like.Participant: I like that. And then it's giving me steps.Participant: Yeah, use your email password to sign in. You may be prompt to identify using. Yeah.Participant: you don't have a login. You can create one. Okay, perfectParticipant: major. Va, health care benefits. Only out more detail guys follow instructions how to create a login account. Verify your identity, Login name, if you have trouble signing. Oh, look at that!Participant: A telephone number.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: This one's probably the best answer so far, because now now it just it right there it ran through like the way my mind was working like the expectation was, here's a couple of things I could try doing my own and theParticipant: the step that I have to go through. But then, like clearly, if I'm I don't even know where to start, or I'm having an issue. Here's here's a direct line to kind of circumvent all of thoseParticipant: things, those walls. I'm gonna hit.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay.Moderator: So you you like this? Answer the best. Then.Participant: Yes.Moderator: And the answer makes the most sense.Participant: Yes, and because they even include the additional information like little FAQ links down below, I mean, that'sParticipant: that's just the way I think that's probably the best way you could lay it out.Moderator: Okay. Great how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: That was easy.Moderator: Easy, all right, and did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?Participant: No no.Moderator: Perfect. Then for the last time. Then I'm going to go ahead and have you type. In that second question I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: Let's see if I can avoid putting in the quotation. Look at that.Moderator: Oh, I spelled it wrong, too, but that's fine. I spelled information wrong.Participant: Doing.Moderator: I did I, when I think when I typed it in the chat window.Participant: Really, but.Moderator: I forgot the R.Participant: Bada bing!Participant: Thank God, I'm patient.Moderator: Right.Participant: If you need to help your dad log in. Wow. Okay, see?Participant: It's like it knows exactly when it's responding to. There.Participant: it's it's saying, the other 2 clearlyParticipant: couldn't grasp or you know, alter the the response text. This clearly feels more like a chat. GptParticipant: response where it says, you knowParticipant: you need to help your dad log in right off the rip. It knows what I'm trying to do.Moderator: Right.Participant: You're not court appointed guardian. Oh, even better. It's just literally going in explainingParticipant: other pieces that I'll probably need to know, especially which sibling I am.Participant: He needs to sign in his own account, using his login credentials. Yeah.Participant: perfect. Here's a telephone number. If you're legal or somebody different. Obviously, on Monday, through Friday times. PerfectParticipant: extra information to tell them who you are. So you don't getParticipant: duck at a wall. General help! Here's another perfect.Participant: I could choose between the 2 which 1 1 i need thereParticipant: and then, if I want to find in person, help cool, perfect, find locations. Page find locations. PageParticipant: I mean, everything else has a link.Participant: Why not that.Moderator: Why? Why doesn't that one sure.Participant: And thenParticipant: there's those typical links which is good to have in there regardless. Yeah, that was a good answer.Moderator: Perfect?Moderator: So does this answer make sense.Participant: Yes.Moderator: And would you want any more information provided.Participant: Probably not.Moderator: Okay. How easy or difficult was it for you to find what you need.Participant: Easy.Moderator: And did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Alright! Can you think a way to improve this interaction, or answer.Participant: Besides that link there, I mean, like anytime, it's trying to to give you an additional place to go that exists within like a URL, or something that I mean.Participant: it's always best to haveParticipant: just just like these questions down here, you know, you could just click right to it.Moderator: I agree.Participant: Yeah, I mean, other than that, this just feels like a a typical interaction with like Chat Gpt or Grok. And definitely response, the response definitelyParticipant: calls out, exactly what I'm trying to look for. And then, like tailors it slightly.Participant: Yeah, I feel like I'm in 2025. Now.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: So let me ask you this. There was at the beginning, as you noted a couple of times a little bit of a lag, a little bit of weight.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: So now, do you think that trade-off for the wait in time is worth it? For the more accurate answer.Participant: Of course, yeah, definitely.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: And did you notice any features in this version of the chat Bot especially, that helped and or possibly hindered you compared to the other 2.Participant: This one something that hindered me on this one.Participant: This this final one here seems to be the one you gotta go with no matter whatParticipant: I mean, like, I said, like in the beginning, with the whole waiting for typing thing. I mean, most peopleParticipant: understand that if there's a computer or AI helping you. I mean.Participant: the answer is less of like, it's not a human typing to you. It's clearly a bot or some form of AI so generating an answer would be better than describing as it's typing.Moderator: Hmm, okay.Participant: I mean, that's that's really reaching. But then again, I mean, at least, there's kind of like a a loading thing saying it's working so.Moderator: Got it all right.Moderator: So with that, we're going to enter. Then our post interview questions and I've got a series of questions here. I'm going to ask you about your interaction with all 3 bots today. So how did you feel while you were using the chat bots? Were there any points where you might have felt stuck, annoyed, or maybe even especially satisfied.Participant: I mean, like one and 2 clearly, were the the typical chat bots that even in my personal experience, whether I'm on like a different website.Participant: Cause you know, if you're you're shopping for something, or you need customer support at some specific company site, and you go to the chat bot 9 times out of 10. I'm not looking to really talk with the chat bot. I'm looking to get a direct representative linked up. SoParticipant: I I purposely avoid trying to talk with a chat bot with one and 2Participant: The 3rd one clearly is like AI and gives you a responseParticipant: even better response than any of the other ones. It's something you can like read and follow through with, and they give you all the answers so.Moderator: Right? Okay, perfectModerator: at any point. Did you feel confused or frustrated, or maybe overwhelmed by the responses from the Chatbot.Participant: like like. When we asked the second question all the time with the 1st 2, it was just like, Okay, I already know this information, or you know, you're really it's just sending me down this path where I need to go find all this extra stuff. Why am I using the chat. BotParticipant: I would, you know, not use the chat Bot. And I would just go straight on the website looking for like contact. Me, I would avoid it.Moderator: Right. Okay.Moderator: did the Chatbot ever give too much information at once? Or what do you think it was just right.Participant: The 3rd one was just right.Participant: The 1st and second were were okay. It was. It was good for what it was.Moderator: Right. Okay. Did you ever have to remember information from earlier in the conversation to complete a task.Participant: No.Moderator: Did you notice any major differences between the 3 different Chatbots.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: What would those major differences be? I think you kind of pointed out already.Participant: Yeah, the first.st The 1st 2 feel like I'm back in 2,000, and the 3rd one feels like I'm in 2025.Moderator: Okay, did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning.Participant: Up the disclaimer on the 3rd one. Yes.Moderator: Yeah. Okay, on the 3.rdParticipant: AndParticipant: the disclaimer on the 1st 2 was before you even started. It was just kind of like above the box.Participant: right right as long as I'mParticipant: I'm not. I'm not imagining those things.Moderator: You are. In fact, if you look at this one and you scroll up to the top, it's still there.Participant: Still there.Participant: Please don't enter personal information. Dropdown. Yep.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Think that's that's good to just have right there, ready to go where where your focus is. And clearly you can expand.Moderator: Were you concerned at all about sharing privacy or personal information?Participant: But no and it was pretty muchParticipant: easy it was there. It was just right in your face, and just said, just don't put any personal information in. I mean, if you do put it in, thenParticipant: where does it go?Participant: I don't know. Right.Participant: Check my spam folder. Everything else is in there where my number went.Moderator: Okay? Where the Chatbot answers the right length for you.Participant: Yes. Yeah.Moderator: Did you ever feel that you need any more or less detail?Moderator: And the 1st 2 I did. Yeah, I wanted more.Moderator: One and more. Okay, was the chat. Bot. What you expected.Participant: Yes!Moderator: In what ways did it meet or differ from your expectations?Participant: The 3rd one is what I expect a chat bot to be. It's more of a standard.Moderator: The 1st 2.Participant: Purchase.Participant: You know I I've lived through it so.Moderator: Right.Participant: I don't know. We could take those, and we can like throw them in the garbage or something now, because we don't.Moderator: Oh, jeez.Participant: No sense to the devs.Moderator: Oh, no, absolutely. Would you say that this is similar or different to other chat bots that you've used.Participant: Sim, similar.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: If the chat Bot didn't answer your question, what did you do next? If you felt stuck.Participant: I kind of revert back to the the old way of things, which is alright. I would leave focus from the Chatbot completely, and I would just go on the website, either scroll the way to the bottom or look for a direct number at the top and the banner. Usually, that's what I do on almost any website like about contact us, or Link, or something like that.Moderator: Right? Okay?Moderator: And do you feel strongly about one version over the other? And why.Participant: 3.rd One clearly feels like it's AI poweredParticipant: and it's the best one. The other 2.Participant: They just feel more hard coded and unable toParticipant: you know, dynamically respond. So you're always stuck withParticipant: semi sort of close to answers that you're looking for. ButParticipant: unless it's just a very simple question.Participant: Usually they're not.Moderator: Got it. Okay, good.Moderator: And did you notice anything specific that you would change or correct at all with the user experience.Participant: No, it's it's pretty pretty muchParticipant: the way supposed to be, I guess, at least in in the way that I use use a chat. Bot!Moderator: All right. So any other comments or suggestions, or any questions for me.Participant: I mean, is, is this essentially going forward? What we're trying to use like an AI empowered Chatbot.Moderator: These are 3 of the proofs of concept that we're working on. And the reason that we're talking to veterans like you is to decide which path to pursue. So we're kind of using your feedback to decide which path of development that we're going to continue to work on. So obviously, it looks like your votes for number 3, andModerator: based off of other feedbacks from other veterans as well. We'll take that into consideration to, you know. Move along with the next steps. In the process.Participant: Yeah, it was funny, because, I was part of a previous testing for the when we were looking at theParticipant: the the Va app, and I was, you know, looking in there and then, and the last the last one that I said cause we were looking at it every time you open up the app it didn't.Participant: How do what do you call it like? You didn't hide your information? I don't know if you're familiar with that, but you open it up, and it would say you're rated 100, and it would put a dollar amount there, and anybody that had like could look at your phone, could see what you're looking at. And I'm like, How come you guys don't have that hidden. And then obviously, after that, and they they confirmed that that was some of the concerns.Participant: Within within like 6 months, maybe maybe or so, maybe a little longer. Then it finally came through. And then I watch all the people online start saying, Oh, my God, what is all this? I'm like. Finally, I'm like, Yeah, it's like your bank account, like, you know, hide those things. So I mean, it'd be pretty cool.Participant: if you guys do go with number 3. Not that I use the chat bot personally, butParticipant: in my opinion. I think you're wasting your time on one and 2, 100. If if that's an active project I don't think it is a month the way I'm like looking at it.Participant: AI AI style responses.Participant: There's so many people that use chat. Gpt grok, and it's only growing. I use it myself for a bunch of different things.Participant: That's the style that I think is is the new standard of any sort of communication. Back and forth.Moderator: Absolutely well. We appreciate that feedback, and thanks for helping with previous studies, too. And, as you can see, we do take that feedback under consideration, and, as you've like, you said, witnessed yourself, it does make a difference. So that's it for me. We wanted toModerator: just tell you that we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is very helpful as we continue to work on the va.gov website to make sure, you know that those things do work for veterans. And lastly, Paragene will send you a thank you. Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans to let them know that they can have a chance to participate in any future studies again. Thanks so much for your time today and enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: Thank you. Appreciate it. Guys have a good day.Moderator: Take care, have a good one.
