Participant: Okay.


Moderator: Do you believe that answer made sense to you?


Participant: Yes, it did cause it. It wanted to know that I reached what I was looking for, and it did.


Moderator: Okay, and how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.


Participant: That power is easy.


Moderator: That part was easy. Okay, you do think that all information was provided.

Participant: yeah. It is insta caution.


Moderator: Okay. Good.


Participant: So then I'm gonna ask the same set of follow up questions. Does this answer make sense to you


Participant: doesn't make sense, because let me know where to go. To get his benefits until you just click on. Get started to va


Participant: pain. Okay.


Moderator: Would you want any more information provided.


Participant: Only other reason I'm I'm I agree with this because by me being a veteran.


Participant: and I know what I'm looking for. But if someone else wasn't looking for it.


Participant: I don't know if they get a my understanding of this.


Moderator: Got it.


Participant: That's the only problem.


Moderator: Right. So you think, since you have the experience of working with it before that, that you have that context sounds like.


Moderator: So how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.


Participant: It was easy for me.


Moderator: Okay, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?


Participant: No.


Moderator: Okay, good.


Moderator: I've got another link here that I'm going to send you, and we're going to check out another version of our bot. So let me get that for you. Here.


Participant: Okay, close this one out.


Moderator: Yeah, you can close this one out.


Moderator: And if you go back to the chat and look, there's another link that I sent you.


Moderator: and they're going to have you do the same thing. Click on that link and share your screen, and we'll walk through the steps on this one as well.


Participant: I also asked for email.


Moderator: Yep, this is gonna ask for 2 factor authentication. And


Moderator: we ask that you use the email that you use to sign up with Perigan.


Moderator: It'll it'll send you a little code.


Participant: Next week, oh.


Moderator: Yep, you got it.


Moderator: and then whenever you get that screen loaded, if you would once again share your screen so we can take a look and see exactly what you see.


Moderator: All right. Looks like it's loading here. Perfect.


Moderator: What I'm going to do then, is once again


Moderator: take your time to familiarize yourself with the screen. And when you're ready in the prompt area.


Moderator: type, the question, how can I sign into Va?


Moderator: And just as before, take a few minutes to respond. Interact with the response that the chat Bot gives. You feel free to speak out loud. Your thoughts and actions.


Participant: Thanks for asking question, what can I found? What if I


Participant: hey, send via? Because my password doesn't work?


Participant: Where was my portion?


Moderator: Yeah? Your question.


Participant: Oh, how can I sign into Va.


Moderator: Yeah.


Participant: How do we have to create login?


Participant: Oh, the question you had to answer the question, even though it gave you multiple questions.


Moderator: Okay. So you think the answer did make sense, then.


Participant: Because it cause? I asked, How can I sign in the Va. I asked about these other things? I only asked how to sign in, and the main one was how to create a login.


Moderator: Right.


Moderator: So then it didn't answer. Your question is what you're saying.


Participant: Not good.


Moderator: Okay, good.


Moderator: So you would say that not all information was provided. Then.


Participant: Yes.


Moderator: Okay, so easy or difficult to find what you needed.


Participant: Know, to create a login, but to anybody else probably be difficult.


Moderator: Did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.


Participant: No.


Moderator: Okay.


Moderator: then, what I'm going to have you do next is just like, last time I want you to type, I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information


Moderator: all right.


Moderator: So go ahead once again and.


Participant: For choices. Imagine va profile. Do you need to switch to the end?


Participant: Just not how? That's the question. I need help


Participant: to help my dad get this behavior? This did not answer none. My question at all.


Moderator: Good. Okay? So the answer, then you said, did not make sense.


Participant: No.


Moderator: And I'm guessing you would want more information, provided you don't.


Participant: I guess.


Moderator: Okay. And was it easy or difficult to find what you needed.


Participant: Dude, difficult.


Moderator: Difficult. Okay?


Moderator: And did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.


Participant: No.


Moderator: Okay?


Moderator: So for this version of the chat Bot, can you think of any way to improve this interaction? Or the answers.


Participant: Oh, that's my question.


Participant: Well, none of these questions really answered the question. None of these choices didn't answer the question.


Moderator: Okay, good, perfect.


Moderator: Let's move on. Then. If you scroll up to the top of this screen on the left hand side


Moderator: there, you can see it says, component 3. Could you click on that link that says, component 3? There you go.


Moderator: So this is our


Moderator: our Va Chatbot proof of concept 3. Once again I want you to familiarize with yourself at the screen, and whenever you're ready


Moderator: once again in the prompt window, please. Type, how can I sign into Va.


Participant: It's titled where?


Participant: So these are different prompts to use this to get into the Va. I mean.


Moderator: All 3 of these, even though the windows kind of look the same, they're all different.


Participant: Soon.


Moderator: Brains kind of working in the back end.


Participant: Okay, this one I kind of like this one said to sign the va.com, you log in. I like this one.


Moderator: Like this one.


Participant: Cause. I tell you how to log in.


Moderator: Right? Yeah. It gives you kind of the step by step.


Moderator: Okay.


Participant: And those who don't know how to use it. This is more easy for them to to go to step by step, how to log in.


Moderator: Good good. So you think for 1st time users. This information kind of seems more complete is what you're.


Participant: Yes.


Moderator: If you want to scroll down, and if you'll look here at this one, this one has a feedback mechanism sort of similar to the last one. So go ahead and click yes or no on that. There we go.


Moderator: And okay. So let's go ahead. And I'm going to ask you the same set of follow-up questions? Did this answer make sense.


Participant: Yeah, this makes very good sense.


Moderator: Very good sense. Okay, you feel that all information was provided.


Participant: You very much, provided.


Moderator: Good and how easy or difficult was it for for you to find what you needed.

Moderator: Very easy, good, good! And did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?


Participant: No.


Moderator: All right. Good.


Moderator: Finally, then, what I'm going to have you do is type our other question into that prompt window. I need to help my dad


Moderator: log in to get his benefits.


Moderator: Then once again, take a few minutes to interact with the response.


Moderator: Once you get that question in.


Moderator: I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.


Participant: Who need the help I need to help. My I don't mind. Let me.


Moderator: Yep, there you go. Need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information perfect.


Participant: Need to help my dad to get his Va. Benefit or Va. Information for.


Moderator: Yep, benefit information, but you can leave it without information, and we'll see what happens.


Participant: Hold on back. What is that?


Participant: Currently the Va. Is going to work in a solution to allow court appointed guardian to sign them.


Participant: Let me think last year, just to help me at all.


Participant: Currently the means working on solution to allow court appointed guardian to sign in


Participant: to match. V. 8. Well, yeah.


Participant: Oh, I don't know.

Participant: shouldn't you have a modality awesome.


Participant: So they didn't know that they can't log in. They can't get his information.


Participant: But if you trying to help your your parent.


Participant: you'd be using their information anywhere.


Moderator: Right?


Moderator: Yeah, I think it says, for now you may need to contact Va directly.


Moderator: Or, yeah, it looks like it's giving you more, more different options down there. Okay.


Moderator: all right, all right. Well, let's go ahead, then, and let me answer. Ask you some. Follow up questions here. Do you believe that this answer made sense.


Participant: Oh no!


Moderator: You don't know. Okay, not sure. All right.


Moderator: So do you think you would need more information provided here.


Participant: How do you know this is a brain fall right here? Because.


Moderator: Hmm.


Participant: To answer the question.


Participant: So I I but I look at down here. So I show you how to create. So it it did answer the question. It wasn't that difficult because I didn't. I didn't stroll down.


Moderator: Okay.


Participant: I'll just scroll down.


Moderator: Got it, and so


Moderator: Do you think it was easy or difficult to find what you needed?


Participant: It was easy now that I'll stroll down and see what I'm looking for.


Moderator: Got it.


Moderator: Did you feel the information was overwhelming or hard to process.


Participant: It was hard process. Yes, it was hard to process.


Moderator: Got it. Yeah.


Moderator: okay. And can you think of any way to improve this interaction or answer for this version of the chat? Bot.


Participant: No cause it. It gives you the information at the bottom. When you scroll down and see, show you how to create so.


Moderator: Okay. Good.


Participant: Move.


Moderator: That completes the task portion of this process. Then I'm gonna go ahead and ask you a couple of follow up questions. This should take just about 5Êmin, and we're we're almost done so.


Moderator: Let me ask you, while you're using the chat. Bot, how did you feel? Were there any points where you might have felt stuck


Moderator: annoyed, or on the opposite end, may be especially satisfied.


Participant: No, my my question is so they don't have different component


Participant: components for you to chat or just gonna be one chat box.


Moderator: So what we have are 3 different versions right now.


Moderator: Okay.


Moderator: where we have. If you could tell, there was just a little bit different interactions between the 3 of them, the 1st ones. You had some buttons to click, that kind of filtered through your answers a little bit differently. And this component 2 and 3 are using different


Moderator: different kind of I guess you could think of it as mechanisms on the back end to help give you your answers. So what we're doing is we're talking to veterans to see where there might be pain points or see which ones that they prefer, so that we can more.


Moderator: I guess, work on those versions of the chat bot to better filter them and make them more useful for our users, which is, which is you guys, the veterans.


Participant: Okay, probably. Welcome.


Participant: So which version do I like the best.


Moderator: My question was while you were using it, did you ever feel stuck or annoyed, or maybe especially satisfied.


Moderator: just trying to get your feelings while you were using it.


Participant: No, I was satisfied using them because I know how to use. So it was no problem.


Moderator: Got it. Okay, at any point. Did you feel confused or frustrated, or maybe overwhelmed by the response.


Participant: We're number 3. I was kind of confused with Number 3. I was.


Moderator: Right.


Moderator: Okay, were this chat bots responses easy to understand? Or were you overwhelmed at any point.


Participant: Here's easy to understand. Understand, as long as you know what you're looking for.


Moderator: Right.


Moderator: Okay, did the chat Bot ever give you too much information at all? Or was it just right.


Participant: It was in between too much or not enough.


Moderator: Right? Okay, did you notice any major difference between the 3 chat bots.


Participant: Yes, I know the difference.


Moderator: Okay.


Moderator: did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning about personal information? And it did it? Did that affect how you use the Chatbot.


Participant: No, I didn't affect how to use this chat box.


Moderator: Okay, were you concerned about sharing privacy or personal information?


Participant: No, it wasn't


Moderator: Okay.


Moderator: were, the Chatbot answers the right length for you, or did you ever want more or less details.


Participant: Probably less detail.


Moderator: Okay?


Moderator: So comparing your use with other chat bots, was this, expect what you expected? And did it meet or differ your expectations from using other chat bots.


Participant: You trying to compare to all 3 of them.


Moderator: What I mean is compared to other ones that you've used, not these ones that we use today.


Participant: What they ought to sing.


Moderator: They're all the same. Okay,


Moderator: So did the chat. If the chat bot didn't ask your question, answer your question. What did you do next. If you felt stuck.


Participant: Answer the question a different way.


Moderator: Right? Yeah. You type that one again, I remember.


Moderator: And let me ask you this, did you feel strongly about one of these proof of concept chat bots over the other. In other words, did you think that one was better than the other ones?


Participant: Yes, I do.


Moderator: Okay, which one is that? And why?


Participant: Number 2 was better because it had directly what you needed.


Moderator: Okay.


Participant: Cause number yeah. Number 2 is, I like number 2 better.


Moderator: You like number 2, all right.


Moderator: And do you notice anything specific that you would correct or change? That would improve the user experience.


Participant: No.


Moderator: Okay?


Moderator: And


Moderator: I guess that that brings us to the end. Then do you have any other comments or suggestions, or any questions for me at all?


Participant: No, no question. So this is, this is just a test how to use the chat box. Correct.


Moderator: Yeah, basically, what we're doing is giving you tasks and based on the answers that you get in your interactions. We will then kind of go back to our


Moderator: our group, our group and say, Hey, here's our findings. Users had problems with this. They had problems with this. They like this. They didn't like this.


Participant: Yeah.


Moderator: Kind of work on it. A little bit more. We'll put together like another version of this, and we'll just continue to kind of hone it down and make it better for for the users, for our veterans.


Participant: Okay. But chat 2 is I. I like it because it you step by step.


Participant: So yeah, just for that question, though.


Moderator: Right? Right? Right? Right? Right?
