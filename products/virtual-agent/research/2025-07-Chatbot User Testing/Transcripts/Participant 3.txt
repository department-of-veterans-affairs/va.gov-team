Participant 3 Ð July 22, 2025 Ð 3 PM ESTModerator: All right. So I've gone ahead.Moderator: and I've got our recording. And our transcription has started now. So just to confirm, you have given permission for us to record this.Participant: Yes, I have.Moderator: Perfect. Okay? So let's move on to our pre-test questions. Got a couple questions before we startModerator: on our tasks and question partModerator: 1st question is, are you using any assistive technology like a screen? Reader, for this task.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, and what would that be? It is a screen, reader.Participant: Yes, jaws.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And can you tell me what device operating system and browser that you're using for this user testing.Participant: This is a desktop computer, and the they sell a windows. PC.Moderator: Okay.Participant: And I will be using Google chrome.Moderator: Google Chrome perfect?Moderator: And the last question is, How familiar are you with chat bots? Have you used any chat bots in the past?Participant: If I have, it's probably been on my phone.Moderator: Okay. Do you know which ones you have used like the names of them? Specifically.Participant: No, okay.Participant: no problem. I mean, if you probably gave me like a like a selection of them, I probably oh, yeah, I've used it, but not off the top of my head.Moderator: Gotcha, so none, none that you can give name to. So let's just break it down. So how many times would you say you've used chatbots in the last month.Participant: Oh, not often. I usually try to do something without a chat. Bot!Moderator: So in the set last 6 months, would you say you used one.Participant: Yeah, I've used it. Yeah.Moderator: Okay, perfect. Then let's go ahead.Moderator: And I'm gonna send you in our chat. If you can access the chat in our meeting, I'm gonna send you a linkModerator: so that you can access our 1st chat. Bot. SoModerator: if you can get to the chat and click that linkModerator: we can load the 1stModerator: chatbot up, and then, whenever you've got that up, if you could share your screen with me, and that way I can follow along and see exactly what you see.Moderator: if it helps at all. In the menu of the Zoom Meeting.Moderator: Chat is one of the itemsModerator: on the main menu, I believe, for for zoom for the Zoom Meeting.Participant: I'm trying to figure out how to get into it.Moderator: From the main menu. If you click, are are able to click, view and then show chat, or it looks like probably shift H might be the shortcut key to it.Moderator: You see, I'm sorry. Alt H. Not not shift and be altModerator: opens the in meeting chat panel. My apologies. I'm an apple user. So I had to look that one up.Participant: No worries.Participant: Okay. So I did have it open.Participant: What?Participant: Oh.Moderator: I mean, put it in there again. See if.Participant: I'm not seeing your messages. This is showing me where I can send a message.Moderator: Hmm, okay, and that's in the chat for this Zoom Meeting.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay, would it be easier to maybe email you that link.Participant: Yeah, I don't. I don't see anything in the chat. I don't know if if I'm missing something. Do you have anybody on here who uses a screen? Reader.Moderator: I do not. Not that I know of. Let me ask the chat, and let's take a look and seeModerator: see if I've got anyone that's familiar.Participant: Because they usually bring somebody on here, but I guess not.Moderator: Okay. So the observer, we have one observer who is familiar with screen readers, but not with jaws. Specifically.Participant: Got it. Yeah. So I heard that.Moderator: Oh, okay.Participant: It reads it out to me, but I can't see it.Moderator: Okay. So when I'm typing the link, it doesn't.Moderator: Doesn't say it. Huh? Let's see if I can do this.Moderator: Let me try this instead.Participant: Somebody just said they can look it up.Moderator: Yep, I'm gonna type in here is the link.Moderator: and in the link is a is a hyperlink. So you should be able to click the word link.Participant: Oh, I found it!Moderator: Found it. Okay. Good.Participant: Bank?Participant: Where did I go?Moderator: Lost! Lost the link.Participant: Huh!Moderator: You lost the link.Participant: I lost Eric. I lost all theParticipant: stuff that was in the chat. I had opened it up, but now I can't get.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Hold on!Observer: Can you try Shift V. It should take you to each linkObserver: hopefully, and then you can navigate to the oneObserver: for Chatbot or for virtual agent.Moderator: Thank you for that.Participant: Shift. V is all all it's just saying is V like a capital V.Participant: Is it another control like control or alt.Observer: Let's see, give me a second. I wish I had a windows machine there.Participant: Oh, oh, no! Hot V is my video.Participant: So that's not it.Observer: Can you try? Insert in F 7.Participant: Okay.Observer: Does that list? All the links on the page.Participant: In the are you?Participant: Are you guys using a regular keyboard.Observer: Yes.Participant: In that block of 6 buttons which button is insert.Observer: Insert is let me see, because I don't, I think insert is specific to Mac.Observer: or sorry to windows. Give me a second.Moderator: It says if you're using a desktop layout, the insert key is typically the jaws key.Moderator: So jaws key plus f 7.Participant: Yeah. But I think there's anotherParticipant: like a button that actually reads out insert. And it's in that block of 6 where it says, like, home.Moderator: Yep.Participant: And.Moderator: Caps lock the caps lock is the default jaws, key.Participant: Upper left.Moderator: But some keys still require the insert key, so maybe the caps locks key plus F 7.Observer: That would make sense.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Somebody said the upper left, but that one didn't work, though.Moderator: The the caps lock doesn't work either.Moderator: No, I was saying. Somebody said. The upper left key started as 6.Participant: Keys that I'm talking about.Participant: You know what it does like the the directional arrows like that, the the 6 keys that are above that. That's the keys that I'm talking about.Participant: I've never used the caps lock key.Moderator: So the caps, locks. Key is.Participant: I know what I said. I'm just saying I've never used it for anything.Moderator: Got it.Participant: Let me see.Participant: Yeah, no, I'm also turned it on.Moderator: I'm also seeing that just typing the letter U should jump to the next link that has not been visited.Participant: No, it's like a it's not working. For some reason. I don't think that's a command key that works in Zoom.Moderator: In zoom right.Observer: Hmm.Participant: It usually works on like emails and stuff like that.Moderator: Gotcha, would it? Would it be easier to email you that link.Participant: Yeah, you can. You can email it to me. Send it to my outlook.Participant: Sure. Let me make sure.Participant: Key one dot Amy at Outlook.Moderator: All right. Let me send it real quick.Participant: Yeah, no worries.Participant: We try guys, we try.Moderator: Oh, it's all good.Participant: It was a great team effort.Moderator: And that's KIJU a n dot a MEY at.Participant: Correct.Participant: Yes, that's it.Moderator: okay.com. Okay.Participant: I'm gonna hop over there to stop.Moderator: And I've got 2 links. So I'm gonna save us some time. And I'm gonna send them both. I'm gonna send.Participant: Okay.Moderator: One that is gonna be called link one.Moderator: And then there's the other one that will be called Link 2, and I'll just list them as that in the, in the email.Participant: Subject, excuse me.Moderator: The subject will be va testing.Participant: Oh, okay.Moderator: Does that work.Participant: Yeah, that's fine. I I thought you were gonna list that as the subject.Moderator: Got it!Participant: Yeah. No worries.Moderator: Yep, just send it. It's called Va user testing sent to yourModerator: The q 1 dot Amy ad@outlook.com.Participant: Come on, wake up, outlook!Participant: There we go!Participant: There we go. Luke is right.Moderator: Me!Participant: Yep, I found itParticipant: like one.Participant: Okay. And then, after I open that link, you said you wanted me to share my page right.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Okay, let me schedule.Participant: Okay?Moderator: Like in zoom to share its alt shift. And S.Moderator: There we go.Moderator: Got it up perfect.Participant: Okay.Participant: here we go.Moderator: So now, what I'd like you to do is just take your time.Moderator: Familiar familiarize yourself with this version of the chat Bot, and whenever you're ready in the prompt window.Moderator: If you could type in, how can I sign into Va.Participant: Okay.Moderator: And as you're doing this, feel free to speak out loud your thoughts and your actions as you explore through the chat. Bot.Participant: You, said the Chatbot. Not the search bar.Moderator: Correct. Yeah, keep going. I can see. Looks like you're tabbing through the different elements on the screen. And you're on. The menu. Looks like about Va find a Va location.Moderator: Yet another menu looks like you had to.Moderator: There you go now. You're the links inside of that.Participant: There it is right there, or link to the Vh.Moderator: That's that's the final leg of the of the the breadcrumb. So that's where we're at now. That's they'll they'll basically reload the page if you hit it, so keep going.Participant: Interesting. Hold on.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Cause. It says same page, link.Moderator: Yep, it's the same page like.Participant: Va Chatbot is what it says to me.Participant: That's why I was confused about it.Moderator: Correct. Yeah.Participant: Okay. Now, heading level one Va. Chatbot.Participant: Use the chat. Bot.Participant: Alright.Moderator: These are looks like some links. Yep, contact us, online.Participant: Hmm!Participant: Excuse me.Moderator: No problems.Participant: Oh!Moderator: There. Yeah, there's how to use a chatbot with screen. Reader, yeah.Participant: Interesting.Moderator: And now you're in the window for the chat. Bot.Moderator: Okay, this should be the button that you click. And now you started the session.Moderator: Now, whenever you're ready, go ahead, and in theModerator: prompt window, please. Type in. How can I sign into Va.Moderator: - yeah, it looks like they've you've jumped down to the very bottom.Participant: Yeah, I don't. Yeah. I was just thinking that same thing.Participant: Hey, Cap?Moderator: You're going through all the links at the bottom now.Participant: So I need to go back up.Moderator: Yeah, I would keep going.Moderator: Yeah, you haven't. You haven't gone through these before. So sure how you gotModerator: okay? I defeated. Oh, there it is.Participant: Okay, there we go.Participant: Alright. What was the question? I'm sorry.Moderator: Yeah, no problem. How can I sign into? Va.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Okay, now take your time and interact with this and go feel free to clickModerator: on the answer that you think is most appropriate.Moderator: And it's put you down in the links again.Participant: The heck.Participant: Where do I need to be.Moderator: Yeah, it you should have it should have put you back into the the area with the question. So I guess, keep tabbing, and I'll I'll let you know when you're in the right area.Participant: Keep going down!Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: back up. Yeah.Moderator: Still, there still in the links, you're almost to the bottom.Participant: What the heck.Moderator: Okay, there, now, you're back to the back into the main. Why don't you go ahead and tab through here? Let's maybe we should visit thatModerator: link that says how to use the chat bot with a screen. Reader, maybe that will help us out.Moderator: So keep going down.Moderator: Okay, almost there.Moderator: Next one.Moderator: Yeah. So if you click that, there you go.Participant: Hmm shift plus tab.Moderator: Shift plus tab to go back to the messages.Moderator: Then it looks like you use the arrow keys to go up and down to focus the message.Participant: And that's what I was using. And I think that's why I jumped like that.Moderator: Okay.Participant: So instead of using shift plus tab.Participant: Oh, what?Participant: Oh, press, enter to focus, only press. Enter.Participant: Okay, shift plus tab.Participant: Okay.Moderator: All right. So that helped us out a little bit.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: So if you can get back into the chat window.Moderator: you are. Yep, you're there now.Moderator: You're at the the heading of the chat window.Participant: What is this? He? What is he talking about?Moderator: I don't know what it where it's at. It's it's there's it's just in white space on my end. So I'm not sure.Participant: Hey, yeah, basically what it is for me, too, because it's like saying, just like, Shift key tab key article. That's literally all it's saying, it's not even giving me headings or nothing.Moderator: We? What if we try that shift, tab and see if it'll get its back into it?Participant: Let me see here.Participant: what did that do?Moderator: Someone says, move between the chat windows, tab key and sh and shift cab teamModerator: key. So it's given. There's a little keyboard controls that it's giving and says, move between items in the chat window, tab keyModerator: shift plus tab key and then do action entry or push enter basically.Participant: Correct.Moderator: So.Observer: You can press escape, to leave that window or use the arrow keys to navigate within the keyboard controls.Moderator: Here we go!Participant: Her voice almost sounds like a computer.Participant: Okay, so what would you like me to do from here?Moderator: Yeah. Why don't you try hitting escape? See? If.Participant: Alright! Let's see.Moderator: Lazy out there.Observer: Alright! There we go now, so we're backObserver: now. Sorry you can use the arrow keysObserver: to look, or between the chats, so you could see previous messages. If you pick, go to the up arrow and lower messages if you go down. But you could also press Tab to focus on the buttons.Moderator: There we go!Participant: Okay.Moderator: So this is the question that the last looks like the lastModerator: phrasing that you got from the chat. Bot.Moderator: Then if you hit the down arrows. I believe it should take you to the items.Observer: Try tab. Now.Moderator: There we go!Observer: And you could press. Go through each button.Observer: and you could, so you'll hear what each one is, and then you can select oneObserver: that you would like to open up.Participant: Okay.Observer: You can navigate back to the messages window and ask another message. If that'sObserver: how you think you would use it.Moderator: Yep, there's 3 link options here. And you, yeah, basically like.Moderator: they said that you can either select one of these options or navigate to theModerator: prompt window and type. Another question.Participant: So that would be what I would select.Moderator: Okay, go ahead and hit. Enter, then.Participant: This thing was messing me up so badly, I almost forgot what the question was.Moderator: Right? Yeah, yeah, just to give you some context, how can I sign into Va.Participant: Yeah, yeah.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Okay. So I'm in some text field. I don't know what it is.Moderator: Yep.Moderator: So this is where I believe, and help me if I'm not wrong. Shift Tab, to go back to the question.Moderator: There we go.Moderator: and then use your arrow keys to navigate through these buttons.Participant: Are you needing me to log in, or something?Moderator: Yeah, whichever one you think would be the best option. The question again is, how can I sign into Va.Participant: Wait. No, I'm saying, do you actually need want me to.Moderator: No, no, no, you don't actually have.Participant: Yeah, that's what I was at.Moderator: Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope.Moderator: just basically, how would you? How would you get to the point that you need to log in? Yeah.Participant: I guess what my question is. What am I looking for here?Moderator: Just the way to answer your question of how can I send it? Sign into the Va.Participant: Oh, I mean I could use any of these login features.Moderator: Exactly so, whichever one you are most familiar with or comfortable with.Moderator: and then I think, shift Tab here will take you back to those options.Moderator: And then you're you're getting. I just want just to be clear. You are getting theModerator: names of these buttons as they appear to you via your screen, reader, correct?Moderator: Yes, okay.Moderator: So you are. You are hearing it. Say, help with my account.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: And then if you push down, then it says.Participant: Create a new account.Moderator: Okay, perfect. Just wanted just wanted to make sure, because I can't hear it on my end.Participant: Yeah, no, I I have my headphones plugged in.Moderator: Got it. Okay? So then again, go ahead and interact on this one.Moderator: which, with whichever one you think is appropriate.Moderator: And I think if you hit shift tab one more time, let's see if that we'll get you.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: It said chat history when I did it that time.Moderator: Yep. So I just wanna make sure you're getting the the prompt from our chat. BotModerator: can you use the arrow to to go up.Moderator: Did it tell you anything? No.Participant: Say again.Moderator: Did it? Did it give you any response? There is it, is it? I just wanna make sure it's giving.Participant: Yeah. Right now, is that just told me when I actually sent the the question, or.Moderator: Hmm, okay. So you can hear the.Participant: Is July 20. Second, give me the time and everything.Moderator: Gotcha. Okay, I just wanted to make sure that you had context for what? The answer that the chat bot was giving you back.Moderator: So yeah, whenever you're ready, go ahead, then, andModerator: select which one you think would be the most appropriate from the links.Moderator: and I think you would just tab then next to get into those back into those.Moderator: Yep, there we are.Participant: A little funky.Moderator: Yeah, no, it is. Yeah.Participant: He was like trying to remember that.Participant: Is gonna be a I don't know. I don't know how to explain it right now.Moderator: No, absolutely. You're not. You're not used to it at all. So.Participant: I'm used to just using the arrows, you know, and usually like, if I'm tabbing, is to get out of something not to get in.Participant: You know, and the shift tab is usually to go backwards.Moderator: Right.Participant: For certain things like when I'm in zoom. If I'm in zoom, I'm using shift tab to go backwardsParticipant: in zoom, and then, if I'm I can't even use the arrows on zoom.Moderator: I see.Participant: Yeah. So like, I have to remember what everything is used for in different. I guess you say platforms.Moderator: Right, exactly.Participant: So.Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: alright. So if you need to sign in again, how can I sign into Va. If if any of these makes any sense go ahead and select them and continue on, and let's seeModerator: if we can get you signed in.Participant: So this just says back, create a new account and help with my account.Moderator: Right. So are you saying you don't see a way to sign into Va. From these 3 options.Participant: I don't unless yeah.Moderator: No, no, that's that's exactlyModerator: right? So that let's go ahead and end right here for this question. And I've got I got some questions for you as follow-ups to that task. SoModerator: does this answer make sense to you?Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Participant: I guess.Moderator: Yeah, no, not at all.Moderator: Yeah. So next question is, was all information provided.Participant: I would say no. Then.Moderator: Yeah, perfect.Moderator: How easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It. It was not that easy.Moderator: Rather difficult. No problem did the information seem overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: The information. Not so much, I mean just the navigation more so.Moderator: Navigation. Okay, perfect.Moderator: What I'm going to do then, is prompt youModerator: to go. I think you just tab now to the next window, which is the text prompt. And I'm gonna have you enter in a sentence for me if you would.Moderator: And I like you to type in. I need to help my dadModerator: log in to find his benefits. Information.Participant: Benefits, information.Moderator: You got it information.Moderator: and then, if I'm not mistaken, then a shift tab, then will take you back after you hit. Enter.Moderator: see it.Moderator: There we go. Looks like it's sending it off.Moderator: and then I think Shift Tab should take you back.Participant: And then what?Moderator: And then another shift. Tab will tell you what the chat Bot said.Participant: He said, a what.Moderator: Another shift tab. So if you do another shift tabModerator: there now, you can see it should say, select from the following topics, or try rephrasing your question.Moderator: and then Tab will give you those options.Participant: Still hit tab now.Moderator: Yep. Now hit tab. Yep.Participant: That's so weird.Moderator: Yeah, I I am learning with you, Kiwon. I'm wondering when.Participant: So let's see veterans benefits, and then manage benefits, Anita.Participant: The help I need to help my dad.Moderator: Log in to find benefits. Information you got it.Participant: So that would be right here, manage benefits online.Moderator: Okay, go ahead and select that one.Moderator: And now we're gonna have to do that shift. Tab twice.Moderator: Do it one more time and then, now use your arrow key to go up and read your answers.Moderator: Yeah, you should be. You should have a big, long line of text that starts with. If you're signed up for the Va. Health, and in inside of it there are a number of differentModerator: links. Are you seeing that? Or.Participant: I didn't even I didn't even see the 1st one you said you signed up for the Vl. I didn't even see that.Moderator: Okay. Can you push up on your arrow keys to see if that will.Participant: Are you seeing it? Go up.Moderator: I'm seeing a little red box move. Yeah, the little tab box move. Yep, keep.Moderator: Yep. Keep going.Moderator: I think this one that said check your claim status. Yeah, keep going. You can check.Moderator: Yep, 3 more.Moderator: There.Participant: Yeah, that's the if you sign up.Moderator: Yeah, this, this is the top of of this the answer.Participant: Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm yeah, that I'm there. Now then.Moderator: Yeah. Now you have to use your arrows to go down to the links through the links to kind of navigate down.Moderator: So you gotta yeah, there you go. So that's that one doesn't make sense. Well, it could make sense. It depends on refill your prescription.Participant: Refill.Moderator: Yeah. Send mess. Send a secure message.Participant: Message.Moderator: Yep.Moderator: So again, going through these pick, whichever one you think is the most appropriate.Participant: Through those 4. Is that what you're saying?Moderator: Yep, whichever one I think there's more I can't. I can't only see so much.Participant: This one says, check your claim status.Participant: Message about va benefits. PageParticipant: Hold on.Moderator: I think you're back at the top now. Yep.Participant: So this right here is this, just like a statement.Moderator: Yeah. So this is the answer from the chat. Bot, that's saying, if you're signed up for Va. Health care program, you can manage your Va. Health from one of theseModerator: options, and it's giving you a list of options below to select. So it's trying to kind of narrow narrow the field down andModerator: The 1st was kind of a some sort of question to kind of narrow it down. And now it's giving you a more specific list of options.Moderator: So if you'd like, go ahead and select one of those options to navigate on.Participant: So the reason I'm asking is because ofParticipant: how it reads out to me.Participant: Like certain ones, say message in front of them like this says, message, check your claim status. You probably don't see the word message up there.Moderator: No.Participant: Exactly the one.Moderator: That same message must be links, because that shows up as a link to me.Participant: Yeah, that's what it would to me. I would think it would be, it would say link or something like that. But it says message.Moderator: Okay.Participant: And then.Moderator: Very good to know.Participant: This one says, message.Moderator: Yep again. It's a link.Participant: And so is this one.Moderator: Yep, that's also a link.Participant: Yeah, I'm like, wait, what's message? Me?Moderator: It means link.Participant: Yeah. So that's why I was confused. I'm like, I don't know what's the answer, because I don't see a link anywhere.Moderator: Exactly. I'd be confused, too. So I guess. Click on one of those messages. Then, yeah, instead of links.Participant: Okay. Oh, so this one I know it ain't that one too fast.Participant: Oh, I'm trying to find.Participant: So I guess I would choose this one, because it's health benefits.Moderator: Okay, go ahead and hit. Enter.Moderator: and it has opened in a new tab for you.Participant: I'm sorry. Say that again.Moderator: It has opened a new tab for you.Participant: Okay.Moderator: And it looks like you're on about Va health benefits. Page, the va.gov forward, slash healthcare forward, slash about your health benefits. So yeah, there's there's the information that we need that we would need. SoModerator: with that done, let me take aModerator: a couple minutes to ask you some questions about that? With thisModerator: question did the answers make sense.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: More so than the 1st right. Would you want any more information provided here.Participant: Any more, not necessarily more.Moderator: So okay,Participant: Clear.Moderator: Absolutely so again, how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: After I understood it, I was easy.Moderator: Okay,Moderator: Can you think of a way to improve this interaction or answer.Participant: Only the the message, link thing.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay.Participant: I see other than out.Participant: Once I figured that part out. I was good.Moderator: Right perfect.Moderator: Finally, then, what I'd like you to do is navigate back to the chat, bot if you can, through your tabs, tab back to it.Participant: Just a regular tab or shift tab.Moderator: However, you navigate to get back to the previous tab in your web. Browser.Participant: Oh, oh, yeah, I forgot. We're in a whole another page, right?Moderator: Yeah. It opened up a new tab, a new tab in your web, browser. Yep, a new page.Moderator: Yep. So you're logging through. It looks like you're shuffling through the differentParticipant: Windows.Moderator: Window applications. Yep, there you go!Participant: So.Moderator: So is there a way to get back to close this tab? Can you close this tab? Let's see, it would be if you're in chrome. It would beModerator: a shift, WI believe, or I'm sorry. Not a shiftModerator: again. I'm on an apples. Command command plus shift.Participant: Yeah, shift bracket. It's like, Whoa left bracket.Participant: Yeah, that's apple.Moderator: Come in!Participant: Because we I don't have a command key. I got control, and I got all.Moderator: Second, let me let me Google that real quick windowsModerator: and it looks like control. W. Yep.Participant: Control, W.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Okay, hold on one second.Moderator: No problem. Take your time.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Now we are back to the chat Bot, and I think we need to tabModerator: to get back to theModerator: to the prompt, the the text prompt.Moderator: So it looks like you're going through the the links again.Moderator: Do we need a tab? Maybe.Participant: That's what I was doing.Moderator: Oh, okay.Participant: So keep doing the tab or.Moderator: Yeah, let's try. Keep tabbing.Moderator: Nope, let's try your arrows. Try your down arrow.Observer: Try escape!Moderator: Thank you.Moderator: There we go!Observer: Now tab.Moderator: Now tab.Observer: Again.Moderator: One last time.Participant: Yeah, one more.Moderator: Yep, one last time perfect now, or we you should be in the.Participant: Prompt window. It was, say, edit.Moderator: Yep, what I would like you to do is type your own question.Participant: Oh!Moderator: And it could be anything you want doesn't have to be related to signing on. It doesn't have to be related anything we've talked about so far it could be anythingModerator: va related.Moderator: All right. How do I get an automobile, Grant? Let's take a look.Moderator: So now, if you hit shift, tab, shift, tab.Moderator: and you can see, I think it should say, select from the following topics I'm rephrasing.Moderator: and then Tab once will take you to those.Moderator: and then use your arrows to navigate.Participant: I don't see it.Moderator: See anything. Okay? No problem. So it doesn't look like it's got the answer that you needed.Moderator: It's supposed to be there.Moderator: Alright. So not that you didn't get the answer that you were expecting. Okay?Moderator: And obviously, you, it was difficult, because it didn't provide you the right answer.Moderator: At any point did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process?Moderator: Can you think of a way to improve this interaction, or answer.Participant: Maybe if it had like suggestions.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: do you know how like on Google, when you say something in the Google function, it was like, Did you mean right? Right?Participant: That's a good. That's a very good feedback. Okay.Moderator: So that will complete our 1stModerator: proof of concept. Let's move aheadModerator: to the proof of concept 2, which is the second link that I sent you. So.Participant: Hi, Emily!Moderator: You have to switch to your Hotmail or your outlook.Participant: Yeah, I'm gonna close this out.Participant: And then I'm gonna go.Participant: Oh, that's it right there, darn it.Moderator: That, is it? Okay? So now, what has happened is it's going to say we have to use 2 factor authentication.Moderator: So if you go back to yourModerator: I think, actually, you know what. Now that I think about it, I think we were given a different email address. We haveModerator: your Gmail.Moderator: Your key. One aim.com. So if you check that email you should have theModerator: pass code that we need or actually know what you can. You can enter it in here. So it doesn't matter. It says, email, so type in either email. And it looks like you can get your access to it.Moderator: using the email that you are currently in. So that'll that'll help.Participant: So I can use. Outlook is what you're saying.Moderator: Yep, absolutely just type that email in here.Participant: Okay.Participant: Excuse me.Moderator: No problem.Moderator: All right. Now, I think you gotta switch back to your email.Participant: If it wants to send.Moderator: Right.Observer: I think it's gonna go to your gmail account.Moderator: He entered his outlook, though right.Participant: Yeah, I put in outlook.Moderator: Let me try to close it out.Moderator: Let's try.Participant: And then I'm gonna reopen it.Moderator: Right? Yeah, we can do that.Moderator: So sounds like we may have whitelisted your gmail instead of your outlook. So let me.Participant: Might have, what.Moderator: What we have to do is what's called Whitelisting, where essentially only certain email addresses are allowed to access.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Give me one second. Here.Participant: I can just do the other one.Moderator: Oh, okay, if that works yeah, go ahead. AndModerator: because what it's gonna do isModerator: sent that send that code to your other to the Gmail account.Participant: Should I hit? Exit here.Moderator: Yeah, you can hit exit here.Moderator: And then if you go back into that email to get the link. Yep, there you go.Moderator: There it is. Yep, you got it.Participant: Oh! Here we go!Moderator: Okay, now, it's prompting you get a login emailed to you. So yeah, let's use your gmail. One.Participant: Tuesday, July 20. Second, open mailParticipant: mail, or 3 54 pm. Status bar. ItemParticipant: messages unread factor, underscore unread, unread, unread. So promotions selected unread cloudflare, cloudflare access, login, message.Moderator: Yep, that's it.Participant: And cloud store, logo link image, your cloudflare access codeParticipant: 3, 1, 9, 8, 0, 4 actions availableParticipant: 3, 1, 9, 8, 0, 4.Moderator: You got it.Participant: Okay.Moderator: All right. So now we are in component number 2, or proof of concept number 2.Moderator: So if you wanna, I I believe shift, let's try shift, Tab to get there.Moderator: There we go! Shift, tab again, shift, tab again.Moderator: and here we go. This is the little. There's like a little BlueModerator: Kip hit it maybe 2 more times.Moderator: Shift tab, shift, tab, Nope, tab.Participant: Yeah, what?Moderator: Tab. Let's try Tab. Now to get you back in there. Okay.Moderator: so there is. It doesn't look like this has been optimized forModerator: screen reader. So basically, there's a little blue drop down area that says, welcome to Chatbot version 2.0 point 1. And it says, Please don't enter personal information. This is not a mental health botModerator: for emergencies call 9, 8, 8, and that's what it's giving you to the link to 9, 8, 8, and if you hit tab again, then there's a linkModerator: for more information. That's a little link, and if you hit it one more time, that will take you to the prompt right? And it's saying, How can I help you today? So we're going to do just like we did last time with, how can I sign into? Va.Participant: Oh, okay.Moderator: Right then, if I remember right. Still shift, tab, shift, tab.Moderator: Oh, gotta go one more time orModerator: yeah. Now you're in the right window. Now, I think you can maneuver with your arrows.Moderator: No, yeah.Moderator: Can you go down? If you go down, does it? Go up? Okay, go go up, try up, up.Moderator: up, up one more time.Moderator: Okay? And it should say, thanks for this question. Here's what.Participant: Thanks for asking this question.Moderator: Yeah. Now the now, now you're ready to navigate and push your down arrows.Moderator: and I'm I'm guessing you're probably getting the message here, too? Or does it say link.Participant: Yeah, no, it's telling me what it's saying.Moderator: Okay, is it saying, link, though? Or is it saying message again? Because.Participant: Say that again.Moderator: Is it telling you that these are links, or is it telling you that? Is it giving you that message.Participant: It's saying black square, and then it says, LinkParticipant: got it right after that, and then it reads out what it says.Moderator: Okay. So it's at least.Participant: So it tells me. A black square is there? Apparently? Yeah. And then it says, Link.Moderator: It's basically like a bullet kind of like a little bullet. But instead of a circle, it's a black, square.Participant: So somebody described it.Moderator: So once again take a few minutes to interact and respond to the chat bot with the response to the chat bot, and feel free to speak out loud your thoughts.Moderator: and feel free to explore these links as needed.Participant: How do I sign into the Va.Participant: I mean, this talks about creating an account in my to me.Participant: That's the closest thing that could be anything remotely similar to signing in.Moderator: Got it.Participant: Who.Moderator: Yeah. Why don't you go back up to that one and hit enter, and we'll see what happens.Moderator: And it looks like it opened a new tab here. So it's telling you how to create a loginModerator: dot gov account for Va, and it's taking you through the process to create an account, soModerator: not telling us how to how to log in so.Participant: Right.Moderator: Okay, so that kind of I think, ends ourModerator: exploration here. Could you? Do the think it was?Moderator: Was it shift, W, or controlled.Participant: Control, wfn.Moderator: W. To close this this tab.Moderator: There we go. So now let me ask you a few questions on this.Moderator: did your answer make sense.Participant: No.Moderator: No was all information provided.Participant: No.Moderator: Was it easy or difficult to find what you needed?Participant: I guess it would be difficult.Moderator: Yeah, you never got.Participant: And I didn't get the answer.Moderator: Right did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No, it wasn't overwhelming. No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: all right, perfect. Last question we're going to do is just like we did last time. I'm going to prompt you to ask. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information. So I think if we tab from where you're at now.Moderator: it may take us to the right spot.Moderator: There it is, right there.Moderator: So again, I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: And benefit information.Moderator: You got itModerator: right, and then shift tab.Moderator: shift, tab, shift tab, and then arrows from here.Participant: There's the list.Moderator: Yeah, there's the list of links.Participant: That's the bottom.Moderator: Yep, I think that's the top.Participant: There's 5 items.Moderator: Okay. Yep.Moderator: Now up one more time, maybe.Participant: Sorry. Say that. What.Moderator: I said, now, maybe up one more time from here.Participant: Oh, who just says thanks.Moderator: Oh, okay.Participant: Yeah, I saw that one already.Moderator: No problem. I can't. It's off the screen. I couldn't cut.Participant: Oh, oh, okay.Moderator: What is that?Participant: Can you see it?Moderator: No, I can't see that one.Participant: Can you see it now?Moderator: Nope.Participant: Oh, wow!Moderator: That's okay. Keep going. You can hear it, and that's all we need. So here, I think these are, this is your list, right?Participant: Right? Here, yeah.Moderator: Yeah. So go ahead and see if any of these make sense, for I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: Okay.Moderator: And if any of these make sense, go ahead and hit, enter, and navigate to that page.Participant: Managing my va.gov profile.Moderator: Okay. So if that's the one you think, go ahead and hit enter.Moderator: and it looks like it took you to a page called managing your va.gov profile.Moderator: So let's go ahead and and ourModerator: task here, then, and I'm going to ask you a few questions.Moderator: Does this answer make sense to you?Participant: I don't know.Moderator: Oh, okay.Participant: Because I don't. I'm looking for benefits specifically. And that's just my profile.Moderator: Exactly. Okay.Moderator: So would you want more information provided.Participant: Year. Okay?Moderator: Was it easy or difficult to find what you needed?Participant: I guess. Difficult.Moderator: Right did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay? And can you think of a way to improve this interaction?Participant: I mean other than getting the right stuff.Moderator: Give me the right answer. Dang it.Participant: Right.Moderator: Alright. So I'm gonna move on, thenModerator: at why don't we hit? Is it shift W. To close this window?Participant: Control.Moderator: Control yeah control.Participant: Control. W to close control.Participant: Oh, oh, oh, I had to work. Yeah. See, I hit shift.Moderator: No.Moderator: I'm messing you up. There we go.Moderator: So now I'll have youModerator: tab through, because at the top of this, in the breadcrumb menu. There is the link to our next component.Moderator: So if you tab, I think.Participant: I don't.Moderator: Hit hit escape to get out of the chat. Bot. So let's try that first.stParticipant: I just hit escape.Moderator: Okay.Participant: If we did anything.Moderator: Doesn't look like you're selected in. Let's see. Hit, tab. And let's see if it does anything.Moderator: Okay, yeah. Now try. Try escape again.Moderator: Nope, nothing try shift tab to get out of this chat. Bot.Moderator: shift. Tab. Yeah. Keep going until we get out.Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: this might take us. We're almost there. Let's see. Shift, tab again.Moderator: Keep goingModerator: almost there. Keep going right there. That's the one. So you'd say component 3.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Yeah, go ahead and hit. Enter. We'll open. Component 3.Moderator: Once again. Go ahead and familiar. Let's do. What is it?Moderator: Shift, tab to get into it. Is that right? Let's let's find out.Participant: Hmm, yeah, we'll find out.Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: Nope, we got a tab tab through it. So let's go tabModerator: till we get there. We gottaModerator: navigate our way through the pageModerator: we're just about to.Moderator: And there's how does it?Moderator: Okay, there we go, all right.Moderator: There we are. There's our prompt window now.Moderator: and we're going to do just like we did the last time. How can I sign into Va.Participant: One second.Moderator: Yeah, no problem. Take your time, nothing but time.Moderator: and I'm not sure if you have anything that says it. But right now there, it says Va. Chatbot is typing, and there's a littleModerator: thing that's spinning to let you know that it's processing.Participant: If it is, I don't know. Okay, just say, how can I help you today?Participant: Knows talking.Moderator: Got it.Moderator: so you must be up in the prompt window, and you you may should be able to arrow down then to see.Participant: This is, I'm at like the very top of the page. I think.Moderator: Oh, yeah, soModerator: it kicked you out of the window completely. So shift, Tab. Let's shift Tab to get back in there. See if it'll get us back in there.Moderator: Shift. Tab!Participant: Whoa!Moderator: You're all the way out now.Participant: What am I doing up here.Moderator: Yeah, you're in the navigation. Oh, you're almost there.Moderator: One more. There you go now, now you're in that. So shift Tab again to go back up into your responses.Moderator: One.Moderator: 2 more. And now I think you can arrow through this, or maybe you might have to shift. Tab.Moderator: Yeah, there you go.Moderator: Yeah, keep arrowing up. You're not quite to the top yet. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going.Moderator: and 2 more. 3 more right there. Yep.Moderator: should start Va Chatbot to sign into. Va, yeah.Moderator: alright. And again, please take a few minutes to interact with the response and feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you navigate throughModerator: the answer.Participant: Okay.Participant: It seems like, they spit out the right information.Moderator: It did.Moderator: Okay. So go ahead and click onModerator: the one that makes the most sense to you. I can't see where you're at, so.Participant: Oh, you you couldn't see none of theParticipant: What is it?Moderator: The so the.Participant: As we do.Moderator: Only certain amount of pixels, tall.Participant: Excellent.Moderator: I see from like Va Chatbot down to if you don't have a login so.Participant: Forget how to make it take up the whole screen.Moderator: I don't know if you can. Honestly, I don't think you can in this prototype, so.Participant: Is it like only half of my screen.Moderator: Yeah, it's about half of your screen. Tall.Participant: Yeah, no, I think it's a way you could do that. I just figure how to maximize it.Moderator: Hmm.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: That's okay. If you want. If this is the selection that you think that makes the most sense, you can just go ahead and click it.Participant: Well, I guess what I'm getting at is where I started out. It was telling me how to sign in.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Like the where you told me to stop it.Participant: like at the top of the screen, or where you, when I was going up, it was giving me all the directions of what to do.Moderator: Right.Participant: Versus having to click on anything. It already had stuff to say.Moderator: Okay. So what what I'm hearing you say is that you were given directions toModerator: how to log in. But.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Doesn't appear to be a link to get to that login right.Participant: No, it it was like Step One. Go to this part of va.gov, and click sign in like it was. It was giving me, step by step, instruction.Moderator: Got it perfect. Okay, let's endModerator: on that part, then. And let me ask you a few questions about this.Participant: Home.Moderator: Once again, does this make sense.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, was all information provided.Participant: Yes.Moderator: And was it easy or difficult to find what you needed.Participant: Easy.Moderator: Okay, did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, then the last for the last time. Then what I'm going to have you do isModerator: tab back to the or yeah, tab back to the prompt window, and I'm going to have you type in. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Moderator: One last time.Participant: Right here.Moderator: You got it.Moderator: I need to help my dad login to get his benefits.Moderator: Information.Participant: Hmm!Participant: -Oh!Participant: Don't forget summer.Moderator: Oh, you're good. I need to help my dad log in to get benefit. His benefits. Information? Yeah.Participant: So that's what I felt is.Moderator: All right. Now let's once again. It says, Va Chatbot is typing, and there's a littleModerator: thing. But yeah, again, you say, there, you have no indication of that. Okay, okay, did it.Moderator: It spit out an answer on my end. Is it talking to you on the other end?Moderator: Oh, Kiwan, are you there?Participant: Yeah. He's reading some steps out to me.Moderator: Gotcha.Participant: It's just like the same thing as signing inParticipant: so what do you need me to do? I'm sorry.Moderator: Oh, no, you're good justModerator: Let's shift tab back into our window.Moderator: Yep, 2 more times, and then you can use the arrows here to navigate again.Moderator: ButModerator: yeah nice.Moderator: It's once again should start with Va Chatbot. But then I then I don'tModerator: don't know what the and the answer is from there.Participant: I'm talking about where I am right now.Moderator: Oh, I can't see where you're at. The the answer itself should start, and it'll it'll just say Va Chatbot.Moderator: and then you can use the arrows to up and down navigate. So so once again,Moderator: let's talk about the answers that this provided, do these answers make sense.Participant: I'm trying to get to that spot.Moderator: No no problem.Participant: Let's go. Let's.Moderator: Arrow up, then still. Keep arrowing up.Moderator: Keep going! Keep going! Keep going! Keep goingModerator: now. I can see it. Keep going. Keep going!Moderator: Keep going.Moderator: Keep going.Moderator: One more.Moderator: Okay, there you are.Participant: The movie.Moderator: Now you're at the top of the answer. Yep, Va, Chatbot!Moderator: Oh, this is the last question. So now.Participant: Yeah, I don't. Oh, my fault!Moderator: You need to go down. Then I'm sorry.Participant: No, I was trying to figure out like this is the same thing.Moderator: Yeah, no, you're you're you're right. I just. I can't see your window. So I think you need to go down. Yeah, do your arrow down, and let's see if I can get you. Get you there.Moderator: there you go.Participant: Here we go!Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: Now you're in the right spot.Participant: Yeah, that's pretty good.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: So does this answer make sense to you?Participant: Yes.Moderator: And do you believe all information was provided.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, was it easy or difficult to find what you needed.Participant: Easy.Moderator: Okay, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, perfect. Then that concludes the the task portion. And what I've got next is just aModerator: quick, wrap-up interviewModerator: to ask about your experience. So 1st and foremost, how did you feel while using the chat bot?Moderator: Were there points where you ever got stuck, annoyed, or or felt especially satisfied.Participant: Oh, just some points. Why, I was frustrated with the responses. But that's it.Participant: Other than that. Everything else is pretty normal.Moderator: Right. Sounds like you had a little bit of struggle with the navigation.Moderator: Shift the shift tab. So that's a little bit different.Participant: Well, well, yeah, I think it's more. Yeah, that's more so. The the issue, like the navigation andParticipant: some of the stuff not being labeled correctly like that message thing instead of the link.Moderator: Right.Participant: You know, stuff like thatParticipant: cause you, it can really throw you throw you off if you're not able to see that stuff.Moderator: Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And it seems like it's a different interaction than what you're used to with most screen readers as well.Participant: Right, and I've never been just thrown somewhereParticipant: in like, maybe the middle of the screen.Moderator: Right.Participant: Before I'm usually either tossed back to the top.Participant: Or just go down, you know.Moderator: Sure.Participant: That thing can just throw you everywhere wherever it feels like I was like where my hair.Moderator: Right, yeah.Participant: I felt so lost I felt like a lost puppy.Moderator: Hard to get your bearings. Okay, you're saying let's see, at any point. Did you feel confused, frustrated, or overwhelmed by some of the in responses or the interface. So yeah, I think you just.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Felt like a lost puppy.Participant: Look yes, all right.Moderator: Were the Chatbots responses easy to understand, or were they at all overwhelming at any point.Participant: No, no, they weren't overwhelming. They may not have gave given you the right answer, but it wasn't overwhelming.Moderator: Okay, did they ever give you too much information at once? Or was the amount of information just right.Participant: I thought it was good for me, especially that last one that we just did with the helping your dad. That was like really good information, for, like the guardianship and caregiving, and all that stuff, I thought it was really valuable information.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: Did you have to remember information from earlier in their conversation to complete a task.Participant: Yes!Moderator: Like all that shift tab stuff.Participant: Yeah. Exactly. All right.Participant: Tab, tab, escape.Moderator: Yeah, exactly the escape and stuff. Right?Moderator: Did you notice any major differences between the 3 chat bots.Participant: Well, I mean one seemed more polished.Participant: That which was that last one.Moderator: Number 3, you'd say was seem more polished.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Way way. Better like in all the than the other 2 to the point where I was like. I don't have to go any further.Moderator: All right.Participant: It's giving me everything I need. It almost felt like a legitimate AI.Moderator: Right. Okay. Did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning? Or were you able to see read and hear the disclaimer.Participant: I'm I'm just gonna go out on a limb and say no, because I didn't even know there was a disclaimer.Moderator: Absolutely okay.Moderator: So the disclaimer, just to let you know, was talking about privacy and personal information. And let me ask you.Participant: Oh, oh, okay, don't enter that into the chat. Bot, yeah, I know what you're talking about now.Moderator: Okay, good. Good. So were you concerned about sharing privacy or any personal information.Participant: No,Moderator: Okay, where the Chatbot answers the right length for you.Participant: Yes!Moderator: Okay, was the Chatbot. What you expected.Participant: Sure!Moderator: Oh no!Participant: Now I will say that last one. I did not expect it to respond the way it did.Moderator: Okay, as far.Participant: 3rd one being very clear and concise.Moderator: Good. Okay, as far as the interactions, though those didn't kind of seem to meet your expectations. Those were different, correct.Participant: Yeah,Moderator: Have you had similar or different experiences with other chat bots.Participant: Some are kind of like what do you call it?Participant: I'll basic basic responses.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Like they give you that. Oh, well, I can't help you call this number 800.Moderator: Right, right, right.Participant: You know this is as far as I can get you. I got your name.Moderator: Yeah, yeah, so.Participant: Yeah kind of a dead end.Participant: It's just gonna give you the same frequently asked questions other than that. I don't know nothing else.Moderator: Do you feel strongly about one of these versions versus another?Participant: Yes, the last one.Moderator: Okay. And why did you like the last one the best.Participant: again, because of how clear and concise and how easily it was it it poured out steps instead of just hey, click this link, you know, it actually gave you the the steps in order to at that of what to do and how to actually do it with thorough wording.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: Do you notice anything specific that you would suggest that we correct or change that would improve your user experience?Participant: Other than all that jumping around. I think it's all right.Moderator: Having seemed out of sequence for you.Participant: Yes, very much so.Moderator: Awesome.Participant: And you guys can put me on contract if you need me to come. Help.Moderator: Okay, do you have any other comments or suggestions here? At the end.Participant: No, no, I think that was very. I'm good with everything.Moderator: Okay, do you have any questions for me?Participant: No I do want to say for the young lady who kept jumping on to say, to speak up, I really appreciate your help.Moderator: Yes, thanks. Thanks.Participant: See you soon.Moderator: Your help.Observer: Appreciate you taking the time out to do this for us. So thank you so much.Participant: Yeah, no. Problem.Moderator: I just wanted to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we share video clips of your sessions with our Va partners.Participant: Absolutely. And there's no problem.Moderator: Okay, perfect. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you. Just so our Va partners don't have this personal information, and we only share the video within our internal team and other digital experiences that takes us to the end. We want to thank you for your help today, and sharing your thoughts.
