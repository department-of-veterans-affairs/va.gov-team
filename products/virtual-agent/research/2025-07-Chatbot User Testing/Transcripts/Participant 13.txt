Participant 13 Ð July 30, 2025 Ð 3:30 PM ESTModerator: And just to confirm, I do have your consent to record this session.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Perfect. All right, just a few quick pre-test questions, and then we'll get into the tasks. Let's see, are you using any assistive technology like a screen. Reader, to complete these tasks today.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, can you please tell me what device and operating system you're using? Is it a windows or a Mac computer?Participant: Windows. 11. Professional.Moderator: Okay? And can you tell me which browser you will be using today?Participant: Well, this is the zoom app.Participant: So.Moderator: Right.Participant: Actually straight zoom.Moderator: Okay. So when I'm I'm what I'm gonna do is I will send you a link here in just a few moments to click on, and I guess isModerator: like my.Participant: I'd probably be using chrome if we went off the zoom.Moderator: Good. Okay. Microsoft, Chrome. Not not Microsoft edge. Okay.Participant: You could use edge. If I've got that, too, if you prefer edge.Moderator: Whichever is your whatever you feel more comfortable with. This is just kind of a a demographic question to see howModerator: how, what you know what? What tools and the specific computers and web browser that we're using. So.Participant: Okay.Moderator: If you're if you're comfortable with chrome, that's perfectly fine.Moderator: Alright. Now, speaking of that link, let me drop it in our chat here. If you look in the chat window, I just posted a link to our 1st proof of concept. Chat, bot.Moderator: and it.Participant: Where? Where am I? Seeing that in the little box, from moderator to everyone, or.Moderator: So if you look across the bottom, you should see audio video participants chat react. And so chat is like the 4th one over.Participant: There was one that popped up. That's why I was wondering if that was it, but apparently not so. I see it.Moderator: Perfect. If you could click that link thenModerator: and then from the Zoom Meeting, there's a that green little button, at least on my computer. It's a green little arrow pointing up for share. If you could see your screen so that my colleagues and I can kind of see what you see as you navigate through our chat bots today.Participant: On that by me. Again, I minimize, not minimize. But I've reduced the size of the video or the computer screen. But I know, I know by sharing, but I just don't see it in this particular one. So here we go. I clicked the background screen so got it alright.Moderator: Yeah, that that little menu kind of hides when it'sModerator: when it's when there's no movement around on the screen. So.Participant: If you don't use this every day, you forget where that stuff is, and.Moderator: Absolutely.Moderator: So if you hit share.Participant: I did.Moderator: Okay. I think you may.Participant: See? Sure. All right.Moderator: There you go, perfect. It's loading. It's.Participant: Share, right.Moderator: Sunny and cherry up. Look out for that tree.Participant: Really, that's hard to believe. But.Moderator: Yeah, I know, right?Moderator: Okay.Participant: I believe that he became a Congressman, much less.Moderator: Right.Participant: Tree.Moderator: Yeah, the Congressman, and then he should have took some skiing lessons.Participant: Before that he probably said, Watch this.Moderator: Right? Exactly. Alright. So what I'm gonna do then is have you take a couple of minutes to just familiarize yourself with this screen. Go ahead and read through all the items in the things that you see here.Moderator: Whenever you're ready, go ahead and click this. Start, chat button, and as we go throughout these tasks, please feel free to speak out loud your thoughts and actions, as you kind of explore through this chat. Bot! So.Participant: In mind. I've not really enjoyed these AI chat boxes I've used for different companies. It drives you crazy, especially when you're trying to get a live person, and it asks you about 16 times, is there anything else I could possibly do? Right? Yeah, you could disappear and get me a live human.Moderator: Right. No, no, actually, that's good. I'm glad you said that, because it reminded me we do have one other pretesting question that I completely ignored to ask, and that is how familiar you are with Chatbots. So it does seem that you have some experience with them. Have you used just the company ones like you're talking about? Or have you used any specific like Chat Gpt or Gronk, or any of those AI bots at all?Participant: Well, I use Gemini more than any from Google.Participant: Yeah, okay. Although I've I've told Gemini, if there's anybody really listening that I consider them to be about 20% wrong.Participant: I was in Texas once time. Bear in mind, Texas is kind of big, and I asked it. Where's the the nearest Va. Hospital to where I am in East Texas? Her answer quickly. It's answer. There are no Va. Hospitals in Texas.Moderator: Oh, yeah, yeah, I don't think that's right.Participant: Yeah, there's 8 or 10 of them. But you know, you can't take that to the bank. You can't say, is it the red or green wire, and say, Well, that's it. That's the the wrong wire.Moderator: Absolutely right. Yeah. Machines are still fallible. So so how many times would you say? Just an estimate? How many times would you say in the last month that you've used Chatbots.Participant: 20.Moderator: 20. Okay. And what would that estimate be for the last 6 months?Participant: 6 times, 20.Moderator: Okay, so hunt about a hundred 20.Participant: And 20, if not more perfect. I mean, if you're just talking about, do I go on toParticipant: toParticipant: Gemini more often than using one of those company ones which I hate. It's a love hate with Gemini and Chat Gpt, and all that, but I I use it several times a day, so.Moderator: Okay. Good.Participant: Just to see what kind of ignorance it comes up with. Came up with some ignorance today, too. So.Moderator: Alright so what I'm gonna have you do 1st is, if you'll recall, we're gonna talk about login and signing in. So in that prompt window. If I could get you to type, how can I sign into Va.Moderator: How can I sign in to Va.Moderator: And then once again take a few minutes to interact with the response that the Chatbot gives, and feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you explore the answers.Participant: Well, I guess they're doing away with my healthy vet, so at some point you might even just make that disappear.Participant: login.gov is a pain in the neck.Participant: I use id dot me for any time. I have to sign in as a as a veteran.Moderator: Okay.Participant: And I think I've used Ds login once or twice, but didn't much care for it, so.Moderator: Got it. Why don't you go ahead and click on the Id. Me button, and we'll see what happens.Participant: That's a scary thing, and let's see what happens. Well, open that door and see what's in there.Moderator: That's right.Participant: Okay.Moderator: So which which one of theseModerator: if any of these, would be the.Participant: I know how to use id, not me. So they really shouldParticipant: should be one. I don't need help. I would guess I don't need help. I have an account. I can'tParticipant: no need to create a new one, and obviously back would take me out of it so, or just have something that says log in using.Moderator: Right.Participant: My account.Moderator: Right. So you think there should be like a button here that says just like sign in or log in.Participant: Right? Yeah. Login with Id. Dot. Me.Moderator: Perfect. Okay, good. Let's go ahead and stop here real quick. And I'm gonna ask you just a few follow up questions about these last couple interactions. So did this answer make sense to you.Participant: Well, the question didn't make sense because it didn't allow me. That presumes that no one has an id dot me account, and and there's gotta be hundreds of thousands, if not millions. It's a private company, but I I see it everywhere.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: Okay, so and then we talked a little bit about this. It sounds like that. You felt that all information may not have been provided. For instance, the just, the sign in button would have been.Participant: Right? Yeah. Click, here.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: And so how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed.Participant: Well, I didn't need a help to sign into login, dot meParticipant: If it would have simply said, Here's where there's a button to click for login. Dot me, and away you go.Moderator: Perfect last question. Did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No, I just didn't understand why it was so mistaken.Moderator: Yeah, just incomplete, perhaps.Participant: Yeah, for sure.Participant: In a real world it wouldn't have gotten me anywhere.Moderator: Right? Exactly. Okay. So next, what I would like you to do is in that prompt window. Please type in. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits informationModerator: and once again take a few minutes to interact with the answers provided here, and feel free to speak aloud. Your your feelings and your actions.Participant: Well, it says, select from the following topics, or try rephrasing your question. I would think that you'd want to haveParticipant: the veteran, or whoever the the sonParticipant: have an experience first, st before you say, try rephrasing your question, because this presumes that the question 1st time I looked at it I thought I must have rephrased it. Wrong because it. The 1st thing it says is, or second thing it says, try rephrasing your question. So just having the 3 choices is better than adding, or try rephrasing your question.Moderator: Okay, so do you think any of these would be applicable to the situation in hand?Participant: Well, veteran benefits, andParticipant: well, all of them, to a certain extent. But it doesn't really presume that you're doing it for somebody else, because I can guarantee if they get too far into it, they're gonna be stopped and saying, You know, privacy act.Participant: You can't get information about somebody you say, is your father, or even if he is your father, without some kind ofParticipant: proof or permission of your father.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: And and again it looks likeModerator: as you mentioned the 1st time. Maybe that login button.Participant: Mexican orange juice, real sugar.Participant: That's the big stuff it is.Moderator: The good stuff. Yeah.Participant: Hard to find.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Anyway.Moderator: No, you're you're good, perfect. So we're gonna stop here again. And I'm gonna ask you the same quick! Follow up questions. Do you believe that this answer made sense.Participant: It was, there was too much to the answer it. You might they're gonna whoever. Let's say it's the sun when he gets to any of those, including the accredited representative. He's gonna hit a roadblock.Participant: whether it's important, you know.Participant: but this is presuming that it's answering any questions, including one from a veteran who won't get the roadblock. He'll be asked.Participant: you know, who was the second grade teacher? And what's the capital of Idaho and that sort of thing to be able to get through.Participant: And which is the whole purpose of the id dot me. They're talking to the to the right one.Moderator: Yep, okay. Great good feedback. There. So would you want any more information provided? Here.Participant: Well, if it was tailor made forParticipant: a relative or son, what have you of a veteran that probably should haveParticipant: something that says, if you are not the are you the veteran, or are you not the veteran? If you're the veteran, go to door number 2, your decision tree, if you're not the veteranParticipant: click here, and then it'll say, you know, you'll need some kind of power of attorney or a court order or a will.Moderator: Yeah, something. Like that.Moderator: Yeah. Okay, good.Participant: If that's going to happen, I guarantee it.Moderator: Yeah. So you're looking for like a, maybe a qualifying question. Before giving the answer.Participant: Oh, yeah, absolutely.Moderator: Okay. Great.Participant: Years and years ago, in the old Va. I went into a Va. Down in Biloxi, Mississippi, and asked for all my records, and the guy said, who was the freedom of information, Guy, and he said, I can't give it to you, I said, why not?Participant: Under the Privacy Act? I said, I'm the veteran. It's my records.Participant: and they still wouldn't give it to me. I ultimately got them. But that's the kind of stuff you got in the old Va. So.Moderator: Yeah, well, hopefully, we're moving on past that.Participant: Yeah, we're doing this. So.Moderator: Yeah, that's right, yeah, definitely.Participant: But as a veteran I wouldn't want someone who says I'm his granddaughter. I don't have any granddaughters, and here's I want to find out what is percentage ofParticipant: disability is, or something like that, or just, you know, somebody mining for something identity, theft or something.Moderator: Sure. Okay, good. So how easy or difficult. Do you think this answer from the chat Bot was.Participant: Well, I don't think it does much good, considering the circumstances that he's he's contacting them for his dad.Participant: There, there really needs to beParticipant: 2 forks in the road. Veteran, not veteran.Moderator: Right? Okay, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process? Seems like it's maybe incomplete. Instead.Participant: Well, yeah, it it. There should be something more to it.Participant: Got it. It's not overwhelming.Moderator: Good. Okay. So for this version of the chat Bot, can you think of any way to improve the interactions or answers.Participant: Well, you could have something that says, if if you're not the veteran, here's some information that takes them to a page that explainsParticipant: what the non-veteran can get and how to get farther down the road, or something, because there's always some instances, I mean even my wife.Participant: a retired Va nurse, you know, has to jump through hoops to get information about me, so.Moderator: Right? Okay, good. Thanks for that feedback. What we're gonna do now is move on to our second version of the chat Bot, and if you'll take a look back.Participant: For that stunning success of this one here.Moderator: Right. Well, hopefully, one of these.Participant: If it's your baby, your your baby. Well, I apologize. ButModerator: No, no, not I'm like like, I said, not offended at all. This is aParticipant: You make it work.Moderator: Yeah, exactly. This is how you make it work. This is part of the part of the how the sausage is made. I guess you could say, and my role is the ux designer. So the stuff that that you're looking at is the buttons, the pictures, the colors, and so I have no emotional vested interest in anything except for what is best for you as the user. So.Participant: Well, we've all things seen things that have been released into the wild, and they weren't ready for prime time. Whatsoever they they blew up. There was a time, years ago you could go online when the computer was new and fresh, and see all of your social security earnings. But all you had to do was to put in your social security number.Moderator: Oh, right!Participant: A lot of people put on their checks along with their date of birth.Participant: Somebody said, maybe that's not a good idea.Moderator: Yeah, that's too much information.Participant: Yeah. Too easy to get too much information.Moderator: Right? Exactly. Okay. So if you'll go back now to the zoom in the chat, you should see another link. For our version. 2Moderator: and it shouldModerator: once again be in that chat window. And here, what we would like you to do. We're just going to do some quick. 2 factor authentication. If you could use the email address that we that you use with Perigan, it's just gonna send you a quick code to confirm. Since we have to put this version of the Chatbot behind a little bit of security.Participant: Or at least the illusion of security, right.Moderator: That's all it really is.Moderator: Anything can be hacked pretty much the anymore.Participant: Yeah, for sure. That's cloud fair access code.Moderator: Got it? Yep, cloudflareModerator: You got it? Yep.Participant: I'm trainableParticipant: mostly.Moderator: And so here you can see our second versionModerator: slightly different, interface, and once again go ahead and read through as needed. And whenever you're ready. We're going to go ahead and pop that same question back into the window there, which is, how can I sign in to Va.Participant: Bear in mind that a lot of vets, you know I've I've got a master's in this stuff, but a lot of them are going to see up there. It says Bot, and they won't know what that is other than a bug. A bad, bad bug.Participant: Oh, a real bug!Moderator: Which, where, where, specifically are you?Participant: Right under Va semantic search, and I know plenty of my veteran friends are, gonna say, semantic. I'm not even Jewish or something, you know they won't know what semantic means or what what Alpha signifies. So I realize this is just part of the test or the trial here, but where it says, please don't enter personal information. This is not a mental health. Bot.Participant: I know what a bot is, but a lot of people don't, and if that's going to be on the live one.Participant: they're they're going to say bot.Moderator: Right? Yeah, that's good feedback.Participant: Bot is something horses get, you know, bad. It's a bad bug.Moderator: Hmm, okay? All right.Moderator: Well, that we appreciate that feedback. Good to know.Participant: This might be a good bug, but don't ask any horses to take this.Moderator: Right. Their hose might have some troubles on the keypad.Participant: They're all thumbs or no thumbs.Moderator: Right, all thumbs alright. So whenever you're ready, could you type in? How can I sign into Va and that prompt, and we'll see how this one compares with the answer versus number one.Moderator: and once again take a couple of seconds here to go ahead and interact with what you see in the chat. Bot!Participant: Well, I think it's probably tmi. Too much information.Participant: it should be simpler than that.Moderator: Even for me.Participant: And I've been to the Co-OP. So you know I'm not justParticipant: reading this stuff for the 1st time, but you know it's all there, but it's it's busy, and people don't want to read the EncyclopediaParticipant: to find out once again the capital of Light, a home.Moderator: Right, got it so you'd prefer the answer. Be a little bit shorter and more concise.Participant: Right do you have this or that? Do you have I? I think the Va. IsParticipant: happy with their experience with Id dot meParticipant: I I think they're probably phasing outParticipant: some of the more complicated ones the login.gov.Participant: You pretty much have to have a login.gov, for every single department that you go to, and and it's it's horrible.Moderator: Hmm, okay.Participant: If you forget something, you you lose all the information you have in there, so.Moderator: Gotta start over, huh?Participant: Completely so. But id dot me works well enough for me.Participant: Yeah. So you know probably better than all thisParticipant: verbiage here is to just haveParticipant: the choices, you know, whatever, in whatever order, flavor, and and then people can click those, and if down the bottom, if you don't have something click here, and then there's something that's more explanatory that you know what you can do to get one of these or something like that. But if you clicked on login dot me 1st thing login dot me is gonna ask, do you have an account.Moderator: Right. So you prefer to have like kind of the list of options like the 1st box.Participant: Yeah, radio buttons, or, you know, regular blue buttons, or whatever color you end up with and just click it.Participant: Got it clicking. Click and get.Moderator: Okay, alright. So did this answer make sense to you?Participant: I thought it was too busyModerator: Good morning!Participant: Information.Moderator: Too much information provided. And would you say it was easier difficult to find what you needed.Participant: Almost impossible to find it, because you have to go through this and say, Well, which one of these could possibly be.Moderator: Right? Okay? And again, seems like you. There was a bit of overwhelming and hard to process information. So let's try that second prompt in the window this time, and let's do. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: Where are you in the world.Moderator: I'm in Omaha, Nebraska.Participant: Oh, yeah, he's delivering papillion.Moderator: Oh, yeah, yep, just the the butterfly, our our SouthernParticipant: Yeah, they spelled it wrong. But that's okay. That's Nebraska. So.Moderator: Of course. Yeah. The fighting monarchs.Participant: Yeah, I was at Offut and.Moderator: Oh, makes sense.Participant: That's fine!Moderator: Yeah, not too far from Bellevue down there.Participant: Yeah. Well, it's technically his Bellevue mailing address.Moderator: Oh!Participant: They have their own Zip code.Moderator: Right? Right?Moderator: Well, good.Moderator: So here it looks like we've kind of run into a dead end. SoModerator: do you want to try and rephrase your question, and see if the bot will come up with an answer.Moderator: This time.Participant: Non-responsive to what I asked it.Moderator: Not at all. Okay, good. Let's stop here and let's go over those follow up questions. So did this answer make sense.Participant: No.Moderator: Good was all of the information provided.Participant: No no information was provided.Moderator: Good and so then, without that information, made it pretty difficult to find what you needed.Participant: Impossible.Moderator: Okay? And did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Not overwhelming. I just read it and ignored it because it wasn't appropriate for what I asked.Moderator: Yeah, impossible to process, because there's not the right information. Good.Moderator: Alright. So if you could look at the very top menu item there, if you look in purple, you'll see component 2, and right next to it is component 3. Let's click on that component 3, and we're gonna go through the tasks for this last version of our chat pot andModerator: Whenever you're ready we're going to. I'm sure you can follow the process here whenever you're ready in that prompt window, if you would please type in, how can I sign into Va.Moderator: Once again? Take your time to explore the answers here, and feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and ideas as you navigate through.Participant: Well, it says you can sign in with a login.gov orParticipant: id dot me. But the wholeParticipant: thing talks about only login.gov. It doesn't say how to log in with id dot me, or well, I guess it does with the last one how to verify your identityParticipant: for your id dot me, but that's not the same thing as logging in to id dot me.Moderator: Right.Participant: And if you already have one, you've already verified your identity.Moderator: Exactly. Okay, good. Let me answer or excuse me. Let me ask you these. Follow up questions, then, did this answer make sense? For to you.Participant: It was incomplete. I mean it made sense, but it was not.Moderator: Sure. Still, some, if we can.Participant: Came in justParticipant: off the street and tried to get that information set at your computer. It wouldn't be complete, especially if you had a login dot meParticipant: I mean id dot me, because there's no place to say click here to go to login done.Participant: or id dot me.Moderator: Good. Okay, so you felt then that some of the information was not provided that you needed, for instance, those links and so forth.Participant: 50% of it was not provided.Moderator: Right. And so, because of that, would you say it's easier difficult to find what you needed.Participant: Difficult.Moderator: Alright, and did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: I just ignored it because it I came into this as the person. If I was logging in I did earlier today, I'd be using id dot me.Moderator: SureParticipant: So I would just say, Poof! Thanks for nothing.Moderator: Yeah, right? Okay, and then finally, let's go ahead and enter. In the second phrase, I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits, information.Participant: Is that just a fake timer on it? Because it already knows the answer. What it's going to be provided.Moderator: Not true, not the wall, the little.Participant: So really taken that much time to.Moderator: Right. This just to give you a little background. This is using an AI chat bot. So this that is an actualModerator: prompt into it. So it's actually thinking and crawling through to to pull up that answer. Yeah.Participant: That's that's a little scary.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: I mean, I've got a fiber optic connection here and a gaming computer, and it should go blip.Moderator: Well, you also have to remember we're using certain I guess. Guardrails. If you'd like to make make sure that certain things, for instance, as you noticed in the personal information kind of warning at the top that there's not you know any of the mental healthModerator: items or keywords that are being used. And so there's kind of some flags, some red flags that we use to kind of filter out it giving incorrect or perhaps harmful information to veterans. So that's why it takes a little bit longer than the other 2.Moderator: So let's ask. I'm gonna ask those follow up questions here.Participant: Well, let me let me finish reading this. I was.Moderator: My fault. I, yeah.Participant: That's all right.Moderator: We did kind of rush through that.Participant: That's all right.Participant: Okay.Moderator: So yeah, this one kind of breaks it down a little bit more like you were talking aboutModerator: in the 1st one you're like, yeah, you all. You gotta kind of have that fork in the road. So it a little bit describe that that situation that you were talking about. So was this the answer that you were expecting? And and did the answer.Participant: It's better than the other ones, although it still is an emphasis with the login.gov, and that has the hyperlinkParticipant: andParticipant: you know it is better in that. It says, to help your dad. You know it recognizes that it's not the veteranParticipant: but you know people can log in for the veteran, and sometimes the veteran.Participant: You know, it's quadriplegic or something can't do it. Somebody has to do it for them.Participant: Either they're pretending to be that person, or they've done it the right way, and they haveParticipant: the authority to act on their behalf. But you know this is far better than the other ones. They're just not not complete. And and again, you know, theyParticipant: emphasize the login.gov nothing about id dot me or Ds login. I'm not sure anybody uses. I don't know anybody that uses Ds login, but I have done it a couple of times, probably just to see which is, which is better.Moderator: Okay, alright, thanks. Good feedback. There. So it sounds like like you said, this is somewhat incomplete. What other information would you want? Provided here.Participant: Well, since it recognizes that it's the sun.Participant: I think it should be a hyperlink to. If you're not the veteran. This is what you need to do to act on the veteran's behalf because they're talking aboutParticipant: the veteran needs to. verifies his identity, you know.Moderator: And.Participant: He got shot through the forehead in Vietnam. He's not going to be doing anything, soParticipant: it there! There does need to be something more.Moderator: Sure like that, maybe power of attorney or or power of.Participant: Court, order.Moderator: Portable. Yeah.Participant: Like a.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: How easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed here.Participant: Well, it was easier, particularly since it recognized that I was the sonParticipant: contacting for for dad right butParticipant: Still, neither of us is still in neither I nor dad so.Participant: but it doesn't say if you already have this account, the 3 little buttons click one of these, and away you go.Participant: and that may be sitting right there, saying, You know my answer. I I don't have any fingers. You go ahead and do it.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay, did this information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No, I'm I'm really overwhelmed. But no, it's.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Been to see the elephant kind of a thing. So no, it's nothing overwhelming, although I do know people whoParticipant: are incredibly frustrated by the simplest things on computers. They justParticipant: don't want anything to do with it.Moderator: Bye.Participant: We had a civilian attorney who never opened any of his mail because he didn't know how to do it, and so he would just let it time out.Participant: Air Force, you know, working for the Air Force and never sent any emails because he didn't know how to do it and refused to learnParticipant: but if you sat him down, said, You know, if you want to still work here, you've got to send us an email. Just say, Hi! He couldn't do it. He'd be cleaning out his desk so.Moderator: Wow! Huh! Some people alright.Participant: Oh, yeah, that's not gonna do it.Moderator: Yep.Moderator: alright. So that does conclude the task portion of our session. So what I'm gonna do now is ask you just a few questions here. For the.Participant: Math, math, questions.Moderator: Oh, simple ones. Just basically about your experience. Using those 3 chat bots. So 1st and foremost, how did you feel while using the chat. Bot! Were there any points where you felt stuck or annoyed at all?Participant: No, it just it felt incomplete.Participant: I simply wanted just a blue button that said, Take me away to log in here.Moderator: Again.Participant: Something.Moderator: Okay. Did you ever feel confused, frustrated, or overwhelmed by any of the responses or the interface.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, where the Chatbot's response is easy to understand.Participant: Well, I I think there wasn't anything that was difficult to understand. It was just not complete. So while you could understand what it said, it's in English. It just was not as helpful as it should have been, or.Moderator: All right.Participant: A couple cases helpful at all. This was the best of them here, where it it recognized when it's doing its pinwheel that you were the son.Moderator: Got it? Good. Okay.Participant: Going to be able to do that. It should alsoParticipant: give some qualifiers to say, you can't act for your dad unless you are this, that, or the other thing. If you have power of attorney or court order, or something which has to be verified byParticipant: Washington or someplace.Moderator: Sure. Okay. Do you feel the chat Bot ever gave you too much information at once?Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, did you ever have to remember information from earlier in the conversation to complete any task.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay? And so you did. Sounds like you didn't notice that. There were some major differences between the 3. And it sounds like you did have a preference for number 3, then, just to verify.Participant: Yes, right door. Number 3.Moderator: Tour number 3. Did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning, and did it affect how you use the chat? Bot.Participant: No, because anytime you get onto a government website, they're going to say, you know, it's like the FBIParticipant: badge on a DVD or videotape for something. You know you're you're going to go to prison for a thousand years in Guantanamo Bay. If you do this or that, and then there's anytime you go on to any governmentParticipant: website, you're going to get that. The Va is no different.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: Were you concerned about sharing privacy or personal information within the chat? Bot.Participant: Well, I didn't share any personal information, so there's nothing to be concerned about but you know, if it had asked me something thatParticipant: I thought was identifiable personal information.Participant: I'd be a little reluctant becauseParticipant: even if even if it's got a lock on it. It'sParticipant: you know people getting around that andParticipant: like fake websites. And what have you.Moderator: Absolutely okay where the Chatbots answers the right length for you.Participant: Well, I think that second one was a little bit too verbose.Participant: I've got a little robot here that just ran into me.Moderator: Get back! Get back there!Moderator: They're uprising. Huh?Participant: Yeah, it is. I mean, it's very handy now. It's decided to turn around and snub me.Moderator: Alright, so was the chat. Bot what you expected, and howModerator: would you say it's stacked up to the other ones you've used in the past.Participant: Well, some of them are absolutely horrible. I I was on one yesterday that was just miserable. I think it was cash app. It was just absolutely terrible.Participant: and I couldn't wait to get out of there. And of course theyParticipant: they want to minimize the human intervention and save money that way, and when I finally did talk to a humanParticipant: they were in some distant land and didn't. English was maybe the 3rd or 4th language.Participant: So it was was not so great. So it was better than that, you know, it was in English.Participant: ButParticipant: yeah, I'm not a real fan of any of those. I'd rather just mind for the information myself, or talk to a live person, but a lot of times when you do that, you know, it says, you know, 4Êh wait. And one time I said, well, I'm just gonna sit here and do something, read a book, and it got to 3Êh and 59Êmin, and it said goodbye.Moderator: Oh oh no!Participant: Yeah, I mean, it was. It was exciting. I was a bit cranky over that.Moderator: I'm sure I would be as well.Participant: So anyway, there's a place for them. I mean, if people want to get informationParticipant: like I said I any of those, and I've I've tried 3 or 4 of them. They're not trustworthy, and they say right at the bottom, we can make mistakes. You will make mistakes. I mean some of the stuff is good information. Maybe. I mean, if I don't know the answer already, why am IParticipant: getting this? And you know.Moderator: Right.Participant: And can you trust it? Not necessarily.Moderator: Actually, if you look at if you look at this chat, bot at the top and click that little down arrow at the little blueModerator: light blue part at the top, there a little warning where it says, please don't enter that personal information.Participant: Okay. Oh, I see the down arrow.Moderator: Yeah, now, I think it says in there, yeah, this is an AI generated, and it may contain inaccuracies. Please verify any important. So.Participant: Well, the one forParticipant: Gemini actually says I make mistakes.Participant: and it didn't used to say that until IParticipant: bitched it out a few times over colossal mistakes, I mean, they were seriously heavy duty, mistakes.Moderator: Right.Participant: And you think, what in God's name are they looking at? And.Moderator: Right, exactly.Participant: I asked it some something about black powder today, and it came, gave meParticipant: the right answer, but not enough of the right answer, and I pointed out that they were missing this salient thing. Oh, it is. Yeah, thanks for telling me, you know. I'll keep that in for the next time around. But you know, Google is part of that outfit. And if you ask a Google question, you get answer A, if you ask Gemini, you get answer, B,Participant: so they're they're on, obviously on different systems. Yeah, even if you say, well, Google just told me this.Participant: yeah.Moderator: Interesting.Participant: Yeah. Trust, but verify.Moderator: Right? Okay? So if the chat Bot didn't answer your question, what did you do next? If you fell stuck.Participant: I probably would. JustParticipant: Va website is is a lot like the Irs website. There's an awful lot of information, but it's very hard to get to.Participant: sure. And so youParticipant: you know, it's looking for some certain magic words, and if you don't put in the magic wordsParticipant: you get something, it'll always show you something, but it's off the wall.Moderator: Yeah, it might not be what you were expecting.Participant: I can guarantee you. It won't be what you expected.Moderator: Right.Participant: You don't want to ever say. Should I take the red pill or the blue pill?Moderator: Oh no!Participant: Because it'll say, Take the blue one. Okay, the blue pill, the cyanide pill is a blue pill, so.Moderator: So yeah, that's not good at all.Moderator: You don't want that. No, you shouldn't invest it, to begin with. But yeah.Moderator: well, Sir, that does it for our session? Do you have any other more comments or or suggestions for me here at the closure.Participant: No, my son lives in in Omaha, and he's.Moderator: Oh, yeah.Participant: Had a big rainstorm there last night, and.Moderator: It was a bad rainstorm. Yeah. Some limbs. The neighbors across the street have a dead tree, and a bunch of limbs fell fell off.Participant: Oh, yeah, and the streets. His street was awash and all that stuff. But I don't know the world is going that way, and I think Fremont had some tornadoes, didn't it?Moderator: Oh, really, now I didn't think so.Participant: I think so.Moderator: Yeah, that's part part of this. We've had really hot and humid weather. So part of it is the opposite side of that. It can definitely bring in some storm fronts, andModerator: bad hail is possible. With this.Participant: Oh, yeah.Moderator: Humid weather as well, so.Participant: I I, my wife, had my brand new pickup truck out in West Texas and got was in a mall and hail hit, and it cost $10,000 to fix it soParticipant: a whole new roof on it, and everything so.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: No, thank you.Participant: There is. Yeah, definitely it.Participant: Nebraska is really nice for those 2 days in the spring and 2 days in the fall.Moderator: Those those spring days seem to get shorter, because this summer it went from like went pretty like there wasn't really a spring. It just went from like forties, fifties, sixties, and I think we maybe had a week in the seventies, and then it was a hundred. So.Participant: Oh, yeah. Well, I'm in the mountains of East Tennessee, andParticipant: quite pleasant. I mean, this is the South, but it's not the deep south.Participant: And so I look obviously the weather for Nebraska and Texas, and happy. I'm not in either place. SoParticipant: Texas 115 degrees nothing, you know. That's yeah.Participant: But it's been. It's been hot here, but not crazy hot. So.Moderator: Well, you're in a good, mild climate. It sounds like so.Participant: Yeah, it's it can be, can be a little bit of things. But it's it's sort of never real hot, never real cold. It's Goldilocks just right.Moderator: Nice kind of like Denver or San Diego, they say, has, like.Participant: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, I've heard San Diego. My dad was stationed in San Diego for a lot of times, and with my mother. And they said, the weather is just perfect. I mean, you go to Los Angeles, and it's horrible, and you go back to Diego, and there you are. So.Moderator: Huh?Moderator: Well, Sir, we really want to appreciate you taking time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so valuable to help us as we continue to work to make sure that the va.gov. Site is working for veterans.Participant: Feel free to call on me again sometime, if you want me to look at a later version of it.Participant: and and be as hypercritical as I was at this time around, but.Moderator: Absolutely. Yeah. We can all pass that along to Perigan. And actually they will also be sending you a thank you. Note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans if you know any that would like the the opportunity to participate in research studies just like this. So.Participant: Sounds good. Okay.Moderator: Thanks again for your time today, Sir, enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: Say hello to Nebraska for me.Moderator: I definitely will.Participant: Did you go to the World Series.Moderator: Oh, yeah, my son's birthday is almost always right in in that time, so his his birthday is June 14.th So we went to the it was Alabama versus who did they play? Was like Alabama and Arkansas, I think, is the game. It was.Participant: It's a great stadium. No place to park, but it's a great stadium.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Like that, and we like to go to storm chasers down in papillion. That's really nice, too. So.Moderator: That's nice. The what they call it the chuck now cause it used to be the Td. Ameritrade, and then Charles Schwab bought it out so.Participant: Oh, yeah. Chuck.Moderator: It's called the Chuck, and then they got what is it? What's the one down in papellion? It's owned by the trucking company?Participant: Yeah, I know which trucking company that is.Moderator: Right off. 144th Street.Participant: You're right? Yeah.Moderator: Warner Warner for Enterprise Warner Enterprises. Yeah, it's a good.Participant: See the Werner trucks down here. I mean, they're everywhere.Moderator: Oh, yeah, yeah. Warner's huge, huge, huge.Participant: Been around a long time.Moderator: Absolutely.Participant: Alright, sir! Well, good talking to you, and stay cool.Moderator: Sir, you have. You have a good day. Yeah, it's thankfully. It's kind of overcast here today. We might get a little bit of rain, so keep us cool for all these 100 degrees.Participant: Add to the humidity. Yeah.Moderator: Right, exactly.Participant: Okay, alright, bye, for now.Moderator: You take care.Participant: Bye.Moderator: Bye.
