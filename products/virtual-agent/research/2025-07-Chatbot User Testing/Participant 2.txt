Participant 2 Ð July 22, 2025 Ð 1 PM ESTModerator: You know, like, make sure that our notes are accurate, and to show clips to other veterans. AndModerator: we've got that and the transcript going. Okay. So before we get started, I'm going to tell you a little bit about what we're doing in this session. We are going to be doing some testing on Chatbots. I'll be asking you a number of questions with our 3 proof of concept Chatbots. So please keep in mind for this proof of concept. We are focusing specifically on login or sign in help.Moderator: and the bots may not all be optimized to give the fastest response times or the best answers. But that's what we're here testing for today. SoModerator: before we get into the tasks and the questions, let me ask you a few questions. So are you using any assistive technology like screen readers during this task today.Participant: No, I'm not.Moderator: Okay, what device and operating system and browser are you using for this testing.Participant: Alright it's a macbook air.Moderator: Okay.Participant: 15 inch. M. 3, 2024.Moderator: Okay.Participant: The brow. The Mac OS is Sequoia, 15.5.Moderator: Alrighty.Moderator: I just pulled it up so I don't have it all memorized. And then the browser is.Participant: Safari. Do you need the model?Participant: Nope, okay, just safari.Moderator: Just to safari orModerator: chrome, or whatever you're using. All right. So next question is, how familiar are you with chat bots? Have you used them in the past.Participant: Chat bots.Participant: A little familiar I've had very poor success with them, and I'm not a fan. So great! If that's what we're doing today. Maybe maybe it'll be better than they've been.Moderator: Okay, so do you know which one specifically, you would have worked with in the past.Participant: I've never used any on va va.gov, but I've used them on Verizon.Participant: trying to think what else I use it. I just use it on triple a. It was awful.Participant: a a few other commercial ones, those kinds of things, I mean just typical websites, I think, Florida power and light. I think I've used there, but I've never used one on Va. At least not that. Not that I I'm I'm pretty sure I've never used a chatbot on Va.Moderator: So how many times would you say? Use Chatbot? Let's just say, in the last month.Participant: Once and again I actively avoid using them. I.Moderator: Just had Charlotte.Participant: Jeez.Moderator: Once in the last month. So how many would you say in the last 6 months? Then.Participant: 4.Moderator: 4. Okay, perfect.Moderator: So if you can find your chat window at the bottom of the screen menu there, I've gone ahead, and I've put in a link.Moderator: Okay, for for you to open. And this is for our 1st proof of concept, and if you can open itModerator: and then share your window. If you look at the bottom of the menu in here, there's a little green arrowModerator: pointing up to share.Participant: I'm sorry. Where am I looking.Moderator: So once you get that link open switch back to the zoom window, and at the very bottom menu there should be aModerator: a little share. Button mine. Mine has a green arrow.Participant: I'm just closing out other apps really quickly. Just so I can do all that. So I'm closing out everything else. And then the only thing that will appear open isParticipant: zoom and safari. Okay, accomplished back on zoom.Participant: And I'm sorry. Now what I'm not. Oh, share. Okay, so and share application windows or safari.Moderator: You can. You can share your safari screen. If that'sParticipant: There's just 2 of them application windows and safari unknown. So I click on safari unknown.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Okay, got it open system settings.Moderator: Oh, you may have to give permissions. Correct? Yeah. You might have to give permissions for Zoom to useModerator: your camera and or your screen sharing rather.Participant: It says that I have to quit and reopen.Moderator: It says you have to quit and reopen zoom.Participant: Says Zoom may not be able to record the contents of your screen. So let's quit. Let me just try the later option first, st so we don't.Moderator: I have to.Participant: Cancel the zoom and start all over.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Okay, are you seeing the screen or no?Moderator: Not quite yet. Let's give it a sec.Participant: If not, I can do that, and then I I don't mind logging back in.Moderator: Sure. Yeah, you may have to do it just to get the permissions to go through.Participant: Returning it. I'm hitting click on, quit and reopen. I I'm assuming it's gonna disconnect us. So I will just connect right back up.Moderator: Sure sounds good. Thanks, sir.Participant: Yup. Thank you.Moderator: See you in a sec.Moderator: and he's back.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Now let's see if you're able to share your screen.Participant: Share my screen. Okay, now, it's showing a bunch of options for sharing my screen.Moderator: Okay.Participant: So I can share. Suff.Participant: Ari, okay, good share. Safari.Moderator: Now I see it. Okay.Participant: All right, allow.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Now, if you switch back in that other tab there, you can see.Participant: All right. Good clicking on this launch. All right. We are all set.Moderator: Perfect. So what I want you to do is go ahead and take your time and acclimate yourself.Moderator: If you need to take a go ahead and read the theModerator: little introduction that we have there, and whenever you're comfortable, go ahead and click, start.Participant: Okay, our chat Bot can't help you. If you're experiencing a personal medical or mental health emergency, go to the nearest emergency room.Participant: I would actually do a wording change on that, because it's confusing me already, and I'm a prettyParticipant: go to the nearest chat room, and I would put or dial 9, 9, 8, 8, or call the fact that it says, go to near the nearest emergency room, comma dial 9, 8 to me, that's all. One command.Participant: So I would I would absolutely put an or in there.Participant: or a semicolon, and then an or to make it clear, I mean, like probably like semicolons, just to make it absolutely clear.Participant: AndParticipant: and frankly, I would put 9 1 1 1st before 9, 8 8, I mean, that's just me. I'm I'm you're looking for feedback. I'm telling you that I think it's crazy that you would put 9 1 1 last, not not like upfront.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Sounds good.Participant: Please don't type any personal information such as your name, address, or anything else that can be used to identify you. Okay, great. I don't need to read all this. VA. Chat bot stuff on the left. Okay, good. So I'm gonna click on chat, start chat unless you disagree.Moderator: Absolutely yep. Go right ahead.Participant: Alright! Alright! I'm clicking all right. Welcome to the chat. BotParticipant: can help you find general information to get started.Participant: Try and earn questions like, Okay.Moderator: Okay, so what I'm gonna.Participant: To me. That's yeah. I'm just noticing. So what's the pack deck to me is a general question. What is my claim claim status?Participant: Is my personalParticipant: information, not general information, and it just said a moment ago, don't enter any personal information, so I'm a little confused.Moderator: Okay, duly noted.Moderator: I see what you're saying.Moderator: So what I'm going to do then, is, as I explained in our intro that we're given the use case to talk about signing in. So what I'd like you to do is to type in. How can I sign in to Va and then take a few minutes to interact with the response that it gives. You feel free to speak out loud. Your thoughts would that you've been doing so far, and your actions as you explore the Chatbot.Participant: Okay.Participant: Alright. So these are my logins. IParticipant: well, my understanding is that my healthy vet? I thought that went away a few weeks ago I thought I got an update that is gone now. Sure.Participant: And Ds login is awful.Participant: It's just the most painstaking thing id dot me is typically what I use because it's nice and simple. login.gov requires me to use some authentication app on my phone, which is kind of frustrating. Id dot me is just very simple. So I just usually use that because it seems to be very secure. And why go through all the other rigmarole? If I don't have to. With all that other craziness.Moderator: Okay. So go ahead. Then, if that's the one you prefer, click on your preferred answer that you see there.Participant: All right.Participant: Do you need to want to create a new one? Or do you need your help with an existing account?Participant: Okay, this is also very confusing, because I thought it would.Participant: I don't understand why it's giving me all this information about creating an account or needing help with an account. I thought we were just gonna log in.Moderator: Okay. Perfect. Good.Participant: So I don't need any of those. So to me, this just feels like another chat bot experience where it's like, you know, D, none of the above are kind of like my responses for most things with chat bots. They don't seem to be very, I mean, maybe one day they'll be smart, but right now they don't feel like they are. And this is like my typical experiences.Moderator: So just for the heck of it. Go ahead and select one of those 3 options.Participant: Well, I'm not gonna click on back, because if I click on back, then I have to do a different one. And I'm not doing any of those, so help with my account or create a new account. So that's I'm not.Moderator: There's there's 4th option, too, where you can type a new message in. You talk type back and you know, and have a conversation, and maybe just say, no. I like you said no. I wanted to log in. So maybe type in, you know. No, I I just need to log in.Participant: Okay, select from the following topics, or try rephrasing your question.Participant: All right. So manage benefits, health appointments or Gi bill.Participant: So to me this is unnecessary, because if we're logging in, it should just take me to log in. And then I figure that out once I get logged in. So this is allParticipant: lovely, but my experience with logging in is once I'm logged in, I can pick and choose what I want to do after I get past theParticipant: the gate. If that if I make senseParticipant: let's see. So I don't do Gi. Bill, I'm done with those years ago, so manage benefits. They're stable. So I'm gonna click on health appointmentsParticipant: all right to schedule, cancel and manage some health appointments online. Please go to schedule and manage appointments. Page that answer your question.Participant: Okay? So that's again a whole extra stepParticipant: to me. It should have just taken me to log in right away, and said, here you go to log in.Moderator: Sure.Participant: So now it's wasting my time, and now it's schedule and manage health appointments. And then it's asking me a question. Did that answer my question, yes or no.Participant: andParticipant: the schedule and manage health appointments is much smaller. So to me, the 1st thing that catches my eye is the yes and no, I feel like I'm supposed to be answering yes or no.Participant: And so I'm gonna just say yes, just for the fun of it, because that's my first, st you know.Participant: So I click on. Yes, okay, great rate. My experience. All right. Va always needs pats on the back. Gets a little exhausting.Participant: So.Participant: and that link is still up there, but that to me that should have been bigger, you know, if that's what I'm trying to do. That should have been the the biggest thing on the screen.Moderator: Okay. And if you'd like, feel free to click that to see if.Participant: All right.Moderator: You 2 years.Participant: On it. Yep.Moderator: Destination. Yeah.Participant: So looks like it's opening a new window, which is fine.Participant: so manage health appointments and sign in or create. So that is great. And like I was mentioning before. Can you see my me moving, my mouse.Moderator: Yes, absolutely.Participant: So there's my choices. So it's nice that it brought me to that one. But save the extra stop I I was candidly, I wasn't an executive at a State Veterans Agency, one of the largest in the country for a number of years, 3 in command of the agency, and I oversaw public affairs, including managing the website. And one ofParticipant: one of the positions that I took with the agency was that no one should have to click more than more thanParticipant: you know, once to get to wherever they're trying to go.Participant: So you know, main screen. And then it's here is where it is, but no 7 layers of drop down menus and and whatever.Participant: So that's just.Moderator: Soon.Participant: Anyway, just making that a point that we shouldn't have had all this. It should have brought me right to here. In the 1st placeParticipant: also. This should have you know this. This should just be. This should be bigger on the sign in page. That's probably not. That's outside, probably the scope of what you're doing today. ButParticipant: you know there's a whole lot going on in this page like a whole lot of things. And the biggest thing is this title across the top that shouldn't be bigger than what it is that I'm trying to do.Moderator: Okay.Participant: So sign in or create. So are we gonna sign in?Participant: Do you want me to sign in.Moderator: If you'd like, you don't have to sign in, if you no.Participant: Okay, well, I'm not gonna sign in unless it helps with the chat bot experience. But then we're outside of that.Moderator: Yep, exactly. This is exactly where we needed to go, soModerator: all right, we'll we'll we'll move along to the question portion then. So did this answer your question.Participant: Well, when I asked the question of, I just need to log in eventually. Yes, it did through a lot of convolutions, and we've had a lot of discussions who had to think about that. But yes.Moderator: So do you believe all information was provided.Participant: Well, I just asked to log in, and it brought me to the login page. So I guess that's a yes.Moderator: Okay.Participant: This wasn't like an information. Heavy request.Moderator: Sure.Participant: I'm gonna ask. I've got another one that I'd like to test drive. Now that we're doing this when we get.Moderator: You actually will. That's that's the 3rd task that we have is you to to ask your own question.Participant: Okay. Good.Moderator: We'll get there. So let me ask you how easy or difficult was it for you to find your what you needed.Participant: Well, moderately.Participant: I mean, candidly, there's this big sign in, you know, this sign in that's blue on the top.Participant: So I just I know how to sign in already, so I would have never used the chat bot to figure out how to sign in. But if I'm imagining for a moment that I'm a veteran who wasn't experienced. It brought me there. I mean it, you know it. It could be fine tuned like we talked about a moment ago, but it got me here, so it I think it accomplished the task for somebody who doesn't know how to get here. Also.Moderator: Okay, did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Well a little, just in the fact that Va just ex, you know, uses excessive words on everything. Va. IsParticipant: consistently, and I've I've done a few of these kinds of things before, and it's like somebody at the top of Va. Needs to make a command decision to to simplify things like what most of the Internet is. So when you get on Verizon or you get on apple.com, or you get on Amazon, or whatever everything is mostly pretty simplified. Va. Is, you know. It's better than it was.Participant: But on and on, with all these paragraphs of text and whatever, and you know goes on and on what you can do when you sign on, and everything this goes on forParticipant: goes on for pages. And then there's all these, you know, 50 links at the bottom, and everything else that this is crap. This is, this is, I mean, this is an amateur website. Candidly.Moderator: Okay, soModerator: let's move on. Then, if you could close this tab, let's go back to the chat window in the in the chat. Bot.Participant: And I guess I should just to further answer that question. This could make it confusing. If I'm looking for something, it just makes it confusing to to find. And and I want to ask you a question while we're here. Can I use the chat bot while I'm in here to find what I'm looking for while I'm in here, or after I've signed in.Moderator: You can switch back to the other tab and use it, but you have to close. You can either click on the tab or close this tab.Participant: Okay. So not not gonna do that. And that would be very confusing.Participant: Yeah. So it's not so the the point. I'm the takeaway point that I'm getting is that the chat bot is not well integrated intoParticipant: this part of the website.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Sounds good.Participant: Alright, so should I. Can I close this tab now and go back to the right.Moderator: Close that tab.Participant: There we are, all right.Moderator: Now, what I'd like. Now, what I'd like you to do isModerator: to ask the question I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits.Moderator: And again, do do just as you did. Take a few minutes to interact with it. See?Participant: I need to help my dad get his benefits.Moderator: Get, get his benefits exactly, Yup, and do the same thing. You did just kind of talk out loud, and as you walk through.Participant: All right, got it.Participant: So it's a very long hover. And now it just came back. Select from the following topics, or try rephrasing your question again justParticipant: too too much.Participant: We don't need 2 separate sub phrases just.Participant: I would I would actually make a 4th button. I would just pop up these buttons.Participant: and then I would have a 4th button. If this is me designing this to make it simple, it'd be veterans, benefits accredited. Representative Va. Health application services, and then I have a 4th one. Re rephrase your question.Participant: and then it would just kick me back to.Participant: you know, re-enter a question or whatever. But then we don't have this whole. Read this.Participant: It's just I don't know. It just feels excessive to me of why I got to read all that. And then, whatever. I'm just looking for some simple answer, and I'm probably probably, if I'm a child of a veteran.Participant: it's probably overwhelming and confusing already just super super simplify everything. So I'm gonna click on veterans benefits, because that seems likeParticipant: what it would be va accredited representative is va garble.Participant: I don't know what an accredited representative is. What's that different from a non accredited representative or other kinds of representatives? What does that even mean? Why do I need accredited. So you know, I would be connect with a representativeParticipant: or something simpler. I know I'm a veteran advocate. I know what an accredited representative is. I just a recommendation letter for for someone, for for being accredited the other day. But if I'm outside the system, what what does that mean? And it just adds more confusion. Get rid of the garble, for for in whatever? And then Va. Application servicesParticipant: again. More garble, you know, file an application for Va. Health care or something super simple.Participant: and you know we don't need to start with. Va, it's you know.Participant: I mean veterans benefits. I suppose that's pretty clear. Maybe you could make it clear. I don't know. That looks pretty clear to me. But the other 2 need work. So I'm gonna click on veterans benefits, because that's what we're talking about, unless you object.Moderator: No absolutely go ahead!Participant: All right. Done, all right. Now, we've got this whole long paragraph.Participant: whether you transitioned out of service recently or decades ago, or either family member.Participant: Okay, we could eliminate that entire 1st paragraph.Participant: We don't need all that introduction and whatever again. Va, just get rid of all the words just.Participant: And you don't need to go to, just.Participant: you know. Click, getting started with Va, you don't need the word page click, you know.Participant: Click!Participant: Getting started with Va. To learn more about benefits and servicesParticipant: and skip all the rest of it. Just click getting started with Va. To learn more about Va. Benefits and services period. Get rid of all the rest of that crap. You can eliminate like 80% of those words, and then.Moderator: So.Participant: Did did that answer your question?Participant: Is again. This is the same confusing thing is.Participant: you know, put the blue box down here. They were able clearly up here we were able to clearly, well, it's gone now.Participant: But clearly we were able to select those should stay up there, those 3, those 3 boxes, because if I selected wrong, they should stay up on the screen.Participant: so that just like this link is still here, the schedule and manage appointments, those 3 links, because if I click the wrong one. I want to go back. I don't want to have to start all over again.Participant: so leave the 3 up there, and just like, I said, for options. Put those options there, andParticipant: stop with all the feedback. Did that answer your question, you know. Just put another link at the bottom, rephrase my question, or start over, or whatever, but have 2 boxes, and the 1st box isParticipant: getting started with Va.Participant: And if you want a description, or whatever, then great, but just just make it simple. So I'll click on the link. But it should be a blue button. It shouldn't be a link.Moderator: Okay.Participant: All right clicking on that.Participant: All right. I would like if it saidParticipant: something of when you click on this, it's gonna take you outside the chat box. But you can come back to this if you need to. I'm really familiar with what's just happened here that it opened a new tab.Participant: But I would say, actually give somebody a warning that when you click on this it's going to open a new tab. But you can come back to this one. If you need to.Moderator: Sure. Okay.Participant: Alright! So here we are!Moderator: Morning. Modal is what you're saying.Participant: Okay. Yep.Participant: So I hate this. It took me here with getting started with Va. This didn't take me to some benefits, Page. And again. I'm scrolling through pages of information. This isParticipant: more just awful. Va.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: All right, let's go ahead, then, and move on to the the question section for this response. So did this answer your question.Moderator: No, I'm looking for information about Va. Benefits from my dad. And this started with getting started with Va.Participant: And I suppose if I read all of this.Participant: but if this is actually smart, which is clearly not, I said about my dad, so it should have already taken me frankly. It should have taken me to this 4 family membersParticipant: right here.Moderator: It shouldn't have taken me to this whole long page getting started with Va. When big letters.Participant: I mean, I thought we already started with Va. Was doing the chat box thing soParticipant: and and frankly, if it'sParticipant: I suppose it could have taken me here to this, for family members.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Well, and that's not actually what I'm looking for, either, because for family membersParticipant: is actually Va benefits for family members. I'm a family member looking for information from my dad. So this does notParticipant: help me to get to what I'm looking for. This is very confusing, and I'm trying to sort out some awful government website thatParticipant: I don't know.Participant: I'm scrolling through all this quickly trying to figure out what I'm looking for. I'm a busy person looking for. You know my dad in the midst of while I'm caregiving for Dad while I'm in the midst ofParticipant: managing his prescriptions and his whatever else, while I'm also working a full time job. And maybe there's kids at home, too. So this is, this is overwhelming and not not good.Moderator: So you'd say it's pretty difficult to find exactly what you needed.Participant: I would rank it as most difficult.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Participant: Second, most second, most difficult.Moderator: Alright, if you will please close this window now you're gonna get the chance to ask your own question in the chat. Bot. Feel free to put whatever you want and can be related to logging in can be related to Va. Or it could be anything you like.Participant: Okay with.Participant: Well, I'll leave it, General, and see if it's specialized. And you can see what I'm writing right.Moderator: Yes, yeah, absolutely.Participant: Okay, so good. It's giving me some choices, not enough choices. Va. Reach.Participant: I am an Lgbtq veteran, and I'm a i'm a veteran's advocate. For many years I have no idea what Va reaches.Moderator: Hmm.Participant: No idea what that is.Moderator: So.Participant: Specify what it is in plain language, not in va gobbledygook you know.Participant: Technical. Speak whatever sexual harassment, assault veterans crisis line. So I could think of several other options. One is, maybe I needParticipant: My 1st thing was, perhaps I'm not a trans veteran. I'm just a gay male, cisgendered veteran. But if I was trans.Participant: I might need some healthcare assistance. Being aParticipant: you know. I just maybe I need a healthcare issue. There's no healthcare options in here, unless Va reaches healthcare. I don't even know what that means.Participant: the second one that I'm thinking of is maybe I'm finally ready to deal with having been sexually assaulted in the military. And I need, you know, I want to talk to a mental health counselor.Moderator: Or I want to make a mental health appointment.Participant: So I suppose I'm clicking on sexual harassment assault. But to me that feels more like I'm gonna click on it and see what happens, I guess, but to be what I think. It's gonna take me to see if it proves me wrong. But I think it's gonna take me to. I was sexually assaulted or harassed at the Va. Not talking about something that happened long ago. But maybe I'm wrong. We'll click on and see what happens.Participant: Okay. It gave me a long paragraph information, and it's all gone off my screen.Participant: A long paragraph. This should have taken me to a page, or I should have done something, but it should never pop up like I can't even seeParticipant: everything that it's supposed to see.Participant: Harassment and sexual assault can happen to anybody. Okay, I don't needParticipant: all that. It's never your fault. We're here to help you.Participant: Okay, someone makes you feel unsafe at Va, call 9 1 1.Participant: Okay, this whole thing needs a comprehensive rework. ByParticipant: excused, I was about to curse. But a professional this is, this is unacceptable.Participant: When you're ready, learn how to report an incident. Va, okay, great. So that'sParticipant: great to learn more about treatment. So this is giving me more than one option. So that is good, that is helpful. That might be what I'm looking for. So I, this is what I was thinking of. So I'm gonna click on that eventually. But I'm gonna see what else is here.Moderator: Sure.Participant: How to file a disability claim related to. So that's good. That that's giving me a prompt for thatParticipant: to learn how to get support for Ptsd go to the Mental Health Services page, if you just want to talk to somebody.Participant: Okay.Participant: this is in paragraph form. This should be in bullet form with all these options. This is too confusing, because the numbers are split up, and it's hard for me to figure out what's happening there.Participant: And Tty, and all of that is.Participant: Put them all as separate bullets. Call the veterans crisis Line at 9, 8, 8, or whatever. I don't know what 9, 8, 8 is, I'm guessing that must be some new thing like 9 1 1. i'm not familiar with it. So I don't really know. Does that even work on my phone.Participant: I don't. I don't know what that is.Moderator: Or text. This number, okay, great. And then call the women's call center.Participant: Okay, so that's great. I happen to be a male veteran. Happens to a lot of male veterans happened to me candidly. While in military service. I understand that it's happened to a lot of other male veterans perpetrated by both female and male veterans against male veterans so great that we have women's call center there. ButParticipant: you know, having something for men. If you're going to put up, women have something for men as well.Participant: I understand that it happens disproportionately in percentages to women, but it happens to more there are more raw numbers of men who it's happened to, because there's simply more men in the military. So, having having something there, I think would be, would be more appropriate. Did that answer your question again, you know. Same same feedback about that. So my interest here I was. My, my thought was, I'm looking for a military sexual trauma page. So I would. I'm gonna click on that just to see what happens unless you disagree.Moderator: No go ahead!Participant: By clicking on it to see where it takes me.Participant: Okay. GreatParticipant: tells me about mst, I like that. It's got right here how I can talk to somebody right now. I'm interested in all that. So that's good. I don't feel like I need to talk to somebody right now, but I'm interested inParticipant: what kind of services I can contact the Mst coordinator.Participant: Okay?Participant: So I identified that I'm an Lgbtq veteran happened to be a gay male veteran.Moderator: Okay.Participant: I would really like something on here that's focused on my particular experiences as well, which once upon a time, Va. Did those kinds of things I don't know, but on this particular page I know that it's been removed from the bottom of the page here, where it has women veterans, minority veterans used to say, Lgbtq veterans as well. I think it's a disservice to veterans like me and theParticipant: many, many hundreds of you know, tens hundreds of thousands of us, maybe millions of us who served, who don't have that as a clear link up front. I think that's unacceptable. I don't give a fuck about some administration's politics that they'd like or don't like. Put it up there. This is, you know, we served, and we may need services related to that I was sexually assaulted by a male platoon sergeant in the military, and I happen to be gay.Participant: He didn't know that I didn't know that at the at the time yet, but that's a that's a distinct area of of service. It it should be there.Moderator: Okay, well, thank you so much for that feedback.Moderator: Let's go ahead then and close this window and ask just a couple following.Participant: Questions.Moderator: About this 3, rd or excuse me this 1st option. So was the answer. Was this the answer that you were expecting.Participant: Was long, but it had multiple options, which I think is good. Again, the chat bot needs to be resized, or something to accommodate all of that you could, you know again, somebody needs to go in here with the editing and make this a lot shorter, you know. 8 o'clock Am. To 10 o'clock Pm. Eastern time.Participant: You can make 8 Am. To 10 pm. Et.Participant: And make it super short, and you could get rid of a lot of characters, and whateverParticipant: there for all of these things, and and across the board, I mean, somebody should just edit the daylights out of everything.Moderator: Right. So again, it seems like you were overwhelmed by the amount of information that was provided, and it was.Participant: But I ultimately found what I was looking for, which is a positive unlike the last. Unlike the last one we're looking for something as simple asParticipant: you know, looking for benefits for my dad.Moderator: All right.Moderator: That completes the questions. For the 1st Chatbot.Participant: Okay.Moderator: If you go back and look atModerator: your zoom workplace meeting, there is a link for our second chat. Bot!Participant: All right, clicking on that.Moderator: Yeah. And now this is, gonna ask you to put your email address in the one that we were given for you. Let me just make sureModerator: is the one that will be sent that code, and it looks like for you. It's sir.d.hardy@gmail.com. So ifModerator: you put the yep, put that in there and then check your email, it'll give you a code.Moderator: Just okay.Participant: And are you? Are you seeing my screen for that, too, or just the.Moderator: But you know you don't. You don't have to share your screen like you can pull it up from your phone, or you can stop sharing whatever whatever you're comfortable with, I absolutely.Participant: Are you sure? Are you seeing my entire computer? Are you only seeing in safari.Moderator: I can only see safari.Participant: Okay.Participant: Well, I'm gonna pull it up here on my phone. Then, just to.Moderator: All right.Participant: I don't have anything there.Participant: Oh, I'm in the wrong one. Sorry.Moderator: Cloudflare access. Exactly. That's code.Participant: Alright entering code.Participant: It would have been nicer.Participant: To send it as a text message rather than an email. It's a little. It's very unwieldy to log in, you know, to get an email when you're in the middle of something standard on everything except for Va.Participant: you know, if I'm logged into anything else, if it's sending me a code to log in my bank or anything else. Send me a text message. Alright. So here we are.Moderator: Alright. So this is our second one. Once again take your time, and acclimate yourself to the design.Moderator: Read, read all the prompts and stuff there, and whenever you're ready type in, how can I sign into Va like we did the 1st time.Participant: Okay.Moderator: And then, just like you did the 1st time. Go ahead and feel free to speak out loud your thoughts and actions as you explore this chat, Bot.Participant: All right.Participant: Alright, this is just the name of it, right? This isn't actually gonna none of us are actually gonna appear.Moderator: Correct. That's just the name of this version.Participant: Please don't enter any person. Enter personal information.Participant: Yeah. And if you click that.Participant: I would say in the chat, bot.Participant: yeah, actually, that if you click that.Participant: because if I click on this I might think it just told me. Don't enter any personal information. And now and I'm I might hold and carry that with me for a while.Participant: Sure. Alright. So I've got options. How to create a login.Participant: I didn't ask how to create a login.Participant: How can I sign in? I suppose you could interpret it as that? So okay, great. ButParticipant: what if I can't sign in how to verify your identity, how to verify.Participant: Alright. So none of these is correct. I'm actually trying to log in. So I want to log into Va.Participant: Gave me the same options.Moderator: It did.Participant: Well, actually, give me 3 of 4 same options. I'm not gonna go through, and you can figure that out which one it left off, but it still doesn't.Participant: This is how to verify. What if I can't sign in or how to create a login?Participant: I'm I just want to log, in log, in now same options, terrible, not smart.Moderator: All right, so go ahead and answer the feedback question at the bottom. Then.Participant: So thumbs down.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And then. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions.Participant: All right.Moderator: Did these answers make sense.Participant: Did the answers make sense.Moderator: Yes.Participant: Well.Participant: the answers themselves make sense. They didn't answer my question. They didn't help me to get to what I'm trying to do.Moderator: Okay, perfect, was all information provided.Participant: No, I mean, I asked the most basic.Participant: you know. Question if I'm trying to log in. These are all troubleshooting, why, I can't log in and all these other things, but didn't actually help me to log in. So no.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: Was it difficult or easy to find what you needed.Participant: It was impossible.Participant: I didn't find what I needed.Moderator: Did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Again. Yes, to both of those. These are too long. So what if I can't sign into va.gov. Because my password doesn't work?Participant: Why not? Just say problem signing in.Moderator: Right.Participant: Something simple. I mean, please, Va, if anybody is listening, take lessons from corporate America that does all this stuff really well. And Va. Does not.Moderator: Got it perfect. Then we're gonna move on to the second task that we did during the 1st half of the 1st chat, Bot, and ask. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: I need to help my dadParticipant: log log in to get his benefits. Information.Moderator: You got it.Participant: Okay, is that the same question we asked the last time.Moderator: Yes, sir.Participant: I was thinking it was I needed to.Participant: I didn't realize we're trying to log. In the last time I thought I was actually out trying to help my dad get his benefits.Moderator: Hmm!Moderator: That's exactly the same.Participant: 1st time around. Okay, that's my confusion.Moderator: No worries.Participant: So via Chatbot gave me the same stuff.Participant: I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Formation.Participant: Okay? Troubleshooting, managing your profile.Participant: Ds login fax! I didn't ask for that. What if I can't sign in.Moderator: Because my password doesn't work.Participant: Okay, I'd have to have more information on what? Like, what's the basis of my question, like.Participant: I don't understand, you know.Participant: if if I'm in my character role here. I don't. I don't have enough.Participant: Yes, thank you.Moderator: No problem.Moderator: Alright. So then again, we're just gonna say that.Moderator: The answer, then didn't make sense. You weren't given enough contextModerator: so would you say you need more information? Yes, obviously, if you if you're having difficulties with your context, well.Participant: I'm having difficult with context, with a character role that I'm playing.Moderator: Sure.Participant: So I don't know how. I don't know whether this answers my question or not, because I don't really know what my character role is. But if I'm looking at this, I'll just imagineParticipant: I need help logging in this helps with.Participant: If it was a password issue, it helps with that. If I haven't switched to login.gov or idme, it's great.Moderator: So what?Participant: And if I'm if I'm looking to log in.Moderator: Right, this is this.Participant: Need to log in.Moderator: About benefits information. So let's just say maybe he's wanting to know, like a copay or his coverage for.Participant: This is all troubleshooting on like technical login issues from some. It help desk thing. This is not helping me to actually get Dad's benefit. Information so no, not helpful.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: All right. Then, we're going to move on to just like you did last time.Moderator: Think of anything you like, put in any promptModerator: and take your time and work through it. It can be the same as you had last time, or it can be a different one, or it can be.Participant: Are you able to read me the exact wording of what I said the last time? Or can you not do that? Because I'd like to do the exact same thing again, if we can.Moderator: Yeah, I can pull up the transcript here and take a look.Participant: I'll just do exactly the same as like literally the same words.Moderator: You, said I. I am an Lgbtq veteran, and I need help because you were gonna start to type other things.Moderator: And then you decided to just make it more broad.Participant: Leave it, general, and then see what options it gives me.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Okay, well, this is much worse than the other one.Participant: So this has nothing to do with.Participant: This is all about signing things.Participant: This is, yeah, this is by far a worse Chatbot than the other one. This one isParticipant: even less smart.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay?Moderator: So not the answer you were you were expecting. Obviously.Participant: Not even close.Moderator: Yeah. The information you needed was not provided.Participant: No, not even close.Moderator: Yep, and I would say, easier difficult to find what you needed, and and.Participant: Impossible. This is like gibberish. It's like, you know, what's the weather today? And it told me, tomorrow is Tuesday.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: All right, perfect. Then let's move on to the last section. If you look at the top header there, you'll see component 3. Next to component 2 in the purple at your left hand side. Yeah.Participant: Okay, good. So assuming this is another, very okay. Great.Moderator: 3rd option. So go ahead just like we did the 1st time. Take your time and read all of the information there in the light blue box at the top.Participant: Okay.Moderator: That's kind of your little your intro.Participant: I'd like to see a little information button. So I'm gonna click on information.Participant: Oh, well, that was not good. So that just bumped me out of the whole thing. So I'm gonna click on the back button.Participant: And it clicked on all of that. I wanted more information. I mean, it would give me more information about thisParticipant: when it's actually fully functional and understand, this is just a mock up. So no worries. But it should not do what it just did. Eventually, I'd like to see another information button thereParticipant: about AI generated. I'm my 1st thought is, I have questions about AI.Participant: I would like to learn more about what is using. What is gathering. Is this safe? Is it private?Participant: Anything you know like? Ask more questions about AI before I proceed, because I may feelParticipant: safe or unsafe about? There's a lot of questions out there about AI. Personally, I'm interested in you know whatParticipant: what what AI platform or model, or whatever they're called, is, what is it using? Is it using Google? Gemini is using a chat Gpt version. So what version is it doing into those things? If I have more knowledge about AI. I might be interested in those things, but for sure I'd like to be able to.Participant: This generated some discomfort. I may never enter a question here. If I have discomfort.Moderator: Got it. That's great feedback. I really, we really appreciate that.Participant: Well, so.Moderator: Let's go ahead as we did with the 1st 2 chat bots. Whenever you're ready. Type in, how can I sign into Va.Participant: Okay, how can I sign into? Va.Participant: I like that. It's got a little waiting message.Moderator: Hmm.Participant: I like that a lot. So it tells me that something is happening rather than just waiting. And did it take, or did it not take.Participant: A long time.Moderator: Longer than the other ones.Participant: Really long time.Participant: Okay, at this point I'm about worn out from waiting. I would have decided to do something else if this was just me if I wasn't doing this for you.Moderator: Sure.Participant: That's too long way too long. And it's a simple question. It wasn't. You know. I'm asking about the history of the universeParticipant: from, you know, whatever this wasn't complicated.Moderator: Right.Participant: Okay, so va chatbotParticipant: to sign into va.gov, you can either use a login.gov or an id dot me account again.Participant: Edit the daylights out of this and make it simple and clear. I don't need to read an entire.Participant: you know. 10th grade essay on how to log in.Moderator: Sure.Participant: This is confusing.Participant: If you don't have a login.gov account, you can create oneParticipant: by following the steps on the Va website. Well.Participant: where is that? I should be able to do something right here to access that if I'm looking to do that once you have an account. Okay, this is all just super confusing.Participant: Oh, gosh! I'm having some real fear right now that Va is gonna screw up using AI like it, you know. Va's had terrible problems with it. For decades. I've been around Va. Since 1994, and it's gotten better than it was. But it has a long, long ways to go. Take some fucking lessons from corporate America Va. Like it's not that hard excuse my language, but that expresses my level of frustration with Va. And I'mParticipant: you know, pretty good at figuring out what I need to do. This is justParticipant: it's like, put 50 cooks in a pot, andParticipant: you know and see what happens. AndParticipant: oh, we're gonna use AI now, and it sounds like a great idea, and nobody test drives it to see if it actually works. I'm glad you're doing this today. This needs a lot of help. This needs a whole lot of help. So this is a bunch ofParticipant: garble. It's gonna take me some real serious thinking. I'm trying to kind of multitask here today. I'm thinking about talking with you as well.Moderator: Sure.Participant: So I can really focus on this. I guess, to figure out if this actually gives me what I'm trying to do. I just want to sign into Va.Participant: So this gave me all those options again for troubleshooting.Participant: None of those is correct.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: I actually still want the same thing. So it just gave me even more words for the same problem that the other one gave me this didn't. This was just as bad as the other one.Participant: I I just. I just want to log in. Now, pleaseParticipant: long hoverParticipant: again if they don't perfect the speed of that. Okay, that's a little better. So that's good. The last one was so long that I I would haveParticipant: done something else.Participant: Via chat, bot to sign in right. NowParticipant: go to the so why can't you put a link there?Participant: You know why, tell me what to do and give me instructions, and then it's all the same thingsParticipant: clearly. What didn't? Why would you repeat?Participant: Why would you re like? Why would this thing repeat to me what clearlyParticipant: it wasn't working already. I didn't say I didn't give the thumbs down. So I'm going to give a thumbs down. It didn't answer my question.Participant: Thank you for your feedback.Participant: Okay, that's pointless. Why doesn't it tell me if it didn't answer my question like, try and help me.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay, so.Participant: So candidly.Moderator: Enter.Participant: Works.Moderator: Answer did not make sense, and.Participant: Worthless.Moderator: Okay. And do you.Participant: Did not make sense.Moderator: Okay, do you feel that all information was provided.Participant: No, no, it still didn't give me the information on how to log in. It gave me like this long paragraph of instructions and.Participant: To do all of that, but it didn't actuallyParticipant: tell me like it didn't give me a link to do there like the very 1st one did.Moderator: Yep, so did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Yes, absolutely.Moderator: Okay, all right. So just like we did the last 2Moderator: times, we're going to ask the question about helping Dad get his benefits. So now, if you can, I'd like you to type. I need to help my dadModerator: log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: and we'll see how this one doesModerator: with this task.Participant: If I open another window, will you be able to see it?Moderator: In safari.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Yeah, if as long as it's in safari, I can. Yes.Participant: Perfect. Okay, so I'm gonna keep following your task. But I'd like to do that in a moment.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Okay. Va. Chatbot, if you're a court appointed guardian with legal paperwork on file with Va, okay, this feelsParticipant: oppressive and adversarial. I'm just trying to help my dad. He might be sitting right here with me. He might have dementia. He might have some impairment, whatever. Clearly he needs my help in doing this I'm helping my dad. Presumably he knows that I'm doing it great if I need to be a court appointedParticipant: in order to do it for him where he can't do all of that I mean.Participant: great is V, really gonna put me through all of this to try. And just I just need to find the Login information to get his benefits. So.Moderator: Hmm.Participant: This is a this is, this is crap.Moderator: Too much. Okay.Participant: And and and wrong, and it starts off with.Participant: you know, this whole legal, adversarial thing like, just answer the freaking question.Moderator: Right.Participant: If you're a family member or caregiver who's not a court appointed guardian, the Va veteran needs to sign into their own. Va. Whatever.Participant: Okay, soParticipant: great. Take me to the Login information. And again managing. This is all the same troubleshooting that it's given me. This is the 3rd time it's given me in the same discussion.Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: So answer did not make sense. We can agree.Moderator: Information. Would you say? All the information was provided.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, easier, difficult to find what you need.Participant: Impossible.Moderator: Okay? And did it feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Yes, it's just. It's truly frustrating, and I'll make the comment again in case they didn't catch it the 1st time I click the thumbs down. Don't thank me for my feedback likeParticipant: get try, you know. I mean AI should be trying and trying to come up with something smart.Moderator: Got it.Moderator: So finally, you can think of your own question. Ask the Chatbot. You can stick with the same one that you have before, or you can think of a new one.Participant: Okay, let's let's do the same one again, just to test drive it. We're trying it. 3 different things. And these are the other 2 are kind of about login, so I'd I'd like to see what the other one does, because the 1st 2 were very different from each other.Moderator: Yeah, could you read it back to me?Moderator: Actually, I think you have to. Yeah, I'm in. Yep.Participant: I'm an Lgbtq veteran.Moderator: And I need help.Participant: And I need help.Participant: All right. Great.Participant: alright! Thank you for your service for help with signing into va.gov, or managing your benefits.Participant: Why would I call a phone number to sign in garbage?Participant: Okay.Participant: sentence is completely unnecessary. They can assist you with account and sign in issues. They just told me. If you need help signing in or managing your account.Participant: stop with all the extra words. If you need help verifying your identity, you're setting up your account. Their resources. Okay, great. This is all about whatever. How nice to know all that great, if you need specific assistance with signing in or managing. I'm not asking about signing in. I didn't say anything about signing in. I mentionedParticipant: Lgbtq. Which should be a clue. I mentioned that I'm a veteran. I mentioned I am should include it on any of those 3 sets of words or sets of words, and the phrase I need help.Participant: I need help. I liked how that other one gave.Participant: You know, healthcare benefits, you know, a bunch of different options. This is very bad.Participant: Answer my question. No same feedback as before, it should be smart, and try again.Moderator: Right? Okay.Moderator: that concludes it. Then what I'm going to do is ask you just a quick few post interview questions.Moderator: So yeah, you can close your yeah, there you go so you can.Participant: As an example on the screen. So this is Google. And then it's answering the question here benefits information. So social security.Participant: It's giving social security. I'm going to try again. Va. Benefits information.Participant: And then I'm going to click on AI mode. So access va.gov.Participant: visit the official website. And here it is right here. And here's a link right here. So take a freaking lesson. Va, and this is how it should work.Participant: So AI mode. So there's a lot of words here, too. I would not have all that, but my question was a little vague, but signing in. So here's sign in, how do I sign into? And it's gonna take me to a Va website sign in to create an account. I'm gonna click on one of those in a minute. But sign in or create identity, verification, multi factor, access benefits, information assistance with whatever. Okay? Great. I'm gonna try that one because that's the 1st thing that pops upParticipant: signing into va.gov, and there it is, right there sign in or create an account. Why can't va do this? Come on, do better.Moderator: Yep.Participant: And there it is, and I'm signing in. That's what I needed, Dad. What's your password, you know? Do do better. Va, I'm gonna do the same thing one more time, just to make a point. I.Participant: M.Participant: And I whoops. I can't type here an LGB.Participant: Tq. Veteran.Participant: and I need help. It even is smart, like figuring out how to answer. Fill my question. As an Lgbtq veteran. You have a variety of resources and support systems navigating healthcare. There's Lgbtq veteran coordinators. Why the hell can't va do this right up front Va. Health care services, access to benefits. It's got the smart things right there. Mental health support. There's a crisis line, you know. You can call 988, or whateverParticipant: do it all right there, or chat confidentially online.Participant: It doesn't. I would like that. It told me if I could tell it what to do. I would like that it would ever right there, so I could click on it right there. Mental health resources, Ptsd treatment, legal assistance is anticipating all kinds of questions. It's taking things outside community. So modern Military Association of America is a wonderful advocacy organization for Lgbtq veterans, American veterans for equal rights. I'm not as familiar with them. I've heard about them transgender veterans. I didn't know about them. That's wonderful that there's something out there, pflag forParticipant: parents and friends of veterans, I guess. And then I'm gonna click on. Well, interestingly, the 1st link is a Dav website forParticipant: Mental Health for Va. And Va. Claims insider. So to me, this is suggesting that Va. Because it's deprioritized all these things on its own web page, that Va is no longer that Google is no longer able to find them as quickly as what it did a moment ago for login.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: CrapParticipant: so, and then click on it for Lgbtq veterans. Good! We have actually got a page. It says Lgbtq veterans, I said. That is there? If you are access to services? Good, why can't we do this? Come on, just don't reinvent the wheel implement, use Google, Gemini, or whatever technology they're using. They already do it really? Well, don't create your own. JustParticipant: pick an off the shelf solution and use that shit. It's not hard.Participant: Okay, thank you for letting me do that with you, and that goes somewhere.Moderator: Absolutely no, I.Participant: We could, we could do this, we could do the 3rd one as well of you know. I need help getting my benefits, or whatever. I'm sure it's gonna do the same thing right? You know.Moderator: Yeah, yeah.Participant: Actually just what's on the screen? What was that 1st question? I am trying.Moderator: Long. I well, the 1st one is I'm trying to log into Va.Participant: I am trying to log in to Va.Moderator: How? How can I sign into? Va, yeah, about the same.Moderator: How can I sign into Va.Participant: And I sign into Va.Participant: okay, you'll need to have an account or whatever, and then they're signing into Va, so go to va.gov and select sign in. So I've got a link right there. I'm gonna try that really quickly, just to see if it works.Participant: So create account getting started the Va. But I can look up here. I can see it. I would have liked that. It was there. This is a problem with Va, not with Google. I'm gonna go back just to try the other option signing into via the very 1st one that's there. And there it is, and signing into Va. To create an account, and there it is.Participant: Google, I mean, please, Va, just use something that's off the shelf that actually works, not creating your own. That doesn't thank you.Moderator: Perfect. Well, we we greatly appreciate that feedback.Moderator: Okay, real quick. I'm just gonna go over these last few questions with you.Participant: Yes.Moderator: So this is the post interview.Moderator: So 1st question is, how did you feel while using the chat bot? And were there points where you felt stuck annoyed, or especially satisfied.Participant: Oh, I didn't feel annoyed ever, not even once. So yes, that was for the record. So I put it in words in the case. They can interpret tone that was completely tongue in cheek, and that was not. That was exactly the opposite of how I felt. I felt frustrated. Fairly quickly. I started with an open mind. I, you know, mentioned that I have not had great luck with chat bots in the past. ButParticipant: yeah, it was. It was not a good experience. And when I just did the quick demonstration using GoogleParticipant: using Google.Participant: never should I ever have to leave a proprietary website and use Google to find what I'm looking for on that proprietary website. And then it does a better job. And consistently for decades. That's how it's. I've found things on Va's website is using Google to find them on Via's website, Va, better.Moderator: Okay, did you notice any major differences between the 3? Chatbots.Participant: Yes, the latter 2 one used AI, and it was.Participant: I mean, it was a terrible version of AI, because it basically gave the same.Participant: I'll just say there was number one, number 2, and number 3, and number one was a little smarter, it felt like than the other 2. It gave better information, and even though it was a little unwieldy, it was night and day diff better than the other 2 that just kept giving the same information over and over and over. This felt like very bad chat bots from a couple of years ago.Participant: They just you ask the you know you ask multiple questions, trying to, you know, rephrase your question, to get it, to do something, and it just gives you the same things over and over. Verizon has been like this for me. It's it's been a bad experience over and over and over the same responses, and doesn't actually give you what you want. So 2 and 3 were worse, and the 3 would just gave more words worse.Moderator: Okay, did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning, and did it affect how you use the Chatbot.Participant: Yes, I noticed the disclaimer. I don't remember the one on the 1st one. I think there was some disclaimer, and I don't remember what it said. I just really keyed into the one when it said AI.Participant: I I just would have again. I would have liked that information to be on there. But did it affect how I used it? The fact that it's AI. I guess I have higher expectations that it's going to be able toParticipant: It's gonna be able to interpret what I'm saying it's gonna be able toParticipant: it. It should be better than just one that's sort of programmed of. If you ask any of these things, it feels like the old versions of chat bots like a version. Number 2 feels like a very old, awful, antiquated version of a Chatbot from some years ago. It feels like it just found like one key word. And it found like, maybe info. And then it just decided, well, we're gonna give you troubleshooting information for logging in, or maybe it keyed in on login or something wasn't smart. The 3rd oneParticipant: just had more language, but it still didn't answer anything specific to my requests at all.Participant: So yeah, anyway, I I guess I said more than I need to.Moderator: No, you're good. That's that's what this is about. This is a feedback session, and we're gettingModerator: getting that feedback. And it's very valuable. So last question I have here is, what was the chat? Was the chat bots behavior? What what you expected? And if not, how was it different?Participant: Well.Participant: I am fully prepared for Va. Not being able to get information technology things right. And it met my expectations of failure. So when we did a little example of using Google?Participant: Whatever they're if it's using Gemini or whatever.Participant: It gave all the kind of information that I would have expected for a chat. Bot to provide. I thought that was really very nice. That was a positive experience for me. But all of the 3 experiences were varying degrees of negative from bad toParticipant: completely unacceptable and awful.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: last thing I have here is, do you have any other comments or suggestions, or any questions for me?Participant: The only other comment is that I've done a few of these kinds of feedback sessions over the last few years, and I've seen some of the finished products after afterwards. That V is implemented, and some of them didn't take, you know. Any of any. You know. Some of those critical suggestions to heart.Participant: So if candidly, if Va. Doesn't do a better job at following instructions, and you know, wasting veterans time and then money, they pay us for this. Presumably they're paying you as an employee or a contractor as well. And if it doesn't do a better job ofParticipant: actually heating suggestions that people you know I've got. I've got significant health issues. I'm a veteran advocate. I'm working with a reporter today on a national story. So I'm taking time out of my day. I was dealing with a personal issue a moment ago.Participant: You know, with with the car having to get towed on unexpected because it wasn't functional has to go to the dealership, a bunch of things going on in my life. I'm perfectly capable of wasting my own time. I don't appreciate it. A Va wastes veterans, time, including mine. And if we take the time toParticipant: give her input, I really hope that they'll do it. You're you're a professional I I'm impressed with your interaction skills as well the way that you're doing all this. I have no doubt that you're very good at what you do, and that you. This isn't your 1st project clearly, and you're going to do other projects elsewhere. But I can only imagine as a professional if it's frustrating as well. If you doParticipant: these sessions. And Va. Doesn't bother to heed. You know what what's what's being recommended. I'm not saying that I have every answer in the world but pretty black and white.Participant: If if Google can answer the questions and Va. Can't in any of its 3 options. Go back to the drawing board and start all the way over and and and and get it right. And it's notParticipant: rocket science, I mean, Va, Google did it on the 1st try. So va, clearly, it's possible. So Va needs to do it. And if I ultimately see, you know, in a few months Va moves at the speed of molasses. SoParticipant: in January there was something we said back in. I grew up in Wisconsin, where it was very cold winters. But if Va. You know, in a in in a few to several months, I test the chat bot, and it's still just, you know, not working right if it's you know. Come on. And then the final point is that Va specifically asked forParticipant: various types of veterans. So lower income veterans, veterans who are having this, and you know various characteristics, including specifically, if you're an Lgbtq veteran. So I'm a little surprised that there was nothing specific to any of those areas given that I highlighted those. But I decided on my own to highlight that. And that's great. But I think that if you're going to ask those questions as a screening question, then do something about it in the.Participant: you know, specific to to the cohort. You're you're you're, you know you're part of as well, and I really hope that Va. Does a better job with all of those cohorts as well. And particularly, you know. Stop. I'm pleased that we were able to find that there's some, you know, web pages that still exist on va.gov. For Lgbtq veterans, and that one that we found on mental health services looked really good, butParticipant: it shouldn't be hard to find, I mean, don't hide it in the freaking closet, and then, you know, expect us to find it when we need it, unless you find to increase the Va. The veteran suicide rate, because veterans who are looking for help. They're looking for help, so they do better unless you're, you know. If you're actually serious about improving Va. Suicide rates, then then actually do better and and care for for veterans. Okay, thank you. I'm off my soapbox, and I really appreciate.Moderator: No, no, absolutely. That's the kind of feedback that we're that we definitely need to hear, and thatModerator: this administration needs to hear. SoModerator: that is it. We are done. I wanted to close and say that we really appreciate you, taking time to share your thoughts with us. As I said, your feedback is very helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure that it is working for veterans.Moderator: Lastly, Paragene will be sending you a note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, that you might know to provide them a chance to participate in any future studies. So again, that does conclude our study. Thanks again for your time, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: And I want to thank you again. Just personally, I really appreciate the time and thanks for your patience, your calm demeanor as well, I got a little frustrated with all this is just.Moderator: No, I empathize fully with you in every aspect and facet that youParticipant: Thank you for that.Moderator: Described today.Participant: Yeah, thank you. Well, hopefully, we'll, you know, hopefully, this will help. So thank you.Moderator: I sincerely hope so.Participant: Too much. Yeah. And you know, if you don't ask, you know, the answer is always no. So the fact that the fact that you're actually doing this today. I just thank you. Your company. Or if you're with Va or whatever it is, I, you know, if you're a Con contractor, just really grateful for you. Thank you.Moderator: Absolutely well. Thank you, sir, take care and enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: You too. Take care now.Moderator: Bye, now.
