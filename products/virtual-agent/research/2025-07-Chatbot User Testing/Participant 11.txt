Participant 11 Ð July 29 Ð 9 AM ESTModerator: Video is.Moderator: So just to confirm sir, I do have your permission to do the video recording today.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: So before we go into the tasks, I want to ask a couple of background questions. First, st the 1st question is, are you using any assistive technology like a screen reader, during these tasks today.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, and what kind of computer are you using? Is it windows or a Mac.Participant: Windows.Moderator: And which Web browser. Are you using Google Chrome? Or maybe Microsoft edge.Participant: Edge.Moderator: Okay, perfect. And have you ever worked with Chatbots before.Participant: That.Participant: Do you mean like when I've gone to sites and.Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: yeah, exactly ones where you kind of type in questions and interact with someone where you're pretty sure it's not a human.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay? Good. If so, do you know the names of any? Or have they just been kind of like on company sites?Participant: On company sites.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: And just for frequency, how many times would you say you used a chat bot in the last month or so?Participant: I don't think I have.Moderator: Oh, okay, would you say you've used one in the last 6 months?Participant: Oh, yeah.Moderator: Okay, so how many times in the last 6 months, would you say? Just an estimate.Participant: Hi!Participant: Maybe 3 or 4.Moderator: Okay, great.Moderator: So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to send you a link if you can locate the chat window here in Zoom. I'm going to send you the linkModerator: to our 1st proof of concept that we're working on. And when that link pops up there it is, if you could click on that link.Moderator: and I'm going to have you share your screen so we can kind ofModerator: see exactly what you're seeing and kind of watch you as you navigate the page.Participant: Okay, how do I share my screen?Moderator: Oh, at the bottom, menu, if where it says audio and video, if you keep going, should there should be a share. Button and mine has a little.Participant: Cool.Moderator: Green arrow pointing up.Moderator: If IModerator: okay, it's loading. It looks like good.Moderator: All right.Moderator: There we go, perfect.Moderator: So this is the 1st proof of concept bot, and it's located there in that little rectangle off to your right hand side. But what I'd like you to do is please take some time to familiarize yourself with this page, and whenever you're ready, and whenever you've read through what you need to go ahead and click the start chat button.Moderator: All right, as you're interacting with this chat. Bot, I'm going to ask you to please feel free to speak aloud your thoughts, your actions, and kind of your feelings as you move through this. If you can scroll down just a little tiny bit there to the prompt window, I'm going to have you where it says, type your message, the 1st thing I'm going to have you do is type in. How can I sign into Va?Moderator: And then, as this answer comes up. I'd like you to take a few minutes to interact with the bot, feel free to click on links that you think are appropriate until you find the answer to your question?Moderator: Oh, sorry you're on mute.Moderator: -Oh!Participant: See it.Moderator: There now I now you're unmuted.Participant: I don't know why itModerator: Why it muted you I don't know, either.Moderator: Oh, you're muted again.Participant: Every time I share it mutes me.Moderator: Oh, interesting. Hmm!Participant: Yeah, I even get a message that says it.Moderator: Let's see, is there a like a button? You can click, or something to turn it off? I've never had that happen before in my meetings.Moderator: or maybe there's a way.Participant: No.Moderator: Oh, okay.Participant: Sharing, now.Moderator: Yep. I can see your screen perfect.Participant: And you can hear me. Okay.Moderator: And I can hear you. Yes.Participant: That was weird.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: All right. So I I would choose id me, because that's what I normally use to log in.Moderator: Perfect. Go ahead! Click on that that blue button! Then.Participant: Do you need help with an existing wow!Participant: I wouldn't choose, either. But I if I was having trouble logging in, I would say help with my account.Moderator: Sure. So what if you wouldn't choose either? What answer would you be expecting here.Participant: That the system is gonna help me reset my account.Moderator: Hmm, okay.Moderator: So if you're logging in, you would look for some way to reach toModerator: to reset your account is what you're saying.Participant: Yeah. Cause if I went through I don't know why I'd go through the Chatbot toParticipant: for help logging in, because normally I would just hit the reset password, or.Moderator: Sure. Well, let's let's say this is your 1st time on Va. You've never logged in before. You've never done any passwords, and you're just trying to find out how to log in. If that's the case, how? How would you?Participant: Then I would go to create a new account.Moderator: Okay, cool. All right. Go ahead and click that one. Then.Participant: So.Moderator: There's a bunch of options there, there's create an account. Am I eligible? Verify my identity? So whichever one of these you thinks would would fit the situation.Participant: Well again, if I didn't have an id me account, I would check and make sure that I'm eligible.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Oh, I didn't know that about Idme, that everybody can do it.Participant: Oh, wow! So yes, that answered my question. Plus some. Oh, yeah.Moderator: Perfect a little bit extra. All right. Let's stop right here for just a minute. What I'm going to do is ask you some. Follow up questions here. So did that answer make sense to you?Participant: Yes.Moderator: All right. Do you think all information was provided.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay, and how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed.Participant: Oh, that was pretty easy.Moderator: Okay, did the information ever feel overwhelming, or maybe hard to process at all?Participant: No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: great. What I'm going to do next is in that prompt window or where you're at. I'd like you to type. In the the following phrase.Moderator: I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: and once again go ahead and interact with this answer, feel free to speak aloud, as you kind of navigate through the chat. Bot.Participant: Well, if I was unfamiliar with the Va. I'd probably just pick the 1st one, because I want to know what.Participant: Well, I certainly wouldn't know what the last one was, so I right veterans, benefits.Moderator: Okay, go ahead and click.Participant: See, people.Participant: okay.Moderator: Okay. So it tells me to go to this.Moderator: Those are.Participant: So.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Check it and see what happens.Participant: Oh, okay. And there it says for family members.Participant: and then I click there.Participant: Oh, that's pretty easy.Moderator: Yeah, you found you found the link. I haven't even seen this page yet.Moderator: So so, okay, great.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Let's can you close this tab and go back to the chat? Bot!Moderator: Alright! So did that answer your question. There.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay. And you want to give it some feedback.Participant: Sure, gave it a 5.Moderator: Okay, great.Moderator: Then I'm gonna ask you some follow up questions once again on this version of the chat. Bot,Moderator: let's see, did the answer, make sense to you.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Do you feel that all information was provided.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, and how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: Oh, that was pretty easy.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: And did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Nope.Moderator: Okay, can you think of any way to improve the interaction or the answer for this version of our chat? Bot.Participant: No, I I think it worked well. It had the linkParticipant: that I could get my answer to.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: Alright. What I'm going to do next is, have you switch back to the Zoom Meeting? And in in the chatModerator: I added another link there. So if you could click that link.Moderator: this is going to open up our version 2.Moderator: And what we've done is that we've we have to have this one behind a little bit of security. So what we've done is added your email to a Whitelist.Moderator: And basically, what we need you to do is put in that email address that you used to sign up for this meeting with Perigan.Moderator: And we're just going to do some quick two-factor authentication. It's going to send you a code.Moderator: And when you get that code from your email, it should come from an email address called CodeModerator: Cloudflare. Excuse me. Yeah, there it is. If you want to just copy that code and paste it back in that other window, you should get in pretty quickly. Here.Moderator: Yeah, there you go.Moderator: All right. This is our second version of the Chatbot version number 2.Moderator: Okay? And I'm gonna ask you basically the same thing. Take a couple minutes to read through the page and familiarize yourself. Then, whenever you are ready, there in the prompt window once again.Moderator: type in the question, how can I sign in to Va.Moderator: and once again take your time,Moderator: and feel free to interact with the chat bot, and the answers that it's provided. Let me know if you get stuck, or if you have any problems with the answers that it gives.Participant: Well, the answers kind of assumeParticipant: that I know I need either a log that I needParticipant: some sort of login for my daParticipant: verify your identity for login.gov account.Participant: I don't know what a login.gov account is.Participant: right? So it sounds like the chat bot is kind of giving you.Moderator: Maybe someModerator: some tips if you're having troubles, login. But you're just wanting to find the link to login right?Moderator: So these kind of look like some troubleshooting things. Like, if you're having problems. Yeah, okay.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay? So if you scroll down here.Moderator: you can see there's a feedback mechanism. Do you think that this answer answered your question properly?Participant: Nope.Moderator: No, okay, good.Moderator: So let's stop here. And once again I'm going to ask these follow-up questions.Moderator: Did these answers make sense to you?Participant: Not really.Moderator: Yeah, okay. And so you would say that all information was not really provided right correct.Moderator: And how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed.Participant: Well, in this case kind of difficult.Moderator: Yeah, you couldn't find what you needed. All right, yeah.Moderator: The information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Yeah, cause I didn't know what these were.Moderator: Right? Okay? Good.Moderator: All right. Let's move on. Then I'm gonna have you type. In the same phrase that we did last time there in that box. I need to help my dadModerator: log in to get his benefits. Information.Moderator: Oh.Participant: Oh, well, that stinks.Moderator: Stink.Moderator: So what would you? What do you think you would do if that happened in real life? You get an answer that they say, well, I don't know.Participant: I might try rephrasing the question.Moderator: Sure. Why don't you try that.Participant: You didn't thank you.Participant: Oh, now I'm back into the how to log in.Moderator: Yeah, looks like it. Got you right back to back to square one. All right. Let's stop here. Okay, so does this answer make sense.Participant: No, because it didn't answer my question.Moderator: Give me one. Okay, and then, obviously, you're probably gonna want more information provided here, right?Participant: Correct.Moderator: Yeah, and easy or difficult to find what you needed.Moderator: Oh, that was hard, very hard. Yeah. Did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Are hard to process.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay? And can you think of a way to improve the interactions or the answers for this version of our chat? Bot.Participant: I guess, be more like the other one where it actually answered the question,Moderator: Because I'm assuming these links work just the same as.Participant: Others. So if I was really frustrated and trying to find an answer, I'd probably start clicking on them just to see what happened.Moderator: Just to see where they go. Yeah, good.Moderator: Let's go ahead. And can I have you scroll to the top of this pageModerator: outside of the Chatbot. There. Yeah, there you go, and if you look at the top, you can see component 3 on the left hand side. If you would click on that. We're gonna go to the 3rd version now of our Chatbot, andModerator: whenever you're ready in the prompt window.Moderator: go ahead and type in same 1st question as last time, the last 2 times, how can I sign into Va.Moderator: Once again? Once this answer pops up.Moderator: take your time, feel free to explore the answer, and also feel free to speak aloud. Everything as you walk through.Participant: Well, this gives a lot more information, and answers the question better.Moderator: Good. Okay, good. So let me answer the some. Follow up questions. Here, let me ask some. Follow up questions. Rather. Did this answer, make sense to you.Participant: It did.Moderator: Okay, good, was all information provided.Participant: I think so better than the 1st one.Moderator: Good. Okay, and how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed.Participant: I think this was pretty easy.Moderator: Pretty easy. Good. Okay. And did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: I mean, it's a lot of information if I'mParticipant: in a rush and don't want to read. But no, it wasn't overwhelming.Moderator: Okay? Good.Moderator: Finally, what I'm going to have you do is type that same phrase that we did last time into the window. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits informationModerator: all right again. Please take a few minutes to interact with the response given here.Participant: Okay.Moderator: All right. So I want to ask some. Follow up questions here. Did this answer make sense.Participant: It it does.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: How easy or difficult was it for you to find the information you needed.Participant: It was easy.Moderator: Okay? And would you want more information provided here?Participant: Yeah, maybe some links or cars.Moderator: Right ways to help ways to log in, or maybe ways to go. Look at the benefits like that last one had.Participant: Yep.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: And did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?Participant: No.Moderator: Okay.Participant: It was. It was decent.Moderator: Good. Finally, I like to ask if you can think of any way to improve the interaction or the answer for this version of our chat. Bot.Participant: Well like, I said, adding, the links would be helpful.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay.Participant: And certainly a link that took you back to that family page is is awesome.Moderator: Good. Yeah. Good feedback. All right. Great. So that completes the tech task section ofModerator: our questionnaire this morning. What I'm gonna do now is, ask a few post interview questions. So.Participant: Okay.Moderator: While you were interacting with this chat. Bot! How did you feel? Were there points where you felt stuck or annoyed.Participant: No, the maybe more on the second one. That didn't give me a lot of information.Moderator: Right. The one that didn't give you said, Hey, we don't have an answer. Yeah, yeah.Moderator: At any point. Did you feel confused or frustrated, or maybe overwhelmed by the chat. Bot's responses.Participant: No, maybe this last one just a little bit, because again, all right. So where do I go to go? Do all this.Participant: doctor? Yeah.Moderator: Kind of incomplete. Huh?Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Alright!Participant: It's a good way to to say it.Moderator: Were the Chatbot's responses easy to understand or overwhelming at any point.Participant: Well, they were easy to understand. They just didn't always give the information I was looking for.Moderator: Good. Okay.Moderator: Did the Chatbot ever give too much information at once? Or do you feel it was just right.Participant: I don't think so. I think it was just right.Moderator: Okay, did you have to remember information from earlier in the conversation to complete any task.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Did you notice any major differences between the 3 different chat bots.Participant: Well, the one didn't seem to be able to answer the questions.Moderator: Right.Participant: Last one didn't seem to give me all the information I was looking for.Moderator: Right.Participant: To be helpful.Moderator: Got it?Moderator: So let me ask you this. Did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning, and did it affect how you use the chat? Bot.Participant: No, not really, because that's kind of all over the Va.Moderator: So were you.Participant: A lawnmower.Moderator: Right? Were you concerned about sharing privacy or personal information that that disclaimer was referring to.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: do you feel the Chatbot answers were the right length for you, or did you ever want more or less information.Participant: Well, I certainly wanted more when the one couldn't find the answers. ButModerator: And the links on the last one, too. Yeah.Participant: But the the one that had all the this I guess it was I forgot which one now, already the one that had the links where I could goParticipant: log in and do things I thought was, and it offered the 800 number.Moderator: Oh, yeah.Participant: That was.Moderator: That was this one. If you scroll up to the top of this one, that's the one thatModerator: is this the one you're talking.Participant: Yeah, yeah, I thought that was even though it was long. I thought it gave all the information.Participant: It was pretty concise for having that much information.Moderator: So pretty thorough answer on that one.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, so, compared to your experiences with other chat bots. Was this what you expected.Participant: Yeah, it was similar.Moderator: Similar. Okay?Moderator: And if the chat Bot didn't answer your question, what did you do next? If you felt stuck.Participant: I tried to rephrase my question.Moderator: Yup. Okay, good. Do you feel strongly about one of these versions of the Chatbot over another? And why? Why would that be.Participant: Well, I like this one just again, because you asked the question, how do I sign in? And it gives you kind of step by step, do this thisParticipant: perfect.Participant: And if you're stuck, here's a phone number.Moderator: You like the 3rd one best. Okay, good.Moderator: Did you notice anything specific that you suggest that we correct or change that would improve the user experience of these chat bots.Participant: No.Moderator: Nope, okay.Moderator: Finally, do you have any final comments or suggestions, or perhaps any questions for me?Participant: No.Moderator: No? Okay, good. Well, that wraps up our meeting today. We really appreciate you taking time.Moderator: Oh, yeah.Moderator: yeah. Your feedback is very helpful as we continue to work on the va.gov. Site to make sure that it really works for veterans. Lastly, Perigan will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to some other veterans that you might know to provide them a chance to participate in future research studies that does it for today. Thanks again. So much for your help and enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: Alright. You as well.Moderator: Great thanks for taking part in our survey. And you have a great day, sir.Participant: Alright, bye-bye.Moderator: Take care!
