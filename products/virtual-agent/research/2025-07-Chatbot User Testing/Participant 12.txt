Participant 12 Ð July 29, 2025 Ð 1 PM ESTModerator: PerfectModerator: alright. And now that we are on the recording, just to confirm one more time, I do have your permission to record the session.Participant: Yes, sir, you have permission to record.Moderator: Awesome. All right, let's get into a couple of pre-testing questions before we get into the tasks. 1st question is, are you using any assistive technology, such as a screen reader to do this session today.Participant: No, sir.Moderator: Okay? And what device or operating system are you using? Is it a Mac or a windows machine?Participant: I'm using an intel thinkpad windows. 11.Moderator: Okay? And which browser are you using.Participant: Primarily use Internet explorer. But we'll use chrome if something, it's my work machine. So it's not everything works in in edge. So sometimes I gotta use.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Sounds good. Alright. So how familiar are you with chat bots? Have you ever used a chat bot before.Participant: Limited. You know.Participant: Use them for like booking my employees flights and stuff. I can go through the chat box, you know just the regular customer service stuff, but as far as actually using them for, like regular AI applications, I I generally don't.Moderator: Okay? So it's more like, on a company's website instead of like, Chat be Gpt or Gronk, or anything like that.Participant: Correct, sir.Moderator: Cool. So how many times would you say you've used a chat bot in the last month?Participant: Oh, probably close to a dozen.Moderator: Oh, okay, a dozen times. So in the last 6 months.Moderator: probably couple 100 times. If it's the same frequency.Participant: Probably. Yes, sir. Yeah, most everything that I do. I've at least gotta start with the chat bot before I can get to get to a real person. Sometimes. Sometimes they can head it off, and I can just solve it within. But usually they're stepping stone to get to to a human being.Moderator: Got it. Okay, that makes senseModerator: good. All right. So what I'll do next then, is we're going to start on the task portion.Moderator: Let me grab a link here, really quick, and I'm going to drop it in the chat.Moderator: This will be in the chat for the zoom window. So when you get a second, if you could, please click on that link.Moderator: and if you're able, would you share your screen so that my colleagues and I can kind of follow along where you're at on screen.Moderator: All right? Good. So this is.Moderator: I see it. Thank you. Yeah, this is our 1st proof of concept that we're gonna talk about today. What I'd like you to do is just take a couple seconds here to look at the page, familiarize yourself with all of the the areas, of course, the chat, but that you see there is the window just to your right. So once again take a few minutes to interactModerator: and feel free to speak aloud. While you're doing this, your thoughts, your actions as you explore the page. Then whenever you're ready. Click, the start chat, button.Participant: So just so everybody knows I am a reader. I read just about everything.Participant: I've already read through some of the the Beta testing stuff that we've gotten like an email. Notice that this is being worked. So said, I read everything so as far as the the contacts and the beta, testing the heads up already tracking that. This is the 1st time that I've been able to get to the the more about. So the expanding outParticipant: of what to expect, and everything.Moderator: Good. Okay? So you're already familiar with the the Beta version of it. That's great.Participant: I see like a question here, for the you know, protecting privacy. Regular va privacy laws and requirementsParticipant: will apply with the chat bot stuff as well as like as if it was more interacting with a regular human being.Moderator: Right? Exactly.Moderator: just like it says, here, this is the information that we keep. We keep. We do keep records of the questions, but it notModerator: not like any specific information per se. It's just basically to fine tune what we call utterances so that we can make the chat bots better. So just just kind of natural language that users would put into the bot that we use to compare it to other data.Participant: Copy easy, sir.Moderator: Yep. And as you can see right here, here's the that. Speaking of which there's this, I guessModerator: warning here about typing in personal information, soModerator: that that kind of further just lets, you know, not to not to type like social security number or anything like that in these chat bots.Participant: Got it. Yeah, the when the screen popped up first.stParticipant: You guys were over the top of that. So I didn't see it initially. But.Moderator: Good. Okay. So whenever you're ready, go ahead and click the start chatModerator: and we'll begin with the tasks soon as this gets loaded. The 1st question or phrase I would like you to enter into the chat bot is, how can I sign into Va?Moderator: And then once again, please take a few minutes to interact with the response that the chat Bot gives you, and feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you explore the Chatbot.Participant: Yeah, does the since you seem like they're going outside. These buttons. Go outside the chat boxParticipant: like, sorry I'm in the airport.Moderator: Go ahead, click it and find out.Moderator: Yeah. Feel free to click around.Participant: Okay?Participant: Zone 8. Local Board as well. All customers travel to Jacksonville Local BoardParticipant: just checking that link to seeParticipant: that it actually goes where I think it's supposed to go.Moderator: Yeah, absolutely explore all you want.Moderator: Okay, so we're at the end of the 1stModerator: set of interactions. So let me take a couple minutes to ask you some questions around what you just did there. So did the answer make sense to you here.Participant: It did. Yes, sir, and significantly easier, because had to. I went that route something that I've already had to do with id me. You know, I had a duplicate account. Had issues trying to get that those merged together. SoParticipant: being able to get that right there instead of have to go dig through the id name, and then that was one of those instances where I had to, you know, go through. Go through the chat, bot before I could finally get to a real person that was able toParticipant: help me with that part of it, and this one seems to cut out, cut out a lot of research steps on my side, anyway. Reading through and chasing through the Id. Me website.Moderator: Well, good. Okay. So it seems like you've had some experience like you said, using the chat bot before, and this route seems a little faster than the experience that you've had in the past. Would that be accurate?Participant: Correct. So that's a that's an accurate statement.Moderator: Perfect. Well, I hope.Participant: What took us there about a minute and a half took me like 30Êmin to find it on my own.Moderator: Wow! Okay, so significantly faster. GoodModerator: do you think all the information was provided that you needed here in this chat.Participant: I do as far as especially with all of the the options that it threw up there for the id me, you know. Password security. Forgetting your password, like everything, is right there again, instead of having to click through individual websites, and then follow those links and keep chasing that rabbit at all.Participant: Just populated here for me.Moderator: Good. Okay. So how easy or difficult would you say that it was to find your answer.Participant: Pretty, very easy, especially with the you knowParticipant: it. It looks like this, you know. Language model has already been trained a little bit so we could have that those ideas of where I was going next. EspeciallyParticipant: I appreciate when you get into those situations where you you're looking for other information, and it just doesn't spit out, you know, like 15 different options. In this case I had 3 or 4 choices with a Hey, do you need to see more.Participant: and then it's put out, you know. 3 more choices. Instead of filling the screen with more junk. It just replaced those buttons definitely helpful. And I think I also saw that there was an option to go backwards in that list. You know one of my methods when I have to go through a phone call, right? As I hold up a finger or I write something down for a possible chance. In this case I'm not having to keep track of where that was. I can just go back to those options and and find what I was looking for.Moderator: Interesting. And that's funny. You say that because the phone, you know, chat bots are really just a visual phone tree. So yeah, I can I can. I can see what you're saying. So did the information that was provided ever feel too overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No, sir, simple, straightforward, plain language like there wasn't.Participant: There wasn't any technical jargon in it.Participant: yeah, pretty pretty simple, straightforward EnglishParticipant: English verbiage and and wording. There.Moderator: So if you want to click the yes button here.Moderator: I'll go ahead and have you enter another phrase.Moderator: and let's type in. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: Reading back, so to make sure I he's got close. I need to help my dad to log in to get his benefits.Moderator: Information information. Yep, you got itModerator: alright. And once again, please take a few minutes to interact with the responses given.Moderator: So let me ask, why? Why would you click the accredited representative here.Participant: Confirming that it was I. I assumed that it was going to get me to a Vso.Moderator: Hmm, okay.Participant: But the Va accredited representative is not something that we get like in theParticipant: in our transition and retirement. Seminars right? They don't use that verbiage they use vso.Participant: even though. And and we just kind of take that to mean that, whether it is from like being in Georgia. Every county has at leastParticipant: one v vso office. But then, you know, you've also can get that access to the American Legion and the Vfw. For me for the Marine Corps League. Local chapters they also have, you know, their own Va. Accredited reps, but they aren't necessarily called vsos. But we are just, but that's the verbiage that we get. So that's what what we know after separation is that I need to be tracking down a Vso. To get help.Moderator: Sure.Participant: So I think in there, in that instance. Maybe using that as or adding, Vso slash va accredited representative.Moderator: Gotcha.Participant: Be more clear for us thatParticipant: my case. I've only been out in 6 7 months now. And that's still. I still only associate Vsl with somebody that is there to help me? As far as that goes, that representative sure.Moderator: Okay, that's that's definitely good. Feedback. Thank you.Moderator: Okay, so go ahead and continue. I didn't. Stop you where you were at.Participant: Yeah, again. Just checking. Took me where I thought it was gonna go that Link didParticipant: Sorry things got hidden.Participant: Oh, come on now does not want to.Moderator: Oh, is theParticipant: The the meetings just in the way. I don't, but I'm not sure smart enough. There it goes.Moderator: Perfect. All right. So I'm gonna take some time again and ask you a couple of questions aboutModerator: your interactions this time. So do you think that? This answer made sense.Participant: Yes, sir. Now, understanding the Va. A credit. But I do think that answer could be clarified just a little bit as far as on the button itself. Vso, or Va. Accredited rep.Participant: I'm ground combat brain like things go down on checklists, and we're simple and straightforward. And so that's just the that's the verbiage. I know. Vso means that I am definitely going to hit somebodyParticipant: who has been certified by the da to get where I need to be.Participant: But as far as the actual interaction, yeah, easy, straightforward the rest of the buttons were clear as far as what what that information was that it was gonna kick out to me.Moderator: Okay, would you want any more information provided? Here?Participant: In the chat bot window for the vsl, I don't think so. I think that was good.Participant: just throwing out there, you know, throwing out there everything.Participant: I don't.Participant: I don't recall exactly what the the other 2 options were. I think one was the login information, and maybe like I think it was va benefits and va health.Moderator: Yep, Ben.Moderator: Offense.Moderator: Second, one. Correct.Participant: Yeah. So toParticipant: again, simple, straightforward language, no ambiguity in here. This one's sending you to benefits. This button is sending you to the health health page.Moderator: Good. Okay. So again, how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed.Participant: Very user.Moderator: Good did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No Nope.Moderator: Okay, all right. So if you couldModerator: return to the chat window and zoom, and I'm gonna drop another link in hereModerator: for you to navigate to.Moderator: AndModerator: we are going to use some quick multi-factor authentication here to use the email that you used with Perigan to sign up. We're going to just quickly send you a verification code.Moderator: We have to put you on a whitelistModerator: for this particular. These next 2 particular proof of concepts. So,Moderator: yeah, if you check your email, there should be an email from Cloudflare access. And once you when whenever you get that email code, go ahead and enter it.Moderator: And now you're going to seeModerator: pretty much a very similar layout and design. Just a few small differences, and I'd like you to once again. Take your time, read through it. Everything else on the page is pretty much the same, except for the chat bot itself. So we got the same windows and drawers and information to the left hand side there.Moderator: So whenever you're ready.Moderator: we're going to do just like we did last time and enter the same 2 questions. So 1st is, how can I sign into Va?Moderator: And once again take, take your time and interact with the Chatbot, feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you explore the answers from the Chatbot.Participant: But I think so. The 1st thing that I noticed right is that the the please don't enter personal information. Notice stayed.Participant: Good, solid reminder that always, always be there. It looks like I like that. The 1st thing, and I might type the question in again to seeParticipant: what it did, but it looked likeParticipant: It scrolled me to the bottom instead of to the top of the answer from the chat box. Right?Participant: Yeah. So itParticipant: instead of on that, that on the beta. When I typed it in everything, it started me at the top of the response. This one is taking me to the bottom.Participant: So if I'm not paying attention, I'm gonna miss. In this case, the top 3rd of what the response was.Moderator: Sure. Okay, good feedback.Moderator: And was this answer, what you were expecting? Does the answer make sense.Participant: This will be the final call, forParticipant: it does, but I think I like the buttons from the from the 1st iteration better than the links. It doesn't like it doesn't like it.Participant: and I'll just go the same route to make sureParticipant: it all ends up the same place.Participant: But I think for for me.Participant: That call out that call out as a button instead of the the bullet with a hyperlinkParticipant: I like. I prefer. I prefer that. Okay.Moderator: Good do you believe all information was provided here.Moderator: or does there seem to be some information missing.Participant: It!Moderator: Versus the 1st one.Participant: I thinkParticipant: I think there were a couple of options missing right? Because this is the 1st he was talking about. login.govParticipant: va.gov id me.Participant: I think the 1st iteration had maybe the the deox or the dfasParticipant: account login options. I know those are getting phased out. ButParticipant: until until those do actually show up as being a requirement, you have to get away from themParticipant: absolutely, absolutely have to get away from them that they should still be presented in that piece. And it's the same deal like I. I see the thumbs up, thumbs down. But me. Personally, I prefer the button, yes or no. Oh.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Just a personal preference there for me.Moderator: Got it?Moderator: So how? I guess. Did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard at all to process.Participant: I think. Yes, with it all just showing up there in that oneParticipant: chat bubble as opposed to being in their separate, their separate buttons.Participant: you know, kind of like, spits it out and go as opposed to like. Hey, these are your 4 or 5 options that we can go through, or your 3 options, plusParticipant: more, or back, or whatever it was in that face 1st shot this is, and especially with it, scrolling to the bottom of the chat text when the question went in.Participant: while it's it's actuallyParticipant: looks like it's slightly less information. It appears to be more cause it just automatically kicked at the butt bottom instead of popping upParticipant: those 4 little buttons right here.Moderator: Hmm, okay. Got it.Moderator: So would you say that it was easier, difficult, more difficult, then, to find your answer this time.Participant: If I was. If I didn't know what I was doing, I think this would make this iteration, for this question would make it more difficult.Participant: To break it out, especially with the the repeat about the the login.gov, whereas the last iteration was a Hey, do you do login.gov or id me, orParticipant: mill connect, or whatever. And then it went into those sub answers after you picked the one that you wanted.Moderator: Sure got itModerator: all right. Let's move on, then, and we're going to enter that other phrase that we did the 1st time I need to help my dad log inModerator: to get his benefits informationModerator: and once again take a few minutes to interact with the response given here.Participant: Alright. So it as you saw the. Was it the 3rd iteration.Participant: Finally got me into an actual response.Moderator: Okay? Good. Let's.Participant: But but not but then it's giving me the the same initial or the same information that you know was presented on the 1st question, which if I was, if I was coming into this, you know this blind and just asking no, no issues. But I think I was expecting there to be a different response.Participant: maybe something along the lines of like likeParticipant: offering assistance. Or how do I information to me for how I validate that I have that privilege or permission to do something on on my, on my dad's behalf.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay.Moderator: So compared to the 1st one, did this answer make sense.Participant: Hmm! Alright! I'm sorry. I think I already closed the other window. Oh, Nope, I didn't.Moderator: So the other one gave you a couple different options. Here.Participant: Yeah, but I'm not engaged.Moderator: That we don't know.Participant: Yeah,Participant: I don't think I don't think this answer gets me what I would be looking forParticipant: if I was trying to do this for my dad, right since it's kicking out the same thing.Moderator: Right.Participant: You know, just going up. A friend of mine who's you know father just recently passed, was a vet you know. He had to go through, and he had to get essentially a power of attorney to be able to do things on his mother's behalf, who is now gonna be the recipient of benefits. And that's not. That's notParticipant: that steps not captured in here. In this response.Moderator: Sure. Okay, good. So would you say that this was more easy or difficult to find what you needed?Participant: I think this this iteration is more difficult, because I'm looking for very specific information, and this is giving me very general stuff.Moderator: Right? So you'd probably want more information provided, like the 1st answers about benefits, or logging on, or even that vso right as opposed.Participant: Correct.Moderator: These answers were given. Good. Okay. Did did the these answers ever feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?Participant: I don't think so, and I didn't catch it. I don't think that this answer kicked me all the way to the bottom, right, even though it's the same linkParticipant: same length of text as the initial one. And maybe it's just because I knew what was coming felt like this one when it shifted in a response. Left more of this window giving me all of all of the options.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Again. That might. That might be recency bias, because I knew it was happening.Moderator: Right. So besides that scrolling down to the bottom for this version, can you think of another way to improve the interactions or the answers for this version of the chat bot.Participant: I think I think in this instance, right? We're when we're asking about parents. If the bot wouldParticipant: could somehow interfer infer. Then at that point that hey? I actually need to be talking to a Vso and and spitting that out. Maybe is one of the options in there thatParticipant: the Vsl, you know. Here's that Vsl website, web Page, that 1st one took me to that. The Beta Beta version took me to.Moderator: Okay, good. Did you notice any featuresModerator: that were unique to this version that you either like or didn't like compared to the 1st one.Participant: The buttons I prefer the buttons from the 1st version. And and the yes or no, instead of the thumbs up thumbs down.Participant: Because actually, when I 1st read that right like, you know, did that answer your question thumbs up or thumbs down again? It's me but IParticipant: I would have respondedParticipant: Without playing with it, I would have responded with a Yes or No typing it in.Participant: And I guess.Participant: yeah, throwing that in there. And now now we confuse, confuse the machine.Moderator: Right. Okay, good, good feedback. So next, can I have you scroll to the top of the page, and if you look at the left hand side you can see component 3 in the top menu there.Moderator: if you'll click on that, and once again take your time to look through the the welcome message on this version of the Chat Bot, and whenever you're ready we're going to ask the same 2 questions. So first, st how can I sign into Va.Participant: So for this iteration. There's a lot there.Participant: Again it did the scroll to the bottom of the chat. Instead of starting me at the top which I think made it feelParticipant: more overwhelming because they, instead of here, I keep going and going and going and going.Participant: and then it's giving me the information. Instead of starting here, and thenParticipant: being able to say, Oh, yep, alright! These are these are the steps that I'm gonna have to take to do XY, and Z.Moderator: Okay. Overall, did the answer make sense to you?Participant: It does. And I I do appreciate that answer. Right? That, hey? We're going to have to use one of these 2 options.Participant: This is how you do it here.Participant: The link for creating the loginParticipant: verifyParticipant: for me again, you know, because I read everything.Participant: not too bad. Right? So I know that I'm me. Personally, I'm gonna go in there and read it.Participant: But with them both being in there, the you know login.gov and the id name all in the one box.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Maybe a little much.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Sure, especially for an older, older user, or somebody who.Participant: as a as a dependent, or now new beneficiary, who's got to do this. It might just be aParticipant: too much too fast.Moderator: Sure makes sense do you think all information was provided here.Participant: I do?Participant: Maybe the the one piece that's missing right? Because now it does. Just give the 2 2 pieces or the 2 types of ways to log in the Login Dot or the Id. Me would be a mention, possibly that.Participant: Yes.Participant: we're moving away from all of the other ways to log in through mail, connector, or whatever the dfas the ox, logins, and all that. That these are, gonna be the one of these 2 options of what we're gonna have to move to.Moderator: Got it. Okay. For this version. How easy or difficult do you think it was to find what you needed.Participant: Yeah, pretty pretty easy to pop it all up there.Participant: again a little. Just the amount of information that got spit out in the one go.Participant: But it looks like it's all there minus the the note that, hey? We're moving away from all these other logins. These are the 2 ways that we're gonna have to do it. Moving forward.Moderator: Got it, and that answers my next question. The information did feel overwhelming to you. All right, good. So let's go ahead. Then, in the in the chat prompt window. I'd like you to enter the next phrase that we have here, which is, I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: and once again take a few minutes to interact with the response. Here.Participant: That's the one that I was trying to think of. The Ds login.Moderator: Got itModerator: alright. So I'm oh, go ahead! Were you gonna type? Another response in there.Participant: No, sir, no, I was just reading. Yeah, that was a very. I think it's a very good explanation of likeParticipant: going with the hey? I'm coming into this blind all right. Va, dot cov. Pick the Ds login.Participant: and then, you know, go from there with the you know. The previous explanation ofParticipant: I've got. You've got to go through that respective web pageParticipant: to get that account. Password, reset, or recovered, or what have you.Moderator: Right? Okay? So this answer did make sense to you. Then.Participant: Yes, sir.Moderator: Okay. And would you want any more information provided? Here?Participant: Sorry I was talking to you. I was muted.Moderator: Oh, sorry I yeah. How easy is that.Participant: It was my fault.Moderator: Oh, okay.Participant: I got it. No, I was spitting out my answer. And then my computer told me I was muted.Participant: Oh,Participant: Maybe if it could go where it says, you know, says, here Ds log on right, for whichever if it could spit that out as a hyperlink instead ofParticipant: yeahParticipant: having to go through the the chat bot or through the Va web page and then, if that link functions the way the rest of them did. You know. Then it opens up that separate window, so I don't loseParticipant: a misclick doesn't cause me to lose my chat. Bot!Moderator: Good. Okay, so would you say it's easier difficult than to find what you needed.Participant: I think the of the 3 iterations. This has been the easiest one, as far as kicking out the information and providing thatParticipant: upfront right instead of well, I like the buttons. The buttons still took me somewhere else, and I was guessing, as far as what what I need to be going with, but this one says, Hey, go here.Participant: follow this to reset or recover your account.Moderator: Right? Okay, for this version. Did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process? On this answer.Participant: No, sir.Moderator: And overall for this version of the chat Bot, can you think of a way to improve the interaction or answer.Participant: I think just the hyperlink option right in the in the the reply, that yep, you you gotta go here and do this.Moderator: Good. Okay? So that does it for the task portion of our user testing session. What I'm gonna do next is just ask you a couple of follow up questions. Just to get your response here. So the 1st question is, how did you feel while using the chat bot? And were there any points where you might have felt stuck or annoyed during the interactions.Participant: It wasn't in this version.Participant: but in that in that second one where I had to ask the benefits questionParticipant: 2 or 3 different times before it got meParticipant: to the hey log into. This is how you log in information.Participant: But no, as far as like everything elseParticipant: other than that one question in that one specific version, it seems like the the language model is, is interpreting things, was able toParticipant: infer what I was looking for.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: so that that would you say that was the only point, then, that you maybe felt confused or frustrated, or overwhelmed by the the chat bots, responses, or interface.Participant: Yes. Well, this one here that I've got up now. Sorry I'm still scaring right just with this one popping it up all in one, and then scrolling to the bottom of it.Moderator: Right.Participant: Okay. I think that that response was a would have been a little overwhelming, for somebody who didn't know what was going onParticipant: wasn't ready for that massive amount of information in one shot, right.Moderator: Besides that one example, where is there any more any other times where the responses were overwhelming? Or would you say that they were overall, fairly easy to understand.Participant: Very good, so easy to understand.Participant: Straightforward again, the plain language, even in that big that long response language there still wasn't anything incredibly technical to it it all seemed to be straightforward. EnglishParticipant: ish nothing too wild.Moderator: Sure. Okay.Moderator: were there times when you had to remember information from early in the conversation to complete your task.Participant: No, sir!Moderator: Okay? So did you notice any major differences between the 3 different versions of the chat bot today?Participant: The buttons is a big one for me. I really like the buttonsParticipant: but again, you know, that's comes down to because I'm I'm a simple creature, andParticipant: I just wanna click it and and go.Moderator: Sure. So let less reading, and just kind of get youModerator: kind of to the to narrow down kind of your your options to go where you need.Participant: Yeah, I feel like the the buttons in their their sub menus. After you click the button, or more.Participant: Okay streamlined it. It felt more streamlined to me as I was trying to chase the information.Moderator: Sure. Okay, good.Moderator: So did you notice? Well, you did notice the disclaimer at the beginning. Did this affect how you use the chat? Bot.Participant: I don't think so, sir. Because you'll notice theParticipant: Oh, sorry.Moderator: It's okay.Participant: Yeah, no, becauseParticipant: it was there was upfront. Especially with the reminder in the second 2 versions where it's still there, even as I scroll to the bottom of the the chat window. It's still right there at the top, hey? Don't put anything in here that you don't want to be in here.Moderator: Right.Moderator: Are you concerned about the possibility of sharing privacy or personal information in the chat box?Participant: Moved away from me.Moderator: I'm sorry. What was that? I didn't hear you.Participant: I didn't catch your question, sir. What it was about are worried about sharing information in the window.Moderator: Yeah. Are you concerned about sharing privacy or personal information in the chat? Bot.Participant: I don't think any more than if I was chatting with the real person. Still, wouldn't you know? Not something that I personally am? Gonna do.Moderator: Right.Participant: outside of what? What they would need, you know, going with the Va benefits portion right? Like, if I was on the phone with them, trying to figure out my claim right? There's information that I've that they've got to have to be able to look at my caseParticipant: right.Participant: I don't. Participant: I would not share that in with the chat Bot, and probably wouldn't share that in a chat window.Moderator: Right.Moderator: Got it. Okay?Moderator: So overallModerator: compared to your experiences and and interactions with other chat bots, would you say that this is what you expected and.Participant: Was it.Moderator: In which ways was it different than your other interactions with chat bots?Participant: It is actually better than I expected it to be. And I felt like it wasParticipant: more responsive as far as theParticipant: the turnaround time from the time I hit enter to send the question for the bot to come back to me. There were only a couple, and it probably has more to do with my Internet connection where it took a little bit of time for things to come throughParticipant: problem.Moderator: As far as the response goes, got it.Moderator: So if you had an an instance where the chat bot didn't answer your question, what did you do next? Especially if you were feeling stuck.Participant: soParticipant: gonna gonna tattle on myself. I have learned in the in the interim that if I throw some profane words at the chat bot, it immediately abandons its mission, and sends me to a real person.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Yeah, you're you're hitting the like the the indicators for frustration and and anger. So.Participant: Yeah, if there's if there's something.Participant: Yeah, there's something that I need to take care of immediately. Probably not the best route, but a bad word here or there gets them moving, moving me to a real person a lot faster.Moderator: Right hacking the system there.Moderator: Alright. So do you feel strongly about one of these proof of concepts over another.Participant: No, I like, I think ifParticipant: if I could get the buttons with the information from this component 3, I think that would have been the mostParticipant: most efficient method for for me as far as the bot setup. But.Moderator: Got it. So the buttons from Number One but plugged into the information from Number 3.Participant: Correct, sir.Moderator: Got it. Okay?Moderator: And do you notice anything specifically? Besides what you've already pointed out about the buttons and about the scrolling on versions 2 and 3 that you would improve or change to help with the user experience.Participant: No, I think so, sir. I think just the the things we've already talked about. So.Moderator: Sure. Okay? And so finally, do you have any other comments or suggestions.Participant: No, actually, exactly. I'm I'm impressed with the the chat bot and where it'sParticipant: where it's at. When that notice 1st came out and I was reading about it. I was expecting it to be, you know.Participant: a normal normal government dod thing where it's clunky and not user friendly. And you know.Participant: I ask you, what's 2 plus 2, and it gives me 6 right?Participant: No, I think this wasParticipant: a good version of it. A good.Participant: good, good bot that will will actually help as opposed to just frustrating people.Participant: Oh, when they're trying to trying to find their information.Moderator: Well, good, yeah, hopefully, we're moving in the right directions. So in fact, that's why we're doing this. So we appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts, and this feedback, you know, is very vital, as we continue to fine tune and make sure that the site is working for veterans. Lastly, Paragene will be sending you a note with a blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you might knowModerator: so that they can have a chance to participate in any future studies. So once again, sir, thanks again for your participation today, and I hope you get on that flight soon and enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: Yeah, I appreciate it, sir. Thank you all much. I really appreciate you guys, your time. And yeah, I think this is this is good workParticipant: that's moving forward as far as making it easier to get into the Va system.Moderator: Good. Well, we appreciate that feedback, sir.Participant: Awesome.Moderator: Y'all have a good rest of your day.Moderator: You as well take care, say, have a safe flight.Participant: Thank you, sir. Bye.
