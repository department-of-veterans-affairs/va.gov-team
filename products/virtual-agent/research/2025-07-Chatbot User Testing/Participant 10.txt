Participant 10 Ð July 28, 2025 Ð 1 PM EST Moderator: There we go.Moderator: Alright. Meant hit this button all right. Now we've got the transcript going. SoModerator: once again I do have your permission to record this meeting, correct.Participant: Yes, you do.Moderator: Great.Moderator: So what I've got first, st then, is a couple of pre-testing questions. 1st of all, I need to ask if you're using any assistive technology like a screen reader, today.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And what device? Operating system and browser, are you using.Participant: I believe it's a Microsoft 10 or something like that.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And is it, are you using the Microsoft browser, or like a Google chrome.Participant: I have both. I think I use the Microsoft more than Google but or chrome. But you, I do have them both available.Moderator: Okay, which one will you be using for this session?Moderator: You should, you know, use whichever one pops up. I'm not a hundred percent sure to be honest.Moderator: No problem. So let me ask you how familiar how familiar you are with chat bots. Have you.Participant: Yeah, if I if I were to just go down to my normal icon where I go to the Internet, it's Microsoft Edge.Moderator: Okay, no problem.Moderator: Let me ask you about your familiarity with chat bots. Have you ever used a Chatbot before.Participant: I don't think I have.Moderator: Okay, no problemModerator: what I'm gonna do next is send you a link. Let me find it here in my chat.Moderator: and what I'd like you to do is in the chat window. If you can find the chat window in our Zoom Meeting.Moderator: There is a link in that. Chat now should be a menu. Towards the bottom is audio video participants and.Participant: There's more, and then chat. Yep, show chat previews.Moderator: Yeah, click, if you can see that link, if you're able to please click on the link that.Participant: I clicked. Okay, I clicked on it says, unable to send the request because the host is recording the act. The the cloud recording.Moderator: Oh,Participant: Alright. So I open. Yeah. I opened the chat. Yeah, let me see. Here.Moderator: Got it.Participant: You're you're chatting as a guest. Got it. Okay? Now I see a link. Here we go.Moderator: Perfect.Participant: There goes there, there you play. But that's okay. I can still hear you.Moderator: Perfect. If you can, real quick go back to zoom, and if you're able to, could you share your screen with me? If you look at the bottom row, there's on my screen at least there's a little green arrow pointing up that says, Share that way. We can follow along and see exactly what you see.Participant: Share screen. Here it is. Yeah.Participant: just hit share again. I guess you know.Moderator: You got it.Participant: There we go!Moderator: All right. It's loading, and I can see your screen perfect. That was.Participant: Brilliant.Moderator: So let me get back to my script here, change my windows all right. So what I'd like you to do is take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with this page. Go ahead and read all that you care to, and whenever you're ready, go ahead and hit the start. Chat, button.Participant: Currently, you know, Beta, testing. All right, let's do it.Moderator: All right.Participant: There we go loading Chatbot.Moderator: Perfect. What I'd like you to do then, is for your 1st question, can you please type in? How can I sign into Va.Participant: So type your message.Moderator: You got it.Participant: How can I sign into the Va.Moderator: Yes, sir.Moderator: Now take a few minutes, then, after you hit, enter to interact with the response that the Chatbot gives, and feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you explore the Chatbot.Participant: I can help find general information.Participant: Get started. What is pack tech? What's my claim? Status? Yeah. Those are always good to know.Participant: Select from the following topic, sign in support, secure messaging via help I use secure messaging a lot that's probably one of the main between that and working on my prescriptions. That'sParticipant: 2 of the main things I use when I go into the Va. And now that we've changed from the basic, my healthy vetParticipant: toParticipant: my healthy.gov, or whatever it's changed to. There's more steps involved in that. So yeah, anything that wouldParticipant: remove a step would be nice.Moderator: Good. Okay, go ahead and click on whichever option you'd like. Then there.Moderator: and we'll see what pops up.Participant: You can communicate. Find out if you're eligible, use your messaging how to sign into.Participant: Well, I guess I have to click on there to find out. See if I'm eligible.Moderator: You got it.Participant: I would assume so. Well, obviously it's got to sign in at the top of the page. So I mean, if it at this point. If I haven't signed in yet, I know I need to, because it's not gonna let me see anything until I'veParticipant: signed in, so I'd go down there to sign in or create or hit the one at the top of the page.Moderator: Perfect.Moderator: Alright. If you could, then close this tab on your browser.Participant: Everything. Everything at the top of the page is in the way.Moderator: Yeah, you you can go ahead and move that little bar with our meeting in it. You should be able to just grab it and move it to the side.Participant: So every every window line orParticipant: hell. Yeah, every everything I get close to wants me to. There we go.Participant: Now, of course, the meeting is being recorded is in the way. I just need to say, okay. And then I can go toParticipant: close that block. Okay.Moderator: Perfect. Okay? So I'm gonna ask you a couple of follow up questions to your 1st interaction here. And yeah, you could. You can click that, too. Did this answer your question.Participant: Sure.Moderator: And then feel free to give your response.Participant: What was your experience? Well, it well, I mean it was. It was good. It took me to. It took me to a link.Participant: So I mean, I guess if ifParticipant: I don't know if if I if I needed to get on secure messaging, I would go, you know, cause I have it. I have a aParticipant: shortcut, or whatever to get to that login screen. So I'm not sure if I had that, since I have that. I'm not sure why I would go to chat, but to ask, How do I get there when I you know you know what I mean? It'd be great for somebody who might not have that. But if I have it, I'm probably not gonna take this step just to add one more step.Moderator: Absolutely. Yeah.Moderator: Okay. So let me ask you some follow up questions here. Did this answer make sense to you?Participant: What do you mean? Where it took me.Moderator: Yeah in the chat. Bot did the answer that the chat bot gave you make sense.Participant: Sure. Oh, you mean where? When? I asked, yeah, when I asked, how do I get to? How do I find the Va.Moderator: Yes.Participant: Then it gave me options. Yeah, it gave me 3 different options. I you know, I picked the one that I would normally go to.Participant: And yeah. And it took me took me to a site where I could get to what I needed. So yeah, if I I go back to my previous answer, if I didn't already have a short, I mean, yeah, shortcut, this would be. This would have got me where I needed to go. Yeah.Participant: okay.Participant: And there, if I remember correctly, there was also a sign in, I think, the one above secure messaging. I don't. I can't see it now, but I think the oneParticipant: yeah, the options one of them was sign in, I think, wasn't it?Moderator: I couldn't tell you.Participant: Yeah, I think it was when I when I you know, when I I pick secure messaging, just that's because what I usually do. But I think the one above thatParticipant: did say, sign in. So, yeah, that would have been the one I would have used, I guess. Yeah.Moderator: So you would click the sign in button just just to go to your sign in page. Okay.Participant: Now that I know that. Yeah, I mean, I was ever hopeful that it was. Gonna take me straight to secure messaging. But I'm not sure how I would do that if I'm not signed in. So yeah, that makes sense.Moderator: Right? Okay, cool. Do you believe that all information was provided to you?Participant: For what I was asking for, sure.Moderator: Good, and how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: Not at all, really, I mean, as soon as I, you know. Once I clicked on what I was interested in. It, went, went to A, gave me the opportunity to get to where I wanted to go.Moderator: Perfect?Moderator: And did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: I mean it was it was. It was different from what I was used to. But you know, I mean, if you just scan the page. And a lot of a lot of people that I know, especially older people. They don't want to read all that stuff because I think they're missing something, or they think, you know I'm confused. I don't know what to do. And then they call and ask for help. But you know, just yeah, if you take a few seconds and you look at your options. And yeah, it's pretty self explanatory.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: Next. What I'd like you to do is in that prompt window where you click the last question. I'd like you to type. This following question.Moderator: I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: I need to help my dadModerator: log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: and once again take a few minutes, feel free to interact with the the chat bot here, as you see, neededModerator: benefits via application services, or well, if he already has benefits, I don't need applications. If it's if there's a question or a problem.Participant: With either what he got or we're trying to verify what's going on, that I might go to the accredited representative because he'll be able to answer my question, and I would assumeParticipant: just veterans benefits is probably gonna be a list of benefits that are possible.Participant: So yeah, if I, if I need actual help.Participant: Then I'm gonna go to the representative because that's where I'm gonna get help. If I just need info.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Then I would go. I would click, you know one of the other ones.Moderator: So yeah, go ahead. And whichever one you think is most appropriate for this made up scenario.Participant: Because I actually had to do that with my well, at the time 95 year old father, who landed on Normandy Beach on D-day, and never, never even spoke to the Va.Moderator: Oh, really.Participant: Yeah. So I got him into the Va when he was either in late 94, early 95 yeah. So he got.Moderator: Oh, wow! So it's pretty fitting for your situation. You you really.Participant: That was very appropriate when you said that, I went through that kind of thing. So yeah, it's it's it's I was like, okay, what does this guy really know about me?Moderator: Complete completely by chance. We ask everybody this question. So it's it's a well, it kind of kind of shows how this is. A fitting, a fitting request right.Participant: Oh, absolutely!Moderator: If you didn't, if you had to do it. I'm sure there's a number of other individuals that had to help their father do the same thing as well, so.Participant: Yeah, alright. So the only yeah, when it when itParticipant: you know, when I asked for an accredited representative in my back of my mind. I'm thinking, okay, I'm going to get a point of contact.Participant: Or or a Vso is gonna chat with me.Participant: which would be which would be beneficial, because now this just says can help me file or request a decision review. But that's not really what I'm asking for. We if we've already filed and I'm trying toParticipant: to log in to get his benefits. Info.Participant: Oh, then I'm you know I would have needed to.Participant: I don't know. I mean really, because my, you know, if ifParticipant: if in the scenario. My dad was in the system.Participant: He would have a login, because I had to set all that up for my father.Participant: So if that was the case, I would log in with his credentialsParticipant: and try to pull up what I needed.Participant: So if this is, gonna ask me, or give me an option to talk to a or or you know it. It leads you to believe that a Va. Accredited representative is going to be on the other side of that that selection.Participant: Then this really doesn't answer much question. And then to get more information.Moderator: Get help from via Credit Representative or via show page. So obviously that would be I would go there next. Click on thatModerator: absolutely. Go right ahead.Participant: So we click on that. And then it's gonna tell me more stuffParticipant: that might be overwhelming for someone who's older, because now they got to read a bunch more stuff that they already think they don't understand, because they won't take the time to read it. But when they take the time to read it. It's really not that hard.Participant: Okay? Well, I hope you found appointmentParticipant: types of credit representatives, type of accredited on this pageParticipant: check. If you already have one find one?Participant: Alright. Yeah, that's that's useful check. If you already have an accredited representative. So then we're gonna have to sign in again to find that out.Moderator: There you go! It all comes back to signing in alright.Participant: Which which we would have done in the start to start with.Moderator: Exactly perfect. So let's go ahead and close this window just like you did last time. And I'm gonna ask you a couple of follow up questions here? Did this answer make sense to you?Moderator: Sounds like you have to know, cause you were. You sounds like you were kind of expecting a an actual representative.Participant: Well, it it got to. It. Got to an option of finding one, but.Participant: It's still, you know, full circle back to read, needing to sign in. So I mean, if I'm on this page.Participant: and you know, and instead of coming over here and asking the you know chat, bot, I'm probably gonna sign in first.stModerator: Right.Participant: So is this good? Obviously, this isn't on the other side of a sign in page which which the amount of information, the amount of useful slash. Accurate information it can give meParticipant: is is restricted.Participant: Because we're not on the official site. We're we'reParticipant: trying to point people in the right direction, which is great. Don't get me wrong, but it's it's it's not the end that most people are going to be looking for. I thinkParticipant: from my perspective. Yeah.Moderator: So what you're saying is, if you're authenticated through the system, there'd be more information available.Participant: Absolutely.Moderator: Cool. Okay. Cool.Participant: More, more end user information, sure. Because instead of just saying, Find a representative that should, I'm assuming, if I'm logged in, we'll have.Participant: you know, points of contact, or at least you know the the phone line of death at the Va. Where you call, and you're on hold for an hour and a half, and.Moderator: Then they hang up on you. And you have to do thatModerator: personal experience. Yeah. And that's that's kind of one of the reasons we're helping to produce this chat bot to kind of lessen those calls and the strain on the call center. So.Participant: That'd be nice. Yeah.Moderator: All right, so would you want any more information provided here? In this answer.Participant: Well, yeah, I would have liked of. I would have liked for it to take me to a a an opportunity to getParticipant: that point of contact, maybe without having to sign inModerator: Right.Participant: You know, cause that. That's if if this is only if the if the full circle on this is only gonna be back to the sign in. Then it's an extra step, in my opinion. But with that said.Participant: You know, this is moreParticipant: pinpointed. I mean, you know, I had a direct question, and it gave me a direct answer, and it wanted me to sign in. But then I'm curious. If on the other side of that sign in. Was it going to? Then take me right to where I wanted I needed to go? That's the case.Participant: Then. Yeah, that would be very useful.Participant: that way. I wouldn't have to sign in and struggle to try to get to that point, because a lot of the menus and whatever just on the on the main page.Participant: They don't give you all of this.Participant: you know, pinpointed information. So yeah, I mean, if it's gonna get me where I want to go. Yeah, it's a good step.Moderator: Okay, good. So how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed.Participant: Pretty shrunkel.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Yeah, once, once I asked it a specific question, it gave me specific options.Participant: Yeah, it just it just all depends on what was on the other side of that sign in.Moderator: Exactly okay.Moderator: Did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Participant: once you once I just once. I just took my time and read through it, and and, you know, weighed my options. It was. It gave me quite a few options. Yeah.Moderator: Okay, good can you think of any way to improve the interaction or answer for this version of our chat? Bot.Participant: Hmm, and like, like, I said earlier, unless it was a more specific.Participant: You know, direct.Participant: because this is where you're gonna go. And this is what you're gonna get like a a point of contact, or whatever. And I and I get it. That's that has to be on a on a more secured area because you don't want just any John Q. Public coming onto this thing and and being able to ascertainParticipant: Con, you know, important contact information unless they they have access, or they rate to have access to it. Via sign in. So yeah, for what? It's for the what it's doing. It's it's a good good situation.Moderator: Okay, great. If you would then go back to the meeting that we're at. I've got another link that I'd like you for you to click on for our second and 3rd versions of our chat. Bot!Participant: So you want me to go back where?Moderator: Back into the chat. If you look at the chat menu.Participant: Okay, there, we go.Moderator: Yeah, there's another link there, andModerator: if you click on that link.Moderator: it should take you to another page, and it's gonna add.Participant: And hold on. I gotta move this chat box thing.Moderator: Sure.Participant: All right.Moderator: It's gonna ask for your email. And we'd like you to use the email that you used for this meeting through Perigan. So it looks like it's K. Warren, 1, 7, 3.Participant: Already, in there.Moderator: Perfect.Moderator: Now at that. At that email address, we basically did someModerator: 2 factor authentication. And it sent you a code. If you could punch that code in there we'll get access toModerator: the second version of our chat. BotModerator: alright.Moderator: and then once again, take just a couple minutes here to go through this. Familiarize yourself with the chat, bot.Participant: Can I close this chat box.Moderator: Yep, we're done with that now.Participant: I don't know why.Participant: Chatbot, 2 alright.Moderator: Yeah. So same thing. Whenever you're ready, please type in the window. How can I sign into Va.Moderator: and we're going to look at the differences between this and the last one.Moderator: So once again take your time, feel free to interact with the response the chat Bot gives, and feel free to speak out loud your thoughts and actions as you navigate.Participant: So how to verify your identity for your login? Would I? Would that be something where.Participant: you know, I provide a username or something, and it's gonna send me a a password, or is thatModerator: Let's find out. Go ahead and click on it.Participant: I mean cause if I already know, I mean, I guess I wouldn't ask that question if I already know. But you know okay, we'll play along.Participant: Verify. Okay.Participant: alright. So this is, gonna take, this is, this is like, maybe if I forgot my password, I guess.Moderator: Right order to verify your information. Looks likeModerator: they want you to take a picture or scan your driver's license or your social security card. So it looks like it's these are steps to kind of prove that you are who you say you are when you're signing up your account.Participant: Right? Well, I mean, it's you know. Well, my my initial impression was incorrect, because if they, I'm not gonna be able to verify my information because they want it.Moderator: Be right.Participant: So, and if I already knew it, I probably wouldn't be at this page.Moderator: Right? Okay.Participant: If I don't know it, I can't give it to you, or if that was or different, different story, right? But since it's and I'm kind of screwed, I guess, if I don't know it already.Moderator: Bit of a catch. 22.Participant: Exactly. Yeah. So yeah, this wouldn't have been helpful if I didn't know my information.Moderator: Sure. Okay.Moderator: let's go ahead and close this window, then, and if you'll notice there's a bit of a different feedback mechanism at the bottom. And if you want to, yeah, there you go. You can click on another link or.Participant: Okay, what? What if I can't send in how to verify your identity?Participant: That would be kind of the same thing as the login.gov.Participant: I already have one created. What if I can't sign in because my password doesn't work?Participant: Haven't had that problem. But I guess I could askParticipant: moment much for me.Participant: So those are good options. If I if if you know for some reason I lose it.Moderator: Right.Participant: So being able to reset it. But I'm sure they're gonna want my login. So. But if the only thing I can't remember my is my password. Then that's not all bad.Moderator: Right? Okay.Participant: Yeah. So that's that would. That's helpful. If I needed that that option.Moderator: Sure. So let's go ahead and ask a couple follow up questions here. So do you think that this version answered your question? How do I log in? Does this answer make sense?Participant: I don't know, because I mean it wanted it wanted it, I mean, if I didn't know if I was having trouble logging in the second one helped, you know, at least would have let me reset. So I mean, yeah. But if I go back to the 1st one, then then that wouldn't have been helpful, because if I don't know my information that wasn't going to help me getParticipant: right. Yeah. So kind of a long.Moderator: Roundabout way to kind of get you where you needed to go. Instead of the direct answer, kind of.Participant: Well, well, actually, I I don't think that was even along around, you know, it was an impossibleModerator: There you go!Participant: Route, because if I can't provide the basics I'm out, you know, at 1st step. SoParticipant: but yeah. The second one gave me options to you know. So long I had my login, and I could re I could redo my password. So yeah, that was more beneficial.Moderator: Got it. Okay. So do you think all the information was provided.Participant: I'll say yes.Moderator: Okay, and how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you need.Participant: Not very. I mean, as soon as I clicked on that link, it told me, okay, this is what you need, and.Moderator: Right.Participant: Go here if you if you have that, and we'll go from there. So.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Initially. Like, I say, when I when I went in there looking for info, and if I didn't have it, they weren't gonna help me that that was a little overwhelming, but the second one helped out.Moderator: Okay.Participant: I have this little net that's just buzzing the hell out of me right now. Sorry. So if I'm waving, I'm I'm just trying to get this net, and I'm gonna say, sorry.Moderator: No problem, no problem at all. It's it's that time of year.Participant: You know what though, I've got these little blue light things you plug in? And it is really been reducing their numbers greatly. Yeah, it is that it is that time of year. Yeah.Moderator: I've seen those on TV, the likeParticipant: And work.Moderator: That attracts them.Participant: Yeah, yeah, it's got a. It's got a little cover with a sticker, a sticky back to it. They go to the light. They get stuck on that little, that little you know. Pad, I guess. And yeah, they're done works. Yeah, that's good piece of gear.Moderator: Oh, good! Well, I'll have to remember that next time I've got the nap problem all right.Participant: Yeah, there's I mean, I've noticed the decrease, you know, a month ago they were. They were pretty tough now it's now they're they're about done, I guess. One little hanger on her here, that'sModerator: He won't. He won't go peacefully into.Participant: No worries.Participant: Where am I of people? Dang it!Moderator: All right, Ken, we're gonna go ahead and have you enter that same question into this one here as well. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. InformationModerator: I need to log in to help my dad get his get his benefits. Information.Participant: Webinar. My dad log in to get is.Moderator: Benefits information.Moderator: You've got it.Participant: Alright what to do if you haven't switched that doesn't. That doesn't help do much for me.Participant: Oh, wait a minute, was it? Yeah. Is that that's answering that question.Moderator: Yeah. Yup.Participant: What to do. Okay.Participant: alright, that doesn't help anything managing your profile. That's not gonna get me what I want. Ds log on Fox. Speak for that question. That's not gonna help.Participant: What if I can't sign into va.gov, that's not helping me either. So none of the none of thoseParticipant: none of those none of those fit yourParticipant: no, they really don't. Nothing. I mean, they don't give me any options like the 1st one did.Moderator: Good. Okay? So the answer didn't make much sense.Participant: Not at all well, and not not just not much sense. It's it's not useful.Moderator: Right? Okay.Participant: Because nothing in here tells me a single thing about where to go next, or who to contact, orParticipant: you know anybody that can help answer the question that I just asked.Participant: Good!Participant: Try rephrasing your question now. The only thing I guess I didn't put benefits. I put benefit. I don't think that would throw it off that far. ButModerator: No, no, it should not. Okay. So once again, this seemed like it was pretty difficult to find, because all the information wasn't provided.Participant: All right.Participant: Yeah, no, yeah. No real options for it to to go where I needed to go. Yeah.Moderator: Okay, did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process?Moderator: No, it's just useless.Moderator: Plain wrong.Moderator: Shit. Huh?Moderator: Okay? Good.Participant: What time is it? It's 92 degrees outside. Yeah, that's kind ofParticipant: exactly right. Yep, technology is not always right.Participant: No, no, I don't. Yeah, I don't. I don't put all my greetings into it, but.Moderator: Good. Okay? Why, if you could, then if you would scroll up to the top of this page, you should see a linkModerator: right there for, says component 3 under the header.Participant: Got it.Moderator: Click on that one. And we're going to try this version.Moderator: And whenever you're ready once again, type, how can I sign into VaModerator: and take a couple minutes to interact with the responses. Feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you explore this version of the Chatbot.Participant: Thought it was typing.Moderator: All right. Looks like you might have to scroll up a little bit. It kind of cut off your answerModerator: inside that box. Yeah, there you go.Participant: Well, yeah, you're right. There's a whole lot of info in there.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: All right. Let's see.Participant: Yeah, I mean, that's informative. That takes you step by step. If you if you'reParticipant: you know, how can I sign in? Yeah, that that's very informative how to do it.Participant: alright. So that's just the login.gov, and I'm I'm assuming. The more I scroll. It'll probably get to id me, or whatever which I don't use. I use theParticipant: login.gov. I think.Moderator: Right.Moderator: Well, let's take a look. It talks about creating if you need help. There's that number you referenced right.Participant: Correct. Yeah, that's that's help. Yeah, that's that's good.Moderator: And it looks like it gets into the verifying once again the the.Participant: Right? So so I'm assuming this being such a basic question would be more tailored. That question would not come from someone who already has a login. So that would be someone trying to log in for the 1st time, or someone who hadn't been on on a long time. And this would be very beneficial, because it's step by step.Moderator: Perfect. Okay, so did this answer make more sense to you?Participant: Absolutely.Moderator: Okay. Do you think all information was provided.Participant: It looks. It looks prettyParticipant: Oh, right what I'm looking for, but it looks like it provides the roomParticipant: pretty thorough, thank you. That's a good thorough works. Yeah.Moderator: Thorough. Okay.Participant: Oh, yeah.Participant: Users, users, you know, user, friendly. Yeah.Moderator: Very user. Friendly. Good. Okay. Was it easy or difficult to find what you needed.Participant: There it popped it right up, except except if you wouldn't have told me to scroll up, I might not have.Moderator: Exactly. Yeah.Participant: I mean, I wanted the way it came up with that same lastParticipant: kind of useless. You know how to verify how to createParticipant: I mean, I you know how to create a login. I mean, that's that'sParticipant: somewhat you helpful, because if I don't know if I don't have a login that would help get me there.Participant: you know, if I had an id me, or whatever that would be helpful, I guess. So. Yeah, without going through all of the stuff that I may have missedParticipant: if I wouldn't have law, you know, because a lot of times that that screen came up, and it was kind of like the same one that came up the last time it gave me those those bullets.Participant: Yeah, I mean.Moderator: Got the same answer? Probably.Participant: Yeah, but if you wouldn't have if you wouldn't have, you know, clued me in on scrolling up, then I wouldn't have got this step by step. So the answer needs to start at the topParticipant: instead of the bottom.Participant: Good. Okay?Participant: Of the of the response. Yeah.Moderator: Perfect did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?Participant: No.Participant: Okay.Participant: Yeah. Once I found it.Moderator: Right once you got it. Yeah.Moderator: let's go ahead now. And in the prompt window type, in this other secondary question I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: Do I need to? Or how do I.Moderator: I need to help my dad a login to get his benefits. Information.Participant: I'm on our keyboard. I gotta replace my keyboard.Moderator: Sticky keys.Participant: Yeah, I've got a brand new keyboard over here. I just hadn't hooked it up yet. Need I need to help my dad log in to get his benefit. Oh, come on! Good gracious!Participant: It's little swear I'm a better typer than that.Moderator: No worries.Participant: Although it all depends. Sometimes my hands work, sometimes they don't. So I'm yeahParticipant: one of those exciting things. All right. So here we go again. It's taking me to the bottom of the answer instead of the top of the answer.Participant: But now that I know that, I mean, if it you know, if it the 1st time I would have.Participant: I would have been lost. But maybe the second time I would have said, Oh, I remember this knucklehead chat pod is not starting where it needs to.Moderator: Right.Participant: I forget now, that is very, very specific.Participant: not saying go here. It says, if your dad needs help, that's that'sParticipant: very informative. You need to sign in.Participant: Okay,Participant: alright. So what? Asking, how do I log in? Assumes that we already have an account. So he needs to sign in using his own.gov or id me account that kind of makes sense, and if you need help, or that's pretty specific about pointed guardian paper on the file you call there. Okay? So that's really not really useful unless I am in a court appointed guardian.Moderator: Right.Participant: Okay, more important point and stuff.Participant: I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure how many people out there orParticipant: or appointed, but that's that's useful. If they are for general help. That's what I need is general help.Participant: So I'd call that numberParticipant: hopefully give them all his pertinent information, and they would say, All right, let's redo your account. And then we go on down, and for more details. That's a lot of court appointed guardians out there, I guess.Participant: What to do if you haven't switched. Yeah, if you haven't switched, you haven't paid attention to any of the year long updates they gave you about. Hey, this is going away, and you need to change your login.Moderator: Yep.Participant: What if I can't sign in because my password that's good cause it's gonna help me re redo my password.Participant: managing your profile? You're gonna need to be able to log in to get to your profile. If you can't log in, then that's problematic.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: And frequently quite frequently asked questions. But that's only if you're using the Ds log on whichParticipant: most most veterans aren't.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Alright. Let me go over a couple of follow up questions here, then, did this answer make sense to you?Participant: It did. It was a long read, butParticipant: yeah, I think I would have gone straight to the general help first, st because I think I I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm just not aware of what's going on in the world. But I would betParticipant: there's gonna be more people who just need general help than people who are court appointed guardians of the veteran.Participant: But I can see where, if you're helping your dad, that's a possibility. But I don't know. Like I said, I'm I'mParticipant: I'm not aware of ofParticipant: you know. I I never needed that. So I guess maybe that's just my problem. ButParticipant: yeah, I think I would put the general help first.stModerator: Got it. Okay, sounds good.Moderator: Would you want any more information provided? Here.Participant: Well, it, you know it gives me it gives me someone to contact if I needed to.Participant: Maybe let's see.Participant: Yeah, it gives me the opportunity to help with my. If my password's not workingParticipant: I want well, and it's it'd be hard to say.Participant: you know. Help me find my information, because if I can't log inParticipant: what if I don't know my username.Moderator: Right.Participant: Usually they give you both options, I will, on some sites you go to. It gives you both options. What if you can't, you know, if I what if I can't remember my my log on? What if I can't remember my password, or, you know, forgot log on forgot password, whatever having that opportunity might helpParticipant: cause. I mean, if you can't, if you don't remember your log on, then your passwords doesn't work. But if I know my! If I know my log on, then being able to find my password would help. So yeah.Moderator: Okay, so would you say it was easy or difficult to find the information that you needed.Participant: It gave me options. I mean, yeah, I mean, ifParticipant: you know from my question, I need to help my dad log and get his benefits. So I mean that that question to me tells me I don't. I don't know his log on information, so general help.Participant: You know, if I called that number, depending on what they could or could not do for me. I would imagine, you know, if I give his social security number and all that you know. Address, phone number, date of birth. They'll probably be able to pull him upParticipant: and give me what I need so long. They answer the phone, and if they don't, or something's wrong with that, then, having the opportunity to, you know, figure out my log onParticipant: and or password would be very beneficial.Moderator: Okay, did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No, except for having to read through all the court and stuff.Moderator: Kind of lengthy. There.Participant: Yeah, maybe maybeParticipant: maybe put that under a link, you know, if you're if you're a court appointed guardian like that down there with all these other ones.Participant: because I mean, that's you know your general helpParticipant: is one sentence, and the court appointed stuff is, you know, a paragraphModerator: Right? So you think maybe, like aModerator: qualifying question, or something where it said like, are you a quote court.Participant: Yeah, down, down at the bottom, where you know what to do. If you haven't switched to log, or whatever have have a bullet down there about. If you are a court appointedParticipant: guardian.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Click here, or you know.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Good.Moderator: That's good feedback.Participant: Because the you know, if if you're not a court appointed guardian, then none of that is relevant rightParticipant: had to read through, and it may have, you know some. You know I'm that way sometimes some veterans are very impatient.Participant: The older ones are not willing to read through a lot of things to get to what they need. I know my dad wasn't so he may have.Moderator: When he've either started reading this, and it was all about court appointed guardians.Participant: It probably would have made him stop reading itParticipant: before he got to the general help. That's why I'm thinking general help definitely needs to be 1stParticipant: to give them that option, and then down below those bullets, you know, because because if you take out that paragraph and a half, you'd obviously have more room for more bullets, and then that would give more options.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Yeah, that's that's great.Participant: Keep it simple. Stupid is the best approach. You know the kiss system, especially for veterans, and especially older veterans, because most of them are not as computer savvy, or they just don't want to sit here and read this stuff because they get confused.Moderator: Okay, good. So besides, that piece of feedback, is there anything else you can think of that would improve this interaction or answer.Participant: No, I think I think that's that's pretty good.Moderator: Good. Okay? Well, that does it for the task portion. I've got just a few questions for follow up here, and then we'll be let you get on your way should take about 3 to 5Êmin.Participant: So how did you feel while using the Chatbot? Were there points where you felt stuck or annoyed, or maybe even especially satisfied?Participant: Well, depending on what I was asking and what component we were on. You know they all had differentParticipant: uses, I guess, or you know, or or lack thereof. In some cases it just all depend on the question.Participant: I mean, it was fairly, you know, for you know, forthright, I mean it was it was, it was.Participant: It wasn't overly daunting. Sometimes it gave me the information I wanted, sometimes it didn't, so.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Situational, I guess.Moderator: Right at any point. Did you feel confused or frustrated, or maybe overwhelmed with the responses.Participant: Little frustrated on that on the component to where none of the answers were relevant.Moderator: Yeah. Just didn't just didn't answer your question.Participant: Yeah, exactly. And a little confusing. When when the you know the chat bot.Participant: it's answer is at the bottom of its response instead of instead of right, you know it should have started. I mean, it would have been better like like my screen is. Now, if I can see my question, and then the first.st The next thing I see is the answer, and not the bottom of the answer.Moderator: That's great feedback. Were the chat bots responses easy to understand or overwhelming at any point.Participant: If you read them, they're not overwhelming, I mean, I think the the length of some of the answers.Participant: while not necessarily overwhelming.Participant: can be because some people just don't want to sit here and read all that stuff you know they they need. They need an answer. They want a short.Participant: short questions, short answer and and having to go through all of this, and then you're reading about things that don't really apply to me.Participant: Is a little off putting so yeah, then, I'm over here looking at the rest of the screen going? Okay, where's where's the answer I really wantParticipant: that's right of instead of, you know.Moderator: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That answered my next question. Too too much information.Participant: Can be, yeah, can be, yeah, can be overwhelming. Yeah.Moderator: Right. So did you ever have to remember information from earlier in the conversation to complete a task.Participant: Not really. What do you mean? Like previous questions?Moderator: Just sometimes, if you start typing things and you're asking a question, and you kind of get get to interacting with the chat bot. You might forget your original question, so that that didn't seem to be the case here, though.Participant: No, yeah, I really didn't. I really didn't, you know? Click on a link or anything like that, although I did earlier? But yeah, it didn't seem to.Participant: Didn't seem to take me down a rabbit hole here.Moderator: Okay. Did you notice any major differences between the 3 chat bots.Participant: Hmm! Well, you know the 1st one.Participant: the 1st one, you know got me to a pointParticipant: where, if if I would have clicked on the login, and it would have taken me right to that point that I needed especially for that Va rep that would have beenParticipant: spot on second one kind of confusing didn't really give me the information I wanted. And you know, 3 gave me that option of a of a phone call, or you know what if I can't sign in a little bit more information, there would have been beneficial as far asParticipant: my username. Kinda kinda what you know. Help in that. But yeah, other thanParticipant: other than the superfluous information about more than likely something that doesn't apply to me. Yeah, 3 was probably one of the better ones, I guess.Moderator: Okay, did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning, and did it affect how you use the chat? Bot.Participant: I don't think I noticed it.Participant: You were directing me otherwise, so I don't think I really noticed a disclaimer.Moderator: If you look at the top of that box where you're scrolling, there's a light blue little bar. Go ahead and click on that light blue little bar. It's the very.Participant: Oh, please please don't enter personal information.Moderator: Yep, go ahead and click on it, and it'll give you a little bit more.Participant: This is not a mental health, partner.Participant: Alright, your answer is all good. Okay.Moderator: So did that. Let's see, are you concerned about sharing privacy, information, or personal information with the chat? Bot.Participant: I wouldn't want to, just because you don't know where it's going.Moderator: Exactly. Okay.Participant: I mean I you know, even though well, it, you know, even though up there it says it's a lockedParticipant: site, or whatever that doesn't mean anything nowadays, really. I mean, I I prefer I mean, I don't have a choice but to trust my information with the Va. So I mean they. They have it all already, but I don't know who has access to this chat box. SoParticipant: I usually try to refrain from that. Yeah.Moderator: Okay.Participant: But telling me not to do it is a good is a good is something good. I mean that. That reminds me, hey? Maybe this maybe you shouldn't trust these kind of these kind of Chatbot things.Moderator: Right? Okay.Moderator: were, the Chatbot answers the right length for you, or did you ever want more or less details.Participant: Well, I don't like showing that 3rd one. That was a lot of extra info that I didn't need that made a little more confusing. ButParticipant: yeah, I mean, once you get, once you got, once I got to what was beneficial, but that was good. ButParticipant: you know, like, I said, put the help, the general help upfront. And you know,Participant: that would help more people, probably. And then the rest of it. Yeah, okay, that's superfluous for most, but who knows it? It.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay, so now, after kind of using the chat bot, would you say that you have used other chat bots before? Or this is just a completely new experience for you.Participant: This is new on the Va. I don't think I've ever done a chat by the Va. You know, like there's some other sites where you ask it a question, and it talks back to you whatever. But but it always wants you toParticipant: always want you to pay for some service or whatever. So yeah.Moderator: Compared to those other Chatbot experiences. Would you say that this is what you expected.Participant: Yeah, it was more, it was more informational. I mean, it was very much more informative work. So yeah, being informative was good. It's just how it got there. Some of those little idiosyncrasies I pointed out. But I mean, yeah, it seemed helpful.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: If the chat Bot didn't answer your question, what did you do next? If you felt stuck.Participant: Well, they had. They had help numbers, you know. If you if you'reParticipant: having trouble signing in, call this person, if you need general help call this number. So yeah, I gave options so long. There's somebody on the other end of that line that would be willing to help. That makes it, you know, easier for people who actually need help. If there's a number and it never gets answered. It goes to a You know, a voicemail that no one ever monitors, or it just rings all day. Then we get pissed off, or like, Well, Va, you know it's they.Participant: It's not a positive experience.Moderator: Absolutely okay. So you said earlier, you felt, that the 3rd one was a little bit better. And could you give me your reasons why.Participant: I think it was more specific, as far as you know. Besides the initial.Participant: Okay, I'm starting at the bottom of which thatParticipant: that really, you know it. It it depends on the situation. If the only thing I needed was this password then? Yes, that was beneficial. If I didn't know any of his information then. That's reallyParticipant: wasn't that helpful, and would not have answered my question if it would have started at the top.Participant: Or if it would have had for general helpParticipant: gave me an opportunity to call someone, then that would have been helpful.Participant: so yeah, just and if it would have had, you know what if I can't sign in? Because my, I don't know myParticipant: username.Moderator: Right.Participant: Oh, and then oh, I don't know my password, one of those 2, because that's usually that's usually the problem. Either. One of them doesn't work. You don't remember one of them, or you didn't write it down, or whatever. So, having those options would be beneficial.Moderator: Got it. Okay,Moderator: do you notice anything specific that you would suggest that we correct or change to help improve the user experience.Participant: You know? Like I said the correct answer. First.st you know the the generalized. Yeah, this kind of more bullet bulletized. Yeah? Answer. You know the correct answer for the correct question. Kind of thing. Yeah.Moderator: Good.Moderator: Okay. Well, do you have any other comments or suggestions, or any questions for me?Participant: No, sir, I think we covered a bunch.Moderator: We sure did. Well, that concludes our survey, then, for today we appreciate you, taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the va.gov. Site to make sure that it works for veterans. Lastly, Perigan will be sending you a thank you with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans, that you might knowModerator: that provides them the chance to participate in any of our future research studies. So that does it for today, sir, thanks again for your time and enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: Thank you very much. You do the same.Moderator: Absolutely you take care!Participant: Alright! Thank you that bye!
