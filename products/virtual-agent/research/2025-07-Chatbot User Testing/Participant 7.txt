Participant 7 Ð July 24, 2025 Ð 3:00 PM ESTModerator: Thanks so much for that. I'm going to. Also, with your permission, take the transcript, which is basically just a bot listening and writing down all the words.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Okay. So I have your permission, then for recording audio and visual, as well as the transcript. Perfect thanks. So much.Participant: Yes.Moderator: While our observers are coming into the room. Here, let me go ahead, and also tell you that this session should take anywhere from about 40 to 45Êmin. I don't want to keep you much longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you to move on to the next task or topicModerator: in this session. We want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers, and we're not testing your knowledge or abilities on Chatbots. Here we welcome any and all feedback, and we won't be offended by any of the opinions that you express.Moderator: Your participation is completely voluntary, and if you need to stop or cancel the session at any time, please let me know, and we'll go ahead and do that.Moderator: Let's see here.Moderator: That then takes us to our pre-testing questions. I wanted to ask a couple questions about the computer and how you're accessing this meeting today. So I guess 1st of all, are you working on a Mac or a windows machine?Participant: A windows.Moderator: Okay? And let's see, are you using which which specific web browser would that be Microsoft? Or maybe.Participant: I'm sorry. Say that again.Moderator: We're looking for the web browser that you're using, like, for instance, Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.Participant: Oh, Google, chrome!Moderator: Blue chrome perfect, all right.Moderator: And are you using any assistive technology today like a screen? Reader.Participant: No.Moderator: No, all right, and let me ask you about your familiarity with Chatbots. Now, have you ever used Chatbots before?Participant: I'm I've used it.Participant: I'm not sureParticipant: How you know I know I've I've done something with it. I don't remember.Moderator: So you don't know any specific names of any. No, okay. How many would you say that you've used in? Let's just say the last month.Participant: I, Google, like AI, you know, like I, Google and AI comes up. So I've used it. And it said,Participant: deeper dive kind of thing. So I've used that a few, I'd say overParticipant: 20 times in the last month.Moderator: 20 times.Participant: Yeah. Oh, at least 20 more.Moderator: Okay, so how many?Moderator: So if you want to.Moderator: times in the last month, how many times would you say in the last 6 months.Participant: Hmm, probably 20 times no, maybe maybe 30. Yeah, maybe you know, it hasn't been. It's it was more someModerator: More recently got it. So you just.Participant: Recently. Yes.Moderator: Just been starting to get into it. And if I'm not mistaken, I think Google's is called Gemini. So you're using Google Gemini for that, all right.Participant: It looks like that's familiar. Yeah.Moderator: Okay, cool. What I'm gonna ask next, then, is, we're going to get into the actual tasks themselves. So if you can access your chat window. I'm gonna send you a link.Moderator: can you?Moderator: Yeah, it's down at the bottom, a couple just a couple away from where video is at.Participant: I think that's that's it. Yeah.Participant: got it? Oh, okay. So you want me to click on that.Moderator: Yes, please click on that link.Moderator: And then, once you've got that web page pulled up.Moderator: I I'd like to ask you to share your screen.Participant: Okay.Moderator: So that I can see what you're seeing, or we can see what you're seeing rather.Participant: Okay, so share screen is here.Moderator: Yeah, it's down at the bottom. Mine has a little green arrow pointing up.Moderator: I'm not sure yours might too.Participant: I am the site issues. Oh, no problem.Moderator: I I work contacts as well. So in the same boat.Participant: Okay, so it's a share share.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Alright! Looks like it's loading on my end. We'll give it just a second here.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Alright perfect. So if you want to.Participant: Open, that.Moderator: Yeah, like, make that window a little bit bigger. So.Participant: It went away.Moderator: Seymour.Participant: I'm messing up here. Sorry.Moderator: It's fine.Participant: I'm 1 of those people.Moderator: No problems at all. I got we got an hour.Participant: You don't want an hour with me messing around with. I'm doing okay. I'm trying to see what happened where the screen went to.Moderator: So I think it clicked behind it. So maybe if you minimize this window,Participant: Okay.Moderator: I think it's stuck behind it, so.Participant: Yeah, there, we go.Moderator: There we are. Yeah.Participant: Still trying to make it bigger. Okay, something else is in the way.Moderator: At the top window. There's a little square. Yeah square.Moderator: Yeah, here we go.Moderator: Perfect.Participant: Okay.Moderator: So then what I'd like you to do next is, take your time andModerator: familiarize yourself with the page a little bit, take a look around, feel free to speak aloud as you make your way through, kind of talking about what you see and what you're clicking on, and then, whenever you're ready, go ahead and click, start, chat.Participant: Okay, over here. It's a start chat. Yeah.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Can you see my screen?Participant: Hmm!Participant: Look at the Va here, huh?Participant: Hey, Chad? Chad, is something that's wrong.Participant: Okay? So before you start anything you're like, okay, no.Participant: okay. So this is what we would seeParticipant: going into the Va chat box.Moderator: Correct.Participant: Any veteran. Okay, telling us, okay, what to expect too much.Participant: Can't do any of these things.Participant: How to use our chat box, the screen. Okay, let me use the screen, reader. SoParticipant: select when you use the check box. Okay.Participant: okay, so I'm gonna start.Moderator: Perfect.Moderator: Yeah, go ahead.Moderator: And then what I'd like you to do after you read our all right.Moderator: Our opening message here.Participant: Okay, I need to move this over here.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Okay, welcome to the Vhs. BotskyParticipant: Bots can help you find general information. Okay.Participant: what's the pack deck? What is? Okay? All right.Moderator: Alright. So the 1st thing I'd like you to do is in thatModerator: prompt window type in how can I sign into Va.Participant: Okay. Enter, posted.Moderator: Yes, please.Participant: Oh, wow! Yeah. Sign in support.Participant: Secure messaging. Via, okay.Moderator: And then just go, whichever one you think makes the most sense for an answer, go ahead and click on it, and just keep interacting with it.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Until until you're stuck or you're kind of.Participant: Okay, sign in support. Okay? And then show me the login id me.Participant: I usually use one of the top 2.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Up my account.Participant: forgot my password. That's me.Moderator: A 2. You forgot your password. Okay.Participant: All the time. I'm always having to changeParticipant: because I have them saved on my computer. So I don't really remember them.Participant: That's a problem. I know.Moderator: Does that answer your question? Yes.Participant: 5 stars. Great please rate your experience.Moderator: Okay? So that we're at the end of the then of this 1st interaction. So let me go ahead and ask a few follow-up questions? Did the answer make sense to you?Participant: The answer, and what each time I'll prompt. I I selected something. Yes.Moderator: Yes, it it did.Moderator: Okay, do you think all information was provided.Participant: It seems like it for me.Moderator: It seemed like it.Participant: But I don't know, because I went fast.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Yeah, yeah.Moderator: The one wanting to know?Participant: It seemed like it was giving me. My.Participant: yeah, I mean, I it's answers I would have expected to pop up. Yeah.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: Let's see how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you need.Participant: Very easy. It was easy.Moderator: Okay, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, great. Let's move on. Then I'd like you to find the prompt window again.Moderator: And then type another question. So.Participant: So I have to just go here.Moderator: Yeah, there you go. I would like you to type. I need to help my dadModerator: log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: Need to help my dad.Moderator: Log in to get his benefits, information.Participant: Okay.Participant: select from the following topic, sign and support veterans, benefits Va accredited representative. SoParticipant: I guess I would sign in support. First.stModerator: Okay.Participant: Boom.Participant: I think either one of them, any of them, would probably give you that same information.Moderator: Whatever. Yeah, whatever you think is the right answer. Again, no wrong or right answers just whatever you would do in a normal situation.Participant: Logged in up my account. Yeah.Participant: see more options with my security options logged inParticipant: alright. See? You.Moderator: Like you're stuck here. So I'm gonna go ahead and stop you right now.Moderator: And start and ask a couple of questions. So.Participant: Sure.Moderator: Again.Moderator: Do you think this answer made sense.Participant: Yes, because it'sParticipant: My thinking is I wanna get to the benefits part. But maybe to get to the benefits I have to help my dad get his login information.Moderator: Huh? Got it?Participant: Like. Maybe I don't have it, and he doesn't have it.Participant: And so that's why I went for the support first.stParticipant: But if you have the login. Then maybe we can get to the benefits part quicker.Moderator: Valia. Okay, so do you think that maybe there should be more information provided.Participant: Maybe.Moderator: Be more clear.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay.Participant: I think so.Moderator: So it seems like you got stuck there at the end. So would you say it was easy or difficult to find what you needed.Participant: It was more difficult.Moderator: Yeah, this one, harder.Participant: I started like, Okay, am I getting?Participant: How much information am I getting for my dad to get to his benefitsParticipant: like if he doesn't have anything.Participant: Then I need. I need bigger help.Participant: And and truthfully, that login.gov may not help right.Participant: She doesn't have a lotParticipant: in front of them already if he hasn't actually registered before, and all that select. Yeah.Moderator: Okay, good. Did the information feel overwhelming, or seems like it seemed kind of hard or hard to process. Seemed like it.Participant: Yeah, cause I mean, some people wouldn't even know what all that's after. That second prompt after the 1st prompt, and you get to the second with the choices. Id me.Participant: orParticipant: was it login backed up? I don't even remember the other ones, because I don't. I don't use them like that. But yeah, they could be.Participant: Those terms might not be familiar, for people.Moderator: Got it. Okay? So for this version of the chat Bot, can you think of any way to improve the answers or interactions.Participant: I would think this more genericParticipant: terms. For the login information, you know, maybe something that would explain whatParticipant: the login information is asking for, you know. How do you go about getting it?Moderator: Sure.Participant: I think that's all like, you know, either more prompts or moreParticipant: assistant prompts, I guess, like underneath, like the plus button.Participant: To see if there are more selections under each one.Moderator: Gotcha.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: Great. So that ends our interaction that we're going to do today with the 1st Chatbot. If you can make your way back to the Zoom Meeting. There's another link I'd like you to click on in the chat again. So you minimize that window. You might have to bring upModerator: the other edge windowModerator: or no, you're in chrome right? You might have to bring up the other chrome window.Participant: What? What do you?Participant: I mean? Oh, actually see the chat box? Yeah.Moderator: Oh, you get I'm sorry. I mean I mean the chat, for in zoom soModerator: I think since you're presenting, you might be able to see the little outside edges.Moderator: Of the zoom, I think earlier said, oh, I have to move this that little piece.Moderator: Yeah, that's where I am.Moderator: If you can access the chat, I've put another.Participant: Yeah, i see the linkModerator: Yeah.Participant: Click, on that.Moderator: Click on that one. Yeah.Moderator: And then use the email that you use to sign up with Perigan. In this part looks like Participant, 1 0 1 5 at Gmail.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Yeah, if you go ahead and do that, then we're gonna do some 2 quick, 2 factor authentication. So it's gonna ask you for a code. So it's gonna email, you a code. If you hit, send me the code.Participant: Okay.Moderator: We'll shoot you an email with a verification. So we just need you to put in that verification code.Participant: Okay.Participant: Do you want me to see?Participant: Hold on.Participant: I'm like a cheat.Moderator: Yeah, might be. Yeah. It probably send it to your phone, too. If you have your phone set up with your email.Participant: Yeah, it's like, my phone is moving slow.Participant: It's not coming up. Oh, here it is. It is there.Moderator: Yeah, it should say, cloudflare.Participant: Exactly. Yeah, no.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: 2, 0, hold 6.Moderator: All right.Moderator: Here we go!Participant: -Oh, you've got a login session.Moderator: Hit the refresh, or I'm sorry. Hit the link button again.Moderator: The link.Participant: From the chat. If you go back to the chat in zoom hit that link. This is sometimes happens.Moderator: Hit that link button one more time.Moderator: And we should be good to go.Moderator: Knock on wood.Participant: Yeah, hmm. Can't reach this page. Hold on. Maybe it's coming up again. Okay.Moderator: There he goes. Yeah.Participant: So it's on the other page, though.Moderator: This is a different page. Actually, yeah.Moderator: One. If you scroll up to the top, you can see this one.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: your email address Participant, 1 0 1 5. So this one we had to authenticate. So it's a little bit different.Participant: I got you.Moderator: So once again, please take your time. Kind of familiarize yourself with the page, and when you're readyModerator: no rush at all. Take all your time, and I'll have you type in. How can I sign into Va in the chat box? Prompt window.Participant: Okay.Participant: so how do I work.Moderator: Oh, it's a how can I sign into Va.Participant: Okay, yeah.Participant: okay.Participant: they're all stupid.Participant: I did that answer your question. Let me see.Participant: Thanks for asking this question. Here is what I found.Participant: What if I can't sign into va.gov.Participant: Because my password doesn't work? How to verify your identityParticipant: for your login, how to create a login?Participant: So I asked, how can I sign in? But I can't sign in.Participant: Okay.Participant: verify your identity.Participant: It's a lot of information they're giving you.Moderator: Right.Participant: Screenshots, which you know is good. It's just a lot.Participant: You have to look at a lot, but it's good becauseParticipant: it'll take you. I remember going through this myself a while ago.Participant: Sure, sure.Moderator: Yeah. It takes you through all the steps.Participant: Yeah.Participant: And I like to go through steps a little bit at a time.Participant: Okay? So.Moderator: Are you still finding your answer on how to sign in, though.Participant: It's taken me a while toParticipant: figure that out, because I gotta look at a lot.Moderator: Yeah, alright, I'm gonna stop you right here. Then.Participant: Okay.Moderator: So does this answer make sense to you? Or were you a bit confused, a little confused?Participant: Because.Moderator: Yeah, it's a lot said it seems like too much information was.Participant: Provided, right.Moderator: Okay, so would you say that it's pretty difficult or easy to find what you needed.Participant: It's difficult.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: A little bit of both hard to process a little overwhelming.Participant: Yeah. Cause I'm still like, okay, I'd have to take moreParticipant: word for word, step to step by step should not be overwhelmed. Yeah.Moderator: Okay, so let's go ahead and close this tab on the browser then, and go back to the chat. Bot!Participant: Okay.Moderator: AndModerator: now I'd like to have you enter in the same question we had last time, which is, I need to help my dadModerator: log in to get his benefits, information.Participant: Hmm!Participant: So they're given choices what to do if you haven't switched to login managing a VaParticipant: dot gov profile ds login fax.Participant: if I can't sign into Va. Because my password doesn't work.Participant: If none of these is correct, please try rephrasing your question another way, so I don't thinkParticipant: any of these. Give me the answer I'm looking for.Moderator: Alright. So, number one, you would say, your answer does not make sense. Then.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And would you want more information provided.Participant: Oh, yes, more information, more specific to what I I need.Moderator: Sure. Okay, and good again, was it more easy or difficult to find what you needed.Participant: It was easier to determine that it wasn't what I needed, but I didn't get what I needed.Moderator: I got you okay?Moderator: And did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Not as much as the 1st question. But yeah, it was. Yeah. I had to read each one to say, Okay, is it answering my question, though so it was easier and harder.Moderator: Gotcha easier to think like you said easier to figure out that you were wrong.Participant: Right, yeah.Moderator: Okay? And finally, for these 2 last 2 questions.Moderator: Can you think of a way to improve the interaction or the answers.Participant: Oh, I guess maybe to to word it again differently.Moderator: Right.Participant: More, you know, specific to really what it is. Is it a login issue, or is it? Do you really want to get to his benefits.Participant: Yes, I think I think the chat box is focusing on login.Moderator: Right.Participant: And so you're having a problem with the loginParticipant: and right. And that might be what it is.Moderator: Benefits. Yeah.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: great. If you could scroll up to the top of this window, then in the header menu at the left.Moderator: Keep going a little bit further, you should see a component 3. There we go.Participant: Yeah, click.Moderator: Click on Component 3. And we're gonna ask some questions on this one.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Alright. Scroll up just a little bit to see the top of the chat window. There we go. Yep.Participant: We're on.Moderator: Component 3, and we're going to ask the same 2 questions. So 1st of all, it was, how can I sign in to Va.Participant: Okay.Participant: taking a minute.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Okay.Participant: use a login.gov account. Here's your basic outline of the process. Go to. Okay, select the sign in option. Use your loginParticipant: credentials, email and password to sign in, confirm oops, confirm last steps.Participant: But it's your 1st time, or you need to verify function.Participant: Okay, cancel, do you want me to click through anything.Moderator: Whatever you think makes sense.Participant: Oh, okay, okay, see, let's make it smaller.Moderator: Yeah, it looks like the bottom part is about troubleshooting. If you're having trouble signing in.Participant: you don't have a login, right? So they're talking about the steps. Okay? So then I would choose one of these to go further.Moderator: Yeah, if this, I think if you scroll up a little bit, it's giving you.Moderator: Yep. Those are the steps to log in.Moderator: If you don't have an account, and then if you're having trouble signing in, and then yep, there's a series of links there. What if?Moderator: Thank you.Participant: Sign in and the one you clicked before.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Got you. Okay.Moderator: Okay, so let's stop right here. Then.Moderator: Did the answer make sense to you?Participant: Yes, it makes sense again. It's a lot of reading, and so you have to.Participant: you know, it's simple enough to understand the the steps, I thinkParticipant: and then it gets a little, you know, wordy if you don't have a login, butParticipant: sometimes you don't have a login, so you need to know what to do.Moderator: Got it.Participant: When I'm looking for information I'll go through everything if I have to.Moderator: Oh!Participant: Just to see if if this is gonna helpParticipant: and start over again if I have to.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: That way. You don't have to go back and reread it. I mean.Participant: Right, right.Moderator: Okay, so do you think all information was provided.Participant: I think enough for yeah. The the question.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: AndModerator: if you notice here, there's a feedback, a little feedback at the bottom that's different from the 1st one.Moderator: So if you if you'd like. Go ahead and click that feedback in which you see the thumbModerator: thumbs down. Did that answer.Participant: Oh, there, okay, yeah. Did that answer your question? Yes.Participant: Okay.Moderator: So.Moderator: Then again, how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: I think it was easy. Based on what was there? Yes.Moderator: Sure, and did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Maybe toward the end, just you know, it was several paragraphs about the Login. So if that, if that's not the issue, then you can just go right back to the to the top toParticipant: to do it. If you have the login, if you don't, thenParticipant: we just go to to the bottom. So it was. It was easy enough.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: All right.Moderator: Let's go ahead, then, and ask the other question that we had. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits, information.Moderator: You got it.Moderator: Let's see what this version gives us for.Participant: Yes, let's see.Participant: Okay, does not have a solution that allowsParticipant: court appointed guardians to sign in on behalf a veteran using login. Okay?Participant: Va. Is working on this, but it will take time to ensure privacy and security if you are a court appointed guardian with legal paperwork on file, with Va, and currently, hmm.Participant: okay.Participant: Giving you all that information.Participant: Caregiver, who is not a court appointed veteran, must sign into their own how to access benefits information.Participant: So how's that helping him?Participant: Hmm!Participant: Did that answer your question? No, not really.Moderator: Okay.Participant: What? Yeah, I mean it it might be, if that'sParticipant: what the situation is. But it could be. You just want to help him log in.Moderator: Right.Participant: Yeah, not that you want to log in to get his information. You're just trying to help him log in.Moderator: So.Participant: Sometimes you just have to act like that purse.Moderator: Right.Participant: That's what I that's what I've had to do with my elderly people.Moderator: Right, but it sounds like you have some, some experience, being a caregiver yourself.Participant: Yes, yes, I have my parents, my aunt. I've done it.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Well, good! Let's.Participant: Let's let's go to the questions then. And let's follow up hereParticipant: didn't want the feedback I'm, sorry I forgot.Moderator: No, that's all right. Go go right ahead. Whatever you think is applicable.Participant: It is, it did, and it didn't. So I don't know. What else should I say here?Participant: Okay, I'll just say it answered my question.Participant: It's fine.Moderator: Okay, all right, let's ask. Excuse me. Let me ask you a couple questions, for follow up, then.Participant: Like.Moderator: Did the answer make sense.Participant: It made sense. It's not. It wasn't an answer I expected, but it it made sense.Participant: in terms ofParticipant: That question. Specifically, I need help.Moderator: Sure.Participant: You know again, if it's worded a little differently.Participant: or my dad needs help. You know my dad needs help, maybe, that I need to help.Participant: So it was interesting that that came up. I didn't expect that.Moderator: It's a good distinction for sure. Okay.Moderator: so would you want more information provided.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, and how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you need.Participant: It was easy because I didn'tParticipant: it? It still gave me information about something I didn't expect, butParticipant: it didn't give me the information to log in, except I could go back to the 1st question.Moderator: Right, right.Participant: You know, you can go back to wording it differentlyParticipant: to get, maybe the answer you need.Moderator: Sure, that makes sense.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Didn't feel overwhelming.Participant: One time. Just do what they were saying.Participant: They weren't giving me no help.Participant: Have a core point.Moderator: Right.Participant: Oh!Moderator: All right.Participant: Even if I did, they they wouldn't accept it. I think right?Participant: Right? Okay.Moderator: And then finally, can you think of a way to improve this interaction, or answer.Participant: Always rewrite the question. If if you're not finding the answerParticipant: that you're trying to get through a chat box, you can reword itParticipant: different ways to see if you're gonna come up with your answer. It might be frustrating.Participant: but it's not that hard to me to reward it. Yeah.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: so that does it for the task. I've got some questions then for a post task interview should just take a couple of minutes, and then we'll be.Participant: Okay. Oh, wow!Moderator: So how did you feel while using the chat bots? Were there points where you ever felt stuck or annoyed?Participant: No, I was in Illinois justParticipant: yeah. I wasn't annoyed and feel stuck.Participant: I always feel like you can find out more information by doing it a little differently.Participant: You know, there's there's there's different things to click on and find information that way.Participant: So okay.Moderator: At any point. Did you feel confused.Moderator: frustrated, or overwhelmed by some of the Chatbot responses.Participant: Yeah, with that that second one, I guess, withParticipant: helping my dad in the 1st task, I felt likeParticipant: I wasn't getting. It was like a lot of information. I think I remember.Participant: I won't say frustrated, but just like, well, I just gotta figure out another way to get it. But it was a lot of information. Yeah.Moderator: Yeah, okay.Moderator: were the chat box responses easy to understand, or were they overwhelming at all at any point.Participant: Yeah, I wouldn't say overwhelming.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Did the chat Bot ever give you too much information at once? Or was it just about right.Participant: That last one was like a lot of information, but it was good information.Moderator: No right.Participant: Just didn't need it right at that moment. Yeah.Moderator: Did you ever have.Participant: Grain of salt.Moderator: Go ahead, take it with a grain of salt. Yeah.Participant: Take it with a grain of salt.Moderator: Yep.Moderator: all right. So did you ever have to remember information from earlier in the conversation to complete a task.Participant: No.Moderator: No. Okay.Moderator: Did you notice any major difference between the 3 different chat bots.Participant: The last one took a while for it to come up. SoParticipant: I was. I was curious about that. It's searching for information because it's not gonna give youParticipant: maybe something that you're really looking for.Participant: That was my feeling that oh, oh, I might not get what I'm looking for.Participant: because it's taking a while.Moderator: That the answers on the lat. On the last one were more accurate than the 1st 2, or more complete, perhaps.Participant: I don't even know it. It was definitely precise in what it was getting from that prompt soParticipant: is letting you know upfront.Participant: You can't log in, or someone so.Moderator: Got it.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay, did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning.Moderator: and did it affect how you use the chat? Bot.Participant: I did notice it. No, I didn't notice that.Participant: So we're.Moderator: Were you? Were you ever concerned about sharing privacy or personal information? Then.Participant: I I'm never really that concerned about it. But I guess, I should be,Moderator: Got it. Okay.Participant: You know.Moderator: Do you believe the Chatbot answers were the right length for you?Participant: Yes.Moderator: Did you ever feel that there needed to be more or less detail.Participant: More detail on that 1st one, the 1st set, and thenParticipant: this, this the second and the 3.rd Excuse me.Participant: not so much that it needed to be less.Participant: Just.Participant: You gotta. You gotta take time to read it, you know. It might. Yeah.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: so was the Chatbot what you expected? And was it similar or different to Chatbots you've worked with in the past?Participant: I think it's similar to our you know about what I expect good deal.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: If the Chatbot didn't answer your questions, what did you do? Not next? If you were felt stuck.Participant: Look for another way to get the answer.Participant: either in what was presented, you know, clicking on something else.Participant: Or rewording the question.Moderator: Thank you.Participant: Yeah, that's that's always my thinking.Moderator: Perfect. Okay, so did you feel strongly about one over the other?Moderator: Did you.Participant: Oh!Moderator: 10 more than the others.Participant: The second one, I think, was well, the second one was the one where I felt was like more warm. It's something.Participant: I don't know. Now let's see.Participant: The 1st one, I think, probably was the easiest one. The last oneParticipant: gave you information that you didn't expect to get so then would ease it would make it make it easier for me to say, Okay, maybe I need to reword it. Well, actually, all 3 of them. I could reword it differently.Participant: so I wouldn't think any one of them was more so than the other.Moderator: Oh, okay, so you didn't really have a preference for one or the other. Okay.Participant: Okay. Let's see.Moderator: Let's see, did you notice anything specific that you suggest that we correct or change that might improve the user experience.Participant: Oh.Participant: I know that they I don't remember if it said it on the 1st one, but I I do remember reading the second and 3rd one about.Participant: You know, this doesn't answer the question, you know, to maybe reword it. And that's that's, you know.Participant: My go to his suit trying to find another way.Participant: so I can't remember if they did that on the 1st one, and I know on the second, too.Participant: they had the did this answer your question.Participant: Maybe the first.st I just don't remember.Moderator: Yeah, let me let me take take a look.Moderator: Let's seeModerator: the one. The 1st one was a little bit different, because they had buttons to click on, whereas the other ones kind of gave you shorter answers with.Participant: And yeah, they gave you a link. Versus those buttons, too. Okay.Moderator: You got it so.Participant: Yeah, they're little.Moderator: Different interactions.Participant: What can't you.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: I think some people might like those buttons, butParticipant: within the button does it give you what you're looking for? So you might have to record it, anyway.Moderator: Did you have a preference in the buttons versus the links was one more easy to.Participant: Yeah, not for me.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And finally, do you have any other comments or suggestions, or any questions for me?Participant: No, this is great. IParticipant: I think this is great, that the Va.
