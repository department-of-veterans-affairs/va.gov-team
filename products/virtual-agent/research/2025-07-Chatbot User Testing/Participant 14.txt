Participant 14 Ð July 31, 2025 Ð 1:00 PM ESTModerator: Recording now and once again, sir, just to confirm, we do have your permission to record.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Awesome. Okay, let's get into why we're here today. We are a team who is working with the Va on the new Chatbot.Moderator: and we're going to show you 3 different proof of concepts for 3 different versions. I guess you could say of the chat but that we're working on. Currently, I want you to keep. Please keep in mind that this is the proof of concept, and we're specifically focusing on login or sign in for these bots. And the bots might not all be optimized to give the fastest or even the right answer. So if you feel the answer is wrong, just tell usModerator: the session should be about 40 to 45Êmin.Moderator: Because of that I want to make sure to not keep you too much longer than that. So occasionally I may move you along on a task or question that we're working on in this session. We want to hear your honest opinions. There's no right or wrong answers. We're not testing your knowledge about bots or anything like that. So we welcome any and all of your feedback, and we won't at all be offended by any of the opinions that you express.Moderator: And finally, and most importantly, this is, of course, completely voluntary, so you don't have to participate whether you do or not has no effect on your benefits or anything with Va. If you'd like to stop the session at any time, just let me know.Moderator: alright perfect. So before we get into the task part I got a couple of pre testing questions just to see like some demographic information. 1st of all, will you be using any assistive technology like a screen? Reader for these tasks?Moderator: No, okay. And what device are we on? Is it a windows or a Mac?Participant: Windows.Moderator: Okay? And what's the operating system? And do you know what browser that you're gonna be using today?Participant: I use chrome, and it's windows 11, I guess. 64 bit.Moderator: Cool. So finally, how familiar are you with chat bots? Have you used any of them in the past?Participant: Yes, I have.Moderator: Oh, good! Which ones?Participant: A lot. I mean, once, for you know, cable I used t-mobile banking doesn't really help much.Moderator: Customer service ones like when you go to a company's website right?Participant: Got it. Okay.Moderator: Okay? So that that type have you used any of the other like kind of voluntary bots like Chat Gpt, where you go and kind of interact.Participant: AI, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I've I've got a few on my phone.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Copilot Gemini chat gpt.Moderator: Oh, good. Okay.Moderator: To use a lot of them.Participant: Yeah, there's 1 with for tattoos. That's pretty cool.Moderator: Really, that's interesting.Moderator: Is it? Like image generator, then? Oh, huh! Funny!Participant: Tell them what you what kind of tattoo you want. It makes it, and it's really strange usually. But.Moderator: Pick like the style then cause there's a lot of different styles of tattoo. Oh, interesting! Oh, that's.Participant: There's I've used a few where you can make a song.Participant: AndParticipant: it's like for my 6 year old daughter, I mean, you know, it's like, Hey, brush your teeth song. And it it was pretty funny, so.Moderator: There he is!Participant: In the style of Taylor Swift, of course, and it just sounded pretty awesome.Moderator: I've some some of the funny Tiktok videos where they take like country songs that are just just silly. Just silly. Okay. So how many times would you say that you've used them in the last monthModerator: from from either either version of the Chatbot we're talking AI Chatbot, or just like customer service chat bots.Participant: I'd say a few times a week.Moderator: Okay. So in a month, maybe a dozen or 20 a month.Participant: Yeah, I'd say, let's say 12 to to be fair. Yeah.Moderator: Okay, so let's do, just do the math in in 6 months. Then you're looking at. You know, about a hundred 50 ishModerator: interactions, and if we were to do it for a year, probably well, over 300.Participant: Yeah, yeah.Moderator: Okay, good. Perfect. So what I'm gonna do next, I've got a link I'm gonna share with you, which is up on our dev server ofModerator: the kind of in-flight version that we've had forModerator: the last little while here, and this is the one it says the same interface. So if you could look at our chat, I sent?Moderator: Yep.Moderator: and if you could, could you share your screen as well? So we can see right where you're following along, and all that good stuff.Participant: One second. Here, move some screens around.Participant: see? SharedParticipant: where I don't use zoom that often.Moderator: Sure. So at the bottom menu, where you see the audio and the video, if you keep going, there's a little green button.Participant: Right in the middle. Sorry. It's been a long day already.Moderator: No, no, no, yeah. If you're not familiar with zoom, it's different than teams and all that good stuff.Participant: Yeah.Participant: Alright,Moderator: Yep, it's loading here.Moderator: perfect, all right. So what I'd like you to do is just kind of observe the page. Take your time, go ahead and feel free to read what you need to. If you scroll down, there's some little menus down there with some stuff hidden in those drawers, and as you do so feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and your action, as you're kind of reading through stuff.Participant: Perfect.Moderator: And whenever you're ready, go ahead and click the start. Chat.Participant: Well, if this this being a desktop page I'm I'm a widescreen, whichParticipant: it's pretty much most of every screen. There's a lot of dead space on both sides.Moderator: Sure.Participant: So like we stretched out and kind of compacted a bit.Participant: Yeah, this is probably the legal Mumbo Jumbo. You have to put in thereParticipant: your numbers before you start.Participant: Yeah, if my life is in health or in danger, I'm probably not clicking through 4 tabs to get here. But.Moderator: Alright!Participant: It's it's the way I I hear that all the time.Participant: Whoa, medical condition, environmental health counselingParticipant: side effects of the personal alcoholic.Participant: Okay.Participant: Screen. Reader, don't don't need it. But okay.Moderator: Right.Participant: Information to collect what? What hasn't the government collected from me? But that's okay.Moderator: Right.Participant: Bother me at all.Participant: Yeah, I mean, this is nice. Start chat. That's pretty big, you know, important.Participant: We cannot help you. I get it.Participant: Please don't do any personal information.Participant: Good reminder.Participant: Is there a name for the chat? Bot.Moderator: It used to be virtual.Moderator: Was it virtualModerator: virtual agent, I think. Yeah, it was virtual agent and virtual agent, and like just a new Chatbot are kind of like merging.Moderator: Yeah, virtual. It used to be the Va virtual agent. And so now they're kind of just combining all the forces. And it's gonna be just the right now. The name is just Vh, app, yeah.Participant: I know I used to get the text from Annie.Moderator: No.Participant: No, I just you know every chat has their own name.Moderator: Feedback. Yeah, yeah, that's that's a. It's interesting. No one's to my knowledge, pointing that out yet. So yeah, it's definitely a good piece of feedback. I don't know that I don't know that there's a like a name yet that we have thought of so no, not that I know of.Participant: Well, don't use Justin. It's not a good one. He's like like Joe, like gi Joe.Participant: I I guess. Be gender neutral. I guess that could be gender neutral.Moderator: Yeah. JO, yeah. The female Joanne, you know.Participant: Yeah, yeah, yeah, orParticipant: government.Moderator: Was it gi, Jane?Participant: Yeah, yeah.Participant: Government issue. Okay? Alright. You want me to start.Moderator: Yeah, go ahead and click this the start chat, and as soon as this comes up, go ahead and read it, and whenever you're ready in the chat. Bot prompt window. I want you to ask. The 1st question is, how can I sign into Va.Participant: Okay, welcome via Chatbot spots help you general information on va.gov. To get started by entering questions or requests like.Participant: What's pack deck. What's my claim? Status.Moderator: Alright. I'm sorry you said.Moderator: How can I sign into Va.Participant: Oh, sign and support secure messaging.Participant: Okay, I. So I have a login.gov, I have an id me.Participant: I don't have aParticipant: Ds login anymore, because I'm a veteran or I'm I'm out of the service. I think I had one of those when I was in.Participant: I haven't mind healthy, but.Moderator: Ds is for like active service folks.Participant: I think. Yeah, I think if I remember right,Participant: my health event, I've got one of those, but that's pretty much discontinuing. I thought.Moderator: Yeah, it is.Participant: It's called.Moderator: Being phased out.Participant: Yeah, do id me.Participant: Do you want to create a new id in your account? Do you need help with an assistingParticipant: help with my account.Participant: See more optionsParticipant: help us secure because I have the verification app on my phone.Participant: And I know I got new. I had to reset my whole phone. And of course, you know, you've got to resign in.Participant: Oh, id me.Participant: Okay? Authenticator. Yeah.Participant: Oh, I guess it's security option.Participant: This link opens a new browser tab to take you to a website outside. va.gov.Participant: yep, multi factor, authentication. Yes, yep, then answered my question.Moderator: Okay, good, perfect. Let's stop right here for a minute.Moderator: So did the answers that the Chatbot gave you. Make sense.Participant: Yes,Participant: So okay, I said, yeah. I mean, I'm signing support which which login provider help with.Participant: Id me. Do you need to create a new id me account id dot me account.Participant: It doesn't say anything about authenticator.Moderator: Okay, so you.Participant: I I know that's authenticator, just because I know id me. But if I were to go back up hereParticipant: oh, whenever I clicked the options, anyway, is like.Participant: you know, ID me like, you know, authenticator.Participant: it's you know, or or it's aParticipant: I guess there's a couple of different ways. It can do authentication, multiParticipant: or 2 factor sign in whatever you want to call it.Moderator: Yeah. 2. Factor, authentication or multi.Participant: Maybe like identifying that cause. I don't. What? What were the other ones? Can I go back.Moderator: No, those choices go away so you can't.Participant: Okay, anyway, did. Let's justModerator: Well, you could, if you know what you could type it again, and you'll see what the problem would be. So.Participant: Month,Moderator: Oh, sorry it was. How can I sign into Va.Participant: Secure messaging sign and support.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Here you go!Participant: Yeah. So I guess these 2 areParticipant: kind of like 2 factor authentication.Participant: And I I know that just because I have both of them.Moderator: So let me let me ask you this. Would it be simpler, maybe, if, like all of this was condensed on a page, and it was just like the login page where you had all that stuff on the Va. And you have all these choices. What would there? Would it be easier just to have a button that says like, well, I'm asking to sign in to Va, specifically, this just takes me to the Va sign in.Moderator: or do you? Do you like the tree that it.Participant: Oh, yeah, the option. And if you could use I mean, they've they've got their own logo, too.Participant: I don't know if you're authorized to use their logo in that with it.Participant: That could be helpful.Participant: But yeah, if there's 1, you know that that you knowParticipant: help with service provider. Do you need help? What this is? Do you need help with.Moderator: Right.Participant: So I guess that does kind ofParticipant: you know. Baby steps walk you through it.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Again. I forget Ds login. I.Moderator: Right. I just have a feeling that's like a.Participant: Retired.Moderator: What I'm saying is for this decision. Would it make more sense for it to just be a login page where it's like, oh, here's here's little click! Here's the link that you need to log into the Va boom, and it just takes you to like opens the new page, and then it's got all these options on the next page, so you could figure it out there and not here in the chat. Bot!Participant: Yeah, yeah, that could be helpful.Participant: I mean, you don't want to give too many options on there as they're still trying toParticipant: trying to figure out what you need, how you need to log in says it's sign and support.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: Okay.Participant: What service provider? Okay, which login service provider. So I guess they're all login service providers.Participant: Do I need it? What's this.Moderator: So so did the answer. So we'll get back to the the question, did the answer make sense, or did it? Was it kind of confusing.Participant: No, it makes sense, because, like I said, these are all login service providers.Moderator: Right.Participant: I don't know what this is. Do I need an account.Moderator: Do I need aModerator: I think that's if you need a if you don't have a login, if you need a like, don't have a login and wanna like sign up for a new account.Participant: I guess the question would be, which 2 faParticipant: login service, because, like, I said, these are login service or 2. Fa. 2. Factor, authentication.Moderator: Sure.Participant: But I don't know if these have that.Moderator: Right. So click on it. See what that button is. They're doing an account. See? Just see what happens.Participant: Do I? Here's what it says in va.gov. When you create a free account to sign into va.gov, you can access and manage yourParticipant: okay free account to access the okay.Participant: benefit services and personal line for, okay, that's good.Moderator: Yeah. So if you can click that, click it, see what it does.Participant: Yeah.Participant: 2025. And the Login Gov Academia account to sign in.Participant: Wow. Okay, here you go.Participant: Takes you right to it. Like I said. The the little Logos are are helpful, just.Participant: I'm visual, you know. I I like.Moderator: Like doesn't usual kind of like bullet point thing that you got there. Okay.Participant: But and if I look at my phone, at the apps.Participant: The wording might not even be there.Participant: But the logo's there.Moderator: Hmm, okay. So you're talking about like iconography to kind of.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Show. Show the the options. Okay? Good.Participant: The id me not on my android the id me app button is just a picture of a person with a green shield and a check mark.Moderator: yeah.Participant: Which is like I said I. I recognize that as id me rightModerator: Cool.Moderator: So now, do you think? All the information was provided by the chat? Bot.Participant: Oh, yeah.Moderator: Okay.Participant: That was that was pretty good.Moderator: So would you say it was easy or difficult to find what you needed.Participant: Oh, it was easy.Moderator: Pretty easy. Okay.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: No, okay, perfect. Let's move on. Then. The next prompt. I would like you to type in the windowModerator: is I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: I'll need to help my dad to log in.Moderator: To get his benefits, information.Participant: That's probably one I would use.Moderator: Yeah, right.Participant: I'd like to find topics to try rephrasing your question. Veterans benefits va health application services. Va accredited representative.Participant: Probably this one benefits.Moderator: Go ahead and click. Yeah, once again, just feel free to click around through anything andModerator: do like you're doing kind of speak aloud as you move through the app.Participant: Whether you transitioned out of service recently or decades ago, or your family member, caregiver or veteran, we can help you find and apply for benefits you've earned and deserve. Go to the getting started with Va. Page. Learn more about benefits services. Let me see, let's get it started with Va.Participant: Weather.Participant: Okay, again. Just the the dead space on the sides. But.Moderator: Sure.Participant: If it was on a phone, I guess like that'd be different.Moderator: Right.Participant: But for the desktop.Moderator: Do you think it should fill the space?Participant: Is this like?Participant: Do you know, if this is like an AI shit?Moderator: That's just a search. That's just a search.Moderator: It's like a search internal search for Va, yeah.Participant: Transition serve veterans, family members, family members.Participant: We can help you connect benefits, better family members, benefits, caregivers.Participant: Okay, where?Participant: Oh, there's a lot of stuff to go through.Moderator: Again. Let's just kind of repeatModerator: right? Right? Right? Good. Let's stop here, then.Moderator: Seems like you kind of found all the treasure trove of stuff that you needed. Did the answer here on this one makes sense.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, would you want any more information provided.Participant: No, no, I think that I mean this takes you to you know what you what you need.Moderator: Right? Just kind of point you in the right direction, right?Participant: Right cause it could be. There's different.Participant: Wow! A lot of different.Moderator: Yeah, different situations.Participant: Situations. Yeah. So that's that's good.Participant: And you know the course, the big, how do I get help for a veteran who's in crisis.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Good to do.Moderator: So would you say it was then easy or pretty difficult to get what you needed.Participant: It was easy.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And did the information ever feel overwhelming at all, or hard to process.Participant: No, no, no, I mean, you know I askedParticipant: about veterans benefits for my dad, and it.Participant: It took me to va benefitsParticipant: for family and caregivers, so that no, it'sParticipant: I mean, there's a there's a lot there, but that's just how it is, because of all the different situations.Moderator: Right.Participant: So you just kind of go through it, and then it does. If you have more questions, it gives you all the other information here. Which? So you you've got a lot of different options.Moderator: So for this 1st version, the chat Bot. Can you think a way to improve these answers or these actions at all?Participant: Let me say no. Here, see what happens.Moderator: Okay, yeah, that's kind of your your baseline. Right?Participant: Greater experience.Participant: Well, okay, let's. I'll give that a 3.Moderator: Okay? Good.Moderator: So what I'm gonna do next, then I'm gonna send you another link. This, this is forModerator: one of the other up.Participant: I like how it opens in a different tab.Moderator: Oh, yeah.Participant: So you still have this.Moderator: Yup, you have a conversation. You have everything there, so you don't lose your spot in the in the chat. Bot!Participant: I've had some chat bots open up to like a new, a different, their own little window, their own like floating window. ButParticipant: either way, you know, having your knowing what tab it's on.Moderator: Right.Participant: Is helpful.Moderator: Okay? Good. So if you look in the zoom chat, I sent another link.Moderator: If you could click that link and it will bring up a page that, speaking of authentication, we're gonna ask you to enter the email address here. It's it's a login for cloudflare cloudflare page.Participant: My zoom, chat.Moderator: Oh, yeah. So if you.Participant: Hold on. Oh, there it is. Okay.Moderator: If you see back at that bottom, it's a floating yeah, it's kind of hard, because it like disappears. And until you get into the app, and like kind of move it around. You don't see that one.Participant: Oh, yeah, yeah, they'll get me started with teams, either.Moderator: Yeah, yeah. All the Va folks have to to use teams. Now, it's kind of.Participant: Yeah, we have it for work. Team chat.Participant: it's blank.Moderator: Oh, so if you that same menu that we were on with audio video participation right next to the share, you should see the chat where there's react, chat, react, and share. There's a heart for react. There's the little bubbles for chat. If you click on that in that menu for the zoom workplaceModerator: you should see. I entered aModerator: and I'll drop it in again.Moderator: The link that starts Chatbot dash, test, dash one.Participant: Am I still sharing.Moderator: Yeah, I still see your screen. Yep, so it's not.Participant: Here.Moderator: Oh, oh! So your menu might be floated at the top. Look up like! See where it says, wherever that little red light is that says.Participant: Oh, there it is! I see it!Moderator: Yeah, there, you go.Participant: Oh, come on!Moderator: Yeah, it kind of changes interfaces a little bit when it have you? Has you sharing the screen? So.Participant: There's that up there!Participant: Where is this thing? Where'd it go?Participant: Hey? Zoom!Moderator: Here, let's see.Participant: What?Moderator: Maybe stop sharing for a second, so you can go back to the regular view, and then you canModerator: find it in the chat. That might. Maybe that'll help.Participant: Oh.Participant: my! Gosh!Participant: That's weird. It's not.Moderator: Let me see if I can.Participant: Close my emails.Moderator: Okay. So I kicked you off.Participant: There we go.Participant: That's weird. Yeah.Participant: Alright. Now. Okay, I got. I'm sorry I got 2 of these.Moderator: Either one same one. I just clicked in it. I just entered it twice.Moderator: So yeah, either one click on that, and it will again take you to should take you to a web page with a prompt for you to enter your email address. And if you will use that same one that you use to sign up with the Peregian folks.Moderator: If you need, I can.Participant: Was.Moderator: It was the J. Bravo, 70 at Gmail.Participant: Okay, cause I got the reply to *redacted*.Moderator: Oh, okay, the one I have here on the list that we so we.Participant: You're both mine.Moderator: What's that?Participant: They're both mine.Moderator: Oh, so what the reason that if you could use that one is because we had. We have to whitelist this because it's behind. You know, a little bit of protection. So we had one of the Devs Whitelist, that email address. So I believe you have to. Yeah, you got it.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Yep, and that should send you a authentication code to that email.Participant: All right. Where's myParticipant: no?Participant: Oh.Participant: oh, they're cloud fare!Moderator: Oh, yeah, sorry should I should have said it's from Cloudflare. Yep.Participant: Oh!Moderator: Okay, perfect. This should give us our second and 3rd versions. If you look up there in the little window under the Va. It says, home component 2, component 3. So we are here on component 2, and basically everything outside of the chat. Bot is essentially the same as the 1st version, and you can see the interfacesModerator: changed slightly. We no longer have the big blue, and with the click, this start? So I guess. Just take your time. Read that, intro. And then we're gonna do just like we did on the last one and ask the same 2 questions. So the 1st one is, how can I sign into Va.Participant: Okay, Major Bot version, choose an environmental. This is not a mental health bot.Participant: Is there a mental health bot.Moderator: No, there's not. That's an interesting thought, though.Moderator: 1 1 that's kind of specifically tailored for mental health.Participant: It said, this is not one I'm like, where is the one I'm just.Moderator: That's a that's some good feedback. Interesting.Participant: I mean, like, this is not financial advice. This is.Moderator: Right.Participant: Okay, upset. You said, how.Moderator: Yep, so how can I sign in to Va.Participant: Do I have to use the Va. Or just Va.Moderator: However, you want to phrase it, something along those lines.Participant: Got it.Participant: Thanks for asking this question. Here is what I found, how to identify, how to verify your identity for your login account.Participant: What if I can't sign into v. 8.Participant: How to create a login.gov account?Participant: Or if none of these are correct, please try rephrasing your question another way.Moderator: So right here, I want to ask you, did this answer make sense.Participant: Yeah. Yeah. How to verify your identity?Moderator: Or just conversely, real quick. Do you think that there's any items missing from that bullet point that would help to answer your question.Participant: How do I sign in? Okay.Participant: what if I can't sign in the V 8 go because my password doesn't work?Participant: So I would want like.Participant: Well, if I'm not signed in here rightParticipant: there should. It probably should be like a login button there. So if you can't see that login button.Moderator: Right.Participant: Probably shouldn't be chatting, but.Moderator: Right.Participant: But this is good. So you want to verify your identity because it's asking you, I'm sure.Participant: verify your identity. For 2.Moderator: They think there should just maybe be a bullet point. One should be click here to sign in.Participant: Well, I mean.Moderator: If you're not signed in.Participant: There, I mean, there's directions on shampoo bottles, too, so I.Moderator: Right.Participant: Keep keeping it simple, breaking it down. Barney. Style.Moderator: Right.Participant: I do appreciate that, too. But, like I saidParticipant: that should you know hopefully, you see that.Moderator: RightParticipant: Yeah, I mean that that makes sense to me. All this. Maybe how to verify your identity with 2 fa.Moderator: God.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Or orParticipant: yeah, I'm I don't know if you if you click this, does it take you like to somewhere where it says, Hey, here's go! Get the app!Moderator: I don't know.Moderator: I don't know. Check it out, look, look, and see him!Participant: Let me.Participant: Come on, da da send a lot just dead space, but.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: This search could be smaller. That's just again. That's just me aesthetics here.Participant: Okay, so prepare your logo and your camera.Participant: His phone number smartphone. Okay? So here.Participant: I guess you don't need a smartphone because you could go to the login.gov on the webParticipant: as well.Moderator: Right? So use the basically the web app of it instead of a native.Participant: And the website of login.gov it probably. Oh, wait. Wait.Participant: Okay. So see here, here's those kind of.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Colors, that.Moderator: The little Logos you were talking about.Participant: Yeah, it's like their font and everything that's just. Oh, yeah, I've seen those before, you know.Moderator: Exactly. Okay.Participant: No, that this this makes sense.Moderator: So do you think all information was provided?Moderator: Or or maybe you would like to see that other bullet point that just says, click here toModerator: yeah. Getting back to that bot.Participant: Or login.gov account, or id me.Participant: Cause it looks like if you click that it takes you to. You get bothParticipant: option. Well, it just says Login. Gov, here.Moderator: Right.Participant: But it shows you this here, too.Participant: I mean, they're they're both pretty much this same.Moderator: Yeah, these are like directions that take you kind of steps.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: That's fine, I, you know, like quote or parentheses, 2 fa.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Oh, what if I can't sign in.Moderator: W. Would you say it was pretty easy or difficult to find what you needed.Participant: Oh, yeah, that's that's easy.Moderator: Super. Easy, was the information at all overwhelming or hard to process. No, no, pretty easy. Okay. So here you can see the feed. There's a feedback mechanism a little different than last time. If you'll recall the last version, said, did this answer your question? Yes or no? And here we have the same one, but with the thumbs up, thumbs down.Participant: What if I do know?Participant: That's unhelpful!Moderator: Yeah. Okay, so yeah, not helpful. Right? That yeah. Should say something a little bit different. Okay.Participant: Rephrase, or or if that, if this didn't.Participant: then you really need to break it down. Barney style, like picture menu, you know, at Mcdonald's like, Okay.Moderator: Okay? Oh, got it.Moderator: Okay, yeah. I see what you're saying.Participant: Baby steps, you know, if I mean.Moderator: Okay.Participant: That should answer your questions. If that doesn't.Moderator: Right.Moderator: Here's the so what would you say? The one big main thing to hit them in the face would be then, ifModerator: they asked that same question, or or if that doesn't answer the question, would you just like have 3 buttons then appear, or how how.Participant: Yeah, or is there?Participant: Does it take you to a person.Moderator: Wow, okay.Moderator: like, if you say no. If you say no, then it it connects you like, maybe, with a live, a live person who's chatting.Participant: Agent.Moderator: Okay.Participant: I i i jokeParticipant: per, you know. Personally, I'm like, well, I don't have a crisis, but I might now, and I Co click. You know you call the crisis line. But that's not right.Participant: Reason to call the crisis line.Moderator: Sure, sure.Participant: You know, it's like, you know, it's frustrating. If you cannot find your answer.Moderator: And.Participant: So put another 30 years on me.Participant: and I could definitely be frustrated. And, you know, give me a person to talk to.Moderator: Right.Participant: Either a person or like, I said.Participant: you know. Break it down, Barney. Style, like, you know.Participant: Just get bullet points likeParticipant: take you to the this. Let's see how to create a login.gov.Participant: Wait a minute. Well, I can't send it, because my password doesn't work.Participant: So did we go through?Participant: I guess? Yeah, create. This isn't creating one.Moderator: Yeah, last time. This interface, if you notice, is a little bit different before we had buttons and kind of a tree menu, if you will, where this just gives you the answers in a couple of different links.Participant: Yeah, I mean this, okay, create a log. Yeah, so does that.Moderator: Yeah, you're looking for. You want to see those Logos to go to log in. Because when you think login, that's what you think of you. Just wanna.Participant: Oh, okay, yeah. See, this is this takes you to do that. That's that's great.Moderator: And there you have the login.gov logo at the top. Yep.Participant: Create an account or sign inParticipant: asking these questions here I I'm assuming I already have a Va account.Participant: I'm having problems.Moderator: So if you thinkModerator: on the thumbs, up thumbs down right? If you click. No, then you would. It just be like, here's login. Here's the log, the green button. Here's the red button. Here's the it just gives you those items. Do you think that would simplify it more? Is that kind of what you mean by that.Moderator: Funny style.Participant: Well how to verify your identity. That takes you to this. That's, you know.Participant: Wait.Participant: Is that? No, never mind.Participant: Well, right there, go back to that window.Moderator: So click! Sign in at the top. Here.Participant: Oh!Moderator: So right there you see how it says, sign in or create an account like that.Participant: That's good. Yeah.Moderator: Like.Moderator: would. You're like, you say, breaking down Barney style. So it's just right here like this little top chunk sign in. And it has this and this or the Ds login. It just gives you those 3 buttons.Participant: Yeah, itParticipant: right and learn about creating. And that's good. You're like, Wait. I've never seen those I'm gonna learn about it.Participant: Got it?Participant: This does. Oh, I saw a video. Wait, wait, step by step, instructionsParticipant: that'd be nice to have on there.Participant: Come on, party style.Moderator: Like little like little like the how how to Youtube kind of videos.Participant: Yeah, like, like,Participant: yeah, I I mean, I thought I saw something like that, hey? Play a video, how to create right here.Moderator: Okay.Participant: There play a video there.Moderator: They are. Yeah.Participant: Lot of information here. I mean, that should beParticipant: I I totally get it, and that'sParticipant: prepare for fine sign in changes.Participant: They're not gonna like that I live in like.Moderator: I think that's where they're talking about of getting rid of. What is it? My health event.Participant: Yeah, it's like, okay, that's you've been talking about it for over a year.Moderator: Right? Okay.Participant: Oh, that's cool! It explains it all here, I guess.Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: So once again. WeModerator: that that's great feedback, by the way, of kind of if they didn't get a good here to just kind of really make it super easy to figure out. Okay, so let's go back to the prompt window. I think we answered all the questions for that 1st subset, and let's do the other one that we were talking about. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: and once again. Take a few minutes interact here, click around just like you were.Moderator: and feel free to speak aloud. Your thoughts and ideas.Participant: Okay, thank you for asking this question. Unfortunately, the Chappa doesn't have an answer.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: OwParticipant: my!Participant: Well, not my veteran nowParticipant: need to needs help logging in to va, dot goParticipant: okay.Moderator: All right. So let's do the same. Follow up questions here for this one.Moderator: Did these? Did this answer make sense? Or were you kind of frustrated that that 1st one didn'tModerator: get you in.Participant: It's a little weird thatParticipant: I need help. I I need to help my dad log in.Participant: I mean, they should recognize login and be like.Moderator: Right.Participant: You know.Moderator: Right.Participant: Help log in.Moderator: Right.Participant: It's it's probably it's probably the same stove.Moderator: Right like you're saying enough to context clues there know to be like, Oh, this person needs to go to a login page. Got it.Participant: Semantic search.Moderator: Right.Participant: Oh!Moderator: So again you would want those you would. You wouldn't like you said you would want that information provided. So how how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: Well, I just had to rephrase it.Moderator: Right.Participant: And we it's kind ofParticipant: off putting that the chat pot doesn't have an answer at all. Which kind ofParticipant: I mean throw, you know the I justParticipant: would think that it would throw something up there, or you know. Then maybe ask you some questions.Moderator: I got you like some clarifying questions.Moderator: Yeah, yeah.Participant: Like, let's see login help.Participant: Okay, see that.Participant: That's weird. Login help brought that.Moderator: Yeah. Those those 2 key words.Participant: So it's like.Moderator: But you've used it in this whole sentence, and it couldn't figure it out. Got it soModerator: so that's that's definitely a way to improve it, like you're saying is, use that that logic or that intent.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: And use those 2 words to figure out, oh, hey!Participant: Yeah, I'm.Moderator: This person is, you know.Participant: Help!Moderator: That even help gives you more. Okay, good.Moderator: So let's go ahead, then, and move over to component 3 at the top menu. There you should seeModerator: that one. Take a quick second here to read through the warning at the top. ThereModerator: everything else is the exact same.Participant: Not a mental health bot for emergencies called 9 and 8Participant: go to the er what's this?Moderator: Yeah. The little info button.Participant: Legal Jumbo.Moderator: Yep.Participant: We're oh, oh.Moderator: Oh.Moderator: no, no, that one did not navigate. You have to hit the back arrow, this that that info did not open in. Yeah.Participant: Oh, what happened here?Moderator: Oh, it compressed! There, you.Participant: Oh, okay. Oh, wait!Participant: Go back to point of 3.Moderator: Yep, you're in component 3.Participant: The answer is AI generated, it may containParticipant: inaccuracies. Please verify any information, any important information.Moderator: All right, let's do the same thing we did before. How can I sign into Va.Participant: Oh, boy!Participant: Sign via dot go to user login admin account. You know the general steps?Participant: Well, there's no hot links.Moderator: Right.Participant: Go to va.gov and select. Sign an option.Participant: Scroll up and look at that.Moderator: Right, yeah.Participant: I I mean like I said. HeyParticipant: it it obviously all this is geared towards younger veterans. Like. My dad's a Vietnam veteran, you know, upper seventies.Participant: He he would appreciate, you know, simplisticParticipant: answers, or like I said, click to go here.Moderator: Right.Participant: All be cookable.Moderator: Right? Yeah. You don't have to read about everything just to click a button. You should just click a button.Participant: Keeps going.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Oh, wait! Wait! Here's your well, that's kind of redundant.Moderator: Right. It's kind of there. You're a little canned answer, if you will.Participant: The answer should fit in one screen.Moderator: Sure you think it's too.Participant: You shouldn't have to scroll down.Moderator: Yup, I agree.Participant: Or have the chat bot longer. I don't knowParticipant: or wider, but whatever like, I said.Participant: I think everyone has a widescreen these days.Moderator: And.Participant: SoModerator: So let let me ask you. Let me ask you here. Do you think this answer made sense.Participant: Oh, either a login.gov account.Participant: I think I can hear the general steps go to vm plus sign in option.Participant: Choose to sign in with your login likeParticipant: good way to go and select the sign in option.Participant: Isn't it?Moderator: It's basically telling you to go to thisModerator: page and click the button. The blue button. Yeah.Participant: Well, it says the sign in option, so should be sign in button.Moderator: Right? Yeah, true.Participant: And there's no other option.Moderator: Right.Participant: There's not that to click the sign in button sign in blue button, or ifParticipant: people are colorblind, you might have to.Participant: you know, make it like bold font.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Cause. That's that's kind of I don't. I don't know if you'd capitalize I and N. ButParticipant: I don't know. It just feels like sign, in log, in.Moderator: You, so you think it should be bigger on the main page.Participant: I mean it, I mean for me that's pretty big, maybeParticipant: less around it, so that you can, you know, single out. I mean the 1st thing that jumps out is this red bar up here? The price? So that's good. I mean, obviously, I see that, too.Moderator: That's that's that's okay with me. I just.Participant: Would like this to say like.Participant: or go to va.gov and select. So if you like, you click this, maybe it opens.Moderator: Sure.Participant: This page I'm like this is blinking like.Moderator: See you.Participant: I thought Barney style. Here, look, you know, justParticipant: blink, blink, blink like click me.Moderator: Right.Participant: Okay, choose a sign in. And then, like I said, orParticipant: have a button here, you could likeParticipant: or or have an option here, walk me through it. Click.Moderator: Right.Participant: Boom. It's gonna walk you. It's gonna then it's gonna take you, you know, Barney style.Moderator: Well, you're you're talking about like the visuals. Maybe you put that picture right here if you go to Va and select the sign in option, and then for the sign in option, you put that little blue button so it know they know us what to look for.Participant: Like like, show me in a hot link, and you click, show me sure.Participant: And it it literally just shows you.Participant: Oh.Moderator: It's like, okay.Participant: You knowModerator: So, if.Participant: Yeah. And maybe this is like floating. So you could still see the next step.Moderator: Right.Participant: While you're here. Okay, I'm here now, what? Well, I gotta go back to this.Moderator: Right.Participant: Now. Which Tab was I in? You know it's like.Participant: you know, I could see that being a little.Moderator: Sure. So with with this version, how easy or difficult was it to find the information.Participant: Not not as not as easy. Like, I said. There's.Moderator: We've got to scroll.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: This is almost the answer is almost.Moderator: Too long, so you would definitely say it felt overwhelming or a little harder to process.Participant: Yeah, that's that's bigger than a chat.Moderator: Okay, let's move on. Let's do the second question that weModerator: had. It's I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: Let's see how this version of the chat Bot answers this question.Participant: Struggling.Participant: He's struggling.Moderator: It's the AI technology.Participant: Bounce around the satellites.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Okay?Participant: Follow up question.Participant: He will need to sign in with a verified accountParticipant: or premium Ds login account. If he does not already have an account. He will need to create one and verify his name. If you need detailed steps on how to sign in or create an account, please let me know.Participant: Yes, I need detail steps.Participant: Well, there's no really follow up question technically.Moderator: Yeah, I was. Gonna say, I don't see a question mark.Participant: Yeah, it's like, that's the answer. And then they say, Yes, I need detailed steps.Participant: Oh, boy!Participant: That was quick!Participant: Could you please specify which detailed steps you need help with on va.gov.Moderator: It, it seems, lost itsParticipant: Yes.Moderator: Of of yeah.Participant: Granted. That's a very terrible prompt here, but if someone's notParticipant: really used to Chatbots or AI prompts.Participant: I mean they they might not go into the detail right.Moderator: No, I see what you're saying. The context, that's what.Moderator: And I was looking for. It lost its context.Participant: If you need to help steps on how to sign in. Okay, I needParticipant: detailed steps on how to sign in.Participant: I should keep moving it up to work.Moderator: Oh, yeah, that is good.Participant: I say, this was right here. It's going past holy cow.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Nope, it's a little just sign in via the community. Just don't.Participant: Yeah, just so.Moderator: Little bit different than the 1st one. When you.Participant: Yeah, is it?Moderator: This is a little bit different cause that didn't mention anything about multi-factor. Oh, no, it did. There it is. It's 4. It's just a different.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: It is slightly different, though 1, 2, 3, 4.Participant: Could be, I guess an option.Moderator: Yeah, that.Participant: login.gov, or, right, yeah.Moderator: There's the that's interesting. How it's different. Huh?Participant: I mean again. No, no, hyperlink, I mean, this is bolded, which is good.Moderator: Bye.Participant: ButModerator: No quick like you said hot links to get you there right away.Participant: Yeah, that.Moderator: Sure.Participant: This could be shorter.Moderator: Right.Participant: Like I said.Moderator: If you scroll up, if you scroll up, they did it in like 2 or 3 lines.Participant: How'd your day.Moderator: Yeah, okay, both points. Okay, keep going. Keep going.Moderator: They did it in 4 lines. There, you scroll down the the bullet point about multi-factor authentication is like whatModerator: 6 now.Participant: That's fair.Moderator: I think it's funny. Okay, so let's let's let's get to these. Follow up questions. Did this answer make sense to you?Moderator: With the qualifying questions. If you remember.Participant: It did. Yes, it did. It did breakModerator: That's funny. What did it say?Participant: Oh.Participant: you don't know Barney style. Come on, come on, Va, you're not prior service, are youParticipant: not, you guys? But the Va. You know.Moderator: Right, right.Participant: It should probably not know all the V. All the.Moderator: Terms. In the window.Participant: Yeah, I'd probably that'd probably not be a good thing. But anyway, yeah, that I mean that the second time it really here the detailed steps. Okay, so that's good. It's really breaking it down.Participant: you know.Participant: Okay.Moderator: It made sense. But once again it sounds like you would want more information provided with those those hot links right?Participant: Yeah. Let me see. Explain. Step 3 from yeah.Participant: Show me my step.Participant: Or was it was that option? 3. What was that?Participant: Worse?Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Not that smart?Moderator: All right. So let's see. Did the info? Well, certainly back up one more before that. How easy or difficult was it to find what you needed?Participant: Oh, it was! It was easy.Moderator: Pretty easy. Okay? And did the information ever feel at all overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Well, the the initial like, I said. It's more than one chat window, so that's kind of a turn off.Moderator: Right. You know.Participant: again. Maybe if this was wider it might fit in there when one window. But this, this really here the general steps. Boom! Boom, boom, keeping it simple.Participant: That's great. So yeah, that.Participant: And then you know.Participant: maybe maybe if you click, you know, did that answer your question if you click. No.Participant: maybe it goes straight into the detailed.Moderator: You know it. It.Participant: Does the detailed automatically.Moderator: Right.Participant: Like.Participant: I mean, do you want to say, Okay, here's the Barney breakdown. Now, if I've been insulted or not, they shouldn't be because they're veterans, butParticipant: you know. So here's the detailed breakdown. Just like said bullet points and picture, you know. Let'sModerator: Okay.Participant: But yeah, that that does answer the question. It does. It does go in detail.Moderator: Okay, and yeah.Participant: Show me would be pretty cool.Moderator: Right the hover over kind of like how we had. If you look in the dropdown hereModerator: right at the top in the blue, when you click that information, icon. So something like that, or like a hover over like if you did, if you did, the hover over it would show you like the button? Or is that like you were talking about before.Participant: Ha!Participant: It can dial it for you.Moderator: Yeah, you could dial. Yeah, let's not. But okay, I'm sorry. Say again.Moderator: oh, no, that that like you're talking about the little hover over like.Participant: Oh, yeah.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Oh, oh, that'd be! That'd be great. Yeah. Just hover over it, and like the little screen, you know, the button would pop up, or somethingParticipant: you know, like.Moderator: More assistive. So some more assistive technology. Okay.Participant: Yeah, or it's even on the same page. It could like, circle this.Moderator: I like it right.Participant: Or like, you know, follow your mouse, orParticipant: I will say auto click, but maybe, like auto auto snap, whatever they call it.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Yeah, it AI should should take the whole conversation into account for this.Moderator: Yeah, for the chat. Definitely, too.Participant: Like step 3.Moderator: Right? Well, and the whole queer, the clarifying question that didn't yeah, didn't answer the question. And that didn't follow context for sure.Moderator: Okay, cool.Participant: We're just, you know, splitting hairs. But yeah.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: No, alright that that end the task portion. What I've got is just a quick few. Follow up questions, and then we'll get you out of here should take about 5Êmin. So what? How did you feel while using the chat bot! Were there at all? Any points where you fell stuck, annoyedModerator: or dissatisfied.Participant: On this one or all in general.Moderator: All 3, all 3 of them. This is for all 3. Yeah.Participant: No, I IParticipant: I mean they they they helped. They had the, you know, the hot links, clickable links, which are pretty universal.Moderator: There was the one on the last version that just I remember it didn't know. So how did it feel when you, when you got to that point where it gave you, hey? I don't know what.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: What did you do? If, when you cancel that.Participant: That's pretty lame, it that's that's not too chat, body.Moderator: Bad bad user, experience, right.Participant: Yeah.Participant: Like I said AI. CanParticipant: you know, or or you know it'll tell you like, Hey, put more detail into your into your question, or I don't knowParticipant: right? but yeah it.Participant: if you're clicking on this, and you're not logged in, it should probably know that.Moderator: More. Help. Yeah.Participant: You know, and if you're logged in like, maybe the Chatbot would knowParticipant: like I said, if it's a floating one, maybe it it floats them like every every page.Participant: And that's kind of crazy. But like, if I was in the claims.Moderator: Oh, so it would give context to the page and say.Participant: Yeah, it would. Right?Moderator: Hey, hey, Justin, what can I help you with on your claims?Participant: You're right right, because I've seen some other likeParticipant: shopping, whatever. I'll just go. Oh, I see, you're looking at theParticipant: right 5, 5, 3,000Participant: telescope, you know. What are your questions about it like? Oh, hey! Cool like it, like more inviting. Not just this open ended.Moderator: Like.Participant: Maybe more specific like, are you doing okay on your claims? And sure, you know, like.Participant: and you can maybe click like like, go away. I'm good, orParticipant: you know, yes, keep helping me, or you know.Participant: because sometimes, like, Oh, AI, my mom's like AI. I don't want anyone on my phone. Well, it's too late.Participant: Yeah, it's everywhere, you know. So maybe that's like an option. ButModerator: So.Participant: It answers. I mean it. It gets to the point.Moderator: This is the point. Okay.Moderator: let's see, were there ever times when the chat bots responses ever felt overwhelming or difficult to understand?Participant: Yeah. Just the the 2 page answer.Participant: Yep. No.Participant: Detailed.Moderator: Yep.Moderator: let's see, did you ever have to remember information from earlier in the conversation to complete the task.Participant: No dude.Moderator: No. Did you notice any major differences between the 3 different chat bots.Participant: Well, but there's obviously this little bar here.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Like, I want to talk to the mental health. Bot, right?Moderator: Yeah, yeah.Participant: Person. Maybe it is the vet, the veteran crisis line.Participant: so I think you can chat with them now, too. Not just call them.Moderator: Yes, I believe you're right.Moderator: ChatParticipant: Anyway. That's different. This answer is AI generated. Well, it's a chat. Bot, so I that's kind of a given. But.Moderator: Right.Participant: Okay.Moderator: You noticed that this one was the call out about the AI, where the other 2 did not sure.Participant: Yeah, yeah, I mean, we're currently pre, alpha.Participant: okay, yeah, I get it.Participant: I mean, this is nice. It gives you all these these numbers, but I'd say, like theParticipant: 1st or second one.Moderator: Remember the 1st one had the buttons. Yeah? And.Participant: Yeah, well, and the stars were like, Oh, thanks for your feedback.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Would you like another question? You know.Moderator: Yeah, the feedbacks were a little different. We had thumbs up versus thumbs down. And versus this version it was yes or no, and then the 5 star which one of those did you prefer? The yes, or the thumbs up or thumbs down, or theModerator: Yes and No with the 5 star?Moderator: Or does it make a difference.Participant: I mean, I mean, for you guys you either want yes or no right for for doing logic.Moderator: No, not necessarily. If you have a better option, by all means.Participant: Oh, really, really the the 5 out! The 5 stars would help you better than 2Participant: like. Does that help the chat? Bot!Moderator: Well, that's just it. What this is is, I mean, it's a different type of feedback. Right? Thumbs up versus thumbs. Down isModerator: binary where.Participant: Yeah, that's true.Moderator: In a like in a likert scale, you can say, Oh, you did really? Well.Participant: You can.Moderator: Because in this you can do things like when you get get this like creating like language models and those types of things.Moderator: you can have the answers kind of.Moderator: and be what they're what you have a confidence level. Right? So with these stars, they give a confidence level of like 0 versus like a hundred. So that helps it kind of build. Build its.Participant: Come to it.Moderator: Level to see if it was a hundred percent. What you wanted, or because what happens is then you can build like if he doesn't know what answer it'll say, Hey, I I didn't, and it's not built in because you could see in in version 2 where it said completely like. No, we don't know what it is, but.Participant: Right.Moderator: If we turned on the switch that said, Hey, use your contacts clues to say, you know you you had this keyword and this keyword. So I think you're trying to log in.Moderator: So that's kind of where this.Participant: Okay.Moderator: And that's the difference between thumbs up, thumbs down versus the the star rating kind of.Participant: I'm just, I think about like, like.Participant: you're, you know, how are you feeling today? And they're likeParticipant: when they asked us these like psychological questions. It's like all the days, none of the days, you know, and there's like a neutral. So I guess 3 would be like neutral or average.Moderator: Right.Participant: So I IParticipant: yeah, I guess I thinking it that way. But you know they're like, Oh, how many stars are you today? Well, I'm not 3 stars, but.Moderator: Right, yeah.Participant: I just again with the Va. That they they never ask how many stars we're feeling. But.Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: Yeah, that's that's how that breakdown works. I think so.Participant: Yeah. Okay. Okay.Moderator: Okay. So next question is, did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning? And did it affect how you use the Chatbot.Participant: I did notice it.Participant: I mean it did not affect cause.Participant: It's the they're all the same. It's the legal stuff.Moderator: Great.Participant: You can't go anywhere without seeing if you have an emergency call.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: If you have an emergency, good for you, for call, for getting a line. It's like.Participant: if you're seeing this, it's not an emergency. I mean, it's like I'm not going to a chat bot if it's an emergency.Moderator: Absolutely.Participant: No offense, Chatbots, but.Moderator: So were you at all concerned about sharing privacy or personal information?Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, let's see.Moderator: So versus other Chatbot experiences was this what you were expecting? And in what ways did it meet or differ? Your expectations.Participant: it.Participant: I can't recall having answers this long.Participant: you know. I mean that even for the 1stParticipant: 1 1st time I asked this just kind of a long like we.Moderator: Sure.Participant: I mean I you know. I I've seen other onesParticipant: with like, step by step, likeParticipant: click, I click right here. It takes me there.Moderator: Gotcha, and it does down here. But right you think way there, too. Yep.Participant: Yeah, I don't have time to scroll. I just want to click, click, click.Moderator: Okay.Participant: you know. You see, there's like aParticipant: they have a cute little name, and like a little like a robot or something, or.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Oh, yeah.Participant: I don't be a. It's all. PC, so I don't know what you could really put there. ButParticipant: I don't know. Robot a helmet or something I don't know.Moderator: Little helmet. Yeah.Participant: But yeah,Moderator: About the same as other chat bots. Better, worse.Participant: It's about the same. I like the timestamps on there. Maybe if I'm on a different tab.Participant: and they answer me, this tab would like blink.Moderator: Oh, yeah. Notification.Participant: Yeah, like I'm if I'm over here.
