Participant 5 Ð July 23, 2025 Ð 1 PM ESTModerator: Go ahead. AndModerator: once again, now that we are recording, confirm that you have given consent for us to record this session.Participant: Yes, it's fine to record.Moderator: Perfect.Moderator: I'm gonna let you know that today we're going to talk about our Va Chatbot. And so we're going to show you 3 different prototypes that we're working on. Please keep in mind that these are just proof of concepts, and we will specifically be working on login or sign in tasks, onlyModerator: so to keep in mind, these bots may not be optimized, they might not be the fastest, they might not have all the answers, and so just keep that in mind as we're going through these questions.Participant: Okay.Moderator: All right.Moderator: So got a couple of pre-testing questions to ask you.Moderator: Are you using any assistive technology like a screen? Reader, for this task?Participant: No.Moderator: Okay. And can you tell me what device the operating system and browser you're using? Like, if it's a Mac.Participant: I am on my laptop.Moderator: Is it a windows?Moderator: Yes, it's HP, okay.Moderator: And are you using Google chrome or safari.Participant: This is edge. I believe.Moderator: Microsoft Edge. Okay, perfect.Moderator: Now let me ask, how familiar are you with Chatbots?Participant: A little. I've used them here and there with different, you know, asking questions to companies and stuff, butParticipant: not really a whole lot.Moderator: Alright! Do you know specifically which ones that you've used, or just.Participant: I don't have a clue. I'm sorry. No.Moderator: No, not a problem at all. That's that's okay. We want users that have some experience and some that don't have any at all. So it fits perfectly. So if you have, I'm just trying to gauge. How many times would you say in the last month that you've used the chat bot, and the last 6 months.Participant: Probably 4 or 5 times in the last month, and in the last 6 months, probably 1520.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: All right.Moderator: For this next part. I'm gonna put a link in the chat here, andModerator: if you can, I would like you to click on this linkModerator: and then share your screen so that we can go over.Moderator: you know, basically, and see what what you see as you're going through these tasks.Moderator: So in our chat, I've dropped the linkModerator: for this 1st proof of concept.Participant: I've got it open, do you?Participant: Am I sharing my screen? Already or no.Moderator: I don't see it yet. What you'll have to do is switch back to the zoom.Moderator: and then at the bottom there's a button that says Share, and mine has a green arrow on itModerator: to the bottom. MenuModerator: perfect! I can see your screen now.Participant: Now I can't see the thing.Moderator: Okay, let's see, can you? Is there a different? Do you have it open in a different window?Participant: Got it now.Moderator: Okay, cool.Moderator: perfect, all right.Moderator: SoModerator: what I'd like you to do is take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the layout and the look and feel of this version of the Chatbot once it gets loaded here.Participant: Okay.Moderator: And as you're doing so, feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you explore the page.Participant: Okay.Participant: I like that. It tells you who to contactParticipant: If you can't get the answers from the chat, bot, chat, bot.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Good.Participant: I definitely like that. It tells you exactly what it can't do.Moderator: Hmm, yeah.Participant: Gotta give you the limitations.Participant: Yes, sometimes you go into them and you're asking questions about stuff. And they're like.Participant: I can't find that answer. Okay.Moderator: Yeah, hopefully, that'll save you some time. So you don't.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Crazy, trying to trying to put in those questions.Participant: Oh, I like it that it tells you what the data collection is too.Moderator: Hmm, good. Okay.Participant: And that it protects your personal information. That's good.Moderator: Yes.Participant: I think it looks pretty good.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Overall. I'm kinda I kinda dig it.Moderator: Alright. So go ahead and read that blue box, and whenever you're ready, click, start, chatModerator: alright. There we have our welcome message.Moderator: Now, whenever you're ready, I'd like you to type in. How can I sign into Va?Moderator: Then once again, take a few minutes to interact with the chat bot, feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you kind of explore. Here.Participant: Hmm!Participant: Well, I didn't get to click on the other 2 because I clicked. Did this answer your question? I said yes, and it didn't take me back to the other thing.Moderator: Oh, go ahead, feel free to go ahead and interact with the bot more and ask more questions. If you'd like, you can rephrase the same question, or a different one, to help you with the taskModerator: right.Participant: Dang it now! I forgot what it's called.Moderator: No problem.Moderator: Yeah. If you need to scroll back up, go right ahead.Moderator: all right.Moderator: Looks like you'reModerator: still not quite getting the answer to your question? Or did you did get your answer to your question? Okay, good.Participant: Not really.Moderator: Not really. Okay. Let's let's go ahead and stop here. Then did this answer make sense to you? Sounds like, sounds like, not really. Yeah.Participant: I mean.Participant: cause I know I've gotten. I don't even use my healthy vet login anymore. I use the Id. Me, I think, butParticipant: like it doesn't.Participant: You can't do it when you're logging in normally, but it gives you the option to do it on here, or it asks you, or whatever. SoParticipant: I was wondering if you could actually use that tab, or that, you know login information.Moderator: Sure, all right.Moderator: And would you want more information provided.Participant: Hmm, not really.Moderator: No, okay.Moderator: Was it easier?Participant: Maybe different per maybe different information like.Moderator: There you go!Participant: Use. You have to create a new login. You know what I mean.Moderator: Right? Yeah.Moderator: Let's see howModerator: how easy or difficult was it to find what you need? Did I ask you that? Yeah.Participant: It was pretty easy until I got to the healthy vet part.Moderator: Gotcha.Moderator: Okay? Did any of the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Not at all.Moderator: Okay, good.Moderator: Next. What I'd like you to do is go back to the prompt window and type.Moderator: I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits informationModerator: all right, and once againModerator: take a few minutes to interact with the responses that the Chatbot gives you, and feel free to speak aloud your thoughts and actions as you explore.Participant: Okay.Participant: I think it's pretty awesome that tells you why you should do your thing, why you should do these different things.Participant: and how they can help you and stuff. But you have to go to a different link, which is fine.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: I I like it, I.Moderator: Okay, cool. Let's go ahead. And then I'm gonna ask you the same round of questions here. Did the answer make sense to you?Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, would you want any more information provided.Participant: Not really, as long as the link that it takes you to is the link that it needs to go to. I didn't check that.Moderator: Not okay.Moderator: How easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It's easy.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Can you think of a way to improve this interaction or this answer?Participant: I can't think of anything off the top of my head right now.Moderator: Sure, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: Not at all.Moderator: All right, perfect.Moderator: What I'm gonna do then is we're gonna move on to our second version here. AndModerator: once again I'm going to go ahead and drop the link in the chat.Participant: Let me close out of this one.Moderator: Yeah, you can.Moderator: And once you find thatModerator: link in the chat, go ahead and click on it, and it will bring up a window for youModerator: to enter your email address. And if you would please enter the email address that we used for this session looks like a Yahoo. One.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Yeah.Moderator: And then you're gonna get a.Moderator: It's a two-step authentication. Here. You're going to get a code.Participant: To that email address. And if you could enter that code.Moderator: We should be goldenModerator: all right. Here we are once again. Same basic surrounding information.Participant: So once again go ahead and take a look at the blue box, read the.Moderator: Read the blue box and scroll down and click in the text field whenever you're ready.Participant: All right.Moderator: And we're going to ask the same question. So the 1st one is, how can I sign into VaModerator: and again take a few minutes to interact with the responses, feel free to check, to click on the links and speak aloud your thoughts and ideas as you explore.Participant: Okay.Participant: I feel like this question, hey? Wait a minute. Where'd my other thing? Go.Moderator: That's the 1st one.Participant: Yeah, yeah, I think it's just just to the right of that.Moderator: I think it says Va Chatbot Demos on the tab.Participant: There we go.Participant: This one isParticipant: A little bit more confusing, I think.Moderator: Sure.Participant: The other one. It flat out, told you which you know options you could do. And this one it says, What if you can't do it because your password doesn't work and.Moderator: Right.Participant: You have to verify and well how to create an account. That's not what I want. I want to know how to log into it, for, like the 1st time.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: yeah. And this one's verifying your identity. SoModerator: all right. So then, what I'm going to do is move on to the question portion? Now does this answer make sense.Participant: It makes sense, but it's not exactly what I was looking for.Moderator: Right.Participant: And you kind of have toParticipant: dig into these a little bit more to findParticipant: what you actually are looking for.Moderator: Gotcha.Moderator: I don't know if that made senseModerator: absolutely. Yeah. Was. Do you think all information was provided?Moderator: Not all of it. No, because it just talks about login and doesn't talk about anything else.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Any other options.Moderator: Right. How easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It would be pretty difficult through this way. I think.Moderator: Right alright, and finally, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: It could have been. It was a little bit overwhelming when I 1st you know.Participant: Why is my password not working, and gives me this whole long thing and all these things to look at. But it wasn't. It was just more information that I was looking for.Participant: Got it.Moderator: Next, we're going to ask the other question. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information.Participant: That's not helpful at all.Moderator: Nope, yeah, it looks like it gave you the same set of links.Participant: No, this one's a little bit different. It's okay.Participant: The 1st one was like all about login id login stuff, not.Moderator: Right.Participant: You know, id me or anything. It doesn't.Participant: It doesn't say how they can help.Moderator: Right.Participant: Or where I should look for the help. It's trying to get me to log in again.Moderator: Perfect. So let's go ahead and ask the follow up questions here.Moderator: Does this answer make sense.Participant: Nope.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And would you want more information provided.Participant: I want different information provided.Moderator: Absolutely okay.Moderator: And how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It was challenging because it didn't answer my question.Moderator: Yeah, perfect. And did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: When I 1st looked at it, I said, I'm sorry what I'm not looking to log in. I need to know where to go.Moderator: Exactly.Moderator: I mean, kinda yeah, it was a little bit right? Okay?Moderator: All right, then, let's go ahead. And if you scroll all the way up to the top of the page.Moderator: You'll see in that little gray header bar. It says, component 3. Can you click on component 3.Participant: Surely.Participant: Okay.Moderator: All right, and same thing here.Moderator: I would like you to.Moderator: you know. Check out the the layout, and whenever you're ready we're going to ask the same questions. How can I sign in to Va.Moderator: Right.Participant: I like this one the best at all 3 of them, for this login question.Moderator: Okay.Participant: It tells you exactly what you have to do. It's a lot of information, but it tells you exactly what.Participant: step by step, how to do it.Moderator: Sure.Participant: Holy crap! That's a lot.Moderator: That is a lot. Okay, soModerator: let's do the follow up questions here. Does this answer make sense to you?Participant: It does make sense.Moderator: Okay, was all the information provided.Participant: Definitely.Moderator: And how easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: I mean, it was very easy to find it.Participant: There's just a lot of information at one time.Moderator: Got it. And that's the next question. Is the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: A little bit overwhelming.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: and one more time. Let's go ahead to the prompt window and ask again. I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits, information.Participant: Sorry. My my house is a zoo right now.Participant: No worries.Moderator: Can't tell. I don't. I don't hear anything.Participant: You're lucky.Moderator: Oh!Participant: Sorry no worries.Moderator: What you gotta do.Participant: He can be quite obnoxious.Participant: Whoa!Participant: Holy crap!Moderator: Yeah, there's.Participant: Lot of information there.Participant: Yes, yes, there is.Moderator: Okay, so.Participant: So let's.Moderator: Of those follow up questions.Moderator: Okay, that's does. This answer makes sense.Participant: HmmParticipant: kind ofModerator: Why do you say kind.Participant: I don't really like the beginning sentence. It's like they're working on a solution to allow court appointed guardians and stuff. I think that's a little. We don't really need that to know that right then and there, you know.Moderator: Got it.Participant: and it keeps going. And then for now your dad, I mean, it's more personalized like that. And it says your dad.Moderator: Okay. So it does make sense. And it doesn't. You said so.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Would you want any more information provided.Participant: No less. I think.Moderator: Okay, did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: A little bit overwhelming. Yes.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Not hard to process, though.Moderator: Sure.Moderator: Can you think of any way to improve this interaction, or answer.Participant: Take out some of the excess like, you know the beginning couple of set sentences.Participant: So I don't see that as being really necessary.Moderator: Right. So trim, trim down the words a little bit is what you're saying.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And finally, did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: A little bit, I would say yes.Moderator: Little overwhelming. Yeah.Participant: A little bit. Yeah.Moderator: Can you think of a way to improve this interaction or answer at all?Moderator: Besides the edit editorialization editing it down a little bit.Participant: Maybe check out some of the links towards the bottom where it gives you likeParticipant: so many options. Maybe narrow it down a little bit.Moderator: To.Participant: You know how to manage your profileParticipant: stuff like that? I don't. I don't thinkParticipant: I feel like the multi factor. Identification stuff is a lot to put in there. And thenParticipant: if you haven't switched, I mean, I guess it's important. If you haven't switched your log to to the login or Idp.Moderator: Got. It was the information, hard or easy to find.Participant: It was pretty easy.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Took a little work, but it, you know it was pretty easy.Moderator: Got it.Moderator: Now I'm going to go ahead and ask you some post-task interview questions. We're done with your main part of it. So we're just going to ask some questions about about the bots. 1st of all, did you notice any difference as far as the processing time between the oneModerator: between the.Participant: I think the 3rd one took longer, but the answers were a lot longer also.Moderator: Okay, so what is it worth the extra time to.Moderator: Get the proper answer.Participant: Yeah, if it was a proper answer, then yeah, it would be worth it. I think.Moderator: Okay, sounds good.Moderator: And how did you feel while using the Chatbot? Were there any points where you felt stuck annoyed, or maybe especially satisfied?Participant: No, I wasn't annoyed, or anything. I thought the 1st one was the easiest one to use.Participant: But the second one I liked how it gave you just a little bit more.Participant: Got it? Okay, huh?Moderator: At any point. Did you feel confused or frustrated, or overwhelmed by some of the responses.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay did the Chatbot ever give too much information at once? Or was it just right.Participant: Yes, yes, it was a little bit too much.Moderator: Okay, are there parts where you had to remember information from earlier in the conversation to complete the task.Participant: Oh, I think it was this one where it, you know, gave youParticipant: all the information on how to log in like the steps. Well, if you don't remember the steps, then you go to thatParticipant: link that it gave you.Participant: Then you're like, wait! What did I have to do next?Moderator: All right.Moderator: So did you notice the disclaimers at the beginningModerator: about personal information, and it did it affect how you use the chat? Bot.Participant: No, but I wouldn't put personal information in a Chatbot, anyway.Moderator: Right.Moderator: Were you concerned about sharing any privacy or personal information in the chat? Bot.Participant: No.Moderator: Did you notice any major differences between the 3 different chat bots.Participant: The amount of information the 3rd one gave was just.Participant: It was a lot.Moderator: Got it okay, compared to other chat bots that you used?Moderator: Was it? Did it meet your expectations? And if if not, how was it different from other chat bots?Moderator: I definitely think it met, and a little bit exceeded my expectations. I would never expect it to give me, step by step, directions on how to Do.Participant: This, that, or the other thing.Moderator: Right.Participant: It just seemed a lot more user friendly for me.Moderator: Got it. So do you feel strongly about one version over another one? And if so, why.Participant: My did not like the 3rd one.Moderator: Oh, you didn't like the 3rd one. Okay.Participant: Not really. I I mean, it was a lot of information, but it was a lot of information, sometimes a little bit too much.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Even though that the answers were maybe a little bit more accurate. With the 3rd one.Participant: That's true. They were.Participant: I don't know.Moderator: Okay, no worries. If you, if you don't feel strongly one over the other, that'sModerator: not a problem. Did you notice anything specific that you suggest, we correct or change that would improve the user experience. Well.Moderator: you've you've talked already a bit about the.Participant: Yeah, that's about it.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And you said it, exp it.Moderator: exceeded your expectations. That's the next question. AndModerator: that does it. Do you have any other comments or suggestions for us about these 3 different Chatbot versions.Participant: I don't think so.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Maybe not having to give a rating on that 1st one. The beta one maybe not have to giving a rating after every single question that was kind of I was like, oh, no! Why.Moderator: Got it. So you prefer, like the thumbs up and thumbs down versus the stars.Participant: Yes, I think that's easier.Moderator: But you don't want it after every question.Participant: After every question doesn't really matter. It'sParticipant: I thinkParticipant: the stars were just a lot, because then you had to decide. Well, I kind of like this information. But can I find more better information if I use different words? And I don't know.Participant: Got it.Moderator: No problem.Moderator: Finally, do you have any questions for me?Participant: I don't think so. I can't think of any off the top of my head.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: I just wanted to circle back around and reconfirm that you're comfortable. If we were to share video clips with this session to our Va partners.Participant: Yes, sir.Moderator: Okay, perfect. And just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing. And we'll only share videos with Va partners for the purposes of improving va.gov and other digital experiences. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure that everything works for our vets.Participant: Awesome.Moderator: Thanks again. Lastly, Perigan will be sending you a little note and blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know that want to have a chance to provide participation for future research studies. Okay, again, thank you so much.Participant: Thank you.Moderator: You bet! Enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: You, too. Bye-bye.Moderator: Bye.
