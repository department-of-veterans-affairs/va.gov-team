Do you believe all information was provided.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, and how easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed.Participant: Hmm!Participant: It was a little difficult, because when I asked for more options, it just repeated what wasParticipant: given before.Moderator: Right.Moderator: Okay, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay. Great. What I'd like you to do then is next in the prompt window like you to type.

Excuse me very easy.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: good. I'm gonna ask you now, can you think of a way that you might be able to improve the interaction or answer for this version of our chat. Bot.Participant: I'm just wondering if I click on that getting started with Va. If that opens a separate tab, or if it overwrites the Chatbot page.Moderator: Oh, go ahead and find out!Participant: Okay.Moderator: Feel free.Moderator: Yeah, you can see there did open in a new tab.Participant: Yeah, open a new tab. So that's good.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Participant: Yeah, that way. We could still keep the chat box Chatbot box open. That's hard to say.Moderator: Tongue. Twister. Yeah, yeah, definitely that way. You don't kind of lose your your place, and where you're at with the chat. Bot. Good.Participant: Like.Moderator: I'm going to go ahead and send you another link.Moderator: And this is for our other 2 components, or or proof of concepts for the Chatbot. If you go back into the zoom window you should see this other link. Now.Participant: Okay, I'm lost.Moderator: Oh, that's okay.Participant: There we go.Participant: Yeah, it's at the bottom, right.Moderator: Yeah, exactly. At the bottom.Participant: There we go. I got youParticipant: so open that one.Moderator: Yeah, go ahead and click on that link.Participant: Right.Moderator: And it's going to ask you to put your email in. And if you would use the same email that you did for a Perigan. That way we can make sure to get you access. And you will see an email from I believe it's Cloudflare is the name of the sender, and it will give you a code to enter.Participant: All right. I'm still.Participant: I got myself. I got myself lost here.Moderator: No, take your time.Participant: There we go. I I had gone back.Participant: I have 3 emails that I useParticipant: for different things, and I wasn't sure which one this one was, so I had to go back in and see which one.Moderator: I'm the same way I got the work email. I got a.Participant: Coyle personal email. SoParticipant: so yeah, I use I have a couple like for clinical studies that I use and things like that. So I can keep them all in one place and one for junk and -oh.Moderator: That's a good idea. I mean, you should have one for all the rewards, programs and stuff that I have that way. It's notModerator: clog in my my personal email. That's that's smart.Participant: Well, shoot!Participant: Let me try this one more time.Moderator: No problem.Participant: Can't remember that dead gummit.Moderator: That's alright.

So.Moderator: Gotcha.Participant: I thought I knew what it was. But let me check something real quick.Moderator: Not a problem.Moderator: Got plenty of time.Participant: Yeah, I got a call this morning because they thought somebody thought I was not signed on soon enough.Participant: and so when I called Chantelle back. She's like oops. I called the wrong person.Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

Take a look at everything in whenever you're ready.Moderator: Type in the prompt window, how can I sign into Va?Moderator: And once again, when the answer pops up, feel free to interact, click on links, do whatever you want, and feel free to speak yourModerator: ideas and thoughts as you do.

Yeah.Participant: Okay.Moderator: Alright. Then you can see at the bottom there's a little feedback question. Whenever you're ready, go ahead and click on thatModerator: right.Moderator: So I'm going to once again ask some follow up questions. Did these answers make sense to you?Participant: Yes, they did.Moderator: Okay? And do you feel all information was provided.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: AndParticipant: Again.

And once again, did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Finally, if you would scroll all the way up to the top on this pageModerator: outside of the chat box, sorry.Participant: Oh, all right. Gotcha. Okay.Moderator: You'll see component 3 at the top left.Moderator: Click on that one. And once again, whenever you're ready in the prompt window type.Moderator: how can I sign in to Va.Moderator: Alright, and once again go ahead. Take your time to interact with the responses given, and feel free to speak out.Moderator: allowed your thoughts and actions as you explore the Chatbot.Moderator: All right. Did this answer make sense to you?Participant: Yes.Moderator: Yes, okay.Moderator: How easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It was kind of mixed.Participant: because at the beginning it talked about signing in with either Login or id me.Participant: But then it didn't give that option. It didn't answer any questions about the Id. Me how to.Moderator: Gotta log in with id dot me.Moderator: It only gave login.govModerator: got it alright. So you feel some information might have been missing. Then there.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: How easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It was easy.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: And did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?Participant: No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Finally, then, what I'm going to ask you to do is in the prompt window once again. Type, I need to help my Dad log in to get his benefits information.Moderator: And once the answer comes up again, feel free to interact with the chat bot. AndModerator: all right.Moderator: finally, I'm going to ask you a follow-up questions to this one? Did this answer make sense to you?Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, would you want any more information provided.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay. How easy or difficult was it for you to find what you needed.Participant: It was very easy.Moderator: Very easy. Okay. Did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: No.Moderator: Alright. Finally, can you think of any way to improve this interaction, or answer.Participant: No, but I do like the fact that it discussed court appointed legal guardians.Moderator: Good. Okay, so.Participant: And how to handle that situation.Moderator: So this one kind of felt like more of a complete answer versus the other 2.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay? Good.Moderator: Alright, that's it. For the task portion of our session. What I'm going to do now then, is ask a few post interview questions should take just a few minutes, and then we'll be finished.Participant: All right.Moderator: How did you feel while using the chat? Bot? Were there any points where you felt stuck or annoyed?Participant: Only the one where it where it talked about signing in with both Login and id me.Participant: But then didn't give any answers about id me.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay, at any point. Did you feel confused, overwhelmed, or frustrated by the responses or the interface.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Were the Chatbots responses easy to understand, or were they overwhelming at any point.Participant: No, they were easy to understand. I thought.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: good. Did the Chatbot ever give you too much information at once? Or do you feel it was just right.Participant: I think it was just right.Moderator: Okay, did you ever have to remember information from earlier in the conversation to complete your task.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: Did you notice any major differences between the 3 different chat bots.Participant: Chatbot like, say, Chatbot, the 3rd one, seem to be more complete and give extra information that someoneParticipant: like, for example, the legal guardian, the court appointed legal guardian partParticipant: that one seemed to give way. More information needed information.Moderator: But still it wasn't overwhelming. I didn't thinkModerator: okay. So you thought it was kind of a more complete answer.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning, as far as personal information is concerned.Participant: Yes, I did.Moderator: Did it affect? How you used the Chatbot.Participant: Not in this situation, because personal information wasn'tParticipant: even a consideration. It was just general questions.Moderator: Right? Okay?Moderator: Where you can concerned about pro sharing privacy, information.Participant: No.Moderator: Okay, where the Chatbot answers the right length for you.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Okay, did you ever feel that you wanted more or less details.Participant: Again on the chat botParticipant: where it offered at the beginning, login or id me, but then didn't go on in to explain how to how to log in with id me.Moderator: Right. Okay, was the chat bot what you expected and did it? How did it meetModerator: any expectations that you might have had.Participant: Actually, I think it was better than what I expected. I've not had good luck with previous chat bots.Participant: 9 times out of 10 I've had to requestParticipant: a representative or a real person for the chat, but this one I felt like would have been sufficientParticipant: with just the chat. Bot.Moderator: Got it so better better than your previousParticipant: Yes, interactions, good.Moderator: So if the Chatbot didn't answer your question, what did you do next? If you felt stuck.Participant: I didn't have that situation, but I did notice on the 3rd one that they gave a phone number to call about the legal guardianship issue.Moderator: Okay.Participant: So that helped.Moderator: Yeah, all right, perfect.Moderator: And did you feel strongly about one of these chat bots over the another?Participant: Yes, 3.Moderator: Again. 3. Okay. Because the complete answers that it gave.Participant: Yes.Moderator: All right.Moderator: Did you notice anything specific that you suggest? We correct or change that would improve the user experience.Participant: I think I've already mentioned that with.Moderator: Right.Participant: The second one. I think it was the second one where they at the beginning of theParticipant: answer it gave 2 different options for logging in, but then only explained how to log in with one of them.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay, perfect. Well, that does it. Then do you have any other comments or suggestions for me?Participant: No, not at all.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: well, that does it. Then we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so vital to help us as we continue to work on our site and to make va.gov. Work for veterans. Lastly, Perigian will be sending you a note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.Moderator: So again, Participant, that does it for today. Thanks so much for your time, and enjoy the rest of your day.Participant: All right. Well, thank you. You have a great day, too. Enjoy. Don't try not to work too hard now.Moderator: I'll try.Participant: Yeah, I know it's Monday.Moderator: It is Monday. Yeah, all right. You have a good day.Participant: All right.
