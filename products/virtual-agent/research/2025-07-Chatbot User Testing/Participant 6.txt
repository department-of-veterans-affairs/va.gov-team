Participant 6 Ð July 23, 2025 Ð 3:00 PM ESTParticipant: God be up here! Hi!Moderator: No problem at all, sir. We'll go ahead, and we'll we'll take as long as we need for this.Participant: Okay.Moderator: All right.Participant: I'm good.Moderator: No.Moderator: I wanna I just wanna let you know I did hit record. And I wanted to confirm now that we are recording, that I do have your permission to record.Participant: Okay. Okay.Moderator: Perfect.Moderator: Okay?Moderator: So I got a couple questions to ask you for the pre-testing questions. So it sounds like you are using some assistive technology today. For this, may may I ask what that is?Participant: Reading the lines that you're speaking. So I got screenwriting, and that's helping me a lot because I'm a hearing disabilities. SoParticipant: got it. So that's that's very helpful. I also have a phone that a special phone for when someone callsParticipant: it, it comes up like this writing so I can read it. And so without that, I have problems on the phone with people. If they don't call me on that number.Participant: I haven't given that number to too many people. But when I talked to someone from the Va. OrParticipant: one of my coin places that I get coins from profit exchange, I use that because IParticipant: I had to get my wife to come over to the phone. It's just frustrating. So the screenwriting is like absolutely fantastic.Moderator: Perfect, no problem at all.Moderator: So next question is, can I ask what deviceModerator: and what browser you're using today for for this test?Participant: Okay, well, I'm using zoomModerator: Is it a an apple computer, or a window.Participant: No, it's just regular dell dell laptop.Moderator: Dell laptop, and are you using then, Microsoft edge as the browser.Participant: You know what I I don't have any paid, Microsoft, but I see it come up occasionally. So I be honest with you. I don't even know what what browser I have, you know. ButModerator: Not a problem at all, no problem whatsoever.Participant: But it works.Participant: That's all that matters. Right?Participant: Yeah, yeah, alright.Moderator: So let me ask you how familiar you are with chat bots. Have you ever used chatbots in the past?Participant: As with the Va.Moderator: Any at all. Not.Participant: Oh, yeah, yeah, I've used Chatbot before.Participant: sometimes, you know, it's a live person. Sometimes it's AI, you know, it's just.Participant: you know, if it's not a live person, you're gonna have a problem because they don't understand the questions. When it comes to AI, you know, they gotta repeat, and then it comes up different. What you said on the screen, you know, but live persons. No problem that that works good.Moderator: Got it. So let me just ask, how many times would you say you used a chat bot in the last month.Participant: I would say about 3 times.Moderator: Okay, so how many times in the last 6 months.Participant: Probably probably about 2 or 3 more times. With that.Moderator: Okay, perfect.Moderator: So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to send you a link in our chat.Moderator: You should see a link in just a second. Let me copy and paste it here, and once you see that link there is a at the bottom menu inside this zoom. There's a little square that says Chat, and if you click on that you should see the link that I just dropped in there.Participant: So let's see, the link will be in the screen that I'm in right now.Moderator: Correct. Yeah, if you look across the bottom menu, you should see audio video, or maybe it's the top.Participant: Participants, chat, reaction.Moderator: Chat, one, sir.Participant: Oh, okay, with chat. Okay? Got it?Moderator: Now you should see like a little yellow M with a link next to it.Participant: Yes.Moderator: Can you click on that link? Please.Participant: I'm sorry. Hold on.Moderator: No problem.Participant: I see what is I see a M.Participant: When when it says no problem when you speak.Participant: and I see Ap for me and and the screenwriting. But I don't see a link now.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Would the link still be in the chat?Moderator: It should be in the chat window.Participant: Let me let me hit. Let's.Moderator: I'll I'll try putting it again.Participant: Yeah, I don't see a link, butModerator: Hmm.Participant: Yeah, I see, share, react, chat.Participant: But in the chat box I IParticipant: it's everything that I'm saying is coming up. Everything you're saying is coming up. I don't see a link. Oh, okay, they got 2. It says 2. Now in there, let me see what I got here.Participant: So it had 2. You must have sent it twice, but I don't see that when I click it there's nothing coming upParticipant: crazy. Huh? I see 3, so I would be clicking it, I would be.Participant: I will be clicking the chat right.Moderator: There should be a you know. Let me share my screen with you.Participant: The one I see. I see 3 in. Red around Circle 3 in the chat box. But when I clickParticipant: that okay, it comes up to the right side.

Are you still there?Moderator: Yes, sir.Participant: Okay? What? Okay? I see. Va, chat box.Moderator: Perfect. So now, if you go back to the windowModerator: for zoom, you should see the tab for zoom.Moderator: Can you click back on that tab.Participant: Jesus.Participant: Say that one more time I IParticipant: because you're not coming up anymore with the writing. I'm just hearing your voice. Can you say that again? It says, start chat. Should I hit that.Moderator: Actually, if you could wait to do that, if you can find the other tab that has this meeting window in it should say, zoom on it.Moderator: Can you find the other tab and switch back to that tab.Participant: The one that we originally were on.Moderator: Yes, sir.Participant: This is a good one, because I'm looking, and I.Moderator: Should be up towards.Participant: Okay, I got it.

You know what that shows.Moderator: That shows your morning.Participant: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't do this all the time that many different connections. But it's if you read like, if you read it. And you know, yeah, it'll work.Moderator: So now, speaking of reading, why don't you go ahead and check out that little blue box that you see? And whenever you're ready, click in the prompt window, and we'll have you type in a prompt whenever you're ready.Participant: Okay, when you say a little blue box, IParticipant: this meeting is being recorded. That's okay. I don't know what blue box you're looking for. I only see a blueParticipant: thing that says Va semantic search.Moderator: Yep, that's the one. Go ahead and read that, and whenever you're ready, scroll down.Participant: Oh, okay, I'm reading down personal finances and mental health. Blah, blah, blah. Okay.Participant: let me see if I could get down here.Moderator: You might have to use your scroll bar on the side of the window to to.Participant: Oh, okay, thank you.Moderator: No problem.Participant: Yeah, I'm trying to scroll down with this other site here. Okay.Moderator: All right.Participant: Down here where it says type of message.Moderator: Yep, and we're gonna do the same thing. How can I sign in to Va.Participant: Okay, hello, and I sign in to the BA.Participant: Okay, let's see what it says. Here.Moderator: Yeah.Participant: Thanks for asking the question, how can you create logins? Government accounts how to verify your identity again?Participant: What what if I can? What if I can't sign into the Va. Because my password doesn't work, how to verify identity. Want me to click one of these.Moderator: Absolutely. Yeah.Participant: Okay, I'm gonna click on how to verify your identity for the Id. Me account.Participant: this is very important. By the way.Moderator: Cool, and here it looks like it took you to the steps on how to verify that identity.Participant: I'm gonna put that in the search box right.Moderator: Oh, you don't have to this whole page if you scroll down the page.Participant: Oh, okay.Moderator: You should see the steps here once again. If you go to that little side. Scroll there you go.Participant: Okay.Moderator: There you have!Participant: Gather, gather your personal documents to complete the process.Moderator: Here's what you must have.Participant: This is all about getting set up for your id, your id, me username, your email address and password.Participant: And then you have access to to the method you set up for multifactor authentication. That's whenParticipant: you're gonna use your phone. And they're gonna text, you, a code. And that security code is what you're gonna need to get signed into. Id me.Moderator: You got it.Participant: Okay. Once that happens, you're you're in, and then you can start doing your secure messages. You can look at your health records. You can look at everything that's all about you. With the Va. You can even go back years and look up tests that you took blood tests and results and anything. It's amazing, amazing website. It has everything about you. It's your whole life, actually.Moderator: Wow!Participant: The Va. Has reallyParticipant: the Re. I have to say, has done an excellent job in setting up all the information about yourself and what you need to know. And once you're in and secure messaging, and you signed into Id me, you can find anything you need to know. I just about 6, 4, 5 months ago I went in there, and I had to find outParticipant: less than that. I'm sorry. About 3 months ago I had glaucoma surgery, and I needed to find some reports on that to give to my ophthalmologist, and I found them, and I printed them. So it worked out really well, I mean, it's just the best thing you possibly have. If you you just need to use it and scroll around and read things and find out what you want to look for. So that's a great thing. And you know you, it's just.Participant: It's the best way to go, I think, in as far asParticipant: signing in and having secure messaging. That's the best I've ever had. I've been using it for several years. I have a primary care, doctor. I I talk with her about anything I need to talk to. I get a response the next day or the day after, for sure.Participant: it's just been extremely helpful for me.Moderator: I'm glad to hear that, sir.Participant: Absolutely.Moderator: Alright. So what I'm going to have you do then, is let's close this tab that you're on. If you look at the little blue area, you should see how to verify. Just click that X to close the tab.Moderator: Do you see it all all the way up at the top of the page, sir?Participant: All the way to the top.Moderator: Yep, if you look above, you can see right where that that Kfc little window is at.Moderator: If you go just to the left of it. You see a little X.Participant: Okay, keep going. Keep going other way.Participant: I had some pop ups over here. Okay.Moderator: Oh, yeah.Participant: So I'm over here. It says, your screen sharing, and I got all the stuff up there.Moderator: Keep going up just a little bit, and there's a little X that you need to click to close this window. So next one over.Participant: Yeah, this one.Moderator: Nope the other way. Sorry to your left.Moderator: then to your left. One more time.Participant: It says, Okay, then.Moderator: Next one over go left one more.Participant: There's no x up here.Moderator: Go go to the next little X till your left.Moderator: Next one over. Go left.Participant: The way.Moderator: Left sir.Participant: Left. Okay, it says, okay. And then there has a little straight line with a circle around it. I don't see an exit.Moderator: Okay.Participant: I see I see a little X-ray here.Moderator: You can close that one. Go aheadModerator: now, close that one, too, that you're on right here.Participant: Maybe that's why I don't see it.Moderator: There you go now we're back. Okay.Participant: Oh, okay.Moderator: Alright. So now I'm gonna ask you a few questions.Moderator: Does did that answer that you received? Make sense.Participant: Absolutely.Moderator: Okay. Do you believe all information was provided.Participant: Everything they needed to know. Yes.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: How easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: It's not difficult at all. You justParticipant: put you put it, put put it, put, put type what you want to know, and it's gonna pop up.Moderator: Okay.Participant: It's how it's how you say things, too, you know, if you don't say it there, what you really want, just be direct, be direct in what you're asking and make it short. Not a long 10 sentence thing, and it's gonna pop up what you need, and pretty fast, too.Moderator: Great, so did the information ever feel overwhelming or hard to process.Participant: There's been some times where you know, you might have excess reading and stuff that you you want to make sure you're clicking the right stuff so, but I wasn't overwhelmed. No.Moderator: Okay, perfect. Then we're gonna have you scroll down to the bottom of this window.Moderator: There you go.Moderator: And then here you can see there's a different feedback mechanism. So can you answer, did this answer your question thumbs up or thumbs down?Moderator: Okay, then we're going to ask the same question that we did last time. I need help.Moderator: I need to help my dad log in to get his benefits. Information. You know you got it. You're ahead of me. You remembered it.Participant: I need to help my dad.Moderator: Log in.Participant: Log, in.Moderator: Yup to get his benefits. Information.Participant: To get health benefits, information.Moderator: Benefits and information.Participant: It was just benefit to get benefits.Moderator: All right, perfect.Moderator: And here it is chugging along. Okay.Participant: I'm killing some span things popping up.Moderator: Alright!Participant: What if I could sign into the Va. That because my password doesn't work.Moderator: Oh, yeah.Moderator: pull up inside that window so we can see the top of the answer. So if you can go back to that little window.Moderator: the the.Participant: So.Moderator: Window. I'm sorry.Moderator: Going down. You're good.Moderator: Yep, you got it right there. Scroll up.Participant: Okay.Participant: You want me scroll up.Moderator: Yes, please.Moderator: Right there.Participant: Oh, too far sorry!Moderator: No worries right below your question.Participant: Right here.Moderator: Yeah, there, you go. Keep going.Participant: Okay.Moderator: See it.Participant: What if I can't sign into my va.com? Because my password doesn't work, or then you create another password.Participant: What to do? What do I do if I have? If you haven't switched to login id, it tells you on the screen.Participant: right whatParticipant: one you want to do, and it tells you that you should be doing login id me, because that's the main one that they want you to use.Moderator: Yep.Participant: They had some old stuff before that.Moderator: Yeah, they've gotten rid of a couple of them. I know.Participant: Yeah.Moderator: All right. So let me ask you, did this information answer your question. I need to help my dad log in to find his benefits. Information.Participant: Well, I I would. I would say,Participant: I would say, yes, because, yeah, it's your answer is, gonna be one of these here one of these you're logging in, or or your your passwords no good, no more.

You know it's amazing that even AI, even AI, right. It's bringing up the stuff that you sawParticipant: with the regular chat box, which is pretty good. I like that. I mean, I do like AI, but some things. They they're not as detailed as a lot of other things, but they're good just showing everything that we we just went through. AndModerator: Okay, so.Participant: Managing your Va. Profile the whole bit.Moderator: Yep.Participant: Absolutely up for that fingers up.Moderator: Good good. So let me ask you some questions, then, about this interaction was all information provided.Participant: Yes.Moderator: And did the answer make sense to you?Participant: Yes, it does.Moderator: Okay. How easy or difficult was it to find what you needed.Participant: Pretty, simple.Moderator: Okay, did the information feel overwhelming or hard to process at all?Participant: Not not to me. No.Moderator: Okay.Moderator: And did you notice any unique feature about this version of the chat? Bot.Participant: Well, I I thought this. This was AI, that we just did right.Moderator: Correct.Participant: Yeah, I I find them both pretty similar, you know. It's pretty interesting.Participant: I I find it to be very informative. They they put it all out there for you, both of both the chat box and the AI.Moderator: Great. Okay? So that conducts that. Excuse me. That concludes rather our task portionModerator: of the testing. What I'm going to do now is just take a few minutes to ask some postModerator: task questions. So the 1st question I have is, how did you feel while using the chat bot? And were there any points where you might have felt stuck or annoyed, or maybe especially satisfied.Moderator: So basically, I'm just asking, how did you feel while using the chat? Bot.Participant: This question is for your other other members.Moderator: Oh, no! This is for you, sir.Participant: Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I felt very comfortable using the chat box. I I like the chat box.Moderator: Okay.Participant: It's pretty simple, pretty easy just to type what you want to know.Participant: It'll pop up. And it's gonna give you a whole bunch of different things so one of your answers are, gonna be there. Okay. So I find it very comfortable, very simple.Moderator: Good at any point. Did you feel confused, frustrated, or overwhelmed?Participant: No, not that. I did not feel confused. I was not frustrated and not overwhelmed. No.Moderator: Where the response is easy to understand.Participant: Pretty much so. Yes, I would say.Moderator: Did you ever feel that the chat Bot gave you too much information at once, or was it just right.Participant: Not really. It's broken down and then highlighted. You click the one that you want. It's good that you get a variety ofParticipant: things. Just wait. One of your answers are gonna be what? What? One of those boxes that you click, you know. So yeah, I find it to be good.Moderator: Okay. Did you notice any major differences between the 3 chat bots.Participant: No, they're pretty similar. The chat box with the AI, which is pretty impressive. I I don't. I don't give AI a high, level rating, but they're pretty decent.Moderator: Okay, so did you notice the disclaimer at the beginning that dealt with privacy, information.Participant: Did a disclaimer at the beginning that though yes, I did.Moderator: Okay, did it affect how you use? Excuse me, were you concerned about sharing privacy or personal information with the chat Bot.Participant: Not really. It depends on what information you're sharing. You know, it's not real personal, you know, I'm not gonna share my social security number and things like that. But I don't mind sharing, and things that are gonna help others.Moderator: Right?Moderator: Okay? So compared to your other experiences with chat bots, is this what you expected? And if not, in what ways was it different.Participant: It's with the chat box. I I expected what what occurred. They're pretty good, because I've used it like, you know, 4, 3, 4, 5 times in the last 2 months, and I've used it before I I find them that they've got more perfected in the last several years.Moderator: Okay? So you would say, it met your expectations.Moderator: Okay.Participant: Yes, it did absolutely.Moderator: Good. Do you feel strongly about one version over another?Participant: AndParticipant: when you mean one version of the you're talking about the AI along with the chat. No, I was very surprised, and seeing what I saw with AI. I was surprised to see almost everything that came up with the regular chat box came up with the AI. Which was surprising to me because I I don't use AI much, and IParticipant: impressive, impressive.Moderator: Good. Okay.Moderator: If the Chatbot didn't answer your question, what did you do next?Participant: I would go to AI all right.Participant: Could always call him Va, too. That's right, that's right. You could.Moderator: Did you notice anything specific that you would suggest that we correct or change that would improve the user experience.Participant: Oh.Participant: not really because I I haven't had any problem with anything, you know. But if I did, then I would suggest, you know, I have good experience with chat box.Moderator: Okay, well, do you have any other comments or suggestions.Participant: Use the chat box sign in with Idm me idm me. It's much easier the Gov. gov.com, you knowParticipant: it's good, too, but they.Moderator: You you like the id.Participant: I like id me. It's much more simpler. You, you put your password, your email, they're gonna send you a text. It says text, you hit text. Your phone's gonna get a text number. You go back to the box. You put it in. Bing, you click it. You're in. That's itParticipant: perfect. You know.Moderator: So. Do you have any questions for me?Participant: No, I think you're fantastic. You got good good voice. You spoke very clearly. You're very professional, you know what you're doing, and I like that, and you and I appreciate you because I was able to hear you. Well, because I mentioned I was pretty disabled with hearing.Participant: But yeah, thank you. You've been very, very professional and very courteous.Moderator: Thank you, sir, I appreciate it. Yeah. I definitely tried to slow down my speech a little bit.Participant: I wish everybody thought like you.Moderator: It's only it's only common courtesy.Participant: Yeah, yeah, I can't tell you how many times I tell people over the phone, look, I'm I'm 87% deaf. Can you slow down a little bit, and and within a minute and a half they're speeding up with their voice again, you know.Participant: Yeah, you know. Well.Moderator: I'm glad that I was able to to.Participant: Good. You'll be good.Moderator: Okay? Well, that that then, concludes our study. I want to appreciate you for taking the time to share.Participant: My pleasure, my pleasure. Everybody out there.Participant: id me chat box is the bomb. Okay?

So I took an Uber for the 1st time in my life, and I'll probably never, ever take one again. The guy drives up. He has hearing aids on Vietnam hat, which drives me all the way from Lax to Valencia.Participant: and we talked. He's 79 years old. He applied for some benefits, and they denied him years ago. He never applied again, I said, you have a hearing. Disability, diabetes, open heart surgery. A lot of these things are in the Pac ActParticipant: in 4 months I got him up to 90%.Moderator: Oh, my goodness!Participant: He looks at me like I'm God, I help other veterans like that.
