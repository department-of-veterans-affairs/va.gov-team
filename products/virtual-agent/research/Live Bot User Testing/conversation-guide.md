## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kiera and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Virtual Live Agent Chatbot. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

General Questions

-   How familiar are you with VA.gov? 
    -   If familiar, consider asking the following questions:
        - What are some reasons that you have come to the site?
        - How often do you visit the site?
        - What are some things you expect from the site that it doesn’t provide already?
    -   If unfamiliar with the site consider asking the following questions:
        - What are some topics you hope the website can assist you with?
-   Can you confirm if you have a Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon, or MyHealtheVet account? 
    -   If they do not already have login credentials:
        -  Would you see value in creating login credentials in the future?
        -   If you chose to, after creating those credentials, what topics would you be hoping to find more personalized information on first? 
-   Can you tell me which web browser you are currently using?
-   Lastly, can you tell me which type of device you are on (i.e. phone, tablet, computer)?

Today I will be asking you to go through a series of tasks using the Virtual Agent Chatbot. Would you be comfortable with sharing your screen so that I can follow along as you do some of the activities?

## First Task: Engaging the Feedback Survey - 5-10 minutes
For the next portion of our session, we’re going to complete a task using the Virtual Agent chatbot. Please open a web browser of your choice and follow the link provided.

### Experience with the Virtual Chatbot
-   How familiar are you with the Virtual Chatbot on VA.gov? 
    -  If familiar: 
        - What are some topics that have you asked the chatbot to assist you with in the past?
        - How often have you used the virtual chatbot while visiting VA.gov?
    -  If they’re not familiar: 
        - What kind of topics and information are you hoping the chatbot can provide you with most?

### Completing the feedback form
Let’s say I asked you to use the Virtual Chatbot to see if you qualify for dental care. Walk me through what you would do to complete this task.

### Feedback on completing the feedback form
  -   Once the bot asks you if that answers your question what do you expect to happen after this point?
  -   When you’ve completed the task or received your answer, how do you expect that encounter to end? 
    -   Do you anticipate a feedback survey? 
    -   Do you expect something prompting you to sign out?
  -   Did you notice that there were multiple places prompting you to provide feedback?
  -   Were you surprised by anything when completing the feedback survey?
  -   When completing a feedback survey what ways would you expect to have to provide your response?
    -   Do you anticipate having to type in an open form?
  -   Do you feel that providing feedback is useful/purposeful? 

### Things to watch for:

-   Once the information is provided does the user go back to the page with the chatbot?
-   Do they stop right after receiving the answer? 



## Second Task: Password Reset Flow - 15 minutes

### Experience with the password reset process
-   Have you ever experienced having to reset your password before?
    -   If familiar: What has that experience typically been like? Did you have to sign in prior to resetting your password?
    -   If unfamiliar: what would imagine the steps to be to complete this?
-   Are you familiar with the type of account that you have?

### Completing the password reset process 
Let’s say you have been having login issues and would like to reset your password. By reviewing the MURAL slides provided, walk me through your thoughts on the flow to accomplish this task. 

### Feedback on completing this task:
  -   During the session: What other keywords/phrases would you consider typing in to help you complete this task outside of the one provided?
  -   During the session: After you’re asked “Do you have an account?”, what would you expect in the next step of the process?
  -   During the session: After resetting your password what would you expect to do next? 
        -   Would you expect to have to log out after that?
  -   During the session: Before this exercise, were you aware of the four types of accounts you could have? And if so, did you know the difference between them?
  -   During the session: If you pressed the wrong button for the type of account, how would you expect to get back to the previous screen?
  -   How would you describe the flow of this process? Is it clear?
  -   After you have reset your password, would you like reminders concerning if your password is about to expire?
  -   Would you be interested in being able to reset your username through the chatbot also?

### Things to watch for:

  -   During session: What other phrases would they use to complete this task?
  -   Would they hesitate or be confused when asked what kind of account they have?



## Third Task: Future Feature Discussion - 5-10 minutes

We are in the process of designing more personalized features for the chatbot around a few topics. Please use the workspace presented in Mural to provide feedback on how you would prioritize the upcoming features. 
  -   Clinical: the ability to make appointments and find a primary doctor
  -   Veteran disability rating: how to get a temporary rating and how to include a dependent in my rating
  -   Education benefits: how to acquire my Certificate of Eligibility, find more personalized information on my GI Bill 

### Feedback on completing this task:
  -   Are there any general categories that have not been named that you’d like to see more development in?
  -   Are there any other topics not shown for these topics that you would like the bot to address? 


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

  -   What are your impressions of this experience?
  -   Do you have any other thoughts on what we talked about today? 
  -   Do you have any questions for me?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future usabiility research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
