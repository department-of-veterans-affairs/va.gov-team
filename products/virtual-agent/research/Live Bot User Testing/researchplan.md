# Research Plan for VA Orchid, Virtual Agent Chatbot, July 14, 2022
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
We released an unauthenticated chatbot in February 2022 with the aim of acting as a way to provide veterans with access to information. We followed this with an authenticated version in April 2022 with the focus being on personalization and features to access private information such as progressing compensation claims. This personalization included the ability of users to sign in with credentials, an updated end to conversation flow, and a feature that enables encryption of sensitive information to name a few. Lastly, the Chatbot was launched in beta in March 2022 to 25% traffic and recently released to 50% availability in May 2022 so it is fairly new to Veterans. 
We need to gather feedback concerning the latest updates in the live version of the chatbot. We also need to gain a sense of priority/interest for the proposed bot features being considered for Phase III.

### OCTO Objectives 
Goals taken from here. 

The following research will support the following OCTO objectives:
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

The research will also help increase these measures:
-   Use of digital service tools
The research will also help decrease these measures:
-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution


### Veteran Journey
The need for assistance and clarity from the VA can happen at any time for a Veteran. With Veterans having only the option of either contacting the VA through either a phone number or VA.gov the Virtual Chatbot fits into the user journey by being one of the first interfaces they can interact with on VA.gov. The Chatbot is also a self service platform furthering the fact that it can be accessed at any time. 

## Research Goals	
1.  Gain insight on lack of feedback survey completion
2.  Take users through a flow to reset their password and gain insight on the expected flow
3.  Gain insight on future chatbot feature prioritization with users


### Outcome
Currently it is hard to gauge the overall experience of users with the chatbot due to users not completing the feedback survey. We hope that this research will help us determine a better way to capture this feedback. 

Secondly, sign-in issues have been reported throughout various pieces of data and we currently have no user flows programmed within that chatbot to address these pain points. After the completion of this usertest we hope to gain valuable feedback to best account for these pain points.  

Finally, with the recent finalization of the Virtual Agent Chatbot team’s Roadmap we hope this research will serve as a guide to better inform which features to prioritize.


### Research questions
1.  Gauge the general feedback of the state of the Current Live version:
  -   What would encourage users to fill out the feedback survey?
  -   Why are they not filling out the feedback survey currently?
2.  Password Reset
  -   What type of flow would users like to see when attempting to reset their password?
  -   Would users like for the chatbot to be able to address having to reset their username or password?
3.  Future Feature consideration: 
  -   What features would users like to see prioritized based upon the following issues: clinical [appointment set up and prescription fulfillment], sign in/credential creation, disability rating information, and life insurance.


### Hypothesis
1.  Users will expect a feedback survey at the end of their exchange with the chatbot.
2.  Users will expect to have to navigate to another window to create or update their login credentials.
3.  Participants will prefer to have a sign out button at the end of their encounter with the chatbot.
4.  Participants will not find any difficulty with the current sign in process.


## Method	
This usability study will be conducted remotely via Zoom with participants and will consist of semi-structured interviews and usability testing.
