**SUBJECT LINE: Veteran User Experience Research Studies - Invitation to Participate (Study Name)**

Hello,

The VA.gov team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is running a user research session. The research is to help us understand how we can best meet the needs of Veterans online.

We are looking for Veterans who are interested in engaging with a prototype of a VA virtual agent. We are exploring how a virtual agent/chatbot may help you find answers to questions you may have on va.gov. We created a prototype to help us understand if the chatbot tool is helpful, and how we can improve it. Your feedback will help us build a better product. 

**What will I be doing in this session?** You will be sent two links. The first link is to the prototype of the chatbot. The second is to a feedback tool, where we will ask you questions about your experience engaging with the chatbot. You must complete the activities on both links. 

**How long is a session?** The session is self-guided and should take you 20 minutes to complete the activity. You can do this at any time that's convenient for you. 

**Interested in participating?** Please reply to this email to receive the study link and a participation code. After completing the online activity, we'll send your compensation of $10 for completing the study.

**We recommend that you complete this activity on a laptop or tablet, if one is accessible to you. It is possible to complete the activity on a mobile phone, but the smaller screen may make the activity more challenging to complete.**  

**Process**

\1. We will schedule the first 10 Veterans that can match the criteria and timeslots.

\2. We will email you the links and a participation code.

\3. Once you complete the card sorts, your compensation will be delivered via check within 1-2 weeks.
