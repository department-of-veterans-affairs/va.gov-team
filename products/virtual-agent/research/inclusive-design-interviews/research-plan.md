# Research Plan for Virtual Agent Inclusive Design/interviews with Veterans with a disability, 6/4/2021

As a researcher I want to create a research plan so Perigean can recruit the right users for our research study.

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is for the VA-Virtual Agent team for the Virtual Agent product. 	

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The virtual agent/chatbot will eventually be hosted on Va.gov. Exact location(s) to be determined. Ultimately, the virtual agent’s goal is to provide responses based on existing Va.gov content to enable and encourage self service behaviors. This project is part of the larger Omnichannel strategy (led by VEO) to provide veterans with seamless access to information. 

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

We understand that a large percentage of Veterans live with disabilities, and that certain disabilities can prevent Veterans from using a chatbot efficiently. We have identified a number of accessibility challenges with our current product we’d like to understand more about.  In order to prevent biases in our research, we want to include the voices from disabled Veterans to better understand:

We plan to ask questions such as:

- Do partial vision or visually impared/blind users have experience with chatbots
- Do they experience the challenges we’ve identified with the chatbot we built (see https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/25113 for the list)
- If they wanted to use this chatbot, what would they use it for

We may have additional questions tied to the larger goals of self service among Veterans, such as: 

- How the Veteran normally find information on va.gov - channels, why do they choose that channel and how often they use it
- Does the Veteran sign into va.gov (using Veteran’s info) - why or why not
- What do they do when they can’t find the information they need on VA.gov? 
- How often the Veteran speak with a VA help desk/contact center
- Have the Veteran ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online?
- Did the Veteran use the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov - why or why not
- What functionality would the Veteran find valuable in a chatbot
- What content (questions and topics) would the Veteran find valuable in a chatbot and what language would the expect

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

The focus is on understanding general usage and mental models rather than validating a specific hypothesis. However, we are curious about the following assumptions, including:

- Participants will encounter the same problems we identified during development
- Veterans with visual disabilities may still be interested in using a chatbot rather than other channels such as the main va.gov site or speaking to a contact center agent.

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	

We would like to conduct direct interviews and a moderated observation with blind Veterans using a moderated script and ask them to perform a specific task of entering text into the chatbot and observe their interactions.  We will be able to both validate the existing accessibility issues we identified in https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/25113 and also see what content is of interest to users.

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

Direct interviews allow the participant to tell their story while allowing moderators to quickly obtain clarity on stated points that may later cause confusion in research synthesis; having people use the product will allow us to capture feedback on possible improvements.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research

Online, Perigean's Zoom

4.	What will you be testing?

The product is at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent-study 

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

Perigean's Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** 
 
We are looking for 2 Veterans who:

- Have visual impairment
- Require assistive technology to navigate va.gov
- Used va.gov in the past year

These Veterans should be familiar with or know how to use Zoom and have assistive technology installed and enabled on their computer so we’re able to observe them using it.

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	

Perigean

## When?

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	

Tentatively June 14-18 (waiting on Lauren’s feedback)

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	

We will be testing the product at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent-study, which is live.

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

Approximately 30 minutes sessions, with a 30 minute buffer in between.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

Monday 9-12, 1-6
Tuesday 9-12, 1-6
Wednesday 9-12, 1-6
Thursday 9-12, 1-6
Friday 9-12, 1-6

Please ensure there is at least ½ hour between interviews.

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

June 10th (approximately) - Luciana Morais or Katie Ho
