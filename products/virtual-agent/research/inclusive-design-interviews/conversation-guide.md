## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to ask you some questions about chatbots, your experience with them in general, and what you might expect from one from the VA. 

Before we start, I would like to give you an idea of what to expect today:
- 
- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- We'll start the session with some technical set-up, then we'll go over a couple warm up questions.
- And finally, I'll ask you to engage with the tool we are testing to gather your feedback. 
 Throughout the session, I may ask you about your thoughts and opinions about the pages or features but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the website to see how we can make it better for all Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question.
- We’re also going to have you talk out loud during the product testing part - so feel free to share what you’re thinking about what you’re seeing in the product.
- In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and we'll help you through that.
- We may send you links to go to during the session. Do you have a communication preference? 
    - if desktop, email/zoom chat
    - if mobile, email/text 
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the interview, please let me know.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*  - **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Tech set-up

Next, I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Shannon may have gone over a list of technical questions when you registered.
- I'm going to quickly run through those again just to make sure I have the right information.

Checklist:
- Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today? 
- Mac or Windows? 
- iOS (iPhone) or Android?
   - If not joined by Zoom already:
   - Do you have Zoom installed? 
- Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.
- What browser are you using today?
- Do you have a screen reader on this device?
- What screen reader do you use?
- How long have you been using it?
- Are you using a screen magnifier today?
- Are there any other assistive technologies that you use?
  - [if deaf/hard-of-hearing, the participant may require captions which need to be turned on in advanced settings]
- Do you know your screen reader's verbosity setting? High, medium, low? 
  - [If high, be prepared to have them repeat anything that can't be heard or understood]
   - I may need to pause you at times an ask you what you're hearing if I can't make out what's being read.

**For those joined by iPhone and Zoom already**

## Joining Zoom

### Help participant join with device

- I'm going to send you a zoom link [by format specified] for you to open on your phone so you can join this meeting.  
- [Send through Veteran's preferred communication channel]
- When you open the link, you should be taken to the Zoom application automatically. Zoom will ask for access to your microphone and video. We only need your audio for this session, so please tap "Allow" for the microphone prompt. Feel free to tap "Don't Allow" for video permissions if you are not comfortable having your face on camera.
- Upon joining the room, Zoom will have you turn on audio by asking “To hear others, please join audio.” Please swipe to and double tap "Wifi or Cellular Data." [This button will be at the center of their screen.]
- Once you're in the call...

## Screen sharing

At this point [I'd like you to go back to Zoom] I'm going to have you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along with you. 

### VoiceOver iOS (Mobile and Tablet) using web app

 - Have you shared your screen before on Zoom?
[If no] Please open your iPhone settings. Once you’re there, go to your control center. Then, find the “Insert screen recording” button and double tap to activate it. When you’re done, please return to the zoom app.
 - Within Zoom, I'd like you to find the "Share content" button and double tap it. You may have to swipe a number of times.
 - A menu should appear. Select the "Screen” option and double tap it. 
   - If you haven’t given Zoom permission to record yet on your device, you’ll be prompted to give access to allow it”
 - Next you'll want to swipe to the "Start Broadcast" button and double tap that. You'll hear a counter "3, 2, 1" and the screen share should begin.
 - Please swipe right until you hear the option to share your audio.
 - [If the screen is black]: We see a black screen right now. If you have screen curtain or other screen hiding tech running, please toggle it off if possible.
 - [If you don’t hear the screen reader]: We can’t hear your screen reader. Are you using headphones, hearing aids, or other technology? If so, would you be able to comfortably use your phone/desktop without that device so we can hear your screen reader? If not, that’s perfectly OK.
 - Return to your home screen and the screen share should begin.

[If successful:]

OK, great, I can see your screen. Sometimes Zoom can be finicky and I will lose the screen share connection and I may have to ask you share screen again the way we just did. Also, if you need to stop sharing during this session you can double tap “Stop Share.” It’s located where the “Screen Share” button originally was at the bottom center of your screen.

Next up: [Warm-up questions](#warm-up-questions)

[If NOT successful:]

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

### Screen sharing set-up - TalkBack, Android using web app

 - Within Zoom, select the "Share content" button and double tap it. You may have to swipe a number of times.
 - A menu should appear with a list of items. Swipe until you find “screen” and double tap it. 
 - You’ll be asked if you want to start recording or casting with Zoom. 
 - Swipe to “start now” and double tap it.
 - If you haven’t given Zoom permission to record yet on your device, you’ll be prompted to give access to “display over other apps.” Swipe until you find “Zoom” in the list and double tap it. Continue swiping to find “Allow display over other apps” and confirm it is “off.” Double tap it to turn it on.
 - Return to your home screen and the screen share should begin.


[If successful:]

OK, great, I can see your screen. Sometimes Zoom can be finicky and I will lose the screen share connection and I may have to ask you share screen again the way we just did. Also, if you need to stop sharing at any time during the session, you can go back into the zoom app and find the “stop share” button where the “share” button was originally located. [at the bottom left corner of your screen (press your finger down and drag it to the bottom left corner, it will be by “share audio” and “announcements”]

## Questions

Thank you for working through that with us. We can get started with some questions.

- How do you normally find information on va.gov - what channels, why do they choose that channel and how often they use it
    - Do you sign into va.gov (using Veteran’s info) - why or why not?
    - What do you do when you can’t find the information you need on VA.gov? 

- How often do you speak with a VA help desk/contact center? What were some of the reasons you have called a VA help desk/contact center in the past?
- Have you ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online - why or why not? What were you doing on it?
- Were you aware that VA.gov had a coronavirus chatbot? If yes -- Did you use the Coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov - why or why not?
- What assistive technology do you use to interact with the Internet?
- Do you use Alexa, Google Home, Cortana, Siri, Bixby, Facebook portal or any other conversational tool?

Product interaction

_Purpose: to understand if they experience the challenges we’ve identified with the chatbot we built_

We’re now going to have you interact with the product we’ve built. 

I'm going to send a link [by format specified] Go ahead and click on the link and we’ll get started.
OR:
Please open the browser and go to [read this url out loud, slowly] staging.va.gov/virtual-agent-study.  

You are now in the chatbot window.  We’d like you to interact with the chatbot, and afterwards we’ll chat about the experience.  
Think of a recent time when you wanted to find out something - some piece of information or a task to complete - on va.gov or to contact the VA.

We’re going to have you go ahead and try and find an answer to that question or tasks using the chatbot.  We want you to ask some of the questions or tasks you’d like to do and try to use the bot for as long as you can.  Feel free to click on links or anything you would normally.  

Remember to talk out loud as you’re interacting with the chatbot, and when you’re done, let us know.

What to observe:

- [KEYBOARD]: Links in the chat log must be keyboard focused
- [COGNITION]: Links must be announced to screen readers as links. Currently being announced as "messages" or just text 
- SCREENREADER]: New messages must be announced consistently across assistive technology software
- [SCREENREADER]: Content should not be repeated when users are navigating through the chat messages 
- [COGNITION]: Screen reader text for timestamps should match visual timestamps 
- [COGNITION]: The chat messages should not have screen reader only information between the end of chat message and text input 
- [PLAIN LANGUAGE]: The bot should have an active voice, and not talk about itself in third person 
- [SEMANTIC HTML]: Chatbot should be in a labelled region for screen reader navigation 
- [SEMANTIC HTML]: Consider simplifying the HTML for each list item for better clarity 

_Closing questions_

Now that we tested the product, we’d like to understand your experience.

- Did the chatbot answer your questions accurately?
- Did it understand what you were trying to ask?
- After reading the response, did you have the information you needed to take the next step to complete your task?
- If the chatbot wasn’t able to answer your question, how did that make you feel?
- The chatbot could answer both general questions (for example, location of a VA facility) and personal questions (your benefit status). However, you must sign into va.gov for the chatbot to answer personal questions. How do you prefer to use this chatbot? a) I would prefer to sign in, so I can get answers to personal questions. b) I would prefer not to sign in, even if it means I cannot get personalized answers. c) I don't know. 
- How do you feel about the voice of the response you received? Voice refers to the personality of the chatbot (friendly, chatty, dry, etc.)
- How do you feel about the tone of the response you received? Tone refers to the style of response (professional, bureaucratic, casual, etc.) 
- How do you feel about the quality of the response you received? Quality refers to your satisfaction with the accuracy of responses. Were you given the right link? Was your question answered? 
- What content (questions and topics) would you find valuable in a chatbot?
- How can a chatbot help you reduce how often you call the VA? 
- Based on your experience today, are you willing to use the chatbot again?
- Do you have any other feedback you'd like to share?


## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to design a VA chatbot and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
