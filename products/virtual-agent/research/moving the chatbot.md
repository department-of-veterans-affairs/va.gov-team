# Overview 
 
## Team 
Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) VEO Multi-Channel Technologies (MCT) – Virtual Agent Chatbot Research  
 
## Background 
The VA Multi-channel Technology (MCT) team seeks to use human-centered design (HCD) research methods to evaluate Veteran expectations and desired experiences for the VA chatbot, specifically as it relates to the usability of the chatbot on the bottom right of the VA.gov home page and subsequent pages. 
 
This project will focus on the desired experience and usability for Veterans interacting with the VA chatbot on the bottom right of the webpage for mouse navigators, keyboard navigators, and screen reader users. User research will focus on testing the desirability and perceived usability of chatbot placement and button interaction, which will inform future iterations and ultimate placement of the chatbot. Additionally, user research will help identify pain points or opportunities for improvement for users with a focus on keyboard navigators and screen reader users. This research will also garner users preferred chatbot size when it comes to covering VA webpage content.  
 
 ## Method
1. What method of research are you planning? 	 
- Remotely moderated interviews with Veterans where they are provided a link to a VA chatbot prototype by a facilitator who will guide them using specified scenarios. Veterans will also be provided a Mural link to conduct A/B testing to gauge their preference for the dimensions of the chatbot on a given page.  
 
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?  
- This approach will allow us to understand the usability of the VA chatbot on alternate web pages with a button to initially interact with it, including the use of a skip link. This method will also measure the desirability of certain key chatbot capabilities and architecture to inform feature design and development.  
 
3. Where are you planning to do your research?  
- Remote virtual interviews and testing in Zoom. 
 
4. Remote: What tool do you plan to use?  
- Perigean: Zoom video conferencing, screen sharing,  
- Shared Mural.co remote whiteboard.
 
## Research questions 
What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	 
 
### User Testing Objectives  
- Understand user expectations and desires around the usability and interactions of the VA chatbot in a new location.  
- Understand how users feel about a chatbot covering VA home page content in relation to different chatbot sizes. 
## Hypothesis 
What is your hypothesis for this research? 	 
- Veterans will find the new location of the VA chatbot easier to locate and more accessible for their needs.  
 
## Participant criteria 
What are you looking for in a participant?  
- 15 Veterans who are familiar with VA.gov. Additionally, at least 8 of the Veterans should be  screen reader users.   
 
## Screening Questions   
- Can they access a laptop or desktop computer with a reliable internet connection?  
If no, then do not recruit.  
If yes, then continue.  
- During the session, they must be willing to share a web browser window on their device. 
- Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share a screen. 
- Language: Participant must be fluent in English so the researchers can communicate with them.  
 
## Key Objectives 
Understand user expectations and desires around the usability and interactions of the VA chatbot in a new location.

## One-on-One Interviews   
In the first 10 minutes of the session, the team will ask a series of questions to understand in what way Veterans expect and desire to interact with the VA chatbot. One-on-one interviews allow the team to probe into the user’s past experiences and identify significant expectations or concerns for their future service interactions.   
  
### Benefits   
- One-on-one interviews are designed to aid the facilitator in conducting the interview  
- The conversational structure of the interview allows the facilitator the ability to react to a user’s response, improves a line of questioning that might result in unexpected findings, and reduces bias by gathering user responses before beginning the activity   
### Limitations  
- Users may withhold information from the research team  
- What the user says may not always match their real-life interactions   
  
## VA chatbot prototype 
Following the interview portion, the team will present the participant with a prototype where the VA chatbot is located on the bottom right of the VA.gov home page. The moderator will guide users through one of two scenarios that will help inform the placement and ways in which VA chatbot users can interact with the chatbot. 
 
### Benefits   
- The proposed prototype will be very close to what users will be able to access on VA.gov, allowing for accurate feedback and realistic experience.  
- The facilitator can observe the habits and behaviors that a user may not realize themselves 
 
### Limitations 
- Need to ensure with developers that the staging environment is set up and stable for testing.  
 
## Facilitation Guide  
### Introduction  
**Note to Facilitator to turn on camera and enable screensharing. If necessary, change observers’ names in Zoom to “Observer.”**

**Introduction Script.**  
Thank you for taking the time to give us your feedback. My name is [insert name], and I will be facilitating today’s testing session. [Optional: Introduce government observers and others present.]  
We are working to improve the user experience of interacting with the VA chatbot and get a better understanding of the chatbots new proposed placement. Our goal is to gather feedback on this prototype you’ll see today and see if this matches Veterans desires and expectations.  
With your permission, we are going to document this session using written notes, audio, and/or video recording. We will only use the information you share with us for research and analysis, and we will not share it with anyone outside of our project team at VA. Do you understand these guidelines and consent to this interview being documented via written notes, screenshots, audio and/or video recording? 
Great, thank you. I will begin the recording and then ask again for our records.  
 
[Ask again] 
 
Before I go over the agenda for today’s session, I also wanted to let you know that your participation is entirely voluntary, and we can stop at any time. You are welcome to decline or skip any question. In our notes, we will remove any personally identifying information such as your name or benefit eligibility status, and combine them with other participants’ information, so no feedback will be directly tied to you. Is that all right? 
 
### Agenda 
To give a quick **overview** of what we will run through, here is our agenda for today: 
 
This session is set to be no more than 45 minutes. In a moment I am going to ask you to share your screen while we are testing the prototype and turn on your camera if you feel comfortable doing so. Let me know if you need help sharing your screen.   
  
We will ask you to go through the prototype that we will share in just a moment. It is important to remember that we are not testing you, we are testing the product. You cannot do anything wrong here.  
  
As you go through today’s session, please think aloud as much as possible. Describe what you are looking at, what you are trying to do, and what you are thinking. We especially want to know if there is anything you like or do not like, or if there is anything you find confusing. We want your complete honesty.  
  
Throughout the exercise, I will ask a few questions to better understand your thoughts and opinion.   
 
After we complete all the tasks, I will ask you about your overall impressions of the experience and take note of any general comments you have. I cannot stress enough your honest feedback will help us make a better chatbot. Please do not hold back. Even small or nitpicky things are helpful. You will not hurt our feelings if you are brutally honest! 
 
Do you have any questions at this point?
