## Background
The Chatbot is a self-service platform that can be accessed at any time by Veterans. The chatbot aims to provide value to Veterans by increasing awareness of existing VA self-service tools, decreasing the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome, and allowing them 24/7 access to either anonymous or secure support. The chatbot was initially released in February 2022 so it is fairly new and unfamiliar to Veterans. Finally, the chatbot is currently situated as a subset of the VA Contact Us and can be accessed directly here.

### OCTO Objectives 
Goals taken from here. The following research will support the following OCTO objectives:
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

The research will also help increase these measures:
- Use of digital service tools

The research will also help decrease these measures:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution


### Veteran Journey
The need for assistance and clarity from the VA can happen at any time for a Veteran. With Veterans having only the option of either contacting the VA through either a phone number or VA.gov, the chatbot fits into the user journey by being one of the first interfaces they can interact with on VA.gov. The chatbot is also a self-service platform furthering the fact that it can be accessed at any time.

## Research Goals	
1. Take users through flows to gain insight on the expected experience of the following topics:
    -   Sign-in content surfacing 
    -   Problem escalation 
    -   Account identification assistance
    -   Password reset flow
    -   Account creation
2. Understand the existing pain points for users around sign-in related issues
3. Understand how users currently handle their issues around sign-in related issues


### Outcome
With the recent finalization of the chatbot teamâ€™s roadmap we hope this research will serve as a guide to better inform which features to prioritize for users. 

The chatbot currently has no user flows designed around the following: providing sign-in related content, problem escalation, account identification assistance, password resetting, and account creation. These are topics that we have seen users contend with in various pieces of data. It is our hope that with the introduction of these flows that we can begin to learn both how to bridge that gap for them and how they are handling these issues currently. 


### Research questions
1. Future Feature consideration: 
    -   What features would users like to see prioritized based upon the following issues: the ability         to provide users with sign in related information, problem escalation, password reset, and             account creation?
2. What are the primary pain points that exist around sign in related issues with users?
3. How are users currently addressing and navigating these tasks?


### Hypothesis
1.  Users will appreciate that chatbot is attempting to handle issues related to sign in and they will     be happy with the flows that we propose to help address their issues.
2.  Users currently go to a variety of sources to find information on and troubleshoot their issues.


## Method	
This usability study will be conducted remotely via Zoom with participants and will consist of semi-structured interviews and usability testing prototypes.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
I would like Perigean recruiting to schedule 12 participants in order to achieve 8 completed sessions. I would like all participants to be veterans. 

### Recruitment criteria
Add the total requested number, ideal completed sessions and breakdown type of participants for this study. 

`Ex. TR: 10; CS: 6; Vets: 5; Fam: 0; Care: 5; Serv: 0`

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|       12        |        8          |    12    |             |          |               | 


### Criteria Table 
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

- If this is for a single study, breakdown your total requested participants for each category by number--***not percentage*** in the single study column. 
- ***This will be applied across particpant types you need*** (*Veterans, caregivers, etc.*) for all categories (*Sex, race, etc*) you select. 
- For example, if you request 10 particpants, for 5 Veterans, and 5 caregivers, you could ask for 5 males, 5 females, and Perigean will apply those numbers across those two particpant types. Do the same for any other category you want Perigean to use for recruitment.  
- If you're using cohorts, ***Perigean will not exceed*** nine participants per cohort to avoid PRA (Paperwork Reduction Act).

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

### Screener

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)
