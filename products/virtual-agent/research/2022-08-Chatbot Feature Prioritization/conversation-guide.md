### Day of the session

Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).



### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*



## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Kiera] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple additional observers during this session?

- If participant does not consent, use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If participant consents, admit observers. 
   - Ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [an hour].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

Awesome, before we begin I want to let you know how the session will go. This session will consist of three tasks that I will ask you to complete. For the first task I will share my screen and grab your feedback throughout the task. Then for the last tasks I will provide you with links to access different prototypes that I will ask you to engage with. I will also ask that you share your screen and narrate your thoughts as you go through the prototypes. 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
