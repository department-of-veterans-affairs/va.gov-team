The various call center data from ID.me, MHV, and VA.gov   would have to be verified due to different flagging/categorization of sign in   issues in these systems. 	| Helps folks self-service bad   sign-in/sign-up experience(s) across VA.gov + password resets. 	| All Veterans\|Everyone 	| No 	| Existing 	| One would assume it could be a   generic response back to the user with a FAQ, phone numbers during business   hours, etc... Ideally, there would be a way for the user questions to   escalate and be piped into a ticketing system that the call center(s) can handle   accordingly.<br>     <br>     The end goal would be a way for a user to reset their password from the   chatbot, but I recognize how EXTREMELY complicated. 	| There are a few things that come   to mind - <br>     - Login.gov launching on VA.gov (Login + ID.me will be preferred Credential   Service Providers based on user research)<br>     - Influx of user sign-ins to VA.gov by having eBenefits + MHV point to   va.gov/sign-in<br>     - The rollout of the dependent user role<br>     - Potential Technology Modernization Funding request to add gasoline to the   Identity fire. 	| Various laws/mandates/etc affect   how our Veterans, caregivers, beneficiaries, etc access VA web properties. I   don't want to place a correlation between the two and it being an urgent   issue - rather, it seems like a potential low-hanging fruit. 	| Increased frustration +   disappointment in the VA for a poor experience. 	| No idea.

| 25 	| Utah 	| Completed 	| VFS - Public Website Team 	| Initiation thought was to add a   chatbot to the R&S library to help connect users to connected Tier 1   benefit hubs.  Also might have some   viability in adding Chatbot to benefit hub pages as a way to help Veterans better   navigate content and lead to a more streamlined Tier 1 benefit application   process.  	| These are conceptual, really   need to spend some time lining out Problem space and determining solutions as   they relate to Chatbot client.  	| We hypothesize that this could   drastically improve connecting Veterans from content rich pages to a Tier 1   benefit action in order to better align Veterans with the help they need and   deserve.   	| All Veterans 	| No 	| Future 	| R&S is still in beta which   lends itself to a more viable test ground before content threshold is met and   beta is released.  	| Working Benefit hub refactor   which could play a part in this concept.   	| N/A 	| N/A 	| Daily visits are now 19K+ 	| Yes, its been a discussion with   team involvement along with backlog tickets. 	| No 	| No 	| N/A 	| Would likely require a   conversation and roundtable review in order to determine if our hypothesis   fits with in the scope of chatbot capabilities.
