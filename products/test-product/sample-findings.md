# Streamlining Claim Appeal Status Experience

Date: 2025-09-10

## Key Findings
- Users struggle to locate the decision letter download entry point when multiple appeals exist.
- Terminology mismatch between "decision" and "determination" increases confusion.
- Long loading states without feedback reduce trust; users refresh prematurely.
- Mobile users abandon at a higher rate on the document detail screen ( +18% vs desktop ).
- Clearer grouping of evidence items improves scannability.

## Methods
Mixed methods: task-based moderated sessions (n=7), heuristic review, analytics funnel comparison (last 30 days), support ticket theme review.

## Recommendations
1. Introduce progressive disclosure for historical decisions.
2. Add skeleton + percent loader for document generation steps.
3. Harmonize terminology to "decision letter" throughout flow.
4. Provide explicit file size + format prior to download.
5. Consolidate evidence items into collapsible categories.

## Next Steps
- Prototype navigation adjustments.
- Run unmoderated validation (n=30) focusing on findability.
- Partner with content for terminology alignment review.
