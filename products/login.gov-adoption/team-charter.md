# Login.gov Adoption team charter

## What we strive for

The fragmented sign-in experience is confusing for Veterans and non-Veterans faced with multiple pathways and credential options. Further, the credential options are insecure, non-compliant, have poor user experience, or are expensive. VA needs a streamlined way for Veterans to sign-in and securely access products and services.

**Vision**
- One sign-on to access all products and services.
- Veteran choice of “public” or “private” credential option for VA.gov

**How**
- Use human-centered design to consolidate ways to sign on to VA.gov
- Migrate users to their choice of Login.gov or ID.me; robust, compliant credential solutions

**Why**
- Users are frustrated and confused because they must go to multiple websites for benefits
- Multiple ways to sign on adds to the confusion
- Current sign on options have usability, security, and compliance issues

## Workflow and cadences

### Stand-up: People & product check-ins

This is a daily team meeting at 10:00 am ET. We use this meeting to share updates about what we did yesterday, what we will do today, and any blockers. It helps us start the day in alignment.

### Sprint planning

This is a bi-weekly meeting on the 1st Thursday of every sprint. It lasts up to 4 hours. We use this meeting to outline team and member focus, dicuss and estimate user stories, and set goals for sprint.

### Refinement

Thi is a bi-weekly meeting on the 2nd Thursday of every sprint. It lasts up to 2 hours. We use this meeting to assess and update workloads for the remainder of sprint and loosely discuss next/future sprint(s). To do this, we walk through each team member's Zenhub tickets to make sure tickets are ready to be discussed by sprint planning. By the end of refinement:
- 100% of tickets have are associated with an epic.
- 100% of tickets have acceptance criteria.
- 100% of tickets are appropriately labeled.

We each review `needs-grooming` tickets within our associated discipline (determined by the right GitHub label e.g. `frontend`) before refinement.

### Sprint review 

This is a bi-weekly meeting on the 2nd Wednesday of every sprint during which the team shows what was accomplished, while the stakeholders provide feedback. It is timeboxed to 2 hours. We use this meeting to review completed work and determine whether additional changes are needed.  

### Retro

This is a bi-weekly meeting on the 2nd Wednesday of every sprint. It is timeboxed at 1.5 hours. We use this meeting to review our processes and identify opportunities to improve them.

## Issue documentation

### Issue creation

You can create issues for yourself or the team throughout the sprint. We'll use refinement to get tickets ready to go before they are put in the "Current Sprint" column on our [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/logingov-adoption-team-632280b31e745000136a61fc/board) board.

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “[Standard Issue / User Story Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=standard-issue.md&title=)”):
- Estimate
- Title that explains the task
- Description that includes background
- Labels (An issue should be tagged 'login.gov-adoption' as well as other labels)
- User story, goal, acceptance criteria are filled out (These will be revised by the PM as necessary)
- Epic assigned
- Milestone
  
### Estimation

Estimation is based on a few factors: how long something will take to complete, risk, Level of Effort (LOE), and complexity. We have found [this scale](https://www.scalablepath.com/blog/agile-points-explained-fibonacci-sequence/) to be helpful in estimating tickets.

 - 1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly   
 - 2 - Mostly known, doable
 - 3 - Becoming complex, maybe be 2 - 3 days of work 
 - 5 - More complex, may take a full week   
 - 8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories      

### Issue validation 

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new 'RED LIGHT URGENT' work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint.
 
## Team norms

### Shared principles

- Be respectful to each other and our collaborators
- Have your camera on when possible
- Speak up and make room for others' voices
- Stay flexible but intentional in the way we work
- Have fun and do great work!

### Logistics

- Keep Slack conversations in public channels where possible, to minimize duplicative and missed communication.
- GitHub is our single source of truth. All work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are important to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
- Our tickets and issues need to have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
