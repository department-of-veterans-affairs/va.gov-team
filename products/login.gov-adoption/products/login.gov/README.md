# Adoption Outline

---

## Overview
Currently, there are multiple ways to sign on and access VA services. These login options do not all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. The Login.gov adoption team aims to consolidate the pathways to sign in to VA.gov and provide Login.gov as a credential option while eliminating duplicative and non-compliant legacy credentials. 

- One sign-on to access all products and services. Veteran choice of “public” or “private” credential option for VA.gov (Login.gov or ID.me).
- All users will be migrated from legacy MHV and DS Logon credentials.
- Veteran users who can't identity proof online can visit VAMCs to do so or have a remote video option.
- Veteran users who are already visiting VAMCs regularly will be guided to create a Login.gov account and proof in person with coordinators.
- Military personnel will be able to proof in person as part of the TAP curriculum and will have a proofed Login.gov account before they transition off active duty.


## Problem Statement
The fragmented sign-in experience is confusing for Veterans and non-Veterans faced with multiple pathways and credential options. Further, the credential options are insecure, non-compliant, have poor user experience, or are expensive. VA needs a streamlined way for Veterans to sign-in and securely access products and services. 

The External Facing Identity Strategy is focused on consolidating the pathways to sign-in to VA.gov and provide Login.gov as a credential option while eliminating duplicative and non-compliant legacy credentials. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- A Veteran user will have more seamless and secure access to not only VA services, but other government agencies that use Login.gov. Their accounts and experience will be more secure and satisfying. 
- For MHV users, they will be able to receive in-person help for signing up for Login.gov and identity proofing. This will ease the transition from using the legacy MHV credential and maintain their access to services. 
- For new Veterans transitioning from the Department of Defense, they will not have to create a DS Logon account or deal with the poor user experience, only to be told that they need to transition to a new credential because DS Logon will eventually go away. They will be given a modern, easy to use credential more in line with their expectations and be fully identity proofed before they leave active duty.

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increase the speed of implementation of the CX EO, “the deprecation of outdated and duplicative credentials” represented by MHV and DS Logon. 
- Increased security of MFA and compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance for Identity
- The VA will no longer have to pay for DS Logon, MHV will not have to devote personnel to maintaining their credential
- Reduced fraud
- Increased user satisfaction

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* [Login Metrics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/dashboard/I6gZ1NVTT6ujnnu4hU1KLA/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.dateOption=last30days/)
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
