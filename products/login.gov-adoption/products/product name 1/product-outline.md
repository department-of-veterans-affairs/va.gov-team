# Product Outline

---

## Overview
*One sign-on to access all products and services, with a choice between a public or private credential option.*

## Problem Statement
The fragmented sign-in experience is confusing for Veterans and non-Veterans faced with multiple pathways and credential options. Further, the credential options are insecure, non-compliant, have poor user experience, or are expensive. VA needs a streamlined way for Veterans to sign-in and securely access products and services. 

The External Facing Identity Strategy is focused on consolidating the pathways to sign-in to VA.gov and provide Login.gov as a credential option while eliminating duplicative and non-compliant legacy credentials. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- A Veteran user will have more seamless and secure access to not only VA services, but other government agencies that use Login.gov. Their accounts and experience will be more secure and satisfying. 
- For MHV users, they will be able to receive in-person help for signing up for Login.gov and identity proofing. This will ease the transition from using the legacy MHV credential and maintain their access to services. 
- For new Veterans transitioning from the Department of Defense, they will not have to create a DS Logon account or deal with the poor user experience, only to be told that they need to transition to a new credential because DS Logon will eventually go away. They will be given a modern, easy to use credential more in line with their expectations and be fully identity proofed before they leave active duty.

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increase the speed of implementation of the CX EO, “the deprecation of outdated and duplicative credentials” represented by MHV and DS Logon. 
- Increased security of MFA and compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance for Identity
- The VA will no longer have to pay for DS Logon, MHV will not have to devote personnel to maintaining their credential
- Reduced fraud
- Increased user satisfaction
