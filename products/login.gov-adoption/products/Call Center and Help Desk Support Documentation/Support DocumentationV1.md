Preparing for Sign In Changes at VA Overview
What sign in changes are happening on VA.gov?
In the coming year* all VA websites will follow a new sign-in process through VA.gov with Login.gov as the recommended account and ID.me as additional option for signing in.  Veterans will need to sign in using one of these two account types that meet our new, stronger security requirements. 

To prepare for these changes, Veterans who only have a My HealtheVet or DS Logon account are being encouraged to create a Login.gov or ID.me account and sign in with one of these accounts next time they need to access or manage their VA benefits and healthcare online. Veterans who already have an existing Login.gov or ID.me account are being encouraged to get in the habit of using those accounts to sign in to VA.gov now. 

Veterans will receive a series of messages via two main methods to inform them of the upcoming changes: 
Email Campaign Communications
Sign-In page updates

Email Campaign Communications will be tailored to two audiences:
Veterans who have not created a Login.gov or ID.me account
Veterans who have created a login.gov or ID.me account but their last log on was with their DSL or MHV account
The following section on Email Communications will show what type of messaging Veterans will see if they do or do not already have a login.gov or ID.me account.

All visitors to VA.gov will see the same sign in page updates, regardless if they already have a login.gov or ID.me account.

Email Communications 
Veterans will receive regular emails starting in August 2023 to encourage them to create a Login.gov or ID.me account or sign in with one of these accounts if they already have access.

Email Communications for Veterans who have not created a Login.gov or ID.me account

Account Creation & Usage
Should I create a Login.gov or ID.me account to sign in to VA.gov?
We encourage you to create a Login.gov account.   
In the coming year all VA websites will follow a new sign-in process through VA.gov with Login.gov as the recommended account. 
Login.gov is a secure U.S. government account that meets modern security standards. You can use Login.gov to access VA benefits, services, and information in a single, secure account. And you can use your account to manage other government benefits and services (like Social Security benefits and federal job applications). 
You can also choose to create an ID.me account. 
ID.me is a commercially-owned account that also meets modern security standards. You can use your ID.me account to manage VA and other government benefits and services. 

How do I create a Login.gov account?
You can create your account on the Login.gov website. (secure.login.gov)
Here’s what you’ll need to create your account: 
An email address 
A unique password that includes at least 12 characters 
When you set up your account, you’ll need to set up multi factor authentication. 
You’ll need to choose at least 1 of these authentication options: 
Entering a security code from your authentication application 
Using your security key 
Entering a security code that you receive by text or by phone call 
Entering a backup code 
Using your federal government employee or military ID (PIV or CAC) 
The first time you sign in to VA.gov with your Login.gov account, we’ll ask you to verify your identity.  
Here’s what you’ll need to verify your identity: 
Your driver’s license or non-driver’s license state-issued ID, and  
Your Social Security number, and  
A phone number on a phone plan that’s in your name 
I could not create a Login.gov account, what should I do?
You can call the login.gov Help Line 24/7 at 800-698-2411, and select 0 (TTY: 711). We’re here 24/7. You can also try creating an account with ID.me from the VA.gov sign in page instead. (https://api.id.me/en/session/new)
What’s multifactor authentication and why does VA.gov use it?
Multifactor authentication is an extra layer of protection on your account. It helps us make sure that it’s you trying to access your account—and not a hacker. It’s also sometimes called 2-factor authentication.
Each time you sign in to a VA website or app, you’ll use multifactor authentication to verify you’re you. You’ll do this using a device that only you should have, such as your mobile phone. 
You’ll get a unique code by text message or phone call, or through another option you choose. Other options may include a supporting app like Google Authenticator, a security key, or backup codes. You’ll then enter that code to access your account. 
This way, even if someone were to guess or steal your username and password, multifactor authentication can stop them from accessing your account. 
How can I get help with creating an account?
If you need help creating a Login.gov account, you can call the Login.gov help center at 844-875-6446 (TTY: 711). They’re open 24/7. You can also submit a help ticket on the Login.gov website.
How do I create an ID.me account?
You can create your account on the ID.me website. 
Here’s what you’ll need to create your account: 
An email address
A unique password that includes at least 8 characters 
The first time you use your account to manage your VA benefits or information, you’ll need to verify your identity. 
Here’s what you’ll need to verify your identity:
A phone number in your name
A government-issued photo ID, like a driver’s license, state ID, passport, or passport card
