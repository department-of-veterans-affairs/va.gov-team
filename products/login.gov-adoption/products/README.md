## Overview

Currently there are multiple ways to sign on and access VA services. These login options do not all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion.The Login.gov adoption team aims to consolidate the pathways to sign-in to VA.gov and provide Login.gov as a credential option while eliminating duplicative and non-compliant legacy credentials. (for more on our vision and mission, see the [team charter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/charter.md). This product outline goes into detail around the goals, thinking, and metrics that guide our work.  

## User problem statements 

- **As a Veteran, I want only one sign-on to access all VA products and services.**
- **As a Veteran, I want to be able to receive in-person help for signing up for Login.gov and identity proofing which will ease the transition from using legacy credentials while maintaining my access to services.**
- **As a new Veteran, I want to be given a modern, easy to use credential and be fully identity proofed before leaving active duty.**
- **As a Veteran, I want to be able to give others differing levels of access to my account, so I can empower them to provide greater care and support to me.**
- **As a Veteran, I struggle with using Multi-Factor Authentication and remembering passwords.**

## Business goals 

- One sign-on to access all products and services. Veteran choice of “public” or “private” credential option for VA.gov (Login.gov or ID.me).
- Veteran users that cannot identity proof through Login.gov will be able to visit an MHV Coordinator to do so or have a remote video option.
- Veteran users that are already visiting MHV coordinators regularly will be guided to create a Login.gov account and proof in person with coordinators.
- Military personnel will be able to proof in person as part of the TAP curriculum and will have a proofed Login.gov account before they transition off active duty.
- Non-Veteran users will be able to sign-in and access the products and services they need for their specific roles.
- All users will be migrated from legacy MHV and DS Logon credentials, although this may not completely occur within this task orders Period of Performance (PoP).
- Pilot use of fast identity online (FIDO) security keys for users that struggle with Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)

## Requirements and Constraints 

### Requirements

- Our work will be guided by our [vision, mission, and north star objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/charter.md#vision).
- Our work will put veterans first.
- Our work will consider the full veteran experience — from logged out to logged in, from online to offline.
- When we know information about veterans, we'll elevate it and present it to them in a way that helps them understand their experience and complete tasks.
- We will work to grow the design system so it better accomodates authenticated tools, flows, and use cases.

### Constraints

#### Data
- Data in the VA is complicated and all over the place. Different information is stored across hundreds of databases and is often duplicative or conflicting.
- We don't have all of the data we want, and we may not be able to get it because it the information isn't digital or is in a database that is a mess/unreliable/will be eventually sunset.

#### Design

- TBD 

## Value Propositions  

Creating a cohesive logged-in experience will:

- Help veterans complete tasks more quickly.
- Increase veteran satisfaction with the VA.
- Reduce the need for multiple touchpoints (other VA websites; VA call centers).
- Help veterans get benefits more quickly.

## KPIs 

We can measure we have moved in the right direction by measuring logins on VA.gov, CSP usage, and Login.gov adoption counts.
