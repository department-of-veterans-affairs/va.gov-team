## Overview
The Login.gov Adopion team aims to drive adoption for safer, more secure sign in options to VA services. This will be achieved through multiple initiatives.

## Priorities
Top-level strategic priorities:
1. messaging to increase proactive Login.gov adoption
2. transitioning users to Login.gov from existing My HealtheVet and DS Logon accounts, also known as “inherited proofing” (DSL being #1 priority)
3. providing support with a human touch to facilitate the migration (in-person proofing capabilities at VAMCs (VA Medical Centers))
4. shared access for non-Veteran users on VA.gov
5. pilot the use of security keys for users that struggle with online MFA (multi-factor authentication) methods

## Product outlines 

## [#1 - There can only be one](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/product%20name%201)
Currently there are multiple ways to sign on and access VA services. These login options do not all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. The Login.gov adoption team aims to consolidate the pathways to sign-in to VA.gov and provide Login.gov as a credential option while eliminating duplicative and non-compliant legacy credentials. 
### Vision
- One sign-on to access all products and services. Veteran choice of “public” or “private” credential option for VA.gov (Login.gov or ID.me).
- All users will be migrated from legacy MHV and DS Logon credentials.
- Veteran users who can't identity proof online will be able to visit VAMCs to do so or have a remote video option.
- Veteran users who are already visiting VAMCs regularly will be guided to create a Login.gov account and proof in person with coordinators.
- Military personnel will be able to proof in person as part of the TAP curriculum and will have a proofed Login.gov account before they transition off active duty.
### Desired user outcomes
- A Veteran user will have more seamless and secure access to not only VA services, but other government agencies that use Login.gov. Their accounts and experience will be more secure and satisfying.
- A Veteran user  will be able to receive in-person help for signing up for Login.gov and identity proofing. This will ease the transition from using the legacy credentials and maintain their access to services.
- For new Veterans transitioning from the Department of Defense, they will not have to create a DS Logon account or deal with the poor user experience, only to be told that they need to transition to a new credential because DS Logon will eventually go away. They will be given a modern, easy to use credential more in line with their expectations and be fully identity proofed before they leave active duty.
### User problem statements
- As a Veteran, I want only one sign-on to access all VA products and services.
- As a Veteran, I want to be able to receive in-person help for signing up for Login.gov and identity proofing.
- As a new Veteran, I want to be given a modern, easy-to-use credential before leaving active duty.
- As a Veteran, I want to be able to give others differing levels of access to my account, so I can empower them to provide greater care and support to me.
- As a Veteran, I struggle with using Multi-Factor Authentication and remembering passwords.
- As a Veteran, I need to understand Login.gov and its benefits, so that I know why I should set up Login.gov as my primary or additional credential.
- As a Veteran, I need to understand how to set up Login.gov, so that I can try and set up Login.gov on my own termsAs a Veteran, I need to know where to go for help if I face an issue while setting up Login.gov, so that I can finish setting up Login.gov.


### Potential MVP features and epics
- Veterans visiting VAMCs will be able to complete sign up for a Login.gov account.
- MHV coordinators or VHIC Associates will be able to verify a Veteran’s identity through an in-person visit or remotely through video.
- Service members going through TAP can sign up for a Login.gov account and proof in-person as part of the process.
- Outreach to existing users that they’ll need to choose a new credential.

## [#2 - The NVURending story](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/product%20name%202)  
Currently there is not a unified definition for each of the non-Veteran customer types at the VA. Each administration — VHA, VBA, and NCA — has their own unique definitions and nuances, which increases the complexity of implementing non-Veteran user roles on VA.gov. Delegates, beneficiaries, caregivers, and dependents are a few terms used interchangeably that encompass many different user types relying on many different products and services across VA. VA.gov will need to transition from exclusively serving Veterans to serving a wider audience, such as caregivers, spouses, partners, POAs, VSOs, etc.
### Vision
- Non-Veteran users will be able to sign-in and access the products and services they need for their specific roles.
### Desired user outcomes
- For Non-Veteran users, they will be provided with access to Vets' shared account data via their own accounts, which will allow them to provide superior care and support.
- Veterans can login and manage varying access roles for trusted associates and knowledgable buddies.
### User problem statements
- As a Veteran, I want to be able to give others differing levels of access to my account, so I can empower them to provide greater care and support to me.

## Requirements and Constraints 

### Requirements

- Our work will be guided by our [vision, mission, and north star objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/team-charter.md#product-vision).
- Our work will put Veterans first.
- Our work will consider the full Veteran experience — from logged out to logged in, from online to offline.
- When we know information about Veterans, we'll elevate it and present it to them in a way that helps them understand their experience and complete tasks.
- We will work to grow the design system so it better accomodates authenticated tools, flows, and use cases.

### Constraints

#### Data
- Data in the VA is complicated and all over the place. Different information is stored across hundreds of databases and is often duplicative or conflicting.
- We don’t have access to all user account data, and we may not be able to get it because it the information isn't digital or is in a external database that we do not have access to.


#### Design

- TBD 

## Value Propositions  

Creating a cohesive logged-in experience will:

- Help Veterans complete tasks more quickly.
- Increase Veteran satisfaction with the VA.
- Reduce the need for multiple touchpoints (other VA websites; VA call centers).
- Help Veterans get benefits more quickly.

## KPIs 

- TBD
- Increase completion percentage of the sign in flow.
- We can measure we have moved in the right direction by measuring logins on VA.gov, Success rate for MFA, CSP usage, and Login.gov adoption counts.
