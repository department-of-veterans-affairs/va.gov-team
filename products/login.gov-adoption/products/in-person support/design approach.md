# In-person proofing: Design approach

Last updated: `@tygindraux` on May 1, 2023 

## Background

Many Veterans are uncomfortable or unfamiliar with remote identity verification. The number of controls required in NIST 800-63 when identity proofing remotely presents significant challenges for Veterans. Right now, around 45% of Veterans fail remote proofing with Login.gov.

Additionally, right now Login.gov offers an in-person support pathway at USPS. But this is currently offered as a backup, not a primary method of identity verification.

The VA has a relationship with Veterans which can be leveraged to provide convenient in-person proofing, in addition to USPS locations. In-person verification should be simple, secure, and privacy preserving.

## Design approach

In December, we completed a [discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research) that helped us gain a deeper understanding of Veterans and their needs. It also helped us develop [hypotheses](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/in-person%20support/product-brief.md) for how to solve problems.

This next phase will focus on prototyping and testing hypotheses, with the goal of defining a minimum viable service. By the end of this design phase we should understand:
- what the service will and won’t do
- how we will build and deliver parts of the service
- which services and systems we need to integrate with and how
- how we might pilot the service
- who we need to pilot the service, and what training and processes they might need

### Initial scoping

Product and development have started initial scoping of this phase, including tech spikes and additional research to de-risk solutions. We should do initial scoping to inform design work, too.

#### This will include:
- meeting with MHV coordinators to learn more about their current experiences (training, systems and processes) and hopes and fears about running this service in the future
- reviewing analogous services, such as Real ID, to understand how others solve similar problems
- reviewing [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research) as needed

### Prototyping

Next, we will prototype the service or parts of the service so we can test ideas with Veterans and staff.

#### This will include:
- creating a service blueprint that describes what the service is and how it works, building off our review of analogous services, our discovery blueprint and additional stakeholder interviews as needed
- identifying concepts within the service that we can prototype and test, for example, a trusted referee portal or the discovery stage of the journey
- prototyping concepts

### Testing

After we’ve identified and prototyped parts of the services that we should test, we will make a plan for and do research with Veterans and staff who deliver the service.

#### This will include:
- writing a research plan that lets us test parts of the service with Veterans and staff, including a plan for recruitment and travel
- doing research with Veterans and staff to answer research questions
- defining recommendations based on the research insights, that shape the next stage of work

## Principles and vision

We will follow these principles when we design this service:
- Prioritize identity over a standard
- Identity in the context of community
- Differentiate between identity verification and an identity credential
- Iterate over time

Additionally, we will work towards this product vision:
- Enabling a platform over standalone flows
- Standalone process as well as a complement / fallback
- A path for all, regardless of starting point (credential)

This document is a suggestion, to be reviewed by product. It's based on our notional roadmap, which isn't public yet. It also references [this product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/in-person%20support/product-brief.md) and initial scoping conversations between product and design.
