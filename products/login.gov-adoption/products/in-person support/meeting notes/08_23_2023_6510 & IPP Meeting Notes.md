### Date: 08/23/23
### Attendees:
Porta, Head of Digital Solutions, porta@themostudio.com
Tom Black, Product Owner, Veteran digital identity, VA OCTO, Thomas.Black2@va.gov
Sophia Philip, Design Lead, sophia@themostudio.com

### Agenda: 
Meeting Notes
- Clarifying 6510 Directive:
  - Originates from NIST
  - Sets requirements
  - Gets feedback
  - OMB through A11 (or 280) circular-> you have to do what NIST says
  - VA also writes their own directives and references OMB, more so to cover all the bases and is all inclusive
- “Black line” version
  - Process to update
  - We should feel empowered to change guidance
- Identity and external with CTO are experts
- TB: Get documents Tom mentioned about external Identity
- See if we can be involved in revising
- NIST; can we use MPI as an authoritative source for Veteran data?
  - Mentions in guidance VHIC as an identification card 
  - Tom has questions about quality of data collection and storage
    - Attribute validation through DEERS (Which may also be VADIR) which is a source that MPI calls from
    - Quality of VHIC maintenance and issuance may not be reliable, consistent and secure enough given how cards may have been issued 10 years ago versus now. 
    - MPI service doc review to look at correlation score source as possible means to discern quality of data in MPI
  - Possibly exchange ICN for EDIPI for other attributes
    - Tom needs to verify these exist
- Need to do holistic audit of data and how it fits into process
- What else is needed, depending on Identity, to cover minimal requirements
  - Because of Login.gov, that is why SSN is needed
- Explore VA commitments on TMF side, not just for IPP but beyond
  - Review roadmap

### Action Items:
- **Tom Black**:
  - Verify if there is a possibility to exchange ICN for EDIPI for other attributes
  - Share documents on external Identity with Porta and Sophia (if any outside of 6510/handbook)
- Porta and Sophia:
  - Schedule follow up with Tom to discuss VA roadmap relative to TMF commitments
  - Review 6510 Blackline version handbook and direction

### Next Steps:
- Assess policy criteria for 6510 relative to IPP
