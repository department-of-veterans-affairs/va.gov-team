## VHIC and VIC Discovery for In-Person Proofing

*Updated as of 10/02/2023*

### Overview
Discovery research was conducted to understand the feasibilty of using VHIC and VIC cards as forms of identity documentation in In-Person Proofing within the Identity toolkit for Login.gov. These forms of identification were selected given the assumption that expanding the options of identity documents for in-person proofing may ease barriers for Veterans to complete identity verification in person. Secondary research and meetings with internal VA stakeholders were conducted to confirm our hypothesis and help inform next steps in integrating VHIC or VIC cards as a component of in-person proofing for Login.gov Adoption. 

### Hypothesis  

VHIC or VIC cards can make it easier for Veterans to complete in person identity proofiing because they are more widely held and can serve as authoritative identity document. 

### Stakeholder Discovery

#### 08/11/2023-VHIC/VIC Discussion (Zoom Meeting with Login.gov Stakeholders)  

##### Overview and Findings
Initiate conversations with Login.gov stakeholders to understand level of knowledge around VHIC and VIC as a valid form of identification for identity proofing. Discovered that many do not understand the difference between VHIC and VIC cards, the level of authentication done to obtain either thus their security as a viable form of identification documents, and the quantity in ciruclation. Follow up secondary research needed with VA stakeholders to answer these questions.

#### 08/14/2023-Login.gov Exploring VHIC and VIC with VA Stakeholders (Email)

##### Overview and Findings
All initial VA stakeholders assumed or known to be knowledgedeable of VIC or VHIC cards were contacted to determine if VHIC and VHIC were verified and distributed in a manner that would ensure they are authoritative identificatino documents, as well as the magnitude in circululation. A VBASPT stakeholder recommended against VIC as an ID for proofing purposes of identity for Login.gov because VIC does not do any in-person proofing and is only used as validation of Veteran status to partake in discounts at private retailers. Validation from an identity purpose is only through the login credentials used to access VIC. The VIC application process itself askes for a current government ID only to ensure the personal photo being applied to the VIC matches their government identification. As for the VIC card itself, the photo on the VIC does not align to the same guidelines required for other official government identification cards, such as the VHIC, driver’s licenses, or passports. Additionally, VBASPT's office is looking to see if the legislative requirement for a photo on the card can be amended. Given this feedback, the decision was made to continue research into the feasibilty of only VHIC cards. A smaller group of VHIC specific stakeholders were identified for a follow up conversation. 

#### 08/21/2023-VHIC Data Follow Up (Email)

##### Overview and Findings
The individuals identified as key VHIC stakeholders who would have access to more information on VHIC were emailed to confirm if they could be used as authoritative identity documentation and how many were in circulation. Follow up messages were sent to the group on 8/24/2023 and 8/30/2023; no responses received. 

#### 08/28/2023-Secondary Research 
OCTO Data was found on the magnitude of VHIC Cards provided in FY19 and FY20 and will be used to inform next steps. Login.gov Adoption team will verify the use of VHIC cards with NIST and 6510 specifications.

#### 09/29/2023 VHIC Stakeholder Teams Meeting
LGA and IPP Overview:
Modernize sign in process, work with MHV team and VA.gov 
Team is building a service for IPP, working with Login.gov to do this migration to use Login.gov to log into VA.gov 
In order for them to do this they need an IAL2 account 
The verification process for proofing remotely is fraught with issues
We are starting the pilot with VA 
Hosting the sign up process at a lot of VA facilities
Work with staff that already have access to the application
Strong desire to have VHIC as an ID that we support 
The varied formats of VHIC makes this very difficult

Edward: Use the Identity Toolkit or use the ID?

Kirk: We will use the ID, like a DL to assert identity
None of the VHIC cards have an address 
The VHIC has been used quote unquote as an ID, to check in and things and it has morphed into 
Used to get on a DoD installation, used to board a Plane
Does not fall into the traditional pathway for ID use
Just added an expiration recently, prior cards did not expire
Working to have it removed from approved IDs for TSA
Any DoD commander on the base can deny access to those using that ID type 

Tom addressing Edward: “Its interesting to see how you view the ID and your perspective.” Edward: “It has snowballed into something larger, this is not our mission and it's hard to enroll in a new process. It's a membership card really and has morphed into an ID. They used it to get discounts. Well if I can use it at the VA, why not get on a plane.”

Tom: “Its interesting that we want to use it as another ID and you are moving away from that”
Having to increase the rigor related to identity proofing. There are executive orders and other things at play. 
Should it be used as an ID, and if so is it rigorous enough. Consider us in the exploration phase. Maybe we can use some pieces from VHIC, so it is part of a larger paperwork around proving identity. 

Edward: “We are constantly torn between, VA employees wanting to issue a VHIC to someone who is homeless. They do not have an address or DL, but we want to get them medical services. We are in the process of reissuing VHIC for folks in the wildfire, we are running into issues since many are using the VHIC to prove identity to get a new VHIC card. In the field they may issue, but now that has been centralized.
Using VHIC in some capacity, perhaps as part of other parcel of documents to prove identity. I would like to work together. 
VHIC coupled with Identity Toolkit - could meet this requirement
They are still using Black and White photos
10 year expiration 
SSN was in the strip, that has been removed and they use a USER ID
Service connected, branch of service, 
Purple heart recipient
MVI and receive those designations
Lots of experations will be coming next year, lots of people will not renew and lots of people will continue to use them to get services even though they are expired. 
2014 started the newest VHIC proofing process, VAMSI, CBOT
Self service portal to do Level 2 
Federal issued ID
VIC - issues by VEO 
Completely different, one is mandated statutorily by congress, the other is not
90% who have VHIC have another ID, but the homeless 
The ideal outreach would be to give them Federal or State ID, and not do this work around with VHIC

Edward: If we increase the variety of ID types, then we increase the Veteran population who has access to services, 
State ID is the ‘gold standard’
If we accept Passport, well they have State ID so not getting any value there
Focus on the underserved population instead
At some point VEO would take over, where we have one standard ID to rule them all
When you try to move forward you will run into a lot of roadblocks, long term they want that, but short term lets solve problems with the current programs. 
We have made changes to support the ID concept, but we need to draw the line somewhere. We will keep the features that we have, but as for new features there is some uncertainty there.

Final outcome: Using VHIC does not seem feasible for the Pilot. Edward is interested in following up on the MVP so we can see if we can use the VHIC as a complementary piece of evidence
