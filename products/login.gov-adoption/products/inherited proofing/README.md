# Inherited proofing outline

## Overview


## Problem Statement
**As a** VA.gov user
**I want** to use modern, secure Credential Service Providers (CSPs)
**So that** I can ensure that my information is safe when accessing VA services.

As we continue to evolve the VA.gov ecosystem, legacy Credential Service Providers (CSP's) do not meet customer experience and security objectives prioritized by the administration in the EO on improving customer experience.  We need to migrate users to newer CSP's that do meet these objectives.  In this specific instance, we are working to move select DS Logon users to Login.gov without the need to reverify their identities.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

Eligible users should be able to easily move their verified identity from DS Logon to Login.gov.

## Undesired User Outcomes

Eligible users are unable to easily complete the migration process.

## Desired Business Outcomes

It is a desire that all of eligible DS Logon users have migrated to Login.gov by September 30, 2023

## Undesired Business Outcomes

Eligible users are still utilizing DS Logon as a CSP after September 1, 2023

## Solution Narrative
Our solution involves providing guidance to users who utilize DSL as their primary CSP (Credential Service Provider) to access VA services.  This includes notifying them of the change via physical and electronic mail, as well as through modals and other methods on VA.gov.  In addition, we will strive to provide information on why this transition is happening, how to identity proof, and why they should do so. 

### Current Status
We are currently engaged in active research regarding the modal experience for eligible and ineligible veterans.
