### Transcript

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000

> M: I started recording, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000

> P4: Yes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000

> I'd like to start by learning more a little bit about your experience with the VA and some of our online services. How long have you been a veteran?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000

> Since 1990.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000

> Okay. And how often do you go online to access and manage your Va benefits and healthcare?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000

> At least once a month, but sometimes 3 to 4 times a week.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000

> Okay. When what makes that change that you visit more frequently?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000

> So there is a couple of reasons why I would visit more frequently. One would be because I have a you know, a medical concern that comes up and I'm trying to figure out which position to go to our trying to get a consultant to see a physician I schedule an appointment. Another might be, because I have outside doctors who, because of continuum care, it's changed. The name has changed so I don't know what it is, but it's outside the VA. They may have something else that they need me to do, and I need to coordinate that back with my doctor, or whoever I'm seeing.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000

> It sounds like, you're managing a lot of a lot of your healthcare online a lot.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000

> Yeah, so, yeah, the blood work. So all the you know. Prescriptions, trying to get them refilled. So all of those things I pretty much prefer to do things online versus physically go in the VA or to call. I always have preferred that, and I've pushed to use that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000

> Great. Well, do you remember the last time that you signed in?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000

> Maybe last week.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000

> Okay. And do you remember why you were signing in that?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000

> I don't remember. No, not right off of my head. Yeah.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000

> That's okay. But probably one of those healthcare tasks like refilling a prescription.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000

> Maybe. I think it was to reach out to my doctor. It might have been because I had a VA appointment and it was virtual. But I don't remember if that was it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000

> That's okay. Yeah. How do you sign into the VA?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000

> So sometimes, that's a problem. So there's like it changed. It's a new thing. And it went to like... there's 4 different ways you can do it. You can do My Vet or ID.me, or something.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000

> So there's 4 different things to use. Which one do you use?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000

> I have started to use the one that lets me into the system which is ID.me. It's connected to my Google, which has been authenticated through multiple processes, and probably the most up to date. The others work sometimes. They'll let me in to sign in. But then there's like some other steps. There's multiple other pieces that have to be done.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:20.000

> And once it gets to a certain point, it only allows me in to only certain things, and I don't remember what. But I use secure chat a lot. So I have to have something that's gonna let me look at my records look at my pharmacy stuff and then still be able to write to my doctor in a secure chat.

> I don't wanna have to log into something, do one thing and then log out of it and log into something else, and then I can do something else. I wanna be able to do all of those things at one time.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000

> Yeah, you wanna be able to do everything in one place. It sounds like the different logins, are you using them for different VA services?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000

> Yeah, I guess that's it. I mean, I guess if I pulled it up I would be able to tell you better. But just from memory, that's what I'm remembering. I know the the one that like is ID.me because it's set up with Google. It's authenticated through Google and so I click one button it does whatever it's doing in the background. And then once opens, I'm in, I can pretty much do everything.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000

> So yeah, ID.me is the one that's working the best for you lately.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000

> I think so, and I think I can't remember the other one. There's another one that I use to look at my benefits.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000

> Do you know if that one might be your DSL?

> Yeah. I feel like that's the one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000

> Okay. Well, we're gonna be talking about those today. Yeah, so I'd like to share some ideas with you so we can get your feedback. I'm gonna send you a link to the prototype. As I mentioned earlier, the prototype is like a pretend version of the VA website. So it's going to look similar. But it won't work as you might. So I'm gonna send this to you in the chat. And let me know when you open that.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000

> Perfect.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:39.000

> So now that we're looking at this page, I'd like to start by imagining that you've come to online to VA.gov to send a chat to your doctor, and first you need to sign in. Can you tell me what you would do first?

> I'd click this button here. [sign in button]

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000

> Okay, let's go ahead and do that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000

> And before we click anything, can you tell me what you would do next if you were signing in?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000

> So, now that I'm looking at it, I'm not sure if I use ID.me or Login.gov. Because both of these work for me, but I'll do this one. Okay. So ID.me should be the one that comes up with my Google. But it may not work in this.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.000

> Well, today, we're gonna imagine that you're signing in with that DSL credential that you mentioned that you sometimes use. So let's click sign in and we'll click continue and let's pretend that you entered in your username and password and you can click login.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000

> Okay. And before we read this in detail, can you describe to me what you're looking at?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000

> [as soon as modal opens up, they click 'close' and try to close the modal]

> It says create a Login.gov account. So do I need to go back one? To create one? So, it's telling me that it's gonna stop working for digital tools and so it's like saying that I have to like VA only Login.gov account without any need... VA Digital Tools? I don't know It just said it just said it at the top so then I was like, okay, I need to create that. Because what I've come to realize with these systems, if you keep going ignoring it and ignoring it. Then, at some point you can't get into any of the systems.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000

> Is this something that you've run into before? Yes, actually I did. I kept ignoring it. I was like, oh, I'll do it another time. I'll do it another time. And then that's when I guess you were reformatting it because the buttons looked different, and so you could choose which one you wanted to do before. But it wasn't, they weren't stacked like that. They were I guess up at the top. So when you click into the thing, it would be like MHV or the blue button was down here.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000

> Okay.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000

> There were all of the buttons. Things were different, so you could choose it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000

> Initially when it said this is going away, you need to create some other stuff for the systems or whatever, I was like yeah, okay, I don't need that right now. I just need to go in and get my stuff. I don't have time. 

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000

> But then I had a unique situation happen where I was, in the system, declared deceased. I don't know why that happened. I just know it happened and so I've been trying like making sure that all of my stuff is up to date now, cause I don't want that to be the issue.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:12.000

> So let's imagine that you're in that scenario where we're you've come to a lot to VA.gov to message your doctor, and after you've signed in with your DSL credential, you've come to this. What would you do next?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000

> Probably be best for me to read it all the way to the end. That would probably be the best thing to do.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000

> After you finish reading it. Can you summarize what you've read to me?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:58.000

> Okay. So it's this particular log on that's gonna stop working for the VA digital tools. And so I can create a Login.gov, it's gonna only work for the VA Digital Tools. And then, if I use it on other government sites, I'm gonna have to like re-verify my identity again. So each time I use it, I have to verify my identity. That's what I'm getting from this.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:41.000

> So you're reading this. And every time that you that you have to use a Login.gov account, you'll have to re verify your account.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000

> To sign in, yeah, you'd have to. I don't know yet, but I would presume that to sign in once. It's already been once I've set up the account. Then it's verifying that I am who I say I am, that's gonna happen every time. So like with anything a password. And my email address and as long as those things are right, then I can go on.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:26.000

> I'm sure when in the system, it'll work. Once I create it. But it's like if I log out and log back in feel like that's what I have to do. Do it over again.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000

> So what does verifying your account mean to you?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:47.000

> Verifying my account or authenticating, it is usually verifying my identity that I am the rightful user of that – that I have the appropriate identity based information to get access to that account.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000

> Do you have any initial questions after you've read this modal?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:29.000

> I guess it was the one thing that threw me off was VA Digital Tools. I just didn't have a a previous association with that name, and so that probably was the only thing that made me kind of like hesitant about the information. Creating a VA-only login makes sense because you don't want to have a login that you create, that works across multiple government systems. Cause you wanna have your HIPPA controlled content over here, separate from anything else, just in case happen. So you wanna have some type of safeguards to protect your data.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:16.000

> In this scenario when you first saw this model, would you close it if you first saw it?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000

> That's what I was saying. Yes, I would have closed it. Yeah, it's absolutely out of habit. Because I did read that first line. It says, soon, tools soon, and I was like, stop working soon. Okay, so this is not something I need to work out right now. But having a date, maybe to say, the soon is July 3rd. These systems have to be, you know, updated, or whatever like that gives like a heads up like, don't play with this. You can close it now, but you gotta do it. You know it's you know there's a sense of urgency.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:15.000

> So if you saw this today, you would not be interested in setting up a login account right now. 

> Correct. Because usually I'm coming online to do something very quickly. I gotta get into something to give to a doctor or something. So I'm not typically having time to like do this. And I don't know what this would look like on my phone, which is probably how I would have access to anyway.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000

> Can you tell me more about it that if you saw this on your phone?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000

> I would close it cause that cause it's too cumbersome to. Like the fields on the entry on a lot of those things are just not set up to, you know. If it's a number, you know it doesn't go to the number pad or the data padding is still like you have to use the number from this, and like some of the little boxes, are hard to determine like what exactly needs to go there. It just doesn't. It doesn't always work. Well. It's not always user friendly. The user interface within the way that it. You know, a structure is, can be a problem.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000

> So I'll be like, oh, I'll just do it later. And especially if I'm on the go, I'm on my mobile. I'm just trying to get a message or send something, and I don't even remember if I've had problems to send messages, I feel like there was something that happened once or twice, so try to do everything on my laptop.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000

> Yeah. So if you saw this on your mobile, you would close it and wait to do it later on.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000

> Yeah.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:22.000

> Okay, do you have any hesitations about setting up a login account?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000

> As a general consumer, yes. I'm like, why, what's happening with the other information? But for me, I'm like this is just a new system, it's just what's happening. I wouldn't think it was fake, because I already have seen VA. I'm always looking at the website before I get on. You know, like to check to see that it's not some phishing or some other thing I'm always like, okay, so pop-up came up like, is this the real website? Is this something else? So I would have already paid attention to that, so that wouldn't be like on my mind if I was on the VA.gov site. For me, it would be just be time. It would just be like, how long is this? Is this gonna take me 15 min, 40 min, an hour and 20 min? Am I gonna have to have 5 different pieces of information? Is it just gonna be my name... I don't know enough about what is it's gonna take to actually accomplish this.

> And if it's it says a few minutes. I mean, I'm a disabled Veteran. So a few minutes. For whom?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:06.000

> Thanks for that. Why do you think the VA is recommending that you set up a Login.gov?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000

> More likely than not that there's a some safety protocols that have been incorporated into this. And so there, trying to get everybody on the same system or same thing and it's easier to do it this way than to back end. Try to fix stuff. That would just be my speculation, or that there's a completely new system that everyone's being integrated to.

> It's not another thing to be a working on, like a new platform. We're just getting a new way to access it. To me those are different kind of different things.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000

> Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Okay, great today. Let's imagine that you're going to set up that login of account. And as we go through the next couple of screens, I'd like for you to describe out loud what you would do next, and if you have a question or something interest you, let me, what would you do next?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000

> I would enter my email address...

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000

> [interrupted] I'm sorry. Let's do create an account.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000

> Yeah.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000

> Okay. Well, I have a account already, but so, I would create an account, I'd click the button. So do I do that, or do I just tell you?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000

> Yes, yes, let's go ahead and create an account.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000

> And so I would enter my email address and then choose my language. My email address, and then I would read the rules of use. I would loosely read them, because they're usually very long, and then I would accept that. I read them and could push, continue.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000

> Okay, great. Let's do that. Let's I think, either press continue, or that check box. I think.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000

> I'm seeing, this is, check your email. And then so I would click that and then confirm your email. Then I would just go into my, I guess this would be in my email, yeah, that would be my email box. So we confirm the email address.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000

> So on that check your email page. Would you be checking your email on your phone or on your desktop?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000

> I would probably initially be checking my phone, like, if I was doing this, and it's asking me to change the password. I would be on my desktop because I wouldn't be trying to do this on my phone. I've just thought about... So we're setting up a new password. Yeah, I would be doing that on my desktop.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:49.000

> Okay, okay, great. So let's pretend that you've created a strong password and click.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000

> [sighs when they see MFA]

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000

> What's that mean?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000

> It's just like, it's just the way it looks. I don't know for me, I guess, having everything in like one little thing where I don't have to scroll it up, and all that other stuff I mean. That's too much to read. It's not a big but it was just like... Okay, the voice, backup codes. These are my options. And face or touch unlock face. Okay?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:39.000

> Yeah. Are you familiar with any of these? Which one would you most likely pick?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000

> So I prefer the thumb touch.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000

> Yeah, we can go ahead and set that one click, that one.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000

> So initially, when you saw this page this it was more like, 'Oh, I have to scroll through all of this,' but we are there any other concerns?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000

> And I have to make a decision, and then, like security key, like, I don't know what that is. I don't remember that. And then I definitely know I'm not playing with the backup codes because I've gotten locked out of my stuff with that. And then the authentication application is great. As long as your phone is not a problem. So it's like I was just like weighing like which one of these worst case scenario I'm locked out of my phone. This is a thing cause if you're locked at of your phone and you have settings on your phone that you know you have to be at your, you know, at your IP in, or whatever it's called. And it becomes difficult to get in it.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000

> So I was just kind of going like which one is gonna the easiest, especially with working with the VA. Or without some other system. But this I think, I think touch is fine or text or voice. Either of those are fine. Maybe I'll just chat text or voice.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000

> Okay, yeah, whichever one you would like to do today.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000

> Yeah, let's do text to voice and press continue.

> And then pretend that a code was sent to you, and then say, send code.

> Okay, let's press. Submit.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000

> Okay, okay. Just asking for a second one as a backup.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000

> And so what would my second method be?

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000

> Yes, today we're not gonna add a second one. But yeah, it seems like you seem to be pleased with that page.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:13.000

> Yeah, I think sometimes like I said, if you get in a pickle, it's just great to have a different way, like there's one that's like easy my thumb boom. I did that. But then something might not be working on your phone or you know, or you may not have access to face recognition on a device or something.  so now you can't get into it. So there's it's always great to have to have more than one that you can choose at the at the time. You're doing whatever you're doing like. Oh, for school, we have the same thing like like, when I'm on my laptop. I can use my phone. I have the macbook pro I can use my thumb to authenticate, and then, you know, but I can also text or have a so it makes it easier, so that if something's going on like I'm in a place where a phone call definitely cannot happen right, like I have an ability to just get a text, you know.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:17.000

> So what do you think that in this scenario you would go set up a backup authentication method in this time?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000

> Okay. Yeah.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:29.000

> At this time. Yeah. Great. Well, in this case, we're not going to we're gonna pretend that we that we didn't. So we're gonna skip that.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:41.000

> Oh, it says it's a picture of somebody smiling with a check, a green check, and it says your account setup is complete. And that it's gonna share the information with the VA, my email address and VA will only use the information to connect to your account.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000

> And what do you think this means?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000

> That I'm done with like setting it up. Just need to agree. That's okay. And then I'll continue.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000

> And what do you expect to happen when you click, agree and continue?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000

> That I can get into my account that I get into my VA tools account. Is that what it's called?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000

> What does va digital tools mean to you?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000

> Yeah, I'm not really sure. Digital, it means that it's, you know, that there's some type of electronic process. And then I guess the tools part some type of resource to help me get my into my information. So again at the beginning I wasn't really sure. That was the thing that slowed me down the most. How that language connected to what I was trying to do.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:12.000

> Okay, yeah, thanks for that. Okay, let's press agree and continue and see where we end up.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000

> Go ahead and read through the screen and tell me what you think.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:32.000

> It just says that I've logged in with for all VA digital tools. And it says that I have a VA only login.gov account. And so that means and I guess, imagine I know that it means that that you can use Login.gov go for other websites. But if if I didn't have it already set up, I'm gonna have to set it up with those other sites to verify my identity.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000

> Can you tell me what what process we just went through?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:17.000

> I set up a new Login.gov accounts to be connected to my VA. Based on my VA, well, it says digital tools. But my VA account. And I basically went through and use my email and an authentication process to verify my identity, and connect the account to my VA account.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000

> And did we end up where you expected us to?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000

> Yeah.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000

> Yeah, okay, do you have any concerns about what just happened?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000

> No. But I'm probably an outlier, cause I'd I use technology a lot. So setting up accounts and just connecting, like kind of authenticating accounts like Google, you know, and things like that to get my passwords and get access to accounts. It's pretty standard for me, so I once I got over the language part, and the choosing of which to use to authenticate my identity. I was fine, but I would probably be somebody who's like more of a consumer of technology. And even I hesitated, so I don't know how someone who maybe doesn't use technology all the time are isn't quite sure of the safety of things. How they would approach it, how they would feel about the experience.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000

> Can you say more about your hesitation?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000

> The hesitation was like, I don't know language VA digital tools. I hadn't necessarily remembered seeing that. And also the way that the visual thing of the page was, I just scroll versus like little buttons. They were just all kind of like stacked you know in a small space. But you know those were the only like once I got over that and just looked at which one it was more of me trying to think through which one was gonna be the best, as like to mitigate any phone issues. If I was stranded somewhere, couldn't you know, verify it, or if I wanted to use my mobile device more now that I have this setup like I was trying to like, think through that process. And maybe having some bit of information about like how each of them works, like something that you can open if you're on a desktop, with what each one meant or does.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000

> Okay, today, we acted like you don't have a Login.gov account, but it sounds like you might already have one. If you saw this message that pop up asking asking you to set up a Login.gov account, how would you react?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000

> Since I already have one, yeah, I'd be like, no, this isn't right. And then I would go back. I would completely close down my browser and then go back in, and then, just like check the cookies or whatever, and delete them like that. I would probably be concerned that something else is wrong.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:41.000

> Okay. So if you saw this message, if you saw a message asking you to set up a Login.gov account and you already have one, you would think that something was wrong.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000

> Yeah, I would think I would again hesitate. Look at the browser, see, did I go to the right web? And then, like, go back, and you know delete my cookies, and then go back in again and see if it comes up again. If it came up again. Okay, it's probably nothing. It's probably just a generic pop up. Yeah.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:13.000

> Okay. Great. So we've already closed that modal. Let's now click up in the dark blue area.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:26.000

> Let's pretend that you that it's been a couple of months since the last time you signed in.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:36.000

> Show me how you would sign in again. Or sign in that next time that you come in to VA.gov.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000

> Doesn't matter what I'm trying to do or does it?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:38:00.000

> Let's use that same task from before that. You're going to chat with your doctor.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000

> Well, I would just have click this, 'send a secure message,' cause that's what I wanna make sure that I'm doing. So I would click, go to the, and it would take me to whatever sign on.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000

> Okay. Yeah.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000

> And then like I said, I typically use ID.me. But now you know hmm, now, knowing that the Login.gov is cool, I would use it.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000

> Well, I use Login.gov for other things. I use it for U.S.A. Jobs. And there's something else I use it for. That's the only one I can think of right off the top of my head.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000

> Then ID.me. I know I use it for that one, for sure. A bunch of little different things, because my Veterans discounts and stuff like that when I go shopping like I have to use those to authenticate that I'm a veteran, and they're all tied together for like shopping. They give me a discount for purchasing, and so I use ID.me.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:36.000

> That makes sense. So in this instance, how would you sign in pretending that after you've created that account?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000

> Yes, login.gov.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000

> Okay. And why would you do that?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:00.000

> I mean, cause I've set it up now, and I know that it works, and it's going to connect me to my VA, all of the the different areas in my VA account.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000

> Okay, great. So let's what would you do here if you came to this page?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000

> I'd enter my email address, enter my password. Then I will sign in.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000

> Let's pretend that you've done that. And before we read this in detail, can you describe to me what you're looking at now?

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000

> It says verify your Login.gov account for use outside the VA. It says estimated time 20 min, and there's what I need to do that. So I would look at it and say, do I have those things and do I have time to do it? Those would be the 2 things I'd want to know, which is great. It says the time, and it has what I need to actually accomplish it.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000

> So why do you think this appeared on your screen?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000

> Because I've already created the account with the VA. It's already established and verified. And now it's given me opportunity to do the same with outside the VA.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:50.000

> Okay, yeah, do you have any initial questions after reading that?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:01.000

> Yeah, probably. What accounts? Because if I'm somebody who's not looking to get employed, U.S.A. jobs is off the top of my head the only one I could think of right at this moment, but I'm sure there's others. So having knowing what those other accounts are, and it be useful for me.

> My dad is like 73. If I help him set his up, he's gonna ask me, why do I need to set up another? Some other thing, when I only need to get into the VA.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000

> I would be like, okay, I wouldn't have an answer for you.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000

> Yeah. What would you tell him?

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000

> I cause I didn't have enough information. I wouldn't be able to tell him anything which is not what I would do, when I'm helping him set up anything before I even walk into the house I'd try to have a list of the different agencies that he can use this login with. And then I would probably check off the ones for him, that he'd use. 'No, I don't want that. Yeah I want that.' Then I would say, we, there's 6 of these on here, Dad it's gonna be better for you to just go ahead and do this, because you know.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.000

> But if I went down the list and he said he didn't need anything but the VA. I don't know that I would do it.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000

> How about yourself with? Would you choose to?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:48.000

> Yes, because things change pretty rapidly, and just because the is something that I'm not doing right at that moment doesn't mean it won't be something that I that would come along, that it made sense to already have it done.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:04.000

> Okay, yeah. So you would do it in this in the same time period as you were like chatting with the doctor.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000

> Yeah. Well, yeah, like, if I was just looking for my like, I went into look at my information, and this was already like I said, and I had the time and the documentation. Then, yeah, I would do it.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000

> Why do you think the VA is recommending that you upgrade your account?

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000

> I just think it's like I said before, just the system there's some system changes. And so maybe they want us all to be on this new system. And they just wanna upgrade t the way people access the the the VA digital tools.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000

> Okay. If you chose not to upgrade your account what do you think will happen?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000

> I don't know. I guess I just like I'm reading deeper. It says Federal job application. Social security benefits. Then it will just be a bit more difficult to get into those pages.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000

> Okay, if you had a question about this screen, what would you do?

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000

> I'm not sure I don't see any anything. Yeah, I'm not sure. I think I would just close it.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000

> We covered a lot today I'd like to spend a couple of minutes kind of reflecting on what you saw before we wrap up. Can you summarize what it is that you did today as you click through that prototype?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000

> I set up my initially the VA only Login.gov account to get access to the VA digital tools, which is my VA account. So I've followed a few steps, added my email and got an authentication code in my email. Click, the link from the email. And it updated, I guess, verified that I was oh, I missed a step. Initially, when I started the account, I sent my email up, and then the next screen was to decide how I wanted to verify my identity, and that's what I chose. Text, and it sent me an email. And then I went through the process.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:45.000

> Okay, out of everything that you looked at today. Is there anything that's stick out to you now?

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000

> No, nothing that sticks out. No. I mean down here where it says other manage other government benefits and services. You know, like social security benefits and Federal job applications, and that maybe being bold like Login.gov, or something cause I didn't originally see that cause. I was saying I'd like to have a list of things, you know, but those are 2 big ones that most of that Veterans will, you know, want to have an account to get access to.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000

> Is there anything else that we could do to make it easier for you to set up a login account to use with the Vm.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000

> No, I think that's it. I think it's pretty easy, and I think as long as how it functions on the website on a desktop on a laptop and on a mobile device, are all user friendly like you don't have to go through any major challenges to like use it. I think that's that's the only thing I would say.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:21.000

> Okay, okay, thanks for that. You can stop sharing your screen if you'd like.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000

> I'd like to make sure it's clear that everything we did today is not real. So you haven't actually set up a login account account, although it sounds like you have one, but you don't have to change the way that you sign into VA.gov. You can keep doing everything as you normally have been.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000

> Perigean will send you a thank you note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other Veterans to provide them with a chance to participate in future research studies. Thank you.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000

> Yeah, that'd be great. Is it alright to share with my – I have a non profit for women Veterans – is it okay to share that on there?

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000

> Yeah, I'm sure that's that's totally fine.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000

> Okay, that'd be great.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000

> Alright! Thank you. We're done all right. Bye!

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000

> Great thanks, so much thanks for all you feedback.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:32.000

> Okay. You, too.
