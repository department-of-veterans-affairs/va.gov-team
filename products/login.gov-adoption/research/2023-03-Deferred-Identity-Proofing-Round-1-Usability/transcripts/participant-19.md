00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000

> Okay, so I've started the recording. I just want to confirm if you're comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000

> You have my consent.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000

> Thank you, alrighty! I mentioned that we're thinking a lot about how people sign in and access some of our online services at the VA. So I want to learn a little bit more about your experience with that before we start looking at that prototype.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000

> Well, first of all, how long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000

> I was discharged in 91.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000

> Okay. So it's been quite a while. Have you been using our online services for about that long or?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000

> Probably not until 2007.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000

> Okay. Yeah, that's good memory. And do you remember what started you off when you decided to go online And do some of the things that you do with the Va.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000

> Secure messaging. Eases communication with my VA providers, and I like keeping track of my prescriptions.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And so we're you introduced to that while you were at a VA healthcare facility?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000

> No, I had to scope it out on my own.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000

> Gotcha. Okay. And so messaging your doctor was one example that you gave is that something that you still do regularly?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000

> On a regular basis. Yes.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000

> Okay, when you're doing something like that, what website do you usually type in to message your documents?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000

> I go to Google, and then I might type in my healthy vet, and I only use my healthy vet. There are 3 signing options, and I only use my healthy vet. There's always some issue with the other 2.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Gotcha. Okay. Do you remember what the other 2 are called?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I don't. If you want me to go to my phone, I can look them up.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000

Don't worry. I was just curious. Sometimes it's hard to remember the different options, especially if they're the ones you aren't using.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000

> Correct.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000

> So you usually will sign in on my healthy vet, and then you use that my healthy bet sign an option.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000

> Correct.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.000

> Have you ever been to another VA website?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000

> Yes, for benefits, and for something with education, and it was not a user friendly experience.

[participant takes a break]

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:44.000

> Great. Okay. So you were talking about how my healthy bet is a little bit easier to use than E-bits, where you access your benefits and then use another website for education things.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000

> Yeah, that must have been the VA benefits as well. I don't know.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000

> Yeah, okay. Let's talk about the benefits website. So when you're on the benefits website, how are you signing into that website?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000

> But let's not even try that, because it must be oh, my gosh! 5 or 6 years, so I don't remember.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:22.000

> Okay, that's all right. Well, I think we might jog a little bit of your memory today in the conversation, especially when we start using that prototype. So let's go ahead and start with that. Okay, so I'm gonna send you a link in this zoom chat.

[screen share troubleshooting] 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:35.000

> I'd like you to imagine that you've just received this email from the VA. I'm gonna give you a second to read this more closely now, and when you're finished I'd like for you to summarize to me what you just read.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.000

> Okay, they're gonna make yet another change, and I probably would have deleted this by now.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000

> Okay, tell me more about that. Why would you have deleted it?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:08.000

> Because I am satisfied with logging on straight to my healthy vet, and that it's that simple.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000

> Yeah. Gotcha. Okay? So you feel like you've got a system that's working for you. So if the Va. Tells you to do something differently, you're like Nope, I'm good.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000

> Yup!

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000

> Yeah, okay, so this this first sentence says, DS Logon will stop working for VA digital tools soon. What's Ds log on?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000

> I have no clue. Not a clue.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:42.000

> Okay, and what about va, digital tools? Okay? So let's pretend like this sentence said, my healthy vet will stop working for Va digital tools soon. What would your reaction be?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000

> Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, my healthy vet will stop working for VA digital tools? Is that what you said?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000

> Yeah, so that's not what it says, but tell me what your reaction would be if that's what it said.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000

> That I'm very angry, because now I'll be spending a lot of time on the phone. Sending messages to my doctors through a real live person. Which is, which is a big waste of my time as well as the real life person.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:25.000

> Right? Yeah, I totally get that what if it said my healthy vet will no longer be a sign in option for Va digital tools Soon. Would that change anything?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000

> Ditto to what I just said. I'm 63 years old. I finally figured out how to use my healthy vet, and I have had the same log in and password for as long as I've had the account, and I'm not changing, end of discussion.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.000

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I definitely understand that I'm no longer able to see your screen I think you're still on the line with me. Oh, there you are. Okay. Alrighty. Let's I'm not able to see your screen, but I think you're probably able to see the website still, right?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000

> I'm still seeing 'Dear Martha Ds login will stop working for Va digital tools, soon.'

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000

> Okay. Alright. So what we're gonna do is I'm not gonna make you share your screen again. I'm just gonna let you look through it. But you're just gonna have to tell me what you're looking at. Every once in a while. Okay, so sounds like, we're still looking at the email. Let's look at that second paragraph. It says Login, Gov is an easy to use. Secure us government account. Have you heard of login.gov?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000

> Yeah. And I trust the Federal Government as far as I can throw them. And know I haven't heard of Login.gov. And I already have, like 18 different passwords. So I really don't give a rats ass if it's easy to use and secure cause the end of discussion.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000

> Yeah, yeah, I totally get that. So you don't trust things that are provided by the government, and you have a lot of different accounts already. So this is not something that you're thinking about for much longer.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000

> Bingo!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000

> Okay, that makes sense. So what we're gonna do today. And you're just gonna have to bear with me. You're going to continue and you're gonna set up a login.gov account.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000

> Wait a minute. So you want me hit that blue box where it says, go to va.gov to create an account?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000

> Yeah, that's sounds right. Let's go ahead and click on that.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:54.000

> And like I said at the beginning, this is just a prototype. So we're not gonna be entering any information or creating an account. Today, we're gonna pretend like we are. Alright, so tell me what you're looking at now.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.000

> Sign in, red box, Login.gov, green box, ID.me, blue box DS Logon, blue box, my healthy vet. I would punch my healthy vet.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000

> Okay. So you're used to my healthy vet, does this page look familiar?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000

> It looks like the one that always gives me trouble when I go to my healthy vet.com on a Google.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000

> Okay. Gotcha. Okay? So it looks familiar, and it usually gives you trouble. But you know you would click on my healthy that.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000

> Yeah.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000

> Gotcha. Okay. If I told you that we needed to set up a login.gov account, what would you do on this page?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000

> Oh, wait a minute. I hit something in it went too far.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000

> That's okay. What's the page look like?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000

> Let's see, maybe wait a minute.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:05.000

> So I have options at the bottom create account. So if you tell me that if I don't create a DS Logon account they're going to kill me, I would go to the box that says, create account.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000

> Okay. This is might be a little bit of a curve ball for you. But we're gonna pretend like we're signing in with Ds log on today. So I'm gonna let you click on that Ds Logon Button. And then once we click on that, it says, username and password, right so we're gonna click, we're just gonna click login. We don't need to type in any information. Okay, so what's the page you're looking at now?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000

> You are about to navigate away from va.gov.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000

> Okay, what's that mean?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000

> What an excellent question! I don't know, and I don't care.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:06.000

> Okay, okay, if you were on the Va website site and you saw something like this, would you have any concerns?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000

> I would log out and start again with my healthy vet.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000

> Okay, gotcha. So we're gonna keep pushing through. And we're gonna click. Continue to login.gov, okay?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000

> Can you log in? Okay? Now, it's asking me for my email and password.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000

> Okay, what? What account is this? Who's asking me for your email address and password?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000

> The VA Login.gov.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000

> Okay. Gotcha. So the Va. Wants you to set up this account with the Vi right?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000

> Correct, correct.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:48.000

> Okay, alrighty. So based on you and your experience, in which accounts that you know you have right now, would you be able to sign in here?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000

> No, because I don't use an email to sign in. Therefore I wouldn't know the password.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000

> Gotcha. Okay? So you think you probably have an account? But you don't use an email to get into your account.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000

> That is correct.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000

> Gotcha! Alright! So what we're gonna click on next is create an account. We're gonna pretend like you don't have an account.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000

> Okay, so I hit create an account. And it doesn't do anything. Okay. Now, it does enter my email. Do you want my actual email?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000

> No, we don't need to enter any information today. But what's helpful is if you just talk me through what you're seeing here.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000

> So what would you do if you saw this page? And you were setting up an account?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000

> Enter my email address.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000

> Yeah, okay. And then, what would you do after that?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000

> Hit continue. Well, no, I need to hit the little box that said I read next set the login.gov rules of use. Then I would hit, continue.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and do that. We'll click the little box and then we'll click Continue, and then you'll just have to let me know what you're seeing on your screen next.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000

> Check my email at martha@gmail.com.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000

> Okay, why is it asking you to check your email?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000

> Because it sent the link to set up the account to my email.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000

> Gotcha. Okay, is this something you've done before?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000

> Yes.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000

> Okay. Alrighty. So let's click on check email. We'll click on that blue button. We're gonna pretend like you're receiving an email.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000

> Okay, so. Confirm your email. Okay, do you want me to confirm email address?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:42.000

> Well, first of all is this email looking familiar? Would you have any questions if you saw an email like this?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000

> It would go to my trash it because I've been spammed, and I've been hacked, and I'm very sceptical.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000

> Yeah, okay, so you would delete it?

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000

> Yeah, go straight to the trash.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000

> Okay. Alrighty. Well, let's click on confirm email address. We're gonna pretend, like we're continuing to set up this account. And what are we seeing now?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000

> Create a strong password, it must be at least 12 characters, not a commonly used word.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.000

> Okay, so when you're setting up passwords for accounts that you have right now, or that you need to create now, do you have any hesitancies or frustrations with setting up and using passwords?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000

> Actually I have the same password for all 18 accounts. Okay. So probably if you saw a screen like this, you would say, I know what password I usually use. I'm gonna put it in here, and then I'm gonna click continnue.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000

> Correct.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000

> Gotcha. Alright! Let's do that. We'll pretend, like you put in your password that you usually use, and we'll click, continue.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000

> Oh, God! Here we go with authentication, face or touch, unlock security, key. I don't know what that is. Government employee. I'm not a government employee. Authentication application. I don't know what that means. Text or voice, message. Thsi does not to be need to be more complicated. Backup codes a list of 10 codes you can printer saved here to when you use the last. No, I'm just gonna stop using my healthy vet and use the telephone instead.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000

> Okay. So you're seeing this page, you're going through the list. A lot of these are looking not familiar, and your reaction is like no I'm not doing this?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000

> Exactly. You want me to hit continue, anyway, right?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000

> Well, unfortunately, yes. But first we we actually need to choose an option. So of all the options you mentioned, you kind of gave your thoughts on each one which one do you think you would choose?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000

> Text.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000

> Okay, let's click on text. Okay? And then we're gonna click. Continue.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000

> Right.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000

> And then tell me what you're seeing on this page.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:26.000

> Add your security code via text message or phone call. We'll send you a security code each time you sign in message and data rates may apply. Please do not use web based phone services.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000

> Okay, have you done something like this before?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000

> Amazon does it, and Paypal does it to me all the time.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000

> Okay, so familiar with it. Maybe not loving that you have to do it for these other services.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000

> Right.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000

> But it's something that you kind of know how it works right.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000

> Correct.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000

> Okay, so what we'll do is we'll pretend, like you put your phone number in and then you're gonna choose text message. It sounds like. And then we would pretend like a code is being sent to you. Okay? So you can click, send code. Alright! And then we'll pretend like that. Codes gonna go in here. So you would type that in where would you get that code from to type in?

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000

> On my text. You've added your first authentication method. Add a second method as a back up. Alright.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000

> So when you're reading that, does this feel like it's an option or something you have to do.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000

> You've added your first and add a backup – needs contingency plan. So it's an option.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000

> Okay, so do you think this is something that you would choose to set up?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000

> No!

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000

> Okay. So what would you do if you didn't wanna set up a second method?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000

> Skip for now. Your account setup is complete.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:06.000

> So before we click ahead, are you still looking at this page that says your account setup is complete?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000

> Correct.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.000

> Okay, let's talk about this for a second. So what type of account have you just set up hypothetically?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000

> I don't have a clue. Well, it must be DS Logon.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000

> Okay. Gotcha. So it's not super clear. But you think it might be Ds log on that You just set up an account for.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000

> And that smiling, happy person at the top really makes me wonder what the hell is this? And what are they trying to get out of me?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000

> Okay, so a little bit. Not enjoying the icon of the person smiling and not super clear, what's going on?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000

> It's like when when men in Africa are trying to get money out of me and they send me Facebook friend requests they always pick the most attractive photographs. And that's why this photo or this woman with the big smile makes me a little bit suspicious.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:26.000

> Okay. So seeing someone who's maybe overly happy at the end of setting up your account has meet, you feel a little suspicious.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000

> Yes.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000

> Okay, okay. So it says, Yeah, go ahead.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:39.000

> And wait, and I think it might be a little bit helpful if it said your Ds Logon account set up is complete.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000

> So you could confirm, this is the type of account you've set up?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000

> Yeah.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000

> Gotcha. Yeah, I think that makes sense. And underneath that it says, we'll share this information with the Va. Why are they sharing information with the Va.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000

> Because of Hippa.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000

> Okay. And so when it's saying, we will share this information, who's we?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000

> It might be with civilian providers from whom I can receive care in the community. It might be with providers, where I've given permission, whatever permission it is to communicate with the VA.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:43.000

> Gotcha. Okay? So it could be a number of different kind of third parties. And you're basically agreeing for this information to be shared with the Va because of hipaa.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000

> Yeah. I don't know why else. It's just a legitimate disclaimer.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000

> Okay. So you think if you are reading this, even though things are not feeling super super clear about who is sharing information. And what account was set up? Do you think you'd probably click, agree, and continue?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000

> Because you're gonna tell me to agree and continue during this day.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000

> Okay. What if I wasn't here?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000

> But I'm firm in my position. That simple is better. And what I've been using has been secure. So why bother to reinvent the wheel?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.000

> Yeah, yeah, I totally get that like, it sounds like, we wouldn't have gotten like nowhere near this far, because you would have said, No, I use my healthy that it works for me. And I'm ignoring this. So I understand it's a yeah. Go ahead.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:48.000

> And if the login that I've used for the last 14 years is discontinued then I'm just gonna call the VA and leave old fashioned messages with my provider.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:01.000

> Gotcha. Okay? So you would. You wouldn't even choose to change your login method.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000

> Exactly. 

> You would say, Okay, I'm gonna go back to how it was before, when I didn't use secure messaging, and I'm just gonna call them yeah, that's really helpful to understand.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000

> Next we're gonna click agree and continue but before we do that. What do you think is gonna happen when we click that?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000

> I'm gonna get a link to my account.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000

> Okay, so you're gonna get a link to an account that you think is probably a Ds logon account. Okay?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000

> Yeah.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000

> Let's click agree and continue. And then what are you seeing on this page?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000

> You logged in with a login.gov.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000

> What's login? Gov?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000

> I don't know. I'd assume that it's something that VA employees can use as well as Veterans using whatever, like my healthy vet, or the benefits.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:12.000

> Okay. So it's something that you said VA employees, but also civilians are able to use this account in order to do things online.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000

> Correct.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000

> Okay, why is it telling you that you've signed in with login.gov?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000

> To let me know that I've signed in.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:34.000

> Okay, is it surprising if you're hearing that you've signed in with login.gov?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000

> I'm not familiar with this, so I don't feel like can fairly answer that question.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000

> Yeah, that's okay. That's a fair answer. So we're gonna read a little bit more closely. Now I'm just gonna give you a second to read that little text, and then, once you've finished that, let me know if anything is jumping out at you, or you have a question about anything.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000

> No, no questions.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000

> Okay. So I might just ask you a couple more questions. If that's okay.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000

> Sure!

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000

> So we can see here. It says, no, you currently have a Va only login.gov account.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000

> Okay.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000

> Why is it saying you have a Va only login account?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:21.000

> Oh, well, that must mean that. That's not the linkage with providers outside the Va.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000

> Okay. So you can only use your account with the Va.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000

> Whoops. I don't know. My screen would be fading, and I hit the screen, so I just lost.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000

> Oh, okay, that's okay. So is it just looking like it says my Va claims and appeals.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000

> Okay. Let's continue on. So we're gonna click at the top of the screen where it says, VA, so it's in that dark blue. Okay?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000

> Okay.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000

> And so does now this look like the homepage?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000

> Yeah, it depends. If I use my ipad, I get one option. If I use my phone, I get another one. If I use the desktop computer at the Va, it's different.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:15.000

> Alright. Well, what we're gonna do next is we're gonna pretend like you've just set up this login Gov account. Okay, you've use this login account to sign in once with the Va. And then a couple of weeks go by and you're gonna sign back into the Va. Okay. So we're gonna click sign in. I'll give you a second to find that sign in. 

> Search. It looks like I'm still signed. Oh, no, there it is.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000

> Here we go again. Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon, MHV. So you want me punch the red box?

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000

> I'm curious to know – Why do you think I want you to click the red box?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000

> Well, and I'm not sure cause we talked about DS Logon and we also talked about Login.gov. So I don't know.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000

> Yeah, so it's not really clear kind of what's going on and why we're talking about these 2 different logins.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000

> Correct.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. I can understand that. What made you kind of lean towards the red box?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000

> Well, cause it's red and red into his intended to catch someone's attention. And it's at the top.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000

> Okay. Well, let's click on login.Gov, and then we're seeing we're seeing a page that should say sign in right? Okay. And so we're not gonna enter any information here. But we're gonna click sign in. We're gonna pretend like we're signing in with the login.gov account. Okay. And then you're gonna see a new page that has a bit more.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000

> There we go verify your login.gov. Yes, okay.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000

> Okay, perfect. So there's a little bit more text on this page. So I'm gonna give you a second to read it, and then I'll ask you a couple questions before we wrap up.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:16.000

> Digital tools. 

> Is the objective that I can also log in to like the IRS with the same login.gov?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000

> Potentially what's making you feel like that might be an option? Can you tell me what sentence that you're reading?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000

> Because I like to solve puzzle and my son is an epidemiologist. So I'm just taking a guess other than that. I can't tell you.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000

> Yeah, okay, okay, so you're kind of guessing.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000

> Wait. Because 'Your identity has been verified. Blah blah like social security benefits and Federal job applications.'

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000

> Yeah, so you feel like that's kind of confirming what you just said about the IRS?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000

> Yes.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:26.000

> Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So it's feeling kind of clear that maybe you could use your login Gov account for things like the Aud or social security. What would you need to do in order to use your login.gov Account for those things.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000

> I would need my state issued ID, social security number and phone number.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:50.000

> Okay. And what would you? What are you imagining? It's gonna happen if you click, verify your identity on login.gov, and we're not gonna click anything yet. But.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000

> Then I'm gonna get the eternal circle of death.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000

> Okay, is that the loading, the loading circle?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000

> The blue circle of death. Oh, my God! Yes!

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:11.000

> Okay. And if you didn't verify your identity, let's say you chose not to verify your identity. What do you think would happen? Based on what you're reading here?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000

> Only Va. Only I could probably get to my healthy vet.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000

> Okay? So you could probably get to my healthy vet, what about the Irs?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000

> If I verified my identity. Yeah?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000

> Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense. Okay? And I think this might be, you know, we're coming to the end of the session. So what's the difference between verifying your identity and then what we did before, what we did earlier in the conversation.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000

> I don't understand your question.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000

> Okay, that's okay. So earlier in the conversation, we put in your email address, you had to confirm your email address, set up text message, authentication. So what's the difference between doing all of that? And then what this screen is asking you to do?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000

> If I just wanna access my healthy vet, then I'm good to go. If I wanted to go to social security or IRS, then I have to have my driver's license and my phone number and my social security number.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000

> Okay. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Alrighty. So if you didn't want to see this information anymore, what would you do?

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000

> Hit the close.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000

> So it feels pretty simple to figure out how to get out of this information?

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000

> Yup!

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000

> Okay, perfect. So that's kind of the end of my questions on this prototype. So if it's simple enough, you're welcome to come back to the zoom app, and we can just have a chat to finish.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000

> Okay, wait. Give me a minute cause I do wanna zoom okay, there we go. Can Yup alright?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000

> Yup, I can see you, and I can hear you. You can still see me.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000

> Yup!

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000

> Okay, perfect. Well, thanks so much. I know it was a little bit of a struggle getting through the technical issues for both of us. But I think we did pretty well. We have a couple of minutes before we finish, so I'd love to just kind of reflect on what we've done today.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:40.000

> Can you summarize to me what you did today when you were clicking through those screens?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000

> I was a guinea pig in a prototype experiment.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000

> Okay. And in that experiment, what were you having to do?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000

> Set up a new account with a different password. Was it, Ds login or Login.gov? One of those.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000

> Okay. So you set up a new account with either login.gov or Ds log on, and then at the very end, what was the Va. Recommending to you, when they asked you to verify your Id. Why did they think that might be a good idea?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:27.000

> Because it gives me the opportunity to access other Federal government, whatever, through one password, and through one account.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000

> Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. So we did a lot of different things today. I asked you a lot of questions which I appreciate. If there was one thing that we could have done in all of those screens to make things easier for you.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000

> What would that have been?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000

> The face, that Smiley faces the first thing that comes to mind. It would be real easy for some individual with nefarious intent to develop another something or other like a US flag, or what dawned on me at first is that I do trust that Va logo, I've seen it so many times, and so when you're shifting from something that I'm familiar with to something that I'm skeptical of before. I even started you're gonna have a hard sell, anyway.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000

> Okay. So it felt a little bit unfamiliar. And you were kind of thinking. I want this to. Maybe be more about like the government right now.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000

> Yeah, yeah, that's fair.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000

> Do you have any questions for me as we wrap up?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000

> We'll do any of the interns. The 2 interns have any questions they want to ask.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000

> Well, they aren't interns actually. But let's see!

> Did you have questions for all 3 of us.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000

> Nope no questions.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000

> Okay. Well thank you. You are very clear with your thinking. I don't have any questions.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000

> Okay.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000

> Yeah, none either. Very useful insights. Thank you for your time.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000

> Oh, thank you!

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000

> Awesome. Well, thanks, just to wrap this up, we all really appreciate your time. This is kind of early days, which is why we're getting feedback from you. I do want to reassure you. That the way that you're signing into my healthy vet right now, using your my healthy, that sign in is still available. So if you went online tomorrow, don't stress, you can continue to use that sign in option.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000

> Okay. The other thing I wanted to make sure was clear is Perigean, the folks who set up this interview earlier. They're going to be the ones that manage payment for the interview. So if you have questions about how you're getting paid, you can ask them, and they should be really helpful and they're gonna also send you a little bit of a blurb that you can pass along to another veteran if they're interested in doing something like this.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000

> Okay. I think that's everything for me. Any other questions you wanted to ask me before we head out.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000

> No questions.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000

Okay well thank you so much!
