### Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000

> I've started recording I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000

> Yeah.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000

> Great. I'd like to start by learning a little bit more about your experience with the VA. And some of our online services. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000

> I've been a Veteran now... I think it's 38 years of service.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000

> Wow! That's incredible. How often do you go online to access and management your VA benefits and healthcare?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000

> At least, maybe once or twice a month, I go to the VA. I use the site to input my knowledge, go in and check MHV. I go in there to communicate with my primary physician about twice a month.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000

> Yeah, okay, that's great. Do you remember the last time you signed into the VA online?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000

> I was getting ready to sign in. I went in yesterday with my computer. About 2 weeks ago I had to go in and put some money in.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000

> Okay, so yesterday you we're trying to put in some mileage to get reimbursed.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000

> Yes, and the only thing the only thing about that – when you go in and put your mileage in. You have issues with putting your totals in.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000

> Okay. Yeah. How do you sign into VA?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000

> I use MHV. The updated version. A new version.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000

> When you say the updated version? Do you mean premium?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000

> Yeah. Premium. Yes. Yes, it's premium.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000

> Yeah, okay.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000

> A locked in my information. So it's pretty easy when I go in. When I get decide to, it just prompts me, and then pulls up my data, and I go in.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000

> That's great. Great. So how does it usually work when you sign into VA.gov? What do you do first?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000

> First I go to the site MHV. Then it gives me a selection of which one to go into, I see a bunch of little icons. Then I click on My Vet. When I click on that, sometimes it sends me a verification – a confirmatin – code, sometimes I get that, put it in and validate and go through to the site.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000

> Okay, great. Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing in before we move on?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000

> Signing in is no issue. Signing in is pretty easy.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000

> Great, that's good to hear. So next I'd like to share some ideas with you so we can get your feedback. I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier that a prototype is like a pretend version of an email or a website it's going to look similar. But it won't work as you might expect, because it's not a real email or a website.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000

> Okay, I'm gonna send that to you in the chat, just copying it. And I put the link in the chat. And are you familiar with sharing your screen in zoom?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000

> Not too good with that.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000

> That's okay. I can walk you through it. Let me know, once you have that link open and okay. Great.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000

> I have the link open.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000

> So come back to zoom, and at the bottom of the zoom there should be.

[continues trying to screen share and gets help from partner]

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:00.000

> Great. And now I'm looking at your screen. And I'd like to start by imaginging that you've just received this email from the VA. And I'm gonna ask you to take a second to read this closely. And when you're finished, I'd like you to summarize what you've read.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:38.000

> Okay. It's telling me that the current system that they have would be discontinued soon, and you'll be able to sign up for the Premium, which would, when you have the chance to go to the Premium login account, you don't have to do any verification in the future.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000

> Okay, do you have any questions? After reading this email?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000

> No, I think I received something like this some time ago, when I switched over to Premium.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000

> Gotcha. What is this email asking you to do next?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000

> What I gather from it, it doesn't have a certain time to do it. I can do it anytime. When I did mine, I did mine right away. [MHV Premium upgrade]

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000

> Can you say more about that?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000

> When I received this memo, I don't see a time when it says I need to do it. I just did mine at my convenience.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000

> Yeah. So it's not telling you when you have to do it.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000

> Yeah, you could do it anytime. So I just did mine, after a couple of times of going back in the old way, then I changed over. Just to test it, to see how it works.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000

> So you've done something like this before?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000

> Yes.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000

> Okay in this scenario, would you be interested in setting up a Login.gov account right now?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000

> Okay, so... You mean set up a new one?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000

> Set up a Login.gov account.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000

> So, okay, and how do I go about doing that? For a VA.gov account?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000

> How do you think you would?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000

> I would probably go to the VA.gov to create an account. [button]

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000

> Okay, before you click on that I have a few more questions. Do you have any hesitations about setting up a Login.gov account?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000

> Yeah, because when I do go in and set up account, I have all the time in the world to do it. So if I take my time and make an error, I don't mess anything up. Doing it in a timeframe, I have be a little nervous about doing it. But if I'm doing it on my own, I have all the time to play around with it. Get help if I need it. Come out of it and try to get in later.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:04.000

> Okay, yeah. Oh, why do you think the VA is recommending that you set up a Login.gov account?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:17.000

> I guess they're trying to make everybody – it's a more secure site. Get all the Veterans on the same page. And I guess with the change of technology and the future. Probably be faster.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000

> Okay, yeah. If you had a question about anything that you read here, what would you do?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000

> I would probably call – most times on the site there's a little icon for support. I'd either try to find the phone number or do it through the do it through the website and go to get support. I'd try to get support on how to do it – have someone walk me through the procedure.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000

> Okay, how would you get support?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000

> I'd telephone them. I'd go to that website and try to get your phone number for support from the VA.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000

> Okay. Thanks for that. Let's go ahead and click that button.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000

> Okay.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000

> Alright! Is this what you expected to see after the email?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000

> Yes, it gives me some login instruction. Yes.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000

> Okay. Can you tell me what you would do next?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000

> I would go to My Health Vet.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000

> Yeah, that's the one that you're that you usually use.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000

> That's the one that I use. I stick with what I'm familiar with. I don't wander off too much, so I'd stick with MHV. That's the one I mostly use – because I can go in with MHV and do almost anything I want to do.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000

> Yeah. Great. Would you ever sign in using DSL?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000

> I think I might have did it in the past, long time ago.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Yeah.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Okay, yeah. But that's not one that you use anymore? Okay. Let's pretend that that you are still using your DSL. So today we're going to sign in with DS Logon. So go ahead and click that.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000

> Okay.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000

> And let's pretend that you entered in your username and password, so you can go ahead and click login. And before we read this in detail, can you describe to me what we're looking at?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000

> You've got to navigate away from VA. And go that way to Login.gov. You can continue to login through Login.gov or stay on VA.gov. It's a choice.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000

> So it's given you a choice. Okay. And why do you think that this appeared on your screen?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000

> So if you want to stay in a secure site, you might want to stay with the VA.gov. That's what I would think this means.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000

> Okay, do you have any questions after coming to this page?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:05.000

> No, I wouldn't have any questions. I would just continue to go forward with the prompts.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000

> Okay. And what do you expect to happen next, if you continued with the prompts?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000

> It will probably take you to a login site, with the site you're looking for, you'll get the screenshots coming up with different types of services they ahve.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.000

> Sure. If you had a question about anything you read here, what would you do?

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000

> Again. I would probably call the VA.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000

> Great. So let's continue on. Let's click that continue to Login.gov button. And as we go through the next couple of screens, I'd like for you to describe out loud what you would do next and if you have a question or something interests you, let me know when we can chat about it.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000

> Okay, on this screen here, you would put in your email address - one that you're going to be using to go into this site. And you put in your password – if you're already can sign in and create an account. If you haven't created account and this is your first time logging in to Login.gov, you got to create an account and then you go down below sign in, and it says create account. Then you would sign in with your government ID, and then I guess they prompt you to set up a password.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000

> Okay, what would you do on this page?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000

> On this page, I probably would put in my email. And once I put my email in, it would prompt my password to jump in. So I save my password – I change it every so often – but I save it, so when I go in I don't have to remember.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000

> Okay, yeah. So you would have it set up so it –

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000

> Already goes in there. [autopopulates]

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000

> Gotcha. Is that because you have a Login.gov account?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000

> I'm not sure because I always go through MHV, I've never done the Login.gov. I may have once a long time ago, I'm not sure.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000

> Okay, if you weren't sure if you had one, what would you do?

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000

> I would create an account. And most times you go down there and click on create account – if you've already have an account, it'll pull up and say you have an account already.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000

> Okay, yeah, great. So let's create an account. And what would you do next on this page?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000

> Enter my email. I would read and accept the Login.gov rules of use. English hit that button, and then I will click on continue.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:40.000

> Okay, great. So let's imagine that you did just that and press continue.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000

> They're going to probably send me something back to validate my email, to confirm it. I will go to my email and check my email.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000

> And how would you check your email? Would you use? What device would you use?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000

> If I'm on my computer, I'll use my phone. Or my Ipad. Because I'm not that computer savvy where I can... So I would use another device. I would use my iPad or my phone.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000

> Okay, great. So we're going to imagine that you've opened up your email address on your phone. So let's click check email now. And what do you do next?

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000

> I would confirm, I'd the message they sent me and I would click down at the bottom 'confirm email address' so they know that's my address. Validate.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:55.000

> Great. So let's do that. Let's click and confirm your email address. What would you do next here?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:16.000

> I would try to establish a password. I would click 'show the password' and I'd try to make sure I meet all the requirements and get me a password that is very strong. If they give me an instruction on what to put in, I put in certain certain characters, but I try to mix up my password with a XXXXX [names characters] or something like that.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000

> Okay, do you have any concerns about setting up a password?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000

> No.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:50.000

> Okay, great. Let's imagine that you set up a strong password and press continue. Can you describe what you're seeing?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000

> The authentication method for setup. And you wanna check how you wanna be able to validate – authenticate your password when you log into the site, they want to verify that it's you. And I generally check text or voice message. And I do that because it's easy for me beause I have a phone in my hand.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000

> Okay, yeah, that's the option that you would pick.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000

> You can use the government ID and different stuff. The options.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000

> Which one would you choose?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000

> Text. Because it's more easier, accessible.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:59.000

> Okay, yeah. So let's scroll down and select text or voice message.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.000

> They're gonna send me a code through my text. Once I received that text, I – oh, here they want, they want you to send you to establish a contact point. So in here, I will put in my phone number. And down to the bottom, I would say, text message. Then I hit send code.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:08.000

> Great. Let's imagine that you've done just that.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000

> And once they send the code, I would see this screen then I with that one time security code, I would go in and type in the code exactly what they sent me. And I hit submit.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:43.000

> Great. So let's click, submit. Can you tell me about this page?

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:58.000

> If you would like to have a backup method for them to authenticate your account, you can do that here.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000

> And do you have any concerns about that?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000

> No.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000

> Great. So today we're gonna skip setting up a backup account. So let's say skip for now. And when you see the screen, what do you think it means?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000

> You validate your email, make sure that's correct. You agree and continue.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.000

> And before we click anything, what do you expect to happen when you click agree and continue?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000

> Probably go into the account. It'll send you a prompt where you can sign into the account.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000

> And which account?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000

> Your VA.gov. Login.gov.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000

> Okay. If there's an issue on this page, what would you do?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000

> Call tech support with VA. Or get in touch with VA.gov, with email or ideally would call them up. Get someone on the phone to help walk me through it.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:34.000

> Okay, great. Let's click agree and continue. And what does this screen mean to you?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000

> Confirming that you have signed in with the Login.gov.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000

> Before we talk about this screen I'd like to just reflect a little bit about what just happened in your own words. Can you tell me what you just did?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:06.000

> Yeah. It walked me through the process of setting up an account for a Login.gov. It did verification to setup a secure login. And it also gave the authentication for how they would check each time to make sure that the right person signed into the account. So when they have your account they have to get verification from you, and send you a code to put in in order to go into your account. It was a login process including security factors.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000

> Okay. And where are we now?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000

> You on the site. Now it says you are logged in. You have signed in with Login.gov. And I guess you can go into the site now and go into My VA or My Health or any one of those you want to go check in and have access to any of those sites.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000

> Okay. And what is the screen trying to tell you?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000

> You have signed in.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000

> Okay. So remember when we started today, we imagined that you would that you were going online to enter your mileage. Do you have any concerns about your ability to do that task now?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000

> No, I don't think I have any question about it. Most of it, when I go in, it's just the process of reading. Touch and go as you go along and follow the instruction. I don't like doing it, but you know, putting it in, I used to like it better when I just turn it into the VA at the VA facility and let them process it. But it's okay.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000

> You preferred it when you could do it in person?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000

> Yeah I would drop it off with my doctor and they would take it and put it in. Now you gotta come back in. Gotta go in and put it in. And for me, it's the issue with attaching the tolls and all that. And not because of the site itself, probably because my knowledge of the site, of being able to use the computer. Not to do with VA. The site is good – it's excellent the way it is.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000

> Okay. So we're nearly done for today. Thank you for answering so many of my questions already. So next, I'm gonna ask you to close this popup.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000

> Okay. [very quickly finds close text on modal]

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:12.000

> And then please click kinda anywhere up at the top of your screen in that dark blue area. And now I like you to imagine that it's been a couple of months since you set up your Login.gov account. And you've come back to your computer and you're going to sign into VA.gov, can you show me how you would sign into VA.gov this time?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:37.000

> I haven't been here in a while. I would go into VA.gov, head down to login, then when I go to login it's going to prompt me with different sites like My Health, and I would click into My Health and go in.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:14.000

> Okay, so let's you can go ahead and click sign in now. And which sign in methods would you use this time? And why?

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000

> My Health Vet. Because I'm familiar with that.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000

> Yeah. Okay, well, today, imagine after you've set up that Login.gov account, imagine that that you still use your DS Logon account. And you set up this this new Login.gov account. We're going to imagine that you go ahead and click Login.gov.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000

> Okay. Enter my email address and my password. And I would hit show my password and I would hit sign in. Because I already created an account. So I can hit sign in.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:21.000

> Great. So we'll imagine that you've entered in your username and password, and you can go ahead and click sign in. And now you see the screen before we read this in detail, can you describe to me what you're looking at now?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000

> I'm looking at the screen where it says verify your Login.gov account for use outside the VA. And it says you have 20 minutes to put your phone name, social security numeber, whatever you need to verify - you've got 20 min to input all that information. Before you get closed out. That's the verification to verify that it's you, it's no one else going into your account.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000

> And why do you think this appeared on your screen?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000

> Security reasons. To keep anyone from going in your account and getting into your medical – any of your personal information. Because once you get in, all your informatoin is in there.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000

> Okay. I'm getting to give you a second to read this a little more closely, and when you're finished I'd like you to summarize what you read.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:29.000

> Okay, they give you options in here. You can either go in and get access to all the VA Digital tools and manage healthcare benefits. If you wanna use other government websites, you need to go in and verify your identity. Oh, that's something new. I didn't know you can go and look at the social security benefits and federal job applications. You have options. And you got a link saying learn more about verifying your identity. You can click on that link if you need any additional information.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000

> Do you have any initial questions after reading this?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000

> No, I think Login.gov – I think I might think about using this.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:29.000

> Okay. Would you be interested in upgrading your account?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000

> Into the premium Login.gov? Yeah, it's sound like something I would want to do.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000

> Okay. Why do you think the VA is recommending that you upgrade your login account?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000

> Sounds like a one stop shop thing. You can go to other sites and stuff. And they have got the security side, and all that. You can do it all through Login.gov. Soo it's under one umbrella. But now you got to go to social security, OPM, all different kinds of sites.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000

> It sounds like this is something that you guys plan on doing in the future... Is this always in existence? Is this is something you're working on or it's already been developed?

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000

> So Login.gov is already one of the ways to login to VA.gov.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000

> Okay. Oh, okay.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:14.000

> Can you say a little bit more about using this in other places?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000

> The way I'm understanding it is you need to go in and look for job applications – not that I'm looking for job applications – looking for social security. You can go and do that through Login.gov, which I think that is very convenient. For me it would be.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000

> Okay. So it sounds like Login.gov is how you can access these other websites.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000

> Yeah, these other government websites. Yeah, I like that part of it.  After I do my mileage today, I'm gonna go in and play around with this.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.000

> Okay. If you choose not to upgrade your Login.gov account, what do you think will happen?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000

> I think eventually, I'm not... I don't expect anything to happen. Because the site I have probably would still let you go in. But if the technology changed, you might have a problem getting in. If you don't change, I guess with the changing technology, it will make it kind of difficult for you to be able to get into the site. So if you're staying intune with technology, you probably want to upgrade and change to that.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000

> But you can log in – you can use Login.gov and still keep the same one I have the same one, MHV Premium, right? You can have both, right? Because I want to keep my security blanket until I get used to other sites. [security blanket = MHV Premium]

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000

> If you had a question about anything on this screen, what would you do?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000

> I would call the VA support.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000

> Okay. Great. So we covered a lot today. And I'd like to spend a couple of minutes now just reflecting before we wrap up. Can you summarize what it is that you did today as you click through this prototype?

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000

> Overview of VA, Login.gov, the benefits, how you sign in, how you get verification, authenticating your account and some of the features of the account. And if you have any issues who to contact for help and assistance. And walk through the process of logging in, verifying your account and validating your account. Establishing your password.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:01.000

> Out of everything that you did today and looked at, ts there anything that sticks out to you?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:16.000

> What stood out to me is the part of this screen right here, where you can go into or manage other government benefits and service like social security and federal job updates. I didn't know you can do all that.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:36.000

> Is there anything else we could do to make it easier for you to set up a Login.gov account to use that the VA?

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:44.000

> What you could do – I'm not sure if everyone, I [know a lot of other] Veterans and I don't think a lot of them are familiar with this at the VA. Login.gov, but most of them are, like I amm using My HealtheVet. So if you, if they could put something out to all the Veterans, let them know this will, some of the pros. You're using with Login.gov. That would be a help.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000

> Okay. Great. Well, thank you. Those are all the questions that I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000

> Oh, well, thanks a lot. It opened my eyes a lot too about Login.gov and what I could do with it – to give some of the advantages that use it.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000

> Yeah. I want to clarify that. So Login.gov is a credential, it's a way to login to VA.gov. So just like you use MHV to log in you can use Login.gov to sign in to VA.gov. And you can use that same login that you create elsewhere on other government websites. So it's not that you can go to Login.gov to access those websites, you can go to those websites and use your login username and password on those sites. Does that make sense?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000

> Okay, make sense. Thank you.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000

> I just wanted to clarify that with you. I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful, as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really, before we go. I wanna make sure it's clear that everything we did today is not real. So you haven't actually set up a Login.gov account or changed the way that you sign into VA. You can continue logging in with MHV as you normally would.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:04.000

> Perigean will send you a thank you note and payment as well.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000

> Thank you. You have a nice day. I'm sorry about the difficult at the beginning of the video.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000

> Oh, not at all technical difficulties are just all part of it.No problem.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000

> Alright, thank you, and have a nice one.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000

> Thank you so much. You have a great day.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000

> Take care bye, bye!

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000

> Bye, take care.
