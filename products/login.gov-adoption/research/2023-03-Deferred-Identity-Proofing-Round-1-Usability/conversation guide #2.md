Note: This Conversation Guide will be used to test [Prototype #2](https://www.figma.com/proto/8vobVoSl1UqLnXsni3rcvO/Login.gov-Adoption%3A-Design-Flows?node-id=402-2918&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=241%3A1368&starting-point-node-id=402%3A2918), where a Veteran receives an email asking them to sign in to VA.gov to start setting up a Login.gov account.

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session
- [ ] Review [guidelines for moderators](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/Guidelines/Guide%20to%20moderating.md)
- [ ] Send [guidelines for notetakers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/Guidelines/Guide%20to%20notetaking.md)
- [ ] Send [guidelines for observers](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/Guidelines/Guide%20for%20observing.md)
- [ ] Ensure prototype(s) are prepared and Perigean will share them with participants

### Day of the session
- [ ] Prepare prototype on your device and be ready for screen sharing if necessary
- [ ] Log into the Perigean Zoom meeting (you will be the host).
- [ ] Turn on transcriptions by clicking the LIVE TRANSCRIPT button in the bottom toolbar, then, in the Live Transcription section, click the ENABLE button.
- [ ] Prepare yourself and your space for a video interview by clearing clutter (on screen and around you), ensuring you have good lighting, and muting distractions like Slack notifications.
- [ ] Use headphones.
- [ ] Review goals and research questions for this study in the [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2023-02-Grandfathering-Migration-Round-1-Usability/research%20plan.md)

### Starting the session
- [ ] If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.
- [ ] Turn your camera on, but don't require the Veteran to turn their camera on, it's up to them. If they choose to have their camera off, ask if they'd prefer you turn your's off.
- [ ] Where applicable, confirm the participant is able to hear and see you.
- [ ] Go through the consent process slowly and intentionally. Remind the participant of their autonomy and choice.
- [ ] You can only record the session if the participant gives you permission to record. Once you start recording, you must let the participant know they're being recorded and have them acknowledge that they give permission. Remember to hit record to cloud.
- [ ] Ask if participants are okay with notetakers and observers joining the session. If they are, add them to the meeting and ensure they are on camera with their name visible on the screen. Introduce them to the participant. Then, ask all third parties to turn off their cameras so you can begin.
- [ ] Ensure everyone except the participant is on mute.

* Task 2 (Sign in to VA.gov): 5 minutes
* Task 3 (Create an IAL1 Login.gov account): 15 minutes

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [YOUR NAME] and I'm a researcher at the VA.

I also have a few colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.

Today we're going to talk about how you sign in to access and manage your VA benefits and health care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I'd like to make sure I don't take too much of your time, so I may occasionally move us along so we can cover everything we're hoping to talk to you about.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Today, you'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is basically like a pretend version of the website. It might not work exactly how you expect. For example, you'll be able to click on somethings on your screen, but not all of them. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real, and what to change.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow people to observe today, but I'd like to confirm. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, briefly introduce all observers while they keep their cameras on and microphones off. If you have time and prefer to, you can ask the observers and notetakers to introduce themselves instead.
    - Then, ask all observers to turn off their cameras for the rest of the session.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

> *Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up - 5 minutes

I'd like to start by learning more about your experience with the VA and some of our online services.

* How long have you been a Veteran?
* How often do you go online to access and manage your VA benefits and health care?
* Do you remember the last time you signed into the VA online?
* Why were you signing in, that day? [What we're you trying to do, that day?]
* How do you sign in to the VA?
* Why do you use [this method] to sign in?
* Can you describe to me how it usually works when you sign into VA.gov [or eBenefits or MHV]? What do you do first?
* Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing in, before we move on?

Great, thanks!

### Things to watch for:
- Does the Veteran recall whether they usually start on VA.gov, eBenefits, My HealtheVet or another VA application?
- Does the Veteran recall using DS Logon, MHV, Login.gov or ID.me to sign in?

## Task 1: Email asks to set up Login.gov - 10 minutes

Next, Iâ€™d like to share some ideas with you so we can get your feedback.

In a minute, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier that a prototype is like a pretend version of an email or website. So it's going to look similar, but it won't work as you might expect it, because it's not a real email or website.

Okay, I've just sent you a link in the chat. [Help them open it and share their screen].

> *Screen: Email from VA.gov*

Now that you have this open, I'd like you to start by imagining that you've just received this email from the VA.

I'm going to give you a second to read this more closely now. When you're finished, I'd like you to summarize what you read.

- Can you summarize what you just read, for me?

## Task 5: Upgrade to IAL2 - 10 minutes

## Cool down - 3 minutes

We covered a lot today. I'd just like to spend a couple minutes now reflecting, before we wrap up.

- Can you summarize what it is you did today, as you clicked through that prototype?
- Out of everything you looked at today, is there anything that sticks out to you now? [This might be something particularly confusing, or interesting]
- Is there anything we could do to make it easier for you to set up a Login.gov account, to use at the VA?

Great, thank you! Those are all of the questions I have for you today.

- Do you have any questions for me?

## Thank you - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Before you go, I do want to make sure it's clear that everything we did today wasn't real. So you haven't actually set up a Login.gov account or changed the way you sign in to the VA. You can continue to do that as normal.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency exit

Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

Blame technology: I'm so sorry, but I just learned that the prototype we'll be reviewing today is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

These are based on recommendations from the [VA platform documentation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies).
