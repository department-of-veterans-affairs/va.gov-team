Secure Sign In Transition

Last updated on: March, 25, 2024


Research Goals
==============

1.  Evaluate the feasibility of the in-person identity proofing service.

2.  Understand the VA staff workflow and ways that the in-person identity proofing service might fit into that flow.

3.  Identity assumptions and requirements that are necessary to uphold for the viability of the in-person identity proofing service.

Research Questions 
===================

-   How might we ensure a positive proofing experience for Veterans with VA staff support?

-   How might we improve the ease of adoption and use of the service for VA staff?

-   How might we help VA staff ease the anxiety/burden for Veterans when they aren't successful in verifying their identity?

-   How might we make failure to verify one's identity remotely more palatable for Veterans and VA staff?

Methodology 
============

Subject matter expert (SME) interviews will be conducted. These will be semi structured interviews featuring two parts. The first part will be a contextual inquiry into the individuals' current work and experience with identity proofing or verification. The second part will be a presentation of the IPP user journey for both Veterans and proofing agents, including assumptions or requirements currently made to ensure the success of the Veteran to verify. The participant will then be asked follow up questions to react and give input on the user journey.

Participant Demographics
========================

The stakeholders identified will be recruited across position levels to ensure we get leadership input as well as stakeholders that have day to day interactions with Veterans and hold a position similar to that envisioned for the VA staff in the in-person identity proofing service.

Through discovery research, our team learned that My HealtheVet (MHV) Coordinators provide support for setting up accounts, whether for MHV, Login.gov, or ID.me. MHV coordinators are also authorized to verify Veteran's identity for upgrading My HealtheVet basic account to premium. Given the depth of MHV coordinators responsibilities, their input can provide clarity and improvements we envision for the in-person identity proofing service we are creating.

Our research team interviewed four MHV coordinators individually as well as two group interviews with Theresa Hancock, Carnetta Scruggs, and Susan Haidary. The MHV coordinators listed below were recommended by Theresa Hancock, Carnetta Scruggs, and Susan Haidary. 

Scott Bacon (Lexington, KY) 

Melissa Beals (Anchorage, Alaska) 

Kelly Crain (St. Louis, Missouri) 

Renee Ruggles (Reno, Nevada)

We are incredibly grateful for the time and insights shared by these experts and the care they provide for Veterans. 

Hypotheses and Conclusions 
===========================

VA Staff will be able to easily guide a Veteran through the in-person proofing product and service. 

-   Partly false. Currently, some MHV coordinators struggle helping Veterans understand the importance of verification. Without a good reason, it can be hard to guide a Veteran through this process and encourage them to share information.

"Verification vs Authentication: Has been confusing to Veterans. It seems that they're verifying information more than once and don't understand the difference. (P3)

VA Staff will report positive feedback on the service flow.

-   Mostly true. VA staff were excited about the service flow,  its potential use in assisting them with the verification process, and welcomed the ease that the service flow would allow them to verify a Veterans identity.

"An in person verification would be great" (P4)

[When asked if this solution would be welcomed by VA staff] "Yes Please." (P6)

VA Staff will be able to adopt the in-person proofing service into their current workflow without training. 

-   Mostly false. VA Staff were not familiar with how to use the IAM toolkit to search for Veterans. In fact, most were not even familiar with what the IAM toolkit is. They would need training on this application before fully engaging with the service.

[When asked about the use of the IAM toolkit] "No not for Veterans that I know of...I know we use another one for employees but I didn't know there was anything here for Veterans." (P3)

[Shakes head] "I've been using Login.gov and don't remember having to go through all of [this, verifying through the IAM Toolkit]" (P5)

VA Staff will be able to identify ways to support Veterans throughout the in-person identity proofing service to help them successfully verify. 

-   Partly true. All MHV Coordinators reported that they would do anything they can to help Veterans, even if doing so means performing tasks outside of the typical verification flow. This means they are educators in addition to verifiers. However, sometimes they may hit a wall where they cannot resolve an issue for a Veteran and they must rely on a third party service (like from Login.gov).

"At least three Veterans I've sent to the post office...nobody has any idea what they are talking about and one person who does know is not there." (P6)

"It is very important to get tech support with Login.gov or ID.me." (P6)

VA Staff will report neutral or positive feedback that the in-person identity proofing service will work in most VA facilities. 

-   Partly false.  Every Coordinator has a different physical space that they work in and varying access to resources. Ten day walk in windows may work at some sites and not others due to the available staff, hours, available technology, available transportation, and so on.

[Speaking about their role and their general day to say at the VA] "Very busy, very dynamic and changing all the time". (P 5)

Key Findings 
=============

Feedback on IPP as a Service
----------------------------

Key Findings 1: MHV coordinators displayed positive reactions towards the proposed user flow for proofing agents.

Five MHV Coordinators (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6) reacted positively towards the concept of the proposed service. The flow of the service felt familiar, valid, and feasible which resulted in the Coordinators' approval.

"I would think MHV coordinators would be happy to help with this effort." (P1)

One participant (P3) also commented that they liked that this service did not have to be "a failed proofing" meaning Veterans could use this service without needing to fail remote proofing first.

"I like that it doesn't have to be a failed proofing."  (P3)

Conclusion

MHV coordinators were satisfied with the flow which indicates that the steps we described for verification are valid. We will do in person research next to learn how the steps work in real time with organic interactions between Veterans and VA staff.

Key Findings 2: MHV coordinators find value in the In-Person Proofing if a Veteran requires more hands-on assistance to complete the verification process. Coordinators would like to see Veterans complete the verification process on their own, in a remote environment and Veterans share that desire.

Four MHV coordinators (P3, P4, P5, P6) agreed that there is a need for an in-person proofing option for Veterans. They also responded positively when asked if a process for verifying a Veteran identity in-person was warranted in their work.

"In-person customer service is absolutely necessary for this work." (P5)

"An in person verification would be great." (P4)

"[When asked if this solution would be welcomed by VA staff] Yes, please." (P6)

While almost all coordinators agreed that an in-person option was necessary, they also shared that Veterans might prefer to complete the verification process remotely, if they can.

"Veterans want to do it on their own, they want to be able to call the help desk themselves." (P4)

Two MHV coordinators (P3, P5) called out that Veterans with lower levels of digital literacy require in person assistance, especially if they attempt to verify their identity remotely and fail.

"One wrong click and they're not with you anymore; hard to do over the phone." (P5)

"I told a patient that I would like them to come in so I can watch them do it." (P3)

When asked about their experiences interacting with Veterans who have no choice but to come to a VA location to complete their identity verification, coordinators admitted that they have experienced first hand the frustrations that Veterans face.

"Veterans resent coming in [to the VA]." (P5)

"We need something seamless and fast otherwise you're not helping us." (P5).

Conclusion

Overall, the in-person proofing princess is a welcomed idea, received positively by nearly all participants. While in-person verification might be more beneficial for some Veterans over others, the need and desire for an in-person option that works is top of mind for MHV coordinators.

Key Findings 3: Verification is a responsibility that can be done by staff besides MHV Coordinators.

Four MHV Coordinators (P2, P3, P5, P6) brought up how they should not need to be the only VA staff responsible for verification. All participants reported that they are the only VA staff verifying at their site. Each of them suggested that sites like Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC) and other staff members such as authenticators, clerks, and telehealth technical coordinators can provide verification services. One coordinator (P4) showed particular interest in how they might train someone else to become a proofing agent: they explained that they are comfortable training others through the MHV privacy and authenticator training but they would need to know more about the "requirements to be a Proofing Agent" for the proposed service.

"MHV works really well. If [the MHV Coordinator] is not around, there are others who can at least verify documents. There's at least one coordinator at each site. If one's not there, others are trained to at least review ID, leave notes and then the coordinator enters information into the system." (P3)

Conclusion

Currently, many MHV Coordinators find themselves alone in helping Veterans verify. However, this does not mean that this role should continue to be isolated. Other VA staff members can be trained to verify Veterans or support part of the process so coordinators do not have to do it all alone.

Key Findings 4: The benefits of modern security measures, such as verification, are not understood by Veterans and VA staff resulting in confusion and untrustworthiness

Three MHV Coordinators (P3, P4, P5)  reported that they found it difficult to explain why verification is an important process for Veterans. Two Coordinators did not see the benefit in verifying (P3 and P5), one did not understand the value verification provides beyond the email confirmation and multi-factor authentication (P3), and another (P5) doubted the effectiveness because they had their identity stolen as a VA employee.

"I don't know what to say about that [need for verification as a process] because as a VA employee I have had my identity stolen." (P5)

Another participant mentioned facing difficulties because Veterans were hesitant to share their information.

"I really don't know how to explain it to them other than 'they're just trying to prove that it's you.'" (P3)

VA staff need guidance or references that clearly explain the benefits of these processes to themselves and Veterans.

"[I] have Vets who don't trust [Login.gov or ID.me], 'I don't want my information out there'." (P4)

"One of the big things we have screamed about the most is they are technically already verified." (P3)

Conclusion

Verification is not always well understood or received by MHV Coordinators. This sentiment is important and may make it challenging for Coordinators to convey the importance of verification to Veterans and persuade them to complete the process in a timely fashion. We need to develop language for Coordinators so they understand what verifying modern credentials entails and why it benefits theVeteran.

Feedback on Features of the IPP Service
---------------------------------------

Key Findings 1: MHV coordinators desire the option to use more than one type of ID when validating a Veteran's identity.

Four MHV Coordinators (P3, P4, P5, P6) spoke to the various types of identification that are accepted during current identity verification processes. Participants made specific callouts of types of identification that is easiest for them to use when verifying a Veteran's identity.

"Like to use VHIC [Veteran Health Identification Card] because it has a unique number that is not SS [Social Security Number] and so can't steal identity." (P3)

When explaining a Veteran's knowledge of acceptable forms of identification, most participants noted that, in their experience, Veterans know what forms of identification to bring with them to VA appointments.

"No issue with Vets bringing the right kinds of IDs." (P6)

More specifically, participants also mentioned that having the ability to verify a Veteran's identity using a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) would be a familiar form of identification to the Veteran, in turn, ensuring the VA staff spends considerably less time completing the process.

"Adding the VHIC as an acceptable ID is wonderful." (P5)

Participants also explained that using VHIC as an accepted form of ID can act as an anti-fraud measure, further supporting participants' positive reaction to the ability to use various forms of ID to complete the verification process.

[Explaining a part of the current In Person Verification process] "With the MHV program they have to come into the VA to verify their identity. Like to use VHIC because it has a unique number that is not SS and so can't steal identity." (P3)

MHV coordinators shared reasons why a Veteran may not possess a current form of identification, and explained that this could bar them from verifying entirely.

"[The Veteran] has a driver's ID from US virgin islands, nothing would take it." (P6)

Conclusion 

Providing MHV coordinators various options for accepted identification is welcomed. Not only does this provide the Veteran with a certain level of comfort and understanding but it also allows the proofing agent some flexibility when it comes to accepting Veteran specific forms of identification.

Key Findings 2: 10 day walk-in periods are realistic but scheduling should be considered to ensure that VA staff are available.

Four MHV coordinators (P1, P2, P3, P6) spoke to the pros of knowing when to expect Veterans for their in person verification appointments. MHV Coordinators have generally busy schedules, but depending on the time and day of the week, their availability can vary.

"MHV Coordinators may have multiple jobs and have to find time to break away. If they had multiple people going...who knows when they would be showing up. Most walk-in's are okay though." (P3)

MHV coordinators explained that receiving a notification that a Veteran will be arriving at a particular location on a specific date or within 10 days would allow them to plan ahead. However, they would still like to keep walk-in appointments to ensure ease of access for Veterans

"Come in while they are here for another appointment because they have to arrange travel. Schedule a time when they are already here so we go to them" (P6).

The term 'walk-in appointment' proved to be confusing to MHV coordinators, but did not deter the coordinators from responding positively to a Veteran scheduling an appointment.

"A walk-in appointment is a scheduled appointment" (P2)

Conclusion

MHV coordinators are okay with walk-in's but scheduled appointments can help them plan their days and backups if needed. This is important if other VA staff will be trained to support coordinators because they will need to know what days they may be needed to verify Veterans. Veterans in turn will also need to know what days an authorized VA staff is onsite to complete in person identity verification.

Feedback on Current Processes
-----------------------------

Key Findings 1: MHV coordinators assist Veterans with the identity verification process both remotely and in person. However, MHV coordinators suggested that there are Veterans groups who require more hands-on assistance and should be prioritized when designing the process for in person proofing.

Four MHV Coordinators (P3, P4, P5, P6) expressed that while they appreciate the ability to offer a Veteran the option of verifying their identity remotely, they do see the value in having an in-person option for Veteran populations who may be impacted by lower digital literacy levels.

"Huge part of the job winds up teaching people  how to use their device." (P5)

"Younger Vets are very good with tech, we can upload ID's, it's the elderly population of Vets that have the most barriers." (P6)

MHV coordinators do everything that they can to assist Veterans, but there are some instances that the current in-person verification process proves to be too confusing or frustrating for certain Veteran groups to complete remotely.

"Some of the steps are repetitive...I just signed on, why am I signing on again, just got another code on my phone, what's this?" (P4)

Participants also mentioned that while Veterans with lower levels of digital literacy are, in some instances, able to create a basic MHV account or non-verified account for Login.gov or ID.me on their own, they struggle to complete the process for a verified account. This can cause both MHV coordinators and the Veteran significant barriers that might not hinder the start of the process, but that does impact the completion of verifying the Veteran's identity.

"They can certainly sign up for them themselves but they get a basic account and then they see someone here to get their premium" (P3)

MHV Coordinators recognize that there are several hurdles that can slow or halt Veterans during the verification process. While they do whatever they can to help Veterans, they cannot always ensure that all Veterans verify successfully.

"There needs to be some in person process for some of those that have been hurting the most." (P3)

Another blocker MHV coordinators elaborated on when attempting to verify Veterans' identity was the lack of options disabled Veterans have when attempting to complete the verification process. More specifically, MHV coordinators spoke to the benefit of having an in-person verification option within VAMC's or other VA facilities, to ensure that Veterans have access to in-person support.

"This [In-person identity proofing at the VA] will be a really great thing so we don't have to send them to the post office." (P6)

Conclusion

MHV Coordinators communicated that Veterans have difficulty completing verification for personal and situational reasons. It is not a one size fits all solution and in the future, the verification service needs to be flexible enough to assist all Veteran populations.

Key Findings 2: MHV coordinators have tactics to solve issues with identity verification currently; however, there is no standard operating procedure when it comes to troubleshooting.

Three MHV coordinators (P3, P4, P5) mentioned that while they do have workarounds, the verification process would be much more streamlined if they were provided with a helpdesk phone number, to better assist Veterans encountering problems.

"I'm still under the impression that ID.me doesn't have a phone number they can call themselves, so that would be extremely helpful." (P4)

"A lot of it has probably been trial and error and working with what you have." (P3)

One participant noted that current services require backtracking across pages when attempting to complete a Veteran's identity verification process. VA staff felt this is an improvement area and ultimately made the verification process take longer than anticipated.

"Sometimes you have to go back to a previous page to complete a step. Let it be a nice seamless we're gonna do this this and this to get this done." (P5)

Conclusion 

MHV coordinators maneuver the complexities of the in person proofing process to the best of their abilities. They would deeply benefit from a system that is more regulated and is better suited to allow them to quickly solve problems Veterans face when attempting to verify their identities.

Key Findings 3: The current verification process is cumbersome, time consuming, and provides significant frustration from both the VA staff and the Veteran.

Two MHV coordinators (P5, P6) called attention to the ways in which they struggle with the current verification process. MHV coordinators want to help as many Veterans as they can, but need a better way to complete identity verification.

"MHV hasn't been rethought in the last 20 years." (P5)

One participant (P6) also made direct mention of how they thought the process could be improved, specifically calling out the need for the process to be streamlined.

"There should be a way where we should be able to quickly prove that. There should be a way when they register that they can check off that they can verify that." (P6)

One MHV coordinator also communicated that the current verification process is not just difficult for them, but they have experienced the Veteran also having a difficult time verifying their identity.

"I've had Veterans throw their hands up and say I don't want to do this" (P5)

[Explaining the optimal setup for their work]  "I'm there and I'm seeing what's happening, seeing what they missed or maybe did wrong." (P5)

Conclusion

Overall, MHV Coordinators find the current verification process lacking, not just for themselves but for the Veterans they are assisting. It's important to note that these MHV Coordinators are not just expressing frustrations when it comes to their role in the identity verification process, but they called attention to the first hand experiences of Veterans they witness having trouble with identity verification.

Conclusion
==========

The most impactful takeaway from SME interviews is that both the proposed service and its intended flow received a positive response. This positive response further validates the need for the in person option we are designing to assist both the Veteran and the authorized VA staff.

We have concluded that a next step will be to conduct usability testing to continue exploring attitudes, pain points, and suggestions for next iterations and improvements for the In-Person Identity Proofing application. Refinements to the application will continue to address barriers and validate assumptions to ensure that the application serves its intended use. The end goal is to enable Veterans to effortlessly navigate the verification process with the help of VA staff.
