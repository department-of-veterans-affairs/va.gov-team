# Conversation Guide 

Introduction

Welcome, thank you for joining us today. My name is ____, my pronouns are _____ and I am a _______(ROLE). As we mentioned in our initial outreach, we are part of the Login.gov Adoption team working under VA OCTO. Our work is focused on improving the sign in experience for Veterans. Today, we are going to ask you questions about in person verification services that currently exist as well as get your input on a possible service we are considering. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We want to improve these services to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Please note that only the members of this team will view the recording and no individual responses will be shared with your supervisor or anyone else in a way that identifies you.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

Context

Veteran Affairs has been tasked with providing increased protection and access to its services and benefits without indirectly excluding Veterans. This has been ushered in by three executive orders to increase trust, improve customer experience and security, and ensure Veterans have equitable access to services and benefits. As mentioned, Login.gov Adoption, under VA OCTO, is focused on educating Veterans on how to adopt and use Login.gov and ID.me. Identity verification is a necessary step in creating these accounts. One consideration we are exploring is providing in-person identity proofing on site at Veteran Affairs facilities so that Veterans may have more options when they need to complete identity verification.

Your perspective is crucial to understanding how this service might be feasible given it is intended to be supported by onsite VA staff. From prior research and SME interviews, we understand there are in-person identity verification processes in place already, for example, setting up a MHV premium account. We hope to learn from processes such as these to better inform what would be needed for in-person identity proofing for accounts like Login.gov.
Agenda
The first part of our interview will be structured to better understand your current work experience and how identity verification processes work in your current role and workspace. As well as how you have seen identity verification processes set up for other VA staff.

The second part of the interview will feature a potential service that we are designing for in-person identity proofing for Veterans to verify their identity to set up a Login.gov account. We will show you the anticipated workflow and want to get your feedback on aspects we should consider.
Part I

Can you please tell us about your professional background and experiences?

What is your current role and responsibilities?

What do you know about in-person verification or in-person identity proofing?

Where have you seen in-person verification or in-person identity proofing done within the VA or by Veterans, and maybe not in the VA?

If they do not mention in the prior section, ask about their experiences with in-person verification? 
What was their role?
What did in-person verification look like as a service for Veterans and for the staff responsible? 
What worked for those in-person verification services?
What were the challenges?
What were assumptions made that we should be aware of?


If they do not mention in the prior section, ask about their current experiences with in-person verification? 
How does it show up in their workday? 
What does the service look like to them? 
To Veterans?
What works for those in-person verification services?
What are the challenges?
What are assumptions made that we should be aware of?

We have heard that for identity verification for MHV Premium there is no standard procedure for MHV Identity Verifiers given that the role is not compensated and done in tandem with employees other responsibilities?
What works with that format?
What does not work?
What is something you think might improve the VA staff or Identity verifier experience?
Are there examples in other departments or even outside of VA that you think could be beneficial for in-person verification?

Thank you for sharing your insights.

Part II
We are now going to switch to the second part of this interview. We are going to show you some images that provide information on a possible in-person identity proofing service we are designing. Our goal is to better understand what the VA staff role may look like in this service. In this service, the VA staff role is referred to as a “proofing agent”. We have designed it based on previous research but we need your input to further improve the VA staff experience as well as the Veterans. We welcome any and all types of feedback and suggestions as we want to ensure that this service is feasible to implement. 


Show the sitemap
Here is a flow chart of the in-person identity proofing service featuring both what the Veteran must do and what the proofing agent needs to do as well as assumptions and requirements we have drafted. Please take a moment to review, you are welcome to ask questions as you look at it. 
Follow Up Questions and Comments
What are your initial thoughts?
Is there anything missing?
Is there anything that you like?
Is there anything that concerns or confuses you?
Review the assumptions and requirements
Ask follow up questions about the feasibility or realisticness of these assumptions and requirements
If they have not mentioned the proofing agent, ask them the questions again but tell them to focus on the steps for the proofing agent.
Troubleshooting Strategies
What might a primary coordinator need to do to authorize another coordinator for our in-person proofing service?
What does this look like if a backup is needed? How is the backup designated?
How feasible does this overall process feel for MHV coordinators among their current tasks?
How might you expect Veterans to feel during this process?
We are considering MHV coordinators as candidate for proofing agents, 
Are there other stakeholder groups we might consider
If yes, who can we follow up with? 
In previous research, we have learned that when a service is being piloted, misinformation can spread. What can we do to anticipate and reduce misinformation?
What can we do to ensure more receptivity from proofing agent stakeholders?
What can we do to ensure more receptivity from Veteran stakeholders?
Review Proofing Agent stakeholder map
These are possible sites and candidates to conduct IPP, is there anyone missing?
We have also listed considerations on the right based on previous interviews you’ve participated in. 
What are other considerations not mentioned here we should include? 

Thank you for sharing your time and insights. Your input is incredibly valuable in ensuring we are envisioning a feasible and meaningful service. 

Recruitment Ask
We are planning a pilot for this service and are looking to recruit VA staff who might be potential proofing agent candidates for this service. Would it be possible to reach out after this interview to recruit [you or members of your team] to participate in either a remote or in-person pilot?
