## Research goals
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access My HealtheVet and other VA services. These login options don’t all meet the required security standards and also create frustration and confusion for users.

Through our research, we hoped to explore how the VA can most successfully migrate existing users, and onboard new user to Login.gov (which is a compliant, single sign-on credentialing platform). While Login.gov does currently exist, our research hopes to uncover the best ways to support Veterans, non-Veteran roles, and VA staff in this transition.

### How this research maps to the Veteran journey
1. Attending to health needs: How can we proactively intervene at this stage to make sure Veterans are able to create a Login.gov account they will use to access My HealtheVet going forward?
2. Managing my declining health: How can we help Veterans who are aging and managing their declining health have clear and technically-feasible options to transition their access to My HealtheVet to Login.gov and ID.me?

### Goals
1. Understand how we can intervene to ensure that new generations of Veterans use Login.gov or ID.me to access My HealtheVet from the start.
2. Understand what in-person support will enable Veterans to create and use a Login.gov account to access My HealtheVet.
3. Understand how the greatest number of Veterans can use multi-factor authentication options, including security keys.
4. Understand how setting up and maintaining shared access might work for Veterans and non-Veterans.

## Research questions

* When should proactive intervention encourage the creation of a Login.gov account?
* What do Veterans find important or beneficial when choosing a login credential?
* How do we communicate the need to migrate to Login.gov to access services?
* How do we support Veterans and non-Veterans after they set up Login.gov?
* When people in-person proof and migrate their account, what issues arise for them?
* What resources or workflows will help with issues during in-person proofing & migration?
* How do Veterans understand the process of choosing and using a MFA method?
* Which MFA options will allow more Veterans to migrate to Login.gov?
* How can MFA support non-Veterans who need access to parts of a Veterans’ information?
* Which non-Veteran users would Veterans choose to set up access for, when and why?
* How do non-Veterans imagine shared access to work for themselves and non-Veterans?

## Methodology 

1. Scenario Validation: We presented Veterans with a scenario showing a potential approach to creating a Login.gov account and accessing My HealtheVet. This helped us evaluate whether Veteran finds a particular solution is useful, clear, appropriate or concerning.

2. Service Prototype Testing: We used this method alongside scenarios, walking Veterans through a service prototype of how they would in-person proof, set up multi-factor authentication and secure a Login.gova account at a VA facility. This helped us evaluate the workflow and support needed.

3. Intercepts: We ran contextual intercepts with Veterans where we shared various stimuli, like, an email or a login screen. This helped us clarifying content and tone-of-voice of messaging, in particular, and reach Veterans who don’t yet have a My HealtheVet or Login.gov account.

3. Being identity proofed at another appointment, and, as the start or end to account setup, is more convenient for Veterans

4. Veterans see security as the VA’s responsibility, but are motivated to be more careful if it puts their benefits access at risk, or they understand how their actions affect fellow Veterans.

5. Perceived ease of use and complex views on security inform Veterans' multi-factor authentication choices.

6. Veterans will choose whichever login credential is most familiar, or, seems more direct to complete a task.

7. Veterans don't think to share access to their healthcare information until life altering events make it necessary.

## Details of Findings

**1. Setting up a new credential is frustrating for Veterans if it’s made to seem like a choice or the need is unclear.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Messaging that suggestions setting up a new credential is optional, when it’s actually required, is frustrating for Veterans. They want clear instructions about what is expected of them.

And if Login.gov is the only option available for accessing valued services, Veterans will use it, but they’d like to know the reason for the changing requirements. Transparency around government decisions and spending instills trust and supports Veterans to embrace change.

> "If Login.gov is the preferred method, the VA has to say that and stop providing options." Participant 9, Veteran Interview

> "They could use the money they are using for Login.gov to help Veterans [instead]." Participant 4, Veteran Interview

<br>

**2. Knowing humanized and dedicated support is available, motivates Veterans to setup and use a credential.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `AUD: Contact Center`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Veterans expect the VA to respect their independence, which means making it easy to navigate set up on their own terms. Although Veterans are competent and familiar with login and setup processes, they do tend to have limited troubleshooting skills. 

This means that knowing humanized, dedicated help is available throughout the journey, makes Veterans more willing to set up and continue to use a new credential.

> "Plenty of people use MFA and have issues. My parents would be a great example of technologically challenged people that need help – but usually they just have to learn how to do it a few times, get used to it and then they are fine." Participant 12, Veteran Intercept

> "The lady at the desk here is already busy, she has to check in more people and get them set up with healthcare. She doesn't have time to help me set up Login.gov, then people would be waiting." Participant 6, Veteran Intercept

> “I would walk away at this point unless someone is walking through [my password issues] on the phone with me." Participant 8, Veteran Interview

<br>

**3. Being identity proofed at another appointment, and, as the start or end to account setup, is more convenient for Veterans.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `MHV: Appointments`,`VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Setting up Login.gov alongside another VA appointment is a welcome convenience for Veterans, as long as it represents a definitive start or end to the process. But, if it creates another ongoing process then Veterans are less likely to see it through.

Moving between online and offline touchpoints can create confusion – but clarity on what to bring, why you’re identity proofing and how it won't affect your existing appointments or accounts, helps put Veterans at ease.

> "I would set up Login.gov at the end of my appointment, while I'm here. I'd rather get more done in a single period." Participant 6, Veteran Intercept

> "If I don't [decide to identity proof], then I'm worried I wouldn't be able to go to my [healthcare] appointment." Participant 3, Veteran Interview

<br>

**4. Veterans see security as the VA’s responsibility, but are motivated to be more careful if it puts their benefits access at risk, or they understand how their actions affect fellow Veterans.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

While Veterans may distrust the government, they tend to overestimate its online security and feel it's the responsibility of the VA to make sure things are secure.

Many Veterans perceive little risk around their medical information being hacked, but are concerned about not being able to access their doctors and prescriptions through My HealtheVet. When considering their data concerns, Veterans tend to be more motivated by keeping fellow Veterans' data safe, rather than their own.

> "I understand that they are trying to be secure, but I also know that when it comes to the Internet, nothing is under lock." Participant 4, Veteran Interview

> "They've put enough security measures in place to ensure the person logging on is secure." Participant 8, Veteran Interview

<br>

**5. Perceived ease of use and complex views on security inform Veterans’ multi-factor authentication choices.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Perceived ease of use drives Veterans' security and multi-factor authentication choices. While they might say security is a priority, in practice, Veterans make choices based on ease of use.

Ingrained responsibility for government-issued property undermines the perception that a security key from the VA would an easy and low-stress MFA option. And while biometrics can at first feel like a violation, through repeated exposure it's increasingly embraced as an easy option requiring no memory.

> “We've all experienced the ‘oh, my God, where's my rifle!?’ Veterans aren’t going to want to be accountable for [a security key] since there's too much ingrained trauma there.” Participant 7, Veteran Interview

> "I'm old, using something new makes me feel old and dumb." Participant 26, Veteran Intercept

> "My personal concern is not being able to use my own device resulting in not being able to have the password securely generated and stored in my password manager. I do not want to have to write this password down." Participant 7, Veteran Interview

<br>

**6. Veterans will choose whichever login credential is familiar, or, seems more direct to complete a task.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

When Veterans gravitate towards familiarity. If they’re used to logging in to My HealtheVet using DS Logon, they will continue to do so, even after they’ve set up Login.gov.

And in some cases, Veterans will choose a particular login credential because it appears to be the most direct route to completing a task.

Familiarity also helps Veterans who struggle to remember their password, a common and major pain point.

> "I seem to press 'My HealtheVet' more often than not. I think it's because that is where I'm going. It feels more direct, like it's getting me right in." Participant 10, Veteran Interview

> "If you keep presenting me with those same options every time, just out of habit, I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing." Participant 7, Veteran Interview

<br>

**7. Veterans don’t think to share access to their healthcare information until life altering events make it necessary.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `AUD: Caregivers`,`PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Veterans don't think to set up shared access until life altering events make it necessary for others to have access to their information. Shared access asks Veterans to consider who they trust and who will take care of them in the future, which can evolve or change over time.

With more complex care situations, caretakers recognize the need for nuanced permissions when accessing a Veterans' information. Veterans and their support systems find it important that a Veteran is able to grant and revoke shared access and see exactly what has been accessed by others.

> “It depends on my trust in the person who I give access, what I would give them access to. My husband could have full access, but my children, would be able to see my medications only.” Participant 15, Veteran Interview

> "I would feel fine about [giving access] to my wife. She's the pilot and I'm the copilot. It would be convenient." Participant 18, Veteran Intercept

> "What if I'm going through a divorce and they use my medical records against me? 75% of my disability is PTSD. In court, it could be used against me in terms of childcare rights. But there is a need regardless, if I'm blind or can't print out a prescription." Participant 3, Veteran Interview

## Additional insights

Passwords represent the biggest point of friction in ongoing use of a login credential. Veterans find passwords difficult to remember, particularly if they are required to update them often. They end up losing access to their My HealtheVet accounts (or having them deactivated) due to an inability to login.

> "This is a problem I have with My HealtheVet, you can't use your previous password so you have to make [a new] one up. It's a big pain to reset and then try to remember. In fact, right now, I'm not sure of my password." Participant 12, Veteran Intercept

Veterans choose to use ID.me because it helps them get access to discounts and other retail benefits. 

> "I use ID.me because I get shopping kickbacks. There's an incentive with ID.me, but I don't really see a benefit when it comes to Login.gov." Participant 5, Veteran Interview

Frustrating past experience with helplines, in general, makes Veterans hesitant to call a helpline for support with Login.gov.

> "The people [on one helpline] are not compassionate, they give me generic answers that aren't useful. They can be condescending, rude, talking over me, and argue." Participant 10, Veteran Interview

Veterans expect identity proofing in-person to take around 5 to 10 minutes.

> "You keeping me longer at my appointment is keeping me away from making more money. If I'm expecting an appointment to already be 2 hours long, 2.5 hours is not acceptable. Because I have to go back to work."

Once Veterans are logged in, they find immense value in My HealtheVet, as a useful, convenient and easy to use service.

> "All I need to do is message people and refill prescriptions, which is really helpful on the My HealtheVet app while on-the-go."

## Recommendations

* Explain the need for Login.gov setup through consistent, contextual reminders and emphasis on help and ease.
* Help Veterans understand their role in ensuring continued access to VA services and protecting fellow Veterans.
* Make it easy to bundle identity proofing with existing appointments.
* Provide in-person support with account creation and use, including identity proofing in-person.
* Help Veterans become familiar with Login.gov by making it an obvious default.
* Recommend multi-factor authentication options that are appropriate and meet each Veterans' specific needs.
* Encourage Veterans to set up shared access early and help them review it often so they stay in control of their information.
* Provide dedicated, supportive help at every step and reach out to those who struggle with setup or use.

## Next steps

* Develop a roadmap and implementation plan for this program of work
* Plan future research studies to build on learnings

## Further research

We recommend further research is done to understand which method multi-factor authentication methods will best support less technologically-savvy Veterans, Veterans who are unhoused, and Veterans with more severe cognitive disabilities.

In the Appendix, we also note which underserved groups this study did not recruit for and recommend additional research studies with these Veterans in the future.

## Secondary research

To gain a deeper understanding of the challenges with credential service providers and proofing across VA services, we spoke with several experts:

* Carnetta Scruggs: MHV
* Sonja Skinner: MHV
* VSP Team: Account Migration
* Dr. Carla Hill: TAP
* Melissa Rebstock: VBA, VBO
* Dr. Berkowitz: Data and Ethics
* Matt Baum: Health Data Security
* Laurie Baker: VBA, VACO
* Danny Reed: VHIC
* Stephania Griffin: Privacy VHA
* 1 working session about Non-Veteran user roles
* 2 focus groups with MHV Coordinators

In our [Sprint Demo decks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/presentations/sprint%20demos) there are specific insights from these expert interviews.

## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to

Our findings may not include the perspectives of the following underserved Veteran groups, Veterans with a cognitive disability, who identify as Native or who identify as LGBTQ+. And we don’t have data on whether Veterans included in our study have mobile devices, were other than honorable, or, are of immigrant origin.

We recommend studies with these underserved groups in the future, including in particular, unhoused Veterans.
