## Introduction
### 1 minute

Hi, I’m [researcher] and [researcher] is taking notes. We’re researchers at the VA. We’re trying to better understand Veteran experiences to help us improve the way we do things. Do you have a moment to talk while you’re waiting?

[If no] Thanks for your time. Have a good day.

[If yes] Thanks. Today we’re exploring how Veterans access VA services, such as My HealtheVet, healthcare portal. We want to know how to explain the different ways Veterans access their account.

- Can I show you something and ask for your feedback?

[If yes] Before we start, I want to let you know that this will take 5 to 10 minutes. I know you’re waiting for an appointment, if you need to leave at any point, that’s okay. I won’t ask for any personal information and your identity will remain anonymous.

I’d love to hear your honest opinion and that’s going to help us make things better. 

## More about you
### 1 minute

- What brings you in today?
- Do you interact with any VA services online?
- Which ones do you use?
- Do you use My HealtheVet?

## Intercept A: Login.gov adoption
### 5 minutes

[If they use My HealtheVet] I want to show you an email that My HealtheVet might send you.

[If they don’t use My HealtheVet] My HealtheVet is an online healthcare portal. It allows Veterans to view their healthcare records, communicate with their doctors and refill prescriptions. I want to show you an email that My HealtheVet might send you, if you used it.

**Show email**

- What is this email about?
- Is there anything confusing in this email?
- If you got this email, what would you do?
- Why do you think the VA is suggesting you update your account?
- Would you rather receive this message another way?

## Intercept B: Shared access
### 5 minutes

[If they use My HealtheVet] I want to see what you think about a potential new feature on My HealtheVet.

[If they don’t use My HealtheVet] My HealtheVet is an online healthcare portal. It allows Veterans to view their healthcare records, communicate with their doctors and refill prescriptions. I want to see what you think about a potential new feature that might be added to My HealtheVet.

**Show screens**

This feature gives you the option to set up limited or full access to your account for anyone you choose. This person can create their own account and see as much of your information as you’d like them to.

- Have you let anyone see your healthcare records in the past?
- Have you shared them with them online?
- How would you feel about them having their own account instead?
- Would you choose to set this up?
- Who would you choose to give access to?
- What kind of information would you let them see?
- Is there anyone else?
- Do you have any concerns about this feature?

## Intercept C: Security key
### 5 minutes

I’d like to get your feedback on an idea we’re exploring to help make online services more secure for Veterans.

- Do you use multi-factor authentication?
- For example, to access your bank account?

[If yes to using multi-factor authentication] I’d like to learn more about how you use multi-factor authentication.

- What do you use multi-factor authentication for?
- Did you set this up yourself?
- Do you find it easy to do?

[If no to using multi-factor authentication] I know you haven’t used it before, but I’d like to talk to you about multi-factor authentication today.

- Have you ever heard of multi-factor authentication?
- Do you know its purpose?
- How do you feel if I ask you to set up multi-factor authentication?
- So, multi-factor authentication is an additional security check. And you can set it up a number of different ways. One way is by using security keys.
- Have you heard of security keys?

Security keys are small devices like this that can be plugged into a computer or held close to a smart phone. This is one way you can set up multi-factor authentication.

**Show security key**

- If the VA offered you a security key to use, would you be interested in trying it?
- What questions do you have about security keys?
- Do you know where you would insert a security key, let’s say into your computer at home?
- Where would you plan on keeping this? Would you be concerned about losing it?
- If it could clip onto your keyring or fit in your wallet, what would you think about that?

## Intercept D: Proactive creation
### 5 minutes

- What brings you in today?
- How did you learn where to come to see if you’re eligible for VA healthcare?
- How long ago did you transition (or leave the military and become a Veteran)?
- Have you heard of Login.gov?
- Do you have any hesitations about setting up a new login online?
- If I told you that today, after you meet with someone from eligibility and enrollment, you could set up a Login.gov account, how would you feel?
- How long would you expect this to take?
- Is this something you would prefer to do at home or at the VA? Why? 

## Closing

### Emergency Exit
[For an emergency with our team] We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

[For building-wide issue like fire alarm] Well, it looks like we need to cut our conversation short. Can we help you find the exit?

[Note that any compensation from Perigean will still arrive as discussed.]
