## Introduction
### 5 minutes

Thanks for meeting me today. I’m [researcher] and [researcher] is taking notes.

Today, we’re going to talk about how to login to VA services, like My HealtheVet.

Before we start, I want to mention a few things:

- This will take about 90 minutes. I’ll check the clock and if I move us along it’s just so we can cover everything.
- We want to improve some of the tools that Veterans use. So, today we’re going to show you some ideas. These aren’t real yet, we’re just trying to see how well they work for you.
- If something doesn’t make sense, please tell me. I’d love to hear your honest opinion and that’s going to help us make things better.
- If at any point I ask for you for some personal or you don’t want to answer, that’s okay. Just tell me and we will move on.
- And if you want to stop the session, either to take a break or to end early, let me know.
- Are you comfortable with me recording our conversation? The recording helps us remember everything we talk about, and once we’ve finished this study, we get rid of the recording.
- [If yes] Okay, so I will start the recording. And once I start recording, I’ll confirm that you’re okay with this.

**Start recording**

I’ve started the recording.

- And to confirm, are you okay with me recording our conversation today?

## More about you
### 10 minutes

To start, I would love to learn a little more about you.

- Can you tell me about yourself and how you interact with the VA?
- [If they mention a disability] How does that affect how you use technology or access VA services?
- [If appropriate] How has your experience been transitioning back to civilian life?
- Which VA services do you often use?
- What device do you usually use if you need to use a VA service?
- Do you have phone with you today?
- Do you have your email on your phone?
- Have you gotten your Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC)? What was that process like?
- Have you heard of Login.gov? Have you ever tried to create a login.gov account? Why did you make one? Tell me how it worked for you.
- When was the last time you went to a VA facility?

## Share designs
### 45 minutes

Thanks for sharing with me. Next, I’d like to share some ideas with you. 

### Task 1: VHIC asks about Login.gov

First, I want you to imagine that you want to start seeing a doctor at the VA Medical Center. So to start the process to determine eligibility for healthcare, you gather your information and go to the eligibility office at your local VA Medical Center.

After you finish your eligibility appointment, you walk down the hall to get your photograph taken and apply for your Veteran Health Information Card (VHIC), which you can use in the future to identify yourself for medical care.

As you’re finishing the process of applying for your card, the VA employee asks if you want to also set up a login.gov account. They tell you that login.gov is a secure way to access many different government services, including My HealtheVet.

My HealtheVet is a record portal that allows you to view your healthcare records, securely communicate with your VA doctors and refill your prescriptions online.

They ask if you’d like to spend 5 more minutes and set up your login.gov account now.

**Show illustration**

- What you be interested in getting a login.gov account? Why?
- Would you choose to set up your login.gov account while doing your VHIC application? Why?

### Task 2: Information gathering

Let’s imagine that you do decide to set up your login.gov account while doing your VHIC. So, the VA employee reviews the name, social security number and birthday you provided on your VHIC application. They ask for your phone number.

- Would you be comfortable with the VA employee taking information form your VHIC account to create your login.gov account? Why?

### Task 3: Email and password set up

Next, the employee would ask you to type in your email address and create a password.

**Show screens**

- Can you show me what you do first?
- What next?
- So, now, login.gov sent you an email to verify your email address.
- How would you check your email while you’re sitting with the VA employee?
- Can you check your email on your phone?
- Do you know the password for your email, if you needed to login on my VA computer, for example?
- Would you be comfortable logging into your email at a VA facility?
- And what about passwords. How would you choose your password?
- Do you have any issues creating passwords?
- How do you make sure you remember your passwords?
- And let’s say the VA had a kiosk where you could enter this information yourself, instead of having the VA employee do it for you. Would you choose that instead?

### Task 4: Identity proofing

Okay. So, the next step for setting up your login.gov account is to verify your identity.

We’re still imagining that you’re sitting with the VA employee. And next, they ask to see your driver’s license.

**Show illustration**

- Do you have your driver’s license with you today? Do you usually have it?
- Do you have any concerns about sharing your driver’s license with a VA employee?
- Is there another form of ID you would like to use instead?
- [If they mention a VA ID] Which type of VA ID do you have?

### Task 5: Multi-factor authentication

The next step for setting up your login.gov account is to set up an additional security check. This will authenticate who you are every time you sign in. It’s something you do in addition to entering your email and password. It’s often called multi-factor authentication.

- For example, to access your bank account?
- [If yes] Walk me through how you use multi-factor authentication. Did you set it up yourself? Do you find it easy to do?
- [If no] Have you ever heard of multi-factor authentication? Do you know its purpose?
- How do you feel if I ask you to set up multi-factor authentication?
- So, multi-factor authentication is an additional security check. And you can set it up a number of different ways.

**Show screens**

Please take a look at this screen. Here are different options for setting up your multi-factor authentication.

- Looking at these options, do you know which one you would choose? Why?
- Is there any option you want to learn more about?
- How would you learn more about that option?
- What do you think about these resources, on the side. What you click on that?
- Is there any information missing on this page, that would help you make a choice?
- And let’s come back to this scenario we’ve been imagining today. You’re setting up your login.gov account. Which of these options would you choose for login.gov? Why?
- [If they don’t know] What would you do if you didn’t know what to choose?
- If you could choose not to set up multi-factor authentication, would you? [If they would opt out] If I told you that choosing not to set up multi-factor authentication can make your personal information less secure, would you still choose not to set it up?
- [If they are concerned about technical forms of MFA] Another option we have thought about, besides these ones, is doing this by mail. So, you would go onto you My HealtheVet account and request a code is mailed to you. 3-5 days later the code would arrive and you can use it to login. What do you think about this?

I want to talk more about one of these options. Security keys.

**Show illustration**

Have you heard of security keys?

Security keys are small devices like this [show physical security key] that can be plugged into a computer or held close to a smart phone. This is one way you can set up multi-factor authentication.

- If the VA offered you a security key to use, would you be interested in trying it?
- What questions do you have about security keys?
- Do you know where you would insert a security key, let’s say into your computer at home?
- Where would you plan on keeping this? Would you be concerned about losing it?
- If it could clip onto your keyring or fit in your wallet, what would you think about that?

Okay, let’s pretend we’re going to set up your security key. We’re going to walk through these steps together, and I’d like to tell me when you’re confused or if you see anything else you want to talk about.

- After going through those steps, did your thoughts about security keys change at all?
- Do you think you would need help to set up or use a security key?
- Who could help you?

## Task 9: Set up shared access

Okay, so congratulations. Let’s imagine your login.gov account has been created. You can now use this to login to My HealtheVet and other government websites.

We’re going to imagine you are logged into My HealtheVet. And I want to ask you about a new feature.

This feature gives you the option to set up limited or full access to your account for anyone you choose. This person can create their own account and see as much of your information as you’d like them to.

**Show screens**

- Is there anyone who you have shared your healthcare records with anyone in the past? Have you shared them with them online?
- How would you feel about them having their own account instead? Would you set this up?
- Who would you choose to give access to?
- What kind of information would you let them see?
- Is there anyone else?
- Do you have any concerns about this feature?

## Task 10: Shared access reminder

Now, let’s imagine you set up shared access for ______. And 6 months later, you get an email reminding you that you set this up. The email also explains what level of access you gave them.

**Show email**

- What does this email tell you?
- Is it useful to be reminded? Why?
- [If confused] The email asks you to review who has shared access and make sure its still correct. If you want to make changes, like you don’t want someone to have access to your account anymore, it suggests how to do that.
- How do you feel about this?
- Is it useful to be reminded? Why?

## Follow up questions

Thanks for walking through all of that with me. Before we finish, I want us to reflect on some of the things we looked at and talked about.

- Is there anything that stuck out to you or was particularly interesting?
- Is there one thing you found confusing or didn’t like?
- [If they mention lots of paperwork] Is there anything that makes it feel like less of a hassle to set up a new system?
- If you were going to talk to a fellow Veteran about updating their account to use login.gov, how would you explain this to them?
- I’d also like to ask if _________ has any other questions for you.
- Is there anything else you’d like to share with me?
- Do you have any questions for me?

## Closing

Thanks again. I really appreciate you sharing your thoughts today. Your feedback is really helpful as we continue to make Veteran services easier and more secure to use.

I also want to say thank you for your service. I know that all of us in the room have really appreciated getting to meet you.

Before you go, I want to mention that Perigean, the people who set up this interview, are going to send you a thank you note with information that you can give to another Veteran if they would like to take part in future research like this.

Thank you.

### Emergency Exit

[For an emergency with our team] We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

[For building-wide issue like fire alarm] Well, it looks like we need to cut our conversation short. Can we help you find the exit?

[Note that any compensation from Perigean will still arrive as discussed.]
