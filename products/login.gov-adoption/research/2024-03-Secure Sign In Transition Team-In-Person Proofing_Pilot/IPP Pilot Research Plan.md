## Research Plan for Secure Sign In Transition Team, OCTO Identity, March 2024
## In Person Identity Proofing Pilot
### Background

Veterans Affairs has prioritized investment in the adoption of Login.gov, as well as continued support for ID.me, as the primary sign-in methods for Veterans accessing their benefits. While these credential providers offer a shared service, allowing access to VA and other government agencies via a single account, their remote identity verification success rates are low (less than 50%). The Secure Sign In Transition team, under OCTO Identity, is tasked to understand how VA’s intimacy with Veterans might be leveraged to provide simple, secure and accessible in-person verification and support for Veterans and their communities.

In-Person Proofing services provided by Veteran Affairs would mean increased access and support for Veterans to set up their new secure login and complete identity verification so they can access their benefits and services. Providing in-person proofing at VA facilities allows Veterans to get the support they need in the format they prefer while also enabling them to access several services in one place they know and trust – the VA. Given the presence of trained identity verifiers across VA sites, there are already trained experts that understand the importance of and have the ability to ensure a compliant verification process for Veterans. The product being tested in the IPP pilot features a Wizard assistant, removing the need for prior training to use the custom application. Volunteer VA sites and identity verifier participants will play a key role in the development of this groundbreaking in-person verification process, providing feedback and input throughout the process and helping the VA to ensure we meet Veterans where they are so no Veteran is left behind. 

### OCTO Priorities

The research supports the OCTO priorities:
Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov
Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
Improve the Veteran login experience
Solidify the VA.gov platform
Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey

The In-Person Identity Proofing product is a means to enable Login.gov access to services that require a verified account. Therefore, the product can be utilized throughout the entire Veteran journey. Given that Login.gov enables the ability to apply for and access services and benefits, this product can be pertinent in the “Getting Out” and “Starting Up” phase. 

### Research Goals	
1. Learn how Veterans and VA staff experience in-person proofing by simulating a real-world experience.
2. Prove that Veterans who elect in-person proofing can have an easy, streamlined, and secure experience when verifying their identity in person with a VA staff member.
3. Identify improvements for the application and service in preparation for a scaled service rollout to VA facilities.

### Outcome

The onsite testing pilot will enable the Secure Sign In Transition team to better understand the feasibility and adaptability of the In-Person Identity Proofing application and service. The researchers will learn about pain points and workarounds Veterans and VA Staff experience during the verification process facilitated by a proofing agent through the custom application. These results will then inform necessary changes to the application and in-person interactions in preparation for a scaled MVP launch.

### Research questions

1. How might we learn from a pilot if the service functions in an uncontrolled environment with organic interactions between stakeholders?
2. How might we identify usability problems through on-site testing in advance of building out the MVP?

### Hypothesis

For VA Staff:
VA staff will be able to easily navigate through the custom application and complete verification without training.
If verification is completed successfully, VA staff will experience either no change or positive change in attitudes toward the identity verification process.
VA staff will anticipate questions from the Veterans and have a standard explanation for identity verification.

For Veterans:
Veterans will be able to easily navigate through the custom application and complete verification.
If verification is completed successfully, Veterans will experience either no change or positive change in attitudes toward the identity verification process.
Veterans will understand why they are completing identity verification and what benefits it will provide to them.

Participant becomes frustrated to the point of defeat: 
Thank you for working with us today to help us learn about this pilot experience. Let’s take a pause here. If you would like, we can have a debrief to talk through some of the things that you noticed and experienced during this research session. I can also step away if you would like to debrief with the Proofing Agent.
[After debrief, if there is one] I appreciate you taking the time to participate in this study, it helps our team better understand what this service entails for Veterans and VA staff members.
