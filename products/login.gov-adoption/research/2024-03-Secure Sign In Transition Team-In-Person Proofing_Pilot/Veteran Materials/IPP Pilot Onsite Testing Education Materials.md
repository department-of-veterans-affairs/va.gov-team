Post Pilot Educational Material

Thank you for your participation in the in-person identity verification pilot. Your insights and feedback will ensure we are designing the best possible verification experience for you and other Veterans like you.

Upon the successful completion of the pilot you recently participated in, you now have a 'restricted' account, through Login.gov. This means that you can only use your Login.gov account to access VA.gov and all associated benefits and services. You will not be able to use this Login.gov account to access other non-VA government services.

To update your account from restricted to unrestricted, and to ensure that your verification will be valid beyond VA sites, you will need to verify your identity again through Login.gov or obtain a verified ID.me account. Below is a list of helpful resources to complete updating your restricted Login.gov account.

To Verify Your Identity with ID.me

After December 31, 2024, you will only be able to access VA.gov using Login.gov or ID.me. DS Logon and My HealtheVet will no longer be available as login options. If you were able to create a restricted verified Login.gov account today, you will be ready for these changes on December 31, 2024. 

-   If you were unable to create a restricted verified Login.gov account during the pilot, please review the options above to create a verified account before the changes to sign in happen.

-   Or, if you were able to successfully create a restricted Login.gov account during pilot and are now interested in creating an unrestricted account, these above options will also enable you to do that.

Thank you again for completing the In-Person Identification Verification pilot.

Sincerely,

The Department of Veterans Affairs
