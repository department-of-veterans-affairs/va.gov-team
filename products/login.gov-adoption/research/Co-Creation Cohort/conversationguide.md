## Kickoff - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Sofia, Sophia, or Svenja] and I am joined by my fellow researchers [Sofia, Sophia, or Svenja] who will be helping out with facilitation and notetaking.

Today marks the first session of a long term study where we will be discussing how you sign in to your healthcare and benefits on VA.gov. For today’s workshop, we are interested in learning more about each of you, your experiences with VA, and how you leverage your support networks when interacting with VA’s services. As this study progresses, there will be opportunities to create and suggest possible alternatives to ensure an improved experience for yourself and fellow Veterans. Your participation today will not impact your ability to access VA services now or in the future.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability or evaluating your experience. We just want to understand your perspectives so that we can better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Introductions - 5 minutes

Before we get started on activities, I would like to introduce our team here today.

[Each participant introduces themselves and how long they have worked for the VA]

Now I would like to go around and learn your names and how long you have served. I will be reading names from the list on Zoom, so if you have a different preferred name please introduce yourself with that name.

## First Task: Establishing Norms - 20 minutes
Given that the nature of today’s workshop, and future workshops, is collaborative, it is important to establish norms. Norms are commitments that we decide on together, and we each can uphold them to ensure we have a shared understanding of expectations and a safe space where we can interact with one another. We have a set of questions that we would like to talk through with you all to set up these norms. I will read a question and an example, then we will open up for discussion. If you would like to share your answers in writing, you are welcome to post in the chat, as well. My colleague will capture your responses on a Google Document as well. 

- What overarching norms are important to you when working in a group? For example, every participant’s opinion will be thoughtfully considered.
- What communication norms are important to you when working in a group? For example, participants will speak from their own experience.
- What norms are important to you during meetings? For example, participants will listen without interrupting.
- Does everyone feel comfortable with the norms we have brainstormed? Does anyone have anything else they would like to add or do you need clarification?
- Given that we are meeting virtually, we want to ensure that we do not miss what someone has said if there is a technology issue. For a technology norm, if someone is experiencing a technology issue we will do our best to work with that person. Another common issue that can come up is if someone forgets to unmute before they start speaking. We will do our best to notice if someone is trying to speak but please let us know in the chat or check to see if you are muted if no one has reacted to what you have said.
- Does everyone feel comfortable upholding the norms written in the document for the remainder of this session?

Thank you for sharing your thoughts. This Google Document will serve as a reminder at the start of each session of the norms we have collaboratively set. If the group needs to adjust these norms, that is an option throughout the duration of the study. As researchers, we would like to mention a few norms that would help us facilitate safe and collaborative sessions. [Read off any norms not covered such as respect, no side conversations, no interrupting, etc.]

## Introduce Activities

Today we have three activities lined up. We would like to try to get through at least to two of them and potentially have the third one take place in our next session. These activities are meant to help identify specific experiences to learn from and understand the systems of support you used as well as inform what we will explore in the upcoming workshops. 

## Second Task: Empathy Mapping Activity - 30 minutes
Our first activity will be filling out what we call an “Empathy Map”. An empathy map is a tool we use to understand the thoughts, feelings, sensations, and opinions of users as they engage with a product or a service. In this instance, we want to learn more about veterans' experiences with sign in services on VA.gov. As you can see on this model, there is one person in the middle of it. This does not mean that we expect everyone here to agree or have the same experience. In fact, we want to encourage diverse thoughts and opinions so we as researchers can gain a better understanding of the entire population. 

Instructions:
Researcher shares screen of empathy map
You will notice on the empathy map there are several sections. Each section allows us to think through feelings or factors that might be present as we engage with a VA product or service. We will go through each section and ask the group questions. There may be different responses in each section, or responses that contradict others, that is ok. As we mentioned, the empathy map depicts one person, but in this session our goal is to best capture everyone’s experience.

After each question, we ask that you share your response out loud. We will then ask you to summarize your thoughts in one sentence. We will write that one sentence in the map as a reference point and refer back to the recording to capture your entire response in the map after the workshop today. 

Questions:
- What kinds of things do you need to accomplish when you sign into VA.org?
- What do you think of when you see VA.gov or the sign on screen?
- Have you noticed any changes to VA.gov or how you manage your benefits online?
- Where are you when you engage with VA.gov online services?
- How would you describe your experience of signing in to VA.gov to someone else?
- What technologies might you use to sign in and access VA.gov?
- What do you need to do when you go online to VA.org?
- Describe who you go to for support
- Have you heard any news about VA.gov?
- What have you heard others say about VA.gov?
- Do we need to consider for someone else besides you--scenarios for them to solve/create
- Who might you go to if you needed support or clarification?
- How do you feel about signing in to access your benefits online?
- What would make it easier for you to sign in?
- What changes would you make for someone like you?
- What have been changes to VA.gov that have made it easier to achieve what you need to do?
- What have been changes to VA.gov that have made it harder to achieve what you need to do?
- When you have interacted with similar products and services that are not in the VA.gov, who do you go to in your support network for help? Why is that the same or different?


### Things to watch for:
- Some participants may speak up more than others. As these patterns come up, try to recognize the quieter voices in the room and engage with them first when presenting questions.
- Always offer a counter opinion or perspective and remind participants that diversity in thought is encouraged: “I want to make sure all perspectives are covered here so that we get the best understanding of all veterans that we can. Is there anything here that anyone would like to add to, clarify, or discuss further?”
- If there is disagreement among team members that goes on a tangent default to norms that were established by the group and refer to them while changing subjects or mitigating differences
- If someone is upset in the middle of a group discussion, say “I would like to take a moment to pause. I see that this discussion is bringing up some strong feelings and stress. In the interest of prioritizing everyone’s comfort, I would like to suggest that we move on. If anyone would like to take a break and step away for a moment though please let me know”

## Third Task: Icon Metaphor Activity 1 - 10 minutes
For our next activity, we will break out into small groups so that we as facilitators can hear more from each individual about their perspectives and relationship with VA.gov. You will be assigned a break out room so please standby as we transition.

Hello everyone. We would like you to think of a metaphor, like an object or person, that represents your perception of VA.gov and what you experience when you sign in. After you have chosen your metaphor, I will ask you to tell me a story that connects to your metaphor and why you chose it. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you would like to give context to your metaphor. As you talk, I will find your metaphor in the form of an icon and write notes on this Mural here to capture your story.

Let’s take a look at this example: Jill has chosen to represent her sign in experience with VA.gov like riding a public bus. Just like how she knows what bus she needs to take, she knows what to do to access VA.gov. Sometimes there are changes to VA.gov, just like there are changes to the bus schedule. This can make things difficult and confusing. The other day, Jill saw a message on VA.gov that she has to make a new sign in account with VA.gov. She would not like to change her routine because she is comfortable and she does not want to get lost.

Please take a few minutes to come up with your own metaphor and tie it in with a story from your experience. Try to think about how you perceive VA.gov, a story that captures a part of your sign in experience, and how that experience makes you feel. I will call us back and ask you to share so that I can add your metaphor and story to our board here.

[Participant’s name], what is your metaphor?
Why have you chosen this metaphor and do you have a story that comes to mind?
Follow up: How does this experience make you feel about VA.gov?

Thank you everyone for sharing, we will transition back to the main room for our last activity. Please standby.

### Things to watch for:
- Participants who may become emotional or upset when recalling a story.
- Affirm the person’s experience, take a pause, and offer a break if needed: “Thank you for sharing, that sounds very difficult and upsetting. Please let me know if you would like to take a pause here.”
- If there is a long pause, depending if the context of the pause is due to perceived negative feelings, ask: “Are you ok to move forward to another question”, “Would you like to revisit this topic at a later time, please let me know, “Would you like to pause”, etc. However, if the long pause appears to come from a transition between questions or waiting on another participant, transition comments from the researcher can be shared to humanize the pause.
- For the participants who end up talking about other people more than themselves, ask: how do you feel when you witness someone else’s experience?


## Fourth Task: Complaint and Thank You Card Activity 2 in Main Zoom Room- 15 minutes (10 mins for writing, 5 mins for reading)

For our final activity, we would like you to write two letters. One is a letter of complaint describing a painful part of the experience. Imagine you are writing to VA.gov about a difficulty you had when you were trying to sign in to understand your healthcare benefits. The other is a thank you note to someone who helped you through an experience that made it a more pleasant one. Afterwards, you have an opportunity to read your letters out loud to the group. 

Alternative Digital option
We are going to send you a link to a Google form in the chat. This link is unique to you and only you and the researchers will be able to view it. It will not be shared with others unless you would like to share it out loud.

Share out Google Form link for participants to write responses. They may read them out loud when finished

*Still discussing the format of response submission. 

If anyone is still working, please take the next few moments to wrap up and submit your letters. In the meantime, would anyone like to share their complaint or thank you letter to the group?

### Things to watch for:
- Give one minute time reminders and let participants know that it is okay to submit something short or not completely edited
- If participants would not like to share, this is okay
- If participants become distressed or upset while writing or sharing letters, acknowledge and affirm their feelings and offer to take a break or let them end their session early if need be. Be sure to reassure that their contribution is valued and they will still receive compensation.

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works for Veterans and is a smooth experience. If you would like to continue participating in this study, Perigean will be sending out invitations for follow up sessions. Our hope is to meet regularly and build off of what we discuss and make.  

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies).]

In addition to using the platform documentation, we will also refer to Charlotte Cesana’s Emergency response user flow to navigate situations where a participant may be in a crisis or at risk of self harm.

We plan on using the VA’s recommended exit strategies to protect our research team members:
Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
