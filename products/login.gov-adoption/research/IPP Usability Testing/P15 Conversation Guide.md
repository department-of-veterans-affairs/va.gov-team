# Conversation Guide for IPP Pilot Veteran Intake Screens Usability Test

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME], and I will be guiding you through this research session.

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to that…

Today we're going to talk about verifying your identity with Login.gov and how you would interact with a program that we’re designing to help you sign up for in-person identity proofing at a local VA medical center.


Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

## Tech Checklist

“I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Someone may have gone over a list of technical questions when you registered. I'm going to quickly run through those again just to make sure I have the right information.”
Device and browser
- Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today?
- Mac or Windows?
- iOS or Android?

What browser are you using today?

If not joined by Zoom already

- Do you have Zoom installed?

If on Zoom but can’t share screen

- If on mobile, you can find instructions for helping participants on iPhone or Android share their screen

If assistive tech is being used

- Do you have a screen reader on this device?

- What kind of screen reader do you use?

- Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.

- How long have you been using it?

- Do you know your screen reader's speaking rate (verbosity setting)? High, medium, low?

	- If high, be prepared to have them repeat anything that can't be heard or understood I may need to pause you at times and ask you what you're hearing if I can't make out what's being read.

- Are you using a screen magnifier today?

- Are there any other assistive technologies that you use?

*If the participant has low vision, they may require captions which needs to be turned on in advanced settings

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.


- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

    
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo application we created that will mimic the experience of being on Login.gov. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's not a real application, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits. This application is adapted for screenreaders, however, you may notice that this experience will differ from what you are used to on a real website. These differences are largely due to the software we used to develop the prorotype. This software is called Figma and it is a tool that designers at VA use to plan out their websites before they launch. We welcome you to point out the differences between your typical screenreader experience and the one you have today so that we improve the experience in the future. I will be controlling our prototype today and acting as your hands. You may tell me where you would like to go and you may ask me to pause the screenreader or repeat information at any time.
  
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session? The observers will introduce themselves briefly and then turn their cameras off during the session. They will also be taking notes during the session of what we discuss.**
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going.
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant, eg/ Hi, I’m ____ and I do research for VA.gov)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, this is like a fancy way of taking notes. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and rather than listing your name, we will give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, we would like to learn a little more about you.

1. Can you tell us how long ago you served in the military?
2. Are you currently enrolled in the VA healthcare system and use any of VA’s benefits?
3. How often do you go online to access or manage VA healthcare, benefits or other services?
- What kind of things do you do when you visit the VA online? 
4. How do you usually sign into the VA online?
- Do you know the name of the service you use to sign-in with? 
	*If participant is unsure, ask if they have ever logged in with a MHV, DS Logon, Login.gov, or ID.me account to access their benefits and services.


## First Task: Navigate the Intake Screens to Create a Case Number for In-Person Proofing - 15 minutes

Our team has been tasked with improving the identity verification process for Veterans when they are creating an account with Login.gov. 

Are you familiar with identity verification?
If yes, how might you explain it to a friend?

This is another definition that is used, identity verification is a process to make sure someone is who they say they are. In a moment, I'll share with you an application that we’ve been working on to help you verify your identity in-person at a local VA medical center.

We are going to do some activities today, and as we go through them I’m going to ask that you try something called "thinking aloud.” I want you to reflect on what you heard and tell me what you might do next. An example might be describing how you like to make toast. When someone asks you how you make toast, you might describe it like that you like it lightly browned with a little bit of butter and a lot of raspberry jam.

Do you have any questions about the think-aloud style I’ve described?\

Okay, now I'm going to share my screen so that our observers can see what we are talking about as we go. [pause to share]

Okay, now I am sharing my scree.

## Prototype
We are going to start off by pretending you have just made a Login.gov account and you have been prompted to verify your identity. In this test, we will pretend that Login.gov has offered you to verify online or in-person and you have chosen the in person option. After you select the verify in-person option, you arrive on this first screen.

I am going to set up my screen reader and navigate to the prototype which may sound a little clumsy. You will need to be prepared to listen when the screen reader says "link, Header". We may pause the screenreader, but if we restart the screen reader it will repeat all of the information from the page on the top. This is one of the differences between our prototype on Figma and a real website.

Make sure that you think aloud by describing what the screen's content makes you think about and about what you might do next. Between tasks, or as you speak, I may stop to ask questions. (Bullet questions are suggested follow-ups to help the moderator engage with the respondent if there are additional questions not answered while reading aloud)



Screen 1: In-person identity proofing
What is this screen telling you?
What are some actions you might take?
It looks like you’re thinking… did you have something in mind that you’re not seeing here?


**Screen 2: Choose a nearby site**
Before you get started with giving feedback you will notice that I added a zipcode here. This is because our prototype does not actually have a search function so I preprogrammed this zipcode for all participants.

- What do you need to do at this step?
- It looks like you’re thinking… did you have a question about anything on this screen?
- From your past experiences registering for an appointment and/or finding a VA location, is this what you expect to encounter?
- When picking a VA location, what considerations do you make to choose one location over another? Alt: what impacts your decisions to choose one location over another?
- Let's click the Search button.
**When I click the Search button, you will hear the screenreader read out some of the same content you heard here. Please continue to listen as there will be some new content further down the screen.**

**We are going to select the Baltimore VA Medical Center**

Screen 3: Confirm site
- What do you need to do at this step?
- How is what this screen is asking you to do different from the last?
- It looks like you’re thinking… did you have a question about anything on this screen?



Screen 4: Verify in-person
- What did you just do?
- What is the purpose of this screen?
- What do you do after closing out this screen? How do you remember what is shared here?
- It looks like you’re thinking… did you have a question about anything on this screen?

### Things to watch/listen for:

- [Does the participant understand the meaning of terms being used?]
- [Notice any pauses or confused looks and their triggers]
- [Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed]
- [Does the participant make any remarks about any UI elements or content, such as the progress bar?]
- [Does the participant have any strong reactions to tasks that are presented to them?]

## Second Task: Visualize and walkthrough expectations of the In-person experience - 15 minutes
Thank you for all of your feedback on our application. Now, I’m going to ask you to click anywhere on your screen. This will take us to the next page that we will discuss.



If you recall, the last screen that you heard in the previous exercise was the confirmation screen that you’d successfully created a case number. It told you some things that you’ll need to bring to your appointment and that you’d also get a confirmation email. So, imagine that you’ve now logged into your email and found this confirmation.

Can you tell who sent you this email?
If no, ask, what would you need to know who sent you this email?

This email is from Login.gov and includes your walk-in appointment details. Please read over this email to yourself and let us know your reactions as you read. In this exercise, we want you to walk us through what you understand your next steps are going to be and also any expectations you have for when you get to the VA medical center.

Follow-up questions:
- What would you do upon receiving this email?
- What information sticks out to you and seems the most important?
- What would you do to find out more information.
- Are there any tasks that you need to complete after receiving this email?
- Do you anticipate any challenges in following up on the tasks in this email?
- What is this email missing that you would need to successfully go to your appointment to complete in-person identity verification?
- When is this information important to receive and review? (Probe for multiple times necessary? E.g., reminders.)

## In-Person Identity Proofing Experience
I am now going to describe the in-person identity proofing experience in a step-by-step fashion. At each step, I will ask you questions about your thoughts on the intended steps a Veteran needs to take to complete in-person identity proofing. 

- Go to the VAMC that you selected in the application
	- How would you do that?
	- What would make this easy or difficult to go within 10 days?
- Locate the proofing agent. The proofing agent is a specific authorized employee who can help you verify your account in person.
	- How would you do that?
- Present your case number to the proofing agent. 
	- How would you find your confirmation number?
- Present your proofing materials to the proofing agent.
	- State issued ID, OR
	- VHIC and proof of address
- The proofing agent asks you to sign into VA.gov to complete your proofing.
	- How would you do that?
- How would you describe what you just did to a friend or someone else?
- What questions might you have for the proofing agent?
- Use Login.gov account
	- What would you use it for?
	- Is there any other information you would need in order to be able to use your Login.gov account?

Afterward, you would be mailed a letter confirming you elected to verify your identity in person. You only need to reply if you did not elect to verify your identity in person in order to notify Veteran Affairs of fraud. 
 - What are your thoughts on the letter that is mailed?
 - What would make this easy or difficult to receive a letter?
 - If someone were to receive a letter and they did not elect to verify their identity, how might they report this fraud? 


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Now knowing how the process goes, how would you describe this process to a fellow Veteran?
- After experiencing this process, could you tell us why or why not you would elect to do in-person proofing? 
- How did you feel about the steps of the verification process that you experienced today? Did it meet your expectations? Were there any surprises? Anything missing that you think might make it easier?
- Anything else you'd like the team to know as we continue improving this application?
## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Exit Strategy

### For Participant:
Be mindful of participant's behavior

If they appear to be distressed, take a moment to check in with them

Offer to bypass a question

Suggest taking a short break

If they continue to give signs of distress, offer an opportunity to gracefully exit the session.

Use a sample exit strategy

Thank them profusely for their time and feedback

Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.

### For researchers:
Pause your research activity.

You could say “I need to take a few minutes to set up the next task” or “I need a short break, please give me a couple of minutes”

Contact the recruiting team (Perigean) using the Slack direct message set up at the start of the study

Describe the scenario in as much detail as you are comfortable

As you are able, be available to answer questions.
If it’s best for you to end your participation in the session and you’ve set it ahead of time, hand off session to a backup moderator.
e.g “for this next part, [researcher] will take over”

If it’s best to end the session, gracefully close the session with one of your practiced exit strategies.

Let the participant know that the recruiting team will follow up with them.

Inform the recruiting team that the session has been ended.

When the session has ended

Take care of your mental and emotional health

Being made to feel unsafe or uncomfortable during research can be a traumatizing experience

Take time to pause and assess your own energy, emotional comfort, and capacity

Let your team know if you need any support.
Consider a debrief with your team and/or the observers on the call as on opportunity to acknowledge this experience and consider how we can better support researchers and participants moving forward.

### Sample exit strategies
We recommend you plan a graceful exit strategy that you will feel comfortable using during a session. Your goal is to simply wrap up the session without any further incident or escalation. It is important not to blame the participant, since it could increase any distress or trauma they are experiencing. If you are exiting for a reason on your side, it’s best not to share any personal details, as it may create additional stress for all. Examples of exit strategies that have worked include:

Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
