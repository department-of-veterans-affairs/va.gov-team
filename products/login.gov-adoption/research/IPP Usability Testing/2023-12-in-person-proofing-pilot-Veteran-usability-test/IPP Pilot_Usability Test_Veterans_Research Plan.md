## In-Person Identity Proofing Usability Test for Veterans
## Login.gov Adoption Team

### Background

Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to offer more digital services to ensure access and security for all Veterans. In order to achieve increased security measures for VA.gov, Veterans will need to  create modern credentials, such as Login.gov, which require verification of one's identity. However, the process of remote identity verification can be very confusing and frustrating, and it has a high chance of failure. Through [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research) and [literature review,](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/In-Person%20Identity%20Proofing%20Literature%20Review_11.9.2023.md) Login.gov Adoption has identified that in-person support is not only desired by Veterans, but it is needed to help many subpopulations of Veterans to verify their identity successfully. For example, Veterans that are not comfortable with processes involving photographing and uploading a digital image. Currently, VA has sites set up so that Veterans may verify their identity for specific services, such as MHV premium. However, the process of identity verification has been found to be inconsistent and unregulated across sites. Login.gov has developed identity proofing services at United States Postal Service sites which are made available to those who have failed remote proofing.

In order to support Veterans who may be unable to verify their identity remotely, Office of the Chief Technology Officer has tasked the Login.gov Adoption team with creating a custom service that meets NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) guidelines, [800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/ial2remote/), and enables Veterans to complete identity verification in person at VA facilities. The service consists of an In-Person Identity Proofing custom application and an appointment at a VAMC with a designated proofing agent. The custom application is a new product that will allow proofing agents to validate proofing documents and use the Identity Toolkit to help Veterans complete identity verification at VA sites. Login.gov Adoption is a team within OCTO Identity and is working in partnership with Login.gov.

Login.gov Adoption is in the process of conducting an AOA (Assessment of Alternatives) to determine the host platform with VA.gov and Login.gov.

### OCTO Priorities

The research supports the OCTO priorities:

-   Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online.

-   Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov.

-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

-   Improve the Veteran login experience

-   Solidify the VA.gov platform

-   Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

-   Drive OIT's Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey

The In-Person Identity Proofing product is a means to enable Login.gov access. Therefore, the product can be applicable throughout the entire Veteran journey. Given that Login.gov enables the ability to apply for and access services and benefits, this product can be pertinent in the "Getting Out" and "Starting Up" phase. 

### Goals

1.  Evaluate the usability of the Veteran-facing side of the In-Person Identity Proofing application to identify opportunities for improvement and enhance the user experience.

2.  Test the in-person proofing application process with 10 Veteran participants within a two-week timeframe.

3.  Conduct the usability test and complete the analysis within one month to inform design changes before on-site testing. 

### Outcomes

The usability testing will enable the Login.gov Adoption team to better understand Veterans' pain points and perceptions of the In-Person Identity Proofing application. The researchers will also learn about what the Veteran needs from their interaction with the proofing agent to successfully verify and have a satisfactory experience. These results will then inform necessary changes to the application and in-person interactions in preparation for on-site testing. 

### Research Questions

How might we ensure a positive and informative proofing experience for the Veteran?

How might we improve the usability of the application for Veterans?

How might we ease the anxiety/burden for Veterans when they aren't successful in verifying their identity?

How might we make failure to verify one's identity remotely more palatable for Veterans?

### Hypothesis

1.  Veterans will be able to easily navigate through the custom application to complete in-person verification. 

2.  Veterans will report positive feedback for the custom application design and flow.

3.  Veterans will need verbal explanations from the proofing agent to understand what In-Person Identity Proofing is and what kind of access it will grant them.

4.  Giving Veterans 10 days to go to a VA facility for a walk-in appointment to verify their identity will make it easier for them to complete identity verification.

5.  If verification is completed successfully, Veterans will experience either no change or a positive change in attitude toward identity verification.

6.  If verification is completed successfully, Veterans will experience a positive change in attitude toward VA's ability to provide services.

7.  Veterans who may have been unable to complete or experienced difficulty with remote verification in the past will report positive feedback about the availability of an in-person verification service.

### Methods

The participants will complete a usability test with the In-Person Identity Proofing custom application in a Quality Assurance Environment that will be recorded on Zoom. Usability testing is most appropriate given there is opportunity to improve the prototype through this evaluative research.

Before participants are given access to the custom application, they will be briefed on the Think Aloud technique. This will ensure that as participants navigate through the screens, they will share their thoughts out loud in addition to providing responses to prompts and questions from the moderator. The questions asked by the moderator are intended to investigate how well the Veteran understands the purpose of each screen, any reactions to what the Veteran sees, and whether the Veteran is experiencing any doubt or confusion.

After evaluating the usability of the prototype, the researcher will then ask follow-up questions about how the Veteran anticipates preparing and attending their In-Person Identity Proofing session with the proofing agent. This series of questions is intended to test how well the prototype prepares the Veteran for their in-person session. These questions will also provide us with information about what the proofing agent needs to do for the Veteran to be successful and satisfied with the proofing process.

### Location

Login.gov Adoption team will conduct remote research sessions in Zoom. The participant should use either a computer, tablet or a mobile phone and be willing to share their screen.
