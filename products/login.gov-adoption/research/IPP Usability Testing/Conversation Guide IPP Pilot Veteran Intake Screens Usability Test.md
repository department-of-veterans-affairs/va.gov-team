# Conversation Guide for IPP Pilot Veteran Intake Screens Usability Test

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to that…

Today we're going to talk about verifying your identity with Login.gov and observe how you interact with a program that we’re designing to help you sign up for in-person identity proofing at a local VA medical center.


Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session? The observers will introduce themselves briefly and then turn their cameras off during the session. They will also be taking notes during the session of what we discuss.**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant, eg/ Hi, I’m ____ and I do research for VA.gov)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo application we created that will mimic the experience of being on Login.gov. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's not a real application, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, this is like a fancy way of taking notes. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and rather than listing your name, we will give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, we would like to learn a little more about you.

1. Can you tell us how long ago you served in the military?
2. Are you currently enrolled in the VA healthcare system and use any of VA’s benefits?
3. How often do you go online to access or manage VA healthcare, benefits or other services?
- What kind of things do you do when you visit the VA online? 
4. How do you usually sign into the VA online?
- Do you know the name of the service you use to sign-in with? 
	*If participant is unsure, ask if they have ever logged in with a MHV, DS Logon, Login.gov, or ID.me account to access their benefits and services.


## First Task: Navigate the Intake Screens to Create a Case Number for In-Person Proofing - 15 minutes

Our team has been tasked with improving the identity verification process for Veterans when they are creating an account with Login.gov. 

Are you familiar with identity verification?
If yes, how might you explain it to a friend?

This is another definition that is used, identity verification is a process to make sure someone is who they say they are. In a moment, I'll share with you an application that we’ve been working on to help you verify your identity in-person at a local VA medical center.

You’ll be asked to complete certain tasks on screen. As you attempt to complete these tasks, I’m going to ask that you try something called "thinking aloud.” I want you to try narrating what you see in front of you and what you might do. An example I like to give, is if someone gave me a task of calling a friend and asked me to think aloud while I do it.

"I'm pulling out my cell phone from my pocket. I see the time on the screen and I swipe up to unlock it. I'm looking for the cell phone icon and then I select that. Now I see my contact list and I scroll to my friend's name. I select that, I now see the call button and click that to make a call."

Do you have any questions about the think-aloud style I’ve described?

I'm going to send you a link in the zoom chat. Please open it up in a web browser, and then let me know once you see it. [Pause for confirmation]

Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen on Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together.

[Zoom Share Screen Directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

<br>Please read the directions, think aloud, and walk me through your thought process as you complete the task of signing up for in-person identity verification. Between tasks, or as you speak, I may stop to ask questions. (Bullet questions are suggested follow-ups to help the moderator engage with the respondent if there are additional questions not answered while reading aloud)



**Screen 1: In-person identity proofing**
- What is this screen telling you?
- What are some actions you might take?
- It looks like you’re thinking… did you have something in mind that you’re not seeing here?


**Screen 2: Choose a nearby site**
- What do you need to do at this step?
- It looks like you’re thinking… did you have something in mind that you’re not seeing here?
- If they have not tried typing in a zip code or have typed in one that does not correspond to the hardcoded sites, the researcher should say: “Try typing in 21201 or 21218”
- From your past experiences registering for an appointment and/or finding a VA location, is this what you expect to see?
- When picking a VA location, what considerations do you make to choose one location over another? Alt: what impacts your decisions to choose one location over another?



**Screen 3: Confirm site**
- What do you need to do at this step?
- How is what this screen is asking you to do different from the last?
- It looks like you’re thinking… did you have something in mind that you’re not seeing here?



**Screen 4: Verify in-person**
- What did you just do?
- What is the purpose of this screen?
- What do you do after closing out this screen? How do you remember what is shared here?
- It looks like you’re thinking… did you have something in mind that you’re not seeing here?

### Things to watch/listen for:

- [Does the participant understand the meaning of terms being used?]
- [Notice any pauses or confused looks and their triggers]
- [Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed]
- [Does the participant make any remarks about any UI elements or content, such as the progress bar?]
- [Does the participant have any strong reactions to tasks that are presented to them?]

## Second Task: Visualize and walkthrough expectations of the In-person experience - 15 minutes
Thank you for all of your feedback on our application. Now, we’re going to switch gears and discuss what happens next after you’ve gone through the online process to create a case number for in-person identity proofing. I’m going to share my screen now. [Share screen of confirmation email]



If you recall, the last screen that you saw in the previous exercise was the confirmation screen that you’d successfully created a case number. It told you some things that you’ll need to bring to your appointment and that you’d also get a confirmation email. So, imagine that you’ve now logged into your email and found this confirmation.

Can you tell who sent you this email?
If no, ask, what would you need to see to know who sent you this email?

This email is from Login.gov and includes your walk-in appointment details. Please read over this email to yourself and let us know your reactions as you read. In this exercise, we want you to walk us through what you understand your next steps are going to be and also any expectations you have for when you get to the VA medical center.

**Follow-up questions:**
- What would you do upon receiving this email?
- What information sticks out to you and seems the most important?
- Are there any tasks that you need to complete after receiving this email?
- Do you anticipate any challenges in following up on the tasks in this email?
- What is this email missing that you would need to successfully go to your appointment to complete in-person identity verification?
 When is this information important to receive and review? (Probe for multiple times necessary? E.g., reminders.)

## In-Person Identity Proofing Experience
I am now going to describe what we intend to see happen during the in-person identity proofing experience in a step-by-step fashion. At each step, I will ask you questions about your thoughts on the intended steps a Veteran needs to take to complete in-person identity proofing. 

1. Go to the VAMC that you selected in the application
   - How would you do that?
   - What would make this easy or difficult to go within 10 days?
2. Locate the proofing agent. The proofing agent is a specific authorized employee who can help you verify your account in person.
   - How would you do that?
3. Present your case number to the proofing agent. 
   - How would you find your confirmation number? Where would you go if you did not have it written down?
4. Present your proofing materials to the proofing agent.
   - State issued ID, OR
   - VHIC and proof of address
5. The proofing agent asks you to sign into VA.gov to complete your proofing. How would you do that?
   - How would you describe what you just did to a friend or someone else?
   - What questions might you have for the proofing agent?
6. Use Login.gov account
   - What would you use it for?
   - Is there any other information you would need in order to be able to use your Login.gov account?
7. Afterward, you would be mailed a letter confirming you elected to verify your identity in person. You only need to reply if you did not elect to verify your identity in person in order to notify Veteran Affairs of fraud. 
   - What are your thoughts on the letter that is mailed?
   - What would make this easy or difficult to receive a letter?
   - If someone were to receive a letter and they did not elect to verify their identity, how might they report this fraud? 


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

1. Now knowing how the process goes, how would you describe this process to a fellow Veteran?
2. After experiencing this process, could you tell us why or why not you would elect to do in-person proofing? 
3. How did you feel about the steps of the verification process that you saw today? Did it meet your expectations? Were there any surprises? Anything missing that you think might make it easier?
4. Anything else you'd like the team to know as we continue improving this application?
## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
