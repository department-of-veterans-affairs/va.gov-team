## Background

Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to offer more digital services to ensure access and security for all Veterans. In order to achieve increased security measures for VA.gov, Veterans will need to  create modern credentials, such as Login.gov, which require verification of one’s identity. However, the process of remote identity verification can be very confusing and frustrating, and it has a high chance of failure. Through [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research) and [literature review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/In-Person%20Identity%20Proofing%20Literature%20Review_11.9.2023.md), Secure Sign In Transition has identified that in-person support is not only desired by Veterans, but it is needed to help many subpopulations of Veterans to verify their identity successfully. For example, Veterans that are not comfortable with processes involving photographing and uploading a digital image. Currently, VA has sites set up so that Veterans may verify their identity for specific services, such as MHV premium. However, the process of identity verification has been found to be inconsistent and unregulated across sites. Login.gov has developed identity proofing services at United States Postal Service sites which are made available to those who have failed remote proofing.


In order to support Veterans who may be unable to verify their identity remotely, Office of the Chief Technology Officer has tasked the Secure Sign In Transition team with creating a custom service that meets NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) guidelines, [800-63](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/ial2remote/), and enables Veterans to complete identity verification in person at VA facilities. The service consists of an In-Person Identity Proofing custom application and an appointment at a VAMC with a designated proofing agent. The custom application is a new product that will allow proofing agents to validate proofing documents and use the Identity Toolkit to help Veterans complete identity verification at VA sites. Secure Sign In Transition is a team within OCTO Identity and is working in partnership with Login.gov (https://www.login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/).

Secure Sign In Transition is in the process of conducting an AOA (Assessment of Alternatives) to determine the host platform with VA.gov and Login.gov.

## [Product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/in-person%20support/product-brief.md)

## OCTO Priorities

The research supports the OCTO priorities:
Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online.
Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov.
Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.
Improve the Veteran login experience.
Solidify the VA.gov platform.
Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience.
Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy.

## Veteran Journey
The In-Person Identity Proofing product is a means to enable Login.gov access. Therefore, the product can be applicable throughout the entire Veteran journey. Given that Login.gov enables the ability to apply for and access services and benefits, this product can be pertinent in the “Getting Out” and “Starting Up” phase. 

## Goals	

Evaluate the usability of the Proofing Agent facing side of the In-Person Proofing application to identify opportunities for improvement and enhance the user experience.
Test the in person proofing application process with 10 proofing agent participants within a two-week timeframe.
Conduct the usability test and complete the analysis within one month to inform design changes before on-site testing. 

*Proofing agent, in the context of in person proofing, is akin to the trusted referee needed to assess risk and ensure compliance with IAL2 requirements. 

## Outcome

The usability testing will enable the Login.gov Adoption team to better understand Veterans’ pain points and perceptions of the In-Person Identity Proofing application. The researchers will also learn about what the Veteran needs from their interaction with the proofing agent to successfully verify and have a satisfactory experience. These results will then inform necessary changes to the application and in-person interactions in preparation for on-site testing. 

## Research questions
How might we ensure a positive and informative proofing experience for the Veteran that the Proofing Agent can support?
How might we improve the usability of the application for Proofing Agents?
How might we help Proofing Agents ease the anxiety/burden for Veterans when they aren’t successful in verifying their identity?
How might we support Proofing Agents to make failure to verify one’s identity remotely more palatable for Veterans?

## Hypothesis

Proofing agents will be able to easily navigate through the custom application and complete verification without training
Proofing agents will understand the purpose of each screen and affirm the content and design choices.
If verification is completed successfully, proofing agents will experience either no change or positive change in attitudes toward the identity verification process.
Proofing agents will anticipate questions from the veterans and have a standard explanation for identity verification.
Proofing agents have methods for troubleshooting identity verification with Veterans.

## Methods	

The participants will complete a usability test with the In-Person Identity Proofing custom application in a Quality Assurance Environment that will be recorded on Zoom. Usability testing is most appropriate given there is opportunity to improve the prototype through this evaluative research. 

Before participants are given access to the custom application, they will be briefed on the Think Aloud technique. This will ensure that as participants navigate through the screens, they will share their thoughts out loud in addition to providing responses to prompts and questions from the moderator. The questions asked by the moderator are intended to investigate how well the Veteran understands the purpose of each screen, any reactions to what the Veteran sees, and whether the Veteran is experiencing any doubt or confusion.

After evaluating the usability of the prototype, the researcher will then ask follow-up questions about how the Veteran anticipates preparing and attending their In-Person Identity Proofing session with the proofing agent. This series of questions is intended to test how well the prototype prepares the Veteran for their in-person session. These questions will also provide us with information about what the proofing agent needs to do for the Veteran to be successful and satisfied with the proofing process.

## Location
The Secure Sign In Transition team will conduct remote research sessions in Zoom. The participant should use either a computer, tablet or a mobile phone and be willing to share their screen.

## Recruitment	
### Recruitment approach

The intended audience for this research are MHV coordinators. Participants have been recruited through Susan Haidary, National Stakeholder Manager, MyHealth eVet.

### Recruitment criteria
For the usability test the goal is to recruit 5-10 MHV Coordinators. 
All participants must be VA employees
All have a computer or smartphone and must be willing to be complete their session on one of those devices
During the session, be willing to share a web browser window on their device
Have a working microphone on their device
Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen
All participants must be trained in using the Identity Management Toolkit
All participants must mark that they are at least a “4” regarding their comfort of using the Identity Management Toolkit to complete a proofing task (see screening question below)
All participants must complete proofing tasks at least weekly (see screening question below)
At least 2 participants should be based in Chicago VAMCs and should agree to be volunteers for the onsite pilot research
