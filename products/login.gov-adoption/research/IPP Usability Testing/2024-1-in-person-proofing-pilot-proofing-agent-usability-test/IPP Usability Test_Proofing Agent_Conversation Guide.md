# Conversation Guide for IPP Pilot Veteran Intake Screens Usability Test

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME], and I will be guiding you through this research session.

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to that…


Today we're going to talk about assisting veterans with in-person identity proofing and observe how you as a proofing agent interact with a program we're designing as a new tool to help locate and verify Veteran identifies so that they are able to access their benefits.


Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

Tech Checklist
“I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Someone may have gone over a list of technical questions when you registered. I'm going to quickly run through those again just to make sure I have the right information.”
Device and browser
Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today?
Mac or Windows?
iOS or Android?
What browser are you using today?
If not joined by Zoom already
Do you have Zoom installed?
If on Zoom but can’t share screen
If on mobile, you can find instructions for helping participants on iPhone or Android share their screen
If assistive tech is being used
Do you have a screen reader on this device?
What kind of screen reader do you use?
Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.
How long have you been using it?
Do you know your screen reader's speaking rate (verbosity setting)? High, medium, low?
If high, be prepared to have them repeat anything that can't be heard or understood
I may need to pause you at times and ask you what you're hearing if I can't make out what's being read.
Are you using a screen magnifier today?
Are there any other assistive technologies that you use?
*If the participant has low vision, they may require captions which needs to be turned on in advanced settings

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session? The observers will introduce themselves briefly and then turn their cameras off during the session. They will also be taking notes during the session of what we discuss.**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant, eg/ Hi, I’m ____ and I do research for VA.gov)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo application we created that will mimic the experience of being on Login.gov. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's not a real application, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, this is like a fancy way of taking notes. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and rather than listing your name, we will give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**
** Please select the button that says “Got It”

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, we would like to learn a little more about you.

1. Can you tell us how long have you worked at the VA?
2. What VA sites have you worked at? Please include VAMCs (Veteran Affairs Medical Centers) and CBOCs (Community Based Outpatient Clinics).
3. Can you describe some of the tasks that are part of your current job?


## First Task: Navigate the Intake Screens to Verify a Veterans Identity 

Our team has been tasked with improving the identity verification process for Veterans when they are creating an account with Login.gov. Like ID.me or DS Logon, Login.gov is another option that they can use for signing in to the VA online. Along with improving the Veteran experience, we have also been tasked with improving the proofing agent experience when helping a Veteran complete identity verification on site at a VA. A proofing agent is a VA staff member that is authorized to help someone complete identity verification.

Are you familiar with Veteran identity verification? 
If yes, how might you explain it to a friend?

You’ll be asked to complete certain tasks on screen. As you attempt to complete these tasks, I’m going to ask that you try something called "thinking aloud.” I want you to try narrating what you see in front of you and what you might do. An example I like to give, is if someone gave me a task of calling a friend and asked me to think aloud while I do it.

"I'm pulling out my cell phone from my pocket. I see the time on the screen and I swipe up to unlock it. I'm looking for the cell phone icon and then I select that. Now I see my contact list and I scroll to my friend's name. I select that, I now see the call button and click that to make a call."

Do you have any questions about the think-aloud style I’ve described?

I'm going to send you a link [Vercel link] in the zoom chat. Please open it up in a web browser, and then let me know once you see it. [Pause for confirmation]

Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen on Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together.

Zoom Share Screen Directions, select the box at the bottom with an arrow going up. Select “desktop”. If it says you need to give permission, you’ll need to leave and rejoin. 
If they say, I can’t see you, say, “Try clicking Zoom and let me know if you can see me”. Then direct them to share screen directions
MODERATOR: You are in full screen, even though you cannot see a scroll bar you are able to scroll with your trackpad or mouse. You can try now to get used to it.
We're going to start off pretending that you have logged in with your PIV card and you are meeting with a Veteran who has come to your VA to complete In Person Proofing. We will pretend that a Veteran has come in to get their identity verified. They have a case number that is tied to their Login.gov account, which you will need to use to initiate the proofing process. Once you click the proofing agent box, you arrive on the first screen. Let’s pretend that you have asked the participant for their case number.

Please read the directions, think aloud, and walk me through your thought process as you complete the task of verifying a veterans identity in person. Between tasks, or as you speak, I may stop to ask questions. (Bullet questions are suggested follow-ups to help the moderator engage with the respondent if there are additional questions not answered while reading aloud)



Screen 1: Enter Veteran Case Number 
What is this screen telling you?
What are some actions you might take?
How would you expect to get the case number from the participant?
What would you do here to be able to continue verifying a Veteran's identity or move to the next screen? 
It looks like you’re thinking… did you have something in mind that you’re not seeing here?


**Screen 2: Confirm applicant email**
- Before you click anything, what do you notice at this step?
- From your experience working at the VA, and verifying a Veteran’s Identity, is this a step you’d expect? 
- When you are verifying a Veteran’s identity, is there anything missing from this screen that would help guide or prompt you to continue with the in person proofing process? 
- Please click the "Continue" button to go to the next screen. 






Screen 3: Validate ID 
What is the purpose of this screen and what might you do? 
What would you do first, in order to start validating a Veterans ID? 
What would you do after a Veteran provided ID?
How would you verify the Veteran’s ID and move forward in the process?






Screen 3: Fill In Information  
What is the purpose of this screen?
Is this screen and what it’s asking you to do  familiar to you based on your previous experiences as verifying a Veteran’s identity?? 
What are some of the actions you would take? Walk me through what you would do. 
Is there anything that you would expect to see on this screen that is not shown that would prevent you from continuing verifying a Veteran’s identity? 



Screen 4: Complete Verification 
What is the first thing that you would do on this screen, where would you click first? 
What are your thoughts on what you have seen and read? 
Is there anything that you would be expecting to see that you don’t see here? 
What would you do to complete this step? 
How does this step make you feel?
What do you anticipate next?






Screen 5: Verification Task Closed 
What is this screen telling you? 
Is this screen asking you to do anything else? 
Is there anything missing from this screen that would better help you communicate or serve the veteran you are assisting? 
What might you do after this screen?
How would you go about making sure that the Veteran now has the ability to use login.gov?

### Things to watch/listen for:

- [Does the participant understand the meaning of terms being used?]
- [Notice any pauses or confused looks and their triggers]
- [Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed]
- [Does the participant make any remarks about any UI elements or content, such as the progress bar?]
- [Does the participant have any strong reactions to tasks that are presented to them?]


## In-Person Identity Proofing Experience
I am now going to describe what we intend to see happen during the in-person identity proofing experience in a step-by-step fashion. At each step, I will ask you questions about your thoughts on the intended steps a Veteran needs to take to complete in-person identity proofing. You do not have to share a screen anymore.

What would make it easy or difficult for a Veteran to find you within your VA so that you could verify their identity? 
How would you explain where you are to a Veteran looking for a proofing agent? 
What would make this easy or difficult for a Veteran who has never been to this/your particular VA?
Would you use the term proofing agent?
Walking a Veteran through locating their case number if they needed assistance. 
How would you go about explaining and/or communicating to a Veteran where they could find their case number? 
What would make assisting a Veteran with this process easy or difficult for you? 
Taking necessary proofing materials from a Veteran in order to verify their identity. 
What barriers or blockers, if any, would you anticipate happening when gathering necessary documents from a Veteran to verify their identity? 
What would you do if a Veteran did not have the necessary documentation with them? 
Assisting a Veteran with Login.gov. 
What steps would you walk a Veteran through who was having trouble accessing Login.gov? 
If a Veteran forgot a password, how would you assist them? 
What would you do if a Veteran did not bring a smart phone with them, but wanted to use their Login.gov account? (i.e what support or troubleshooting techniques have they used in the past?)
Explaining the Process 
How would you explain the process that we just walked through to another proofing agent or colleague? 



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
After experiencing this process, could you tell us why or why not you would elect to use this application when verifying a Veteran’s identity in person? 
How did you feel about the steps of the verification process that you saw today? Did it meet your expectations? Were there any surprises? Anything missing that you think might make it easier?
Anything else you'd like the team to know as we continue improving this application?
## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Exit Strategy

### For Participant:
Be mindful of participant's behavior
If they appear to be distressed, take a moment to check in with them
Offer to bypass a question
Suggest taking a short break
If they continue to give signs of distress, offer an opportunity to gracefully exit the session.
Use a sample exit strategy
Thank them profusely for their time and feedback
Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.

### For researchers:
Pause your research activity.
You could say “I need to take a few minutes to set up the next task” or “I need a short break, please give me a couple of minutes”
Contact the design team over Slack
Describe the scenario in as much detail as you are comfortable
As you are able, be available to answer questions.
If it’s best for you to end your participation in the session and you’ve set it ahead of time, hand off session to a backup moderator.
e.g “for this next part, [researcher] will take over”
If it’s best to end the session, gracefully close the session with one of your practiced exit strategies.
Let the participant know that the recruiting team will follow up with them.
Inform the recruiting team that the session has been ended.
When the session has ended
Take care of your mental and emotional health
Being made to feel unsafe or uncomfortable during research can be a traumatizing experience
Take time to pause and assess your own energy, emotional comfort, and capacity
Let your team know if you need any support.
Consider a debrief with your team and/or the observers on the call as on opportunity to acknowledge this experience and consider how we can better support researchers and participants moving forward.
Sample exit strategies
We recommend you plan a graceful exit strategy that you will feel comfortable using during a session. Your goal is to simply wrap up the session without any further incident or escalation. It is important not to blame the participant, since it could increase any distress or trauma they are experiencing. If you are exiting for a reason on your side, it’s best not to share any personal details, as it may create additional stress for all. Examples of exit strategies that have worked include:
Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
