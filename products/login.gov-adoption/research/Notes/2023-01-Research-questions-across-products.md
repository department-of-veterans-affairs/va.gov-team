# Research questions across products
Last updated by @tygindraux: January 31, 2023

## Purpose
This document describes the research questions (at a high-level) that we need to answer about the Veteran and staff experience across the 4 ongoing identity projects:

1. Legacy credential migration
2. In-person support
3. Login.gov proactive adoption
5. Non-Veteran user roles

This should drive alignment and help product and design make decisions including prioritizing what research to do next, based on risk, effort and capacity.

## 1. Legacy credential migration
### Our assumptions
- Veterans can go from a DS Logon account to a Login.gov account (IAL1) and skip (or defer) identity proofing
- Veterans can go from a MHV Premium account to an IAL2 Login.gov account without re-proofing
- Veterans can set up and use an MFA method(s) of their choice
- Veterans are supported if an issue arises when migrating their account
- Veterans are aware that the VA no longer supports DS Logon
- Veterans use Login.gov and ID.me and stop using their legacy credentials
- Veterans can upgrade from IAL1 to IAL2 Login.gov accounts if they choose to
- VA staff can support Veterans if an issue arises during migration
- Login.gov staff can support Veterans if an issue arises during migration

### What we need to know
- Can Veterans get through the process end-to-end and migrate their accounts to Login.gov?
- How do Veterans who are less digitally connected set up and use MFA?
- Do Veterans understand the limits of an IAL1 Login.gov account?
- Do Veterans know where to get help if or when an issue arises?
- Are VA staff prepared to help Veterans migrate their accounts?
- Are Login.gov staff prepared to help Veterans migrate their accounts?
- Do Veterans stop using their legacy credential moving forward?
- Do Veterans understand why and how to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account?
- Do Veterans choose to upgrade to an IAL2 account?

### How we might learn this
|Research questions|Methods|
|:---|:---|
|Can Veterans get through the process end-to-end and migrate their accounts to Login.gov?|Test end-to-end clickable prototype with Veterans (including accessibility testing); Track live journey including drop-offs|
|How do Veterans who are less digitally connected set up and use MFA?|Do in-person research with Veterans (including unhoused Veterans and those with severe cognitive disabilities)|
|Do Veterans understand the limits of an IAL1 Login.gov account?|Test end-to-end clickable prototype with Veterans; Survey Veterans after they set up an IAL1 account|
|Do Veterans know where to get help if or when an issue arises?|Test end-to-end clickable prototype with Veterans; Track helpline stats (VA and Login); Track live journey including drop-offs|
|Are VA staff prepared to help Veterans migrate their accounts?|Interviews with helpline staff; Track helpline stats (VA); Track live journey including drop-offs|
|Are Login.gov staff prepared to help Veterans migrate their accounts?|Interviews with helpline staff; Track helpline queries (Login.gov)|
|Do Veterans stop using their legacy credential moving forward?|Track login credential usage|
|Do Veterans understand why and how to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account?|Test end-to-end clickable prototype with Veterans (including accessibility testing); Track live journey including drop-offs; Survey Veterans who have an IAL1 account|
|Do Veterans choose to upgrade to an IAL2 account?|Monitor legacy credential usage by new Login.gov users|

## 2. In-person support
### Our assumptions
- Veterans can identity proof in-person at a VAMC
- Veterans can receive in-person help with creating and using a Login.gov account over time
- Veterans know where to get support in-person from the VA
- VA staff can confidently and consistently help Veterans through Login.gov setup
- Veterans can set up and use an MFA method(s) of their choice

### What we need to know
- How do Veterans who are less digitally connected set up and use MFA?
- Do Veterans and VA staff know who supports Veterans in-person with Login.gov account set up and use?
- Are VA staff prepared to help Veterans in-person with Login.gov account set up and use?
- Which VA staff will help Veterans in-person with Login.gov account set up and use?

### How we might learn this
|Research questions|Methods|
|:---|:---|
|How do Veterans who are less digitally connected set up and use MFA?|Do in-person research with Veterans (including unhoused Veterans and those with severe cognitive disabilities)|
|Are VA staff prepared to help Veterans in-person with account set up and use?|Do in-person discovery research with VA staff|
|Do Veterans and VA staff know who supports Veterans in-person with Login.gov account set up and use?|Survey Veterans; Track helpline queries (VA)|

## 3. Login.gov proactive adoption
### Our assumptions
- Veterans can conveniently identity proof or create an account while they're already at a VA Medical Center
- Veterans can schedule an appointment to identity proof or get help with Login.gov in-person
- VA staff can do identity proofing at a VA Medical Center, as part of an unfinished or new Login.gov account set up
- VA staff can confidently and consistently help Veterans through Login.gov setup
- New Veterans can set up a proofed Login.gov account when they're transitioning out of service

### What we need to know
- Can Veterans schedule an appointment to identity proof in-person at a VAMC?
- Do Veterans face any issues when identity proofing in-person?
- Can Veterans complete the first steps of setting up an account at home before identity proofing in-person?
- Do Veterans have questions about Login.gov when it's introduced to them by a VA staff member in-person?
- Do VA staff know how to identity proof in-person?
- Are VA staff able to answer questions and help Veterans troubleshoot when introducing Login.gov to them?
- Do Veterans complete the Login.gov set up process after identity proofing, if it’s done at the start of account set up?

### How we might learn this
|Research questions|Methods|
|:---|:---|
|Can Veterans schedule an appointment to identity proof in-person at a VAMC?|Test scheduling appointments end-to-end flow with Veterans;|
|Do Veterans face issues when identity proofing in-person?|Interview VA staff who identity proof in-person; Do in-person observational research with Veterans|
|Do Veterans have questions about Login.gov when it's introduced to them by a VA staff member in-person?|Interview VA staff who identity proof in-person; Do in-person observational research with Veterans|
|Do VA staff know how to identity proof in-person?|Interview VA staff who identity proof in-person; Do in-person observational research with Veterans|
|Are VA staff able to answer questions and help Veterans troubleshoot when introducing Login.gov to them?|Interview VA staff who identity proof in-person; Do in-person observational research with Veterans|
|Do Veterans complete the Login.gov set up process after identity proofing, if it’s done at the start of account set up?|Monitor legacy credential usage by Veterans who identity proofed for a Login.gov in-person(?)|

## 4. Non-Veteran user roles
### Our assumptions
- Veterans can grant someone else full or partial access to their information
- Veterans can manage who has access to their account and be reminded of these accounts' permissions periodically
- Veterans are willing to set up shared access for someone preemptively (before a life-altering event makes it necessary)
- Veterans are willing to set up shared access for someone when a life-altering event occurs

### What we need to know
- Are Veterans motivated to set up shared access without the occurence of a life-altering event?
- Do Veterans and those who want or could benefit from shared access understand that this person will be required to set up their own Login.gov account (or ID.me account)?

### How we might learn this
