# CEDAR Identity login.gov/ID.me Adoption Campaign Pilot and Co-Creation Study
# Paused due to re-prioritization and team bandwidth


## Background
Veteran Affairs (VA) continues to digitize across systems and services to ensure access and security for all Veterans. The phased migration to Login.gov ameliorates barriers by consolidating platform login and increasing security for Veterans and non-Veteran users. For the digital migration to login.gov, VA is conducting a phased communication campaign to ensure that the shift to digital does not leave any Veterans behind. The phased communication campaign provides online and physical touchpoints to support adoption of modern credentials through a) self-service (including remote helpdesk support) and b) through/with in-person proofing support. Partnerships with agencies like MO offer opportunities to learn how Human-Centered Design and generative research can optimize a digital migration and phased communication campaign.

## Project Overview
A three month longitudinal study of generative research and participatory design workshops initiated by a preliminary pilot and followed up by three series each comprised of sessions. As of now, the pilot and following sessions will be conducted virtually. We will recruit Veterans and their support network to participate in focus groups and co-creation workshops. We will offer preliminary pilot participants the opportunity for continued engagement over three months. During the preliminary pilot, participants and researchers will co-create expectations and structure of longitudinal study should there be interest. Primary goal is to assess awareness and receptivity to In Person Proofing methods and communication campaigns created by MO to promote migration to a Login.gov credential. Secondary goal is to assess feasibility and Veteran and Veteran support network interest in a longitudinal study. More specifically, feasibility and participant interest in using focus group and co-creation research and design methods, and staying engaged over a period of time.

## Research Goals
### Primary
Discover new strategies, language, and channels to educate Veterans about Login.gov.<br />
Leverage trusted communities and resources to provide migration support, especially to those who display more hesitancy and resistance.<br />
Uncover jobs to be done that pertain to accessibility and edge cases.<br />
Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our iterations through rapid workshops and prototypes.<br />


### Secondary
Learn how to best engage a group of Veterans on an on-going basis.<br />
Learn about how Veterans influence one another towards adoption.<br />

### Research Questions
How might we leverage the Veteran community to increase awareness and migration to Login.gov?<br />
How might we adapt virtual and in person communication channels to increase trust and support in our services?<br />
How might we develop virtual and in person communication channels that address differing levels of hesitancy?<br />
How might we ensure that our services are well designed for all Veterans?<br />
How might we use this study’s methodology as an example for future campaigns and research for Veteran facing services? <br />


## Research Outcomes 

Refine key messages<br />
Identify key support needs and when to offer certain support aids<br />
Update communication strategy and toolkit <br />
These research outcomes will be unique to a) self service, including remote helpdesk support, and b) through/with in-person proofing support<br />

## Research in support of:
- Commitment to Digital Modernization - Veteran Affairs’ modernization initiative is a commitment to providing streamlined and secure access to all VA products and services. By researching opportunities to use in person proofing throughout digital migration the VA can ensure exclusion is reduced and possibly identify future use for in person proofing and co-creation with Veterans as a tool for research and future initiatives. 
- Executive Order on Preventing and Addressing Identity Fraud in Public Benefits Programs - These efforts will ensure continued fraud reduction and increased security for users, carrying forth President Biden’s call to action. In Person Proofing offers an opportunity to reduce fraudulence with in person verification without sacrificing the ease of creating a login.gov credential and its affordance of stronger digital service security.
- Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government - In striving to improve the federal customer experience and security, trust is an essential building block and outcome integral to the digital modernization of Veteran Affairs. Generative research and human-centered design not only offer meaningful research methods but also build trust by centering the user as both the source of knowledge and the collaborator to ensure their needs guide the work and determine its success. 

## Research Methodology:
Co-creation, generative research
We will mostly engage in a group format (up to 9 participants). Within this study, we have designated series (comprised of 3 sessions within a month) where we will engage with the same participants. In order to ensure that individual voices are heard, we may either ask for pre-work (not longer than 15 minutes or reflection/capture) or have individual heads-down time during the group sessions, preparing for discussions. The sessions will be a combination of exploring current state experiences with conversation prompts or creative activities; and envisioning desired solutions through brainstorms informed by prototypes and role play. During the sessions, we will pay attention to the inputs from participants as well as how they interact with each other, namely, who and what influences individuals and the group to change their attitudes and perspectives. Because of the longitudinal nature of these interactions, we also plan on asking for feedback on the session design, and bringing in learning from previous sessions and reporting on what they informed us.

## Trauma informed approach
To ensure the research experience for participants is respectful and supportive, a trauma informed approach will be used for both pilot and the longitudinal study. During research review through Veteran Affairs, collaboration sessions will be held in pre-research planning to review workshop design and identity structures and resources to provide trauma informed practice throughout the research process.
## Pilot
Establish an initial pilot study of three workshops for iterative engagement of Veterans and Veteran support networks in the development process and mixed method and generative research. During the pilot, participants will do workshops that allow for co-creation of expectations within the pilot and into the longitudinal study should they participate. There is also opportunity to do initial research into participant awareness and receptivity to the phased communication campaign. The pilot also allows for gauging initial interest in longer term engagement in the longitudinal study. 
## Co-Creation Longitudinal Study
The longitudinal study is an extension of the pilot and pilot attendees are encouraged to continue participation in the longitudinal study. The longitudinal study is optimal as it offers the following benefits:
  - Continuity and familiarity: Having consistent study participants throughout the development process allows for continuity and a deeper understanding of the service. Participants become familiar with the service's evolution, goals, and challenges, which allows them to navigate different topics more effectively.
  - Building relationships and trust: Long-term engagement with the same participants fosters stronger relationships and trust between the development team and the users. Participants feel valued and invested in the service's success, leading to a more collaborative and productive partnership.
  - In-depth understanding: Over time, the participants can gain a comprehensive understanding of the service, its nuances, and the various user types. This allows for more detailed feedback, targeted discussions, and meaningful insights into addressing hesitancies and meeting user needs.
  - Iterative improvements: By involving the same participants throughout the development process, we are able to gather feedback on prototypes, early versions, and subsequent iterations of the service. This iterative feedback loop helps refine and enhance the user experience over time.
  - Efficiency and cost-effectiveness: Engaging the same participants can save time and resources in terms of onboarding and orientation. The participants are already familiar with the service, its goals, and the context, allowing discussions and feedback to be more focused and productive.




## Recruitment


Each session will have up to 9 participants per session. For the duration of the study, Perigean will oversee recruitment. Over recruitment is encouraged assuming likelihood of no shows/drop out therefore criteria will be out of 9. The study is organized into a three session pilot and three series of sessions (See study session timeline below). For the pilot and three series, there will be an unique cohort recruited for each. Each cohort will need to register for each study session within their assigned series. Cohorts will be unique for the pilot and each series to increase attendance as asking participants to commit to more than three sessions can become a barrier and discourage attendance. Should Veterans only be able to attend with support network members (for example, caregiver, family member or friend), we will designate specific sessions for both Veteran and their support network member to attend. Both Veteran and support network members will still register with Perigean in order to be compensated and be able to sign up for those designated workshop sessions. See Approach to Recruit in Appendix

Participant characteristics should be distributed in a manner offering diversity in ethnicity, gender, age, ability, and housing. Given the small size of each co-creation study group per session, it will not be possible for the sample to be representative. 
### Primary Criteria

## Registration 
Participants will need to initially register with Perigean as a participant, regardless if they join at the start of the pilot or throughout the study. For each session registered participants will need to sign up through Perigean in order to be compensated per session. 
Compensation
Given a registered participant completes a 90 minute workshop, they will receive $60 from Perigean. An extra incentive may be offered to participants should they complete all pilot and longitudinal study session to encourage regular attendance. 



# APPENDIX
## Approach to Recruit:

- Identify the right participant group composition through initial recruiting sessions for each of the segments
- Establish a clear purpose for the pilot and longitudinal study; prepare brief for recruiting partners and define the specific goals and objectives of the study. Clearly communicate the purpose of the study to the participants and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities. This will help set expectations and ensure alignment.
- Define user types based on current login approach and level of hesitancy
- Recruit a diverse participant group with three users per segment (8 total)
- Facilitate open communication in a supportive and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable expressing their opinions, concerns, and hesitancies; employ different methods to encourage active participation and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to contribute
- Set up a cadence of interactions, build on the previous interaction – summarize so all participants have a similar starting point for the conversation at hand – and foreshadow future ones, as consistency and continuity is important for engagement
- Utilize various engagement mechanisms, like one-on-one interviews, co-creation sessions, async feedback/online forum, surveys
- Incorporate inputs effectively into iterative campaign development. Given this is a generative study, there will be no direct usability testing. However, through co-creation activities and discussion, participants can inform attitudes and approaches that the communication campaign can be adapted to support. Researchers will communicate the actions taken as a result of the feedback to the participants, demonstrating that their input is valued and influential.
- Acknowledge the efforts and contributions of participants, provide compensation for workshops attended.
- Stay adaptable to changes, incorporate feedback from participants into how to facilitate engagement, stay adaptable and continue iterating the approach to ensure the workshops remains effective


## Risks and potential mitigations


- Lack of fresh perspectives: While continuity has its advantages, using the same participants for an extended period might limit the introduction of new perspectives and fresh insights. Over time, participants may become accustomed to the service and potentially miss important considerations or blind spots
- Invite participants to reach out into their network for additional input. For example, participants may invited members of their support network to register with Perigean and participate in the study.
- Bias and groupthink: Maintaining the same participants can lead to potential bias and groupthink. Participants may start aligning their opinions or be influenced by the dominant perspectives within the group. 
- Actively seek diverse viewpoints and consider formats that allow for individual contribution before discussion or create break-out sessions that take power/viewpoint dynamics into consideration
- Fatigue and disengagement: Participants members may experience fatigue or reduced engagement over time, particularly if the development process becomes lengthy or repetitive. 
- Consider recruiting a larger cohort and then offering opt-in sessions
- Provide meaningful updates, addressing their feedback, and recognizing their contributions
- Limited scalability: If the campaign evolves in a way that was not anticipated initially, the participant representation and diversifying of the workshop group may become necessary.
- Anticipate ways of how to bring in other participants/viewpoints without creating alienating group dynamics
