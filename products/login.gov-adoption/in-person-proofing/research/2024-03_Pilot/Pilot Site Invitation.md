## **Participate in a Pilot with VA’s Secure Sign in Transition Team**


## **A new verification service for Veterans**

As VA works to improve security and streamline sign in options, Veterans are finding themselves in a digital migration that will change how they access their healthcare and benefits. VA has prioritized investment in adoption of Login.gov as a secure sign-in credential provider. Login.gov currently offers remote identity verification along with an in-person backup option at USPS. However, according to Login.gov’s May 2023 identity verification report, only 53% of applicants successfully completed online or ‘remote’ verification.

With this in mind, the Secure Sign in Transition (SSiT) Team created a new in-person identity verification pilot service that ensures that Veterans can upgrade to a verified account and access the services and benefits they are entitled to. We would like to pilot this service within VA facilities, where staff are familiar with the population and Veterans already visit for services and benefits. 

The SSiT team would like to partner with a VA Virtual Health Resource Centers to run a pilot for this in-person verification service in the coming months (_target March 2024_). **Will you join us to ensure all Veterans are accounted for during this secure sign-in transition and beyond? **

**Below you’ll find the requirements and procedures for piloting in-person identity verification:**


## _What does it mean to be a pilot site?_

As a pilot site, we ask that you lend us the following resources to make testing possible:



* 1-2 VA Staff Members who are trained and approved to use the Identity Access Management Toolkit (IAM Toolkit)
* At least two computers
    * One of which can be used by a Veteran to access their personal email
    * One of which a VA staff member can access the IAM toolkit and the application SSiT has designed for this service
* Wifi that can be accessed by Veterans on a guest or public network
* A semi-private or private space where Veterans may safely share their PII 
* An information desk area that permits signage for the pilot and can guide Veterans to the designated testing space

We ask that the aforementioned resources are made available for 4 business days in **March 2024**. 


## _How we’ll support you as a pilot site_

The Secure Sign in Transition Team (SSiT) will provide VHRC staff with a kick off call to review the purpose of the pilot, introduce the teams, and answer questions; and, a 60 minute training call to walk the VHRC staff of the participating site through the pilot schedule and the application they will be using.

During the study, the SSiT team will be onsite to observe the proofing process, evaluate the experience of the VHRC Staff and the Veterans, and provide assistance when roadblocks come up. **The team will only be evaluating the process according to the research goals and not the competence of the involved parties. **Members of either party may ask for assistance from the SSiT team or opt out of this study at any time.

_What to expect during the pilot_

Below are the in-person identity proofing steps we’ll be testing. Each session with a Veteran should take about 20 minutes. We expect to have 9 Veterans over a 4 day period.
