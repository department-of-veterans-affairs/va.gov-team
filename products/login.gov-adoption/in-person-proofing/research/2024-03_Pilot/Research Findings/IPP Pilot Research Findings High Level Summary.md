# In-Person Proofing Pilot


## Executive Summary

The Secure Sign in Transition (SSiT) Team coordinated a pilot of the In-Person Proofing application at the Baltimore VA Medical Center from June 10th through June 13th, 2024. During this pilot, the team conducted:



* 5 moderated research sessions with paid participants
* 11 intercept interviews with Veterans or their Caregivers within the VA Medical Center
    * Participants were compensated by Perigean following completion of interview
* 3 shadowing sessions with the My HealtheVet (MHV) coordinator, Simon DoQuang
* 5 observational studies of Baltimore VA Medical Center


## Initial Findings



* 4/5 successfully completed the prototype in-person proofing service
    * On average, the service took 10-15 minutes to complete
* 5/5 participants expressed positive attitudes toward the identity in-person proofing Íapplication and service in moderated sessions
* Across intercept interviews, shadowing and moderated sessions, many participants suggested verification should be offered as they complete other tasks at the VA
    * IPP was perceived as “too quick and easy” to be a standalone service that would warrant traveling to the VA
* IPP should be available through benefits, enrollment and pharmacies at VAMCs, as well as identification offices on bases
* IPP relies on access to Internal Control Numbers (ICNs). The Secure Sign-In Transition team needs to identify an agnostic and universal method to enable authorized VA staff to look up ICNs in order to verify a Veteran’s identity
    * Key finding: Identity Toolkit is not an universal option.


## What’s next?



* Formally summarize research findings in an in-depth report
* Present research findings at the Veterans Digital User Experience Weekly Design Sync on Monday, July 15th, 2024
* Discovery research on alternative databases for verifying the Veteran’s identification besides Identity Toolkit
