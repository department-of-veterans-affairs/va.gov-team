In Person Identity Proofing Pilot Intercept Interviews Research Plan
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Secure Sign In Transition Team, OCTO Identity

April 2024
----------

### Background

Veterans Affairs has prioritized investment in the adoption of Login.gov, as well as continued support for ID.me, as the primary sign-in methods for Veterans accessing their benefits. While these credential providers offer a shared service, allowing access to VA and other government agencies via a single account, their remote identity verification success rates are low (less than 50%). The Secure Sign In Transition team, under OCTO Identity, is tasked to understand how VA's intimacy with Veterans might be leveraged to provide simple, secure and accessible in-person verification and support for Veterans and their communities. An in-person proofing service and application has been designed to test and better understand the feasibility and adoptability of onsite verification services at VA facilities.

The Secure Sign In Transition team is conducting several on-site pilots for the service.. During the first pilot, the Secure Sign In Transition team plans to conduct intercept interviews to gather data on attitudes and receptivity towards the in-person identity verification service. The SSiT team plans to also interview caregivers and family members if possible to better understand their experiences and attitudes toward supporting Veterans with identity verification in person.

### OCTO Priorities

The research supports the OCTO priorities:

-   Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online

-   Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

-   Improve the Veteran login experience

-   Solidify the VA.gov platform

-   Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

-   Drive OIT's Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey

The In-Person Identity Proofing application is a means to enable Login.gov access to services that require a verified account. Therefore, the product can be utilized throughout the entire Veteran journey. Given that Login.gov enables the ability to apply for and access services and benefits, this product can be pertinent in the "Getting Out" and "Starting Up" phase. 

### Research Goals

-   Evaluate a Veteran's attitude and receptivity to the in-person identity verification service as a concept when they are in a VA facility rather than online. 

-   Evaluate a caregiver's attitude and receptivity to the in-person identity verification service as a concept when they are in a VA facility rather than online. 

-   Identify improvements for the application and service in preparation for sequential pilots and a scaled service rollout to VA facilities.

### Outcome

Intercept interviews will enable the Secure Sign In Transition team to better understand the feasibility and adaptability of the In-Person Identity Proofing application and service. The researchers will learn about pain points and workarounds Veterans and VA Staff experience during the verification process facilitated by a proofing agent through the custom application. These results will then inform necessary changes to the application and in-person interactions in preparation for a scaled MVP launch.

### Research questions

1.  How might we learn from Veterans and/or caregivers the likelihood of them using in-person identity verification as they are in the midst of accessing VA services?

2.  How might we learn from Veterans and/or caregivers their receptivity to in-person identity verification  as they are in the midst of accessing VA services?

3.  How might we identify pain points or improvements that are needed by getting feedback while a Veteran and/or caregiver are in a VA facility? 

### Hypothesis

For Veterans:

1.  Veterans will validate our assumptions of how the service will work.

2.  Veterans will validate our assumptions of how the service should be updated in future iterations. 

3.  Veterans will report neutral or positive feedback to the in-person identity proofing service.

4.  Veterans will report neutral or positive feedback that they would use the in-person identity proofing service. 

5.  Veterans will report neutral or positive feedback that other Veterans would use the in-person identity proofing service. 

6.  Veterans will understand why they are completing identity verification and what benefits it will provide to them.

For Caregivers:

1.  Caregivers will validate our assumptions of how the service will work.

2.  Caregivers will validate our assumptions of how the service should be updated in future iterations. 

3.  Caregivers will be able to identify ways to support Veterans throughout the in-person identity proofing service to help them successfully verify. 

4.  Caregivers will report neutral or positive feedback to the in-person identity proofing service.

5.  Caregivers will report neutral or positive feedback that they would use the in-person identity proofing service. 

6.  Caregivers will report neutral or positive feedback that other Veterans would use the in-person identity proofing service. 

7.  Caregivers will understand why they are completing identity verification and what benefits it will provide to Veterans.

### Method & Procedure

#### Method

The Secure Sign In Transition team will be conducting an in-person pilot for the in-person identity proofing application. While the team is onsite, researchers will conduct intercept interviews through the Virtual Health Resource Center when they are not conducting pilot sessions. 

####\
Testing Procedure

1.  SSiT researchers will be posted by the front entrance and help desk of the pilot site.

2.  Veterans and caregivers will be approached by a SSiT researcher and provided preliminary information to decide if they would like to participate. 

3.  If they consent, they will complete a consent form then begin the intercept interview.

4.  Responses will be recorded in written notes and recorded audio. 

1.  The participant may end the interview at any time. 

2.  The interview will be 15 minutes long. 

6.  Researcher will scan consent form and send personal information in an encrypted email to Perigean POC at the end of each study day for incentive distribution. 

#### Exit Strategy

Veteran Exit Strategies

1.  Participant becomes annoyed or frustrated*:

Let's take a pause here. I just want to check in and see how you are feeling. Would you like to take a break or talk through anything about your experience? Would you like to continue or end the session here?

*Facial Expressions: Furrowed brows, tightened jaw, clenched teeth, frowning, rolling eyes, or gritted teeth.

Body Language: Tense posture, crossed arms, pacing, fidgeting, tapping fingers or feet rapidly, or aggressive gestures.

Verbal Cues: Sighing heavily, speaking in an escalated tone, using sarcasm, swearing, or expressing feelings of being overwhelmed.

Changes in Behavior: Increased irritability, impatience, withdrawal from conversation or activities, or decreased productivity.

Physical Symptoms: Increased heart rate, flushed face, sweating, shallow breathing, or trembling hands.

It's important to note that not everyone displays frustration in the same way, and some individuals may internalize their feelings rather than showing visible signs. Understanding these signs can help in effectively addressing and managing frustration in oneself and others.

1.  Participant becomes frustrated and unable to continue*:

Thank you for working with us today to help us learn about this pilot experience. Let's take a pause here. If you would like, we can have a debrief to talk through some of the things that you noticed and experienced during this research session. I can also step away if you would like to debrief with the VA staff member.

[After debrief, if there is one] I appreciate you taking the time to participate in this study, it helps our team better understand what this service entails for Veterans and VA staff members. Our recruitment team from Perigean will follow up with you to thank you for your participation and discuss compensation for your time.
