The Secure Sign In Transition team will be conducting an in-person pilot for an in-person identity proofing application. While the team is onsite, researchers will conduct intercept interviews through the Virtual Health Resource Center when they are not conducting pilot sessions.

[IPP Pilot Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2024-03_Pilot/IPP%20Pilot%20Research%20Plan.md)

Upon arrival at the Virtual Health Resource Center, speak with staff on how Veteran intercepts will be conducted. Specifically, seek responses to the following:

-   Are there certain Veterans to intercept or avoid?

I. Intercept Intro - 1 minute

Hello, my name is [NAME] I do research for the VA, would you be interested in answering a few questions about sign-in and identity verification? It should take about 10-15 minutes.

-   Yes, continue

-   Are you a Veteran?

-   Yes, continue

-   No, are you a caregiver of a Veteran? Meaning do you help a Veteran access their services and benefits through the VA?

-   Yes, continue

-   No, thank them for their time

-   Later, let them know where you will be located and for how long.

Great. In order to receive the incentive you will need to complete this consent form. The consent form includes some questions about yourself. Only members of the research team will see these responses and they will not be tied back to your personal information and we will shred these at the end of our research. Here is a copy for you. If you could please fill those out and sign at the bottom that'd be great.\
Let me know if you have any questions. [Let participant read form and have a copy available to take with them]

After finishing this interview I will share your contact information with Perigean and you should receive an incentive from them in the form of a check in a few weeks. They will call you if they need more information. 

III. IPP Questions - 15 minutes
-------------------------------

Let's get started! As I mentioned I am a part of a research team that is trying to improve the sign in experience for Veterans and making the process easier.

1.  What sign-in credential do you [or the Veteran you care for] use to access VA.gov?

-   If they don't know, ask: My HealtheVet, DS Logon, Login.gov, or ID.me

-   If they respond with either MHV or DSL ask them why they do not use Login.gov or ID.me

1.  Have you [or the Veteran you care for] ever verified your identity for your VA.gov sign in?

-   Yes

-   If yes, do you remember what you did?

-   Were you successful in verifying your identity?

-   Did you have to try multiple times? Why?

-   Did someone help you?

-   How long did it take?

-   What did you think of that process?

-   No

1.  When you are asked to provide identification for a VA service, which type of ID do you prefer to show [for the Veteran you care for]?

-   If not mentioned, ask about state issued ID, drivers license, Veteran Health Identification Card, or Passport

1.  We are designing a new service that would allow Veterans to sign up for a walk-in appointment online to come in person at their preferred VA site to verify their identity in person with a VA staff member. Veterans would need to bring in identification documents, a personal smart device to access their email at the VA, and have a 10 day window to come in. 

-   What are your thoughts on this process? 

-   Would you change anything?

-   What do you think of setting up the appointment online?

-   Would you use this service? Why or why not?

1.  Who do you think would use this service? 

2.  What if Veterans could come into the VA, without any set-up online beforehand, and do in-person identity verification on the spot, what do you think of this approach?

3.  Right now, you can verify your identity online, over a virtual call with an authorized staff, or in person at post offices, do you have a preference?

4.  As a Veteran who is in the VA going about your business, would a Veteran make time for this?

5.  Who do you think would benefit from in-person options to verify their identity?

6.  If a Veteran relied on a caregiver to verify their identity, do you think they would use this process?

-   What does a caregiver need to help a Veteran complete this process?

IV. Closing - Less than 1 minute
--------------------------------

Thank you for your time and helping us continue to improve the identity verification and sign-in experience. As I mentioned, you will have a check mailed to you. Someone from Perigean may call you to confirm your information before sending.
