## IPP Pilot Moderated Application Session Conversation Guide
### Research Session Prep
- Signage will have been put up
- VA staff informed of testing and instructed to direct Veterans to testing area
- Fake participant data, surveys and educational materials printed ahead of time
- SSiT Research team will prep confirmation email to participants coming in that day
- Conduct observations three times per day when moderated research sessions or intercept interviews are not being done. 

- SSiT research team and VA staff are positioned in designated testing area
VA staff will complete pre-pilot survey
- On first and last day, needs to be before Veteran participants arrive

Hi, I’m [NAME] thank you for participating in today’s pilot. As mentioned, on the first day of the pilot and last day of the pilot you will be asked to complete a survey. The results of the survey will not be shared with your supervisor and will not be used as an evaluation of your performance. The survey helps us understand how you experienced the service we have designed and how we can improve it. Do you have any questions?
Finishes survey; that’s it for now - you may continue working and we will notify you when the participant has arrived. When they arrive we’ll ask you to come and wait at the computer station so you are ready for them. We will be observing the session and taking notes, we ask that you try to complete all the steps on your own. However, if the technology is not working or you have tried to problem solve and are still blocked, we can step in to help. Do you have any questions?

### Resources Needed: 
- Pre-pilot survey
- Confirmation email


Veteran participant arrives and is directed to testing area 
Depending on layout, can be met by SSiT research member and directed or VA staff can direct if they feel comfortable
- Veteran greeted by SSiT research team member
- Confirm consent
- Fill in attendance tracker table for each participant

### Resources Needed:
- Attendance tracker
- Perigean consent form

Hi, are you [Participant’s name]? 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [SSiT researcher’s name] and I am part of the research team that is putting on this pilot. 
How are you today? 
Do you need anything before we get started, such as using the bathroom or water?

Before we get started, I am going to go through a checklist to make sure we are ready to go, then I will share an overview of what you will be doing today:

In talking with Perigean you should have been given instructions on what to bring today:

Perigean let me know that you signed a consent form, do you still consent?
- If no, thank them for their time and let them know they will not be compensated as they did not complete the study activities
- Did you bring a personal smart device to access your email?
- Did you bring one of the accepted forms of identification?

Record what identification they brought in table below

Great, thank you! 

### Exit Strategies 

Participant does not bring personal smart device:

- Thank you for coming in today, your participation is greatly appreciated. Since you did not bring a personal smart device, are you comfortable with logging into your personal email on our computer [show participant SSiT provided computer]. You will need to use a non-VA computer, as VA computers do not allow you to access your personal emails. At the end of your session, I will clear the history and all your personal information. 
    - Yes, continue with study
    -  No, find a time for them to come in again to complete study. Perigean will only be able to compensate you once you bring in all the required material and a personal device. Please let me know when you can come in next and we will schedule a new time now.
        - Confirm new time works for VA staff
        - Contact Perigean with what happened and updated session

Today, you are going to be going through the steps for a service we are creating for in-person identity verification. This service is not available to the public yet and we are doing this pilot to make sure it works and learn from you how we might improve it before making it available. Any action you take today will not impact your current sign-in credentials, service or benefits. During today’s session, I will be helping you complete some parts of the process and then I will have a VA staff member help you with another part. At the end of the session you will be asked to complete a survey and give feedback on some material. We anticipate the entire session and survey will take 30-45 minutes but you will still be compensated for the full two hours.

During this entire process either myself or another researcher will be observing and taking notes. We are doing this to understand how you and the VA staff member use the application. These notes will not be shared with anyone outside of this study and will not impact your benefits and services.

Do you have any questions?

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Before we get started, I want to share more about the work we are doing. Our team has been tasked with improving the identity verification process for Veterans when they are creating an account with Login.gov. Like ID.me or DS Logon, Login.gov is another option that you can use for signing in to the VA online.

Any questions?

Let’s get started!

Introduce participant to other researcher
- If main researcher must step away, the supporting researcher will step in

Walk them to SSiT computer with application opened

Veteran will be instructed to use intake application screens on a SSiT-provided computer

On the screen, you will see the web application that we have made. You may begin using the application. You will notice that this is a testing Login.gov site, meaning any information you enter will not impact your current sign-in credential. At the end of the session we will walk you through deleting this test account.

Please select, “Create an account” and the application will provide instructions on next steps. 

Please enter your personal email address and include “+pilot”. For example, participant+pilot@gmail.com 

Please select “text or voice message” for authentication and enter the number for the smart device you brought with you today

Please select “Skip for now” for setting up a second authentication method

At the end of the session, we will walk you through how to delete this test account. As best you can, try to go through the application until the end without my assistance as we would envision a participant would do  at home. At the end of this part, you will receive an email.

SSiT staff will support you if needed.

Site to set up test account: link: https://idp.int.identitysandbox.gov/sign_up/enter_email 

Have the Veteran write down the confirmation number and write it down as well
Upon completion of intake, Veteran will check email on personal smart device.
SSiT staff that is observing will email Veteran confirmation email

Confirm Veteran received email and ask them to show it to you. 

Great, thank you and now I am going to take you over to the VA staff who will help you finish the second part of this service. 

Provide Veteran copy of dummy data

When the VA staff asks for your identification, please give them this paper. 

This paper is fake information that the VA staff will put into the application that they see. This will not impact your account and the VA staff knows that the information is fake. 

If successful, direct Veteran to VA staff

### Resources Needed:
- Fake Participant Data
- Confirmation Email

### Exit Strategies

Participant unable to access test Login.gov account:

- I am so sorry, but it seems that you are unable to access the test version of Login.gov. Would you like to try resetting the password?
    - Yes
        - If participant is able to reset password, double check they can log back in
        - If participant is unable to reset password:
            - I apologize for the inconvenience. We will have you access the application using this URL
    - No
        - I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time. Here is some information on how to set up a verified account as well as support for resetting the password [provide educational material]. Ask VA staff if they would be able to assist Veteran with any further support.

VA staff will facilitate verification through the proofing agent side of the application on the VA computer with the Veteran

Introduce Veteran to VA Staff
[VA staff member’s name] will now help you complete the second part of this service. You will not see what’s on the screen but they will ask you for your identification documents. Remember to give the piece of paper with the fake information to the VA staff when they first ask for your identity documents. The VA staff knows this is fake information. 
The VA staff will ask for your first name, last name, and possibly your social security number later on in the session; this will be to look you up in an official VA application, not the prototype application. My colleague and I will only be observing, so feel free to pretend we’re not here. As best you can, see if you both can complete this part together.
Unmoderated unless major issues occur and SSiT team member will step in
SSiT team member will observe exchange
Be ready to remind participant to provide fake documentation and that their name and social security number will only be input into the real VA application to look them up. 
Upon opening the Identity Toolkit, remind the VA staff that they should see if they can locate the participant in the Toolkit using their first name, last name, and social security number but do not need to enter the actual Internal Control Number (ICN) into the In-Person Identity Proofing Application. 
If the VA staff cannot find the ICN associated with the Veteran tell them to continue filling out the application with the fake participant data
If Veterans want to know how their information is already in there, say the following:
VA Staff will search on a VA application for their real information that is already in the system. No new information will be put in but they need your ID to validate the info in the system. This data was initially collected when they created their sign-in credential at VA or started seeing a service provider at VA.

VA Staff is unable to access application

Thank you for your patience, let me see how I can help [SSiT research team steps in to troubleshoot]. 
If unable to fix, offer to talk through the next steps of proofing with the Veteran to get their feedback. 
If yes, VA staff can return to normal work
If no, end session and thank Veteran for their time and ask them to complete survey [may not be able to complete most of it]
After Veteran leaves, review screens with VA staff to gather feedback as with the usability test.

VA Staff’s PIV card is not being recognized to open the application

Thank you for your patience, let me see how I can help [SSiT research team steps in to troubleshoot]. 
If unable to fix, offer to talk through the next steps of proofing with the Veteran to get their feedback. 
If yes, VA staff can return to normal work
After Veteran leaves, review screens with VA staff to gather feedback as with the usability test. 
Upon completion of verification, VA staff will guide Veteran to SSiT research team for close out
Fantastic and thank you. Do either of you have any questions?
[To VA staff] My colleague will have you finish a survey
[To Veteran] You will also fill out a survey, but first let’s delete the test account. 
Sit with Veteran and use SSiT computer to delete test account (link: https://idp.int.identitysandbox.gov/sign_up/enter_email).

If they forget password and have set up MFA, can go through ‘forget password’ pathway
Veteran completes feedback survey
We are almost done, here is a survey that we’d like you to complete. The information you provide will only be accessed by the research team and will not impact your services or benefits. 
After finishing survey
Today you did not do anything that changed your current account. Veterans are encouraged to start using more secure logins, like Login.gov or ID.me that require identity verification. We have put together this information on how to set up a verified account and here is a copy for you. 
Would you like to meet with a MHV coordinator to set up a verified Login.gov or ID.me account?
Yes, direct them to VA staff
No, continue to next step 
Direct Veteran to exit
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today and try out the service. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the app and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with info that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies [Can skip if running out of time].
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

Resources Needed:
Veteran Survey
Anti-Fraud Letter

Have proofing agent complete post pilot survey
Thank you again for your help today. As mentioned, the last steps is to complete the end of day survey. The results of the survey will not be shared with your supervisor and will not be used as an evaluation of your performance. The survey helps us understand how you experienced the service we have designed and how we can improve it. Do you have any questions?

Resource: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/safety-protocol.md

As researchers, our number one priority is to keep our participants safe. When working with Veterans, it is particularly important to be aware of our participants' psychological and physical well-being during our research sessions. If you find yourself in a session with a Veteran who is experiencing a medical or psychological emergency, follow the protocol below to request assistance.
Requesting emergency assistance
Stop your research activity in order to attend to the participant.
Contact the recruiting team (Perigean) over Slack immediately. Please use the direct message set up by Lauren at the start of the study so that everyone is notified.
Include a detailed description of the scenario so that the recruiting team can respond appropriately (for example: the participant stopped responding and became listless during the interview; the participant vocalized intent to harm themselves/others). Be available to answer questions, so that Perigean can reach out to 911 or the Veteran Crisis Line as appropriate.
Follow Perigean's guidance carefully. A member of the recruiting team may join the meeting (if they are not already online to take notes) to identify appropriate next steps. They may escalate to the Veteran Crisis Line or to 911 as needed. They may give you specific instructions about how to keep the participant engaged or how to hand off controls of the session so that they can stay with the participant until emergency support is available.
After the emergency has been handled, please update the Slack channel with any relevant details.
As needed, loop in your government project point of contact (usually your OCTO lead).
Witnessing an emergency can be a traumatizing experience. Be sure to take time to pause and assess your own energy, emotional comfort, and capacity, and let your team know if you need any support. Consider a debrief with your team and/or the observers on the call as on opportunity to acknowledge this experience and consider how we can better support researchers and participants moving forward.
Creating a safe space for participants
Although we may not intend it, research sessions inherently create a power dynamic where the moderator is in control: participants don't know what questions they will be asked, what tasks they will be given, and the moderator represents the VA. Before you start your research study, consider ways that you can create a psychologically safe space for participants that shifts the power dynamic in favor of the participant.
Get an accessibility review. Our VSP Accessibility team (@vagov-accessibility on Slack) can provide expert advice on effective and ethical research design for participants with various disabilities. Ensure your research methods and conversation guide are appropriate for our participant population. Be prepared to be creative to accommodate disabilities.
Be mindful of participant's behavior. If they appear to be distressed, take a moment to check in with them. Allow them to bypass questions if they need to. Help them feel comfortable to take breaks if they need to.
Prioritize the participant over the research. Be prepared to pivot from your conversation guide and approach in order to meet your participant where they are.
Give participants an exit strategy. In your conversation guide, be sure to tell participants that they can pause or stop the session at any time, no questions asked. For example: "If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop." During the session, offer participants who are in distress an opportunity to gracefully exit the session. Thank them profusely for their feedback or for making the time to talk to you. Go to sample exit strategies.
Creating a safe space for research moderators
It is also important that research moderators feel safe and secure while conducting user research. Prepare your own exit strategies in advance with your team. These may include identifying a backup moderator who can jump in if something happens to you, or drafting and practicing exits should you no longer feel comfortable to continue the session with the participant. Should an incident occur during the research session wherein the moderator no longer feels safe or capable to continue, follow the protocol below to request assistance.
Pause your research activity.
Contact the recruiting team (Perigean) over Slack immediately. Please use the direct message set up by Lauren at the start of the study so that everyone is notified.
Include a detailed description of the scenario in your slack message so that the recruiting team can respond appropriately. Do not be modest in your description; the details are necessary to determine appropriate next steps. As you are able, be available to answer questions.
If you feel unsafe and want to end the session, use one of your practiced exit strategies to gracefully close the session. Let the participant know that the recruiting team will follow up with them.
Inform the recruiting team that the session has been closed.
Being made to feel unsafe or uncomfortable during user research can be a traumatizing experience. Be sure to take time to pause and assess your own energy, emotional comfort, and capacity, and let your team know if you need any support. Consider a debrief with your team and/or the observers on the call as on opportunity to acknowledge this experience and consider how we can better support researchers and participants moving forward.

Unique exit strategies have been included throughout the pilot conversation guide at possible fail points in the pilot flow.
