**Date Presented **

Sprint 39

February 2024  

**Summary **

We conducted this work to gain deeper insights and inform design iterations on the current version of In-Person Identity Proofing. Testing was conducted remotely on Zoom using the Figma prototype of Veteran facing In-Person Identity Proofing screens. 

**Value Add**

Testing the custom application further supported the solution that the design and research team presented.

**Date Presented **

Sprint 42

March 2024

**Summary **

To gain deeper insights and inform design iterations on the current version of In-Person Identity Proofing. Testing was conducted remotely on Zoom using the Figma prototype of proofing agent In-Person Identity Proofing screens. Proofing agents are the authorized VA staff that would facilitate in-person proofing.

**Value Add **

Without conducting Proofing Agent usability testing, the design team would have been unable to conclude that the custom application design would meet future proofing agent requirements and address common pain points that they currently experience when verifying Veterans identities In person.

Sprint 36

**Summary **

To gain deeper insights and inform design iterations on the current version of In-Person Identity Proofing for participants using screen readers. Testing was conducted using a Figma prototype of Veteran facing In-Person Identity Proofing screens. 

**Value Add**

Without conducting this test, the design and research team would have been unable to ensure that our custom application meets accessibility requirements and that the application could be used by those individuals requiring assistive technology.
