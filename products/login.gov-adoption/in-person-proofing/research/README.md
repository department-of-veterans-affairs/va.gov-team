## In-Person-Proofing Research Activity Log

### In-Person Identity Proofing On Site Signage


#### Deliverables

[In-Person Identity Proofing Signage ](https://www.figma.com/design/HdYyoAYefTSyHNjVuUdT2I/IPP-Pilot-Materials?node-id=2%3A325&t=xxBcZWXuSmgi1OEK-1)

#### Date Presented 

Not Presented

Work completed in Sprint 42, March 2024; updated in May 2024 due to change in pilot location

#### Summary

Signage to be printed and posted around the pilot site to help with way finding to the pilot site.

 
#### Value Add

It is a visual to help with way finding and assist Veterans with locating the pilot site to avoid delay or confusion for research participants.

### Subject Matter Expert (SME) Interviews 

#### Deliverables

[Research Report ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/in-person-proofing/research/2023-12-in-person-proofing-pilot-SME%20Interviews/2023-12-in-person-proofing-pilot-SME%20Interviews-Research%20Findings.md)

#### Date Presented 

04/01/2024

#### Summary 

SME Interviews of MHV coordinators were conducted in order to better understand the current verification process and identify pain points in order to make suitable and informed design decisions.

#### Value Add

Without conducting these SME interviews, there would be little to no understanding of the barriers that VA staff currently face when attempting to verify a Veterans identity in person. Based on the insights that were gained during these interviews, the design team was able to properly design the Proofing Agent screens within the custom application.

### In-Person Identity Proofing Proofing Agent Usability Testing 

#### Deliverables

[Research Report ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/in-person-proofing/research/IPP%20Usability%20Testing%20Proofing%20Agent/2024-1-pilot/2024-1-in-person-proofing-pilot-proofing-agent-usability-test-research-report.md)
#### Date Presented 

Sprint 42

March 2024

#### Summary 

To gain deeper insights and inform design iterations on the current version of In-Person Identity Proofing. Testing was conducted remotely on Zoom using the Figma prototype of proofing agent In-Person Identity Proofing screens. Proofing agents are the authorized VA staff that would facilitate in-person proofing.

#### Value Add

Without conducting Proofing Agent usability testing, the design team would have been unable to conclude that the custom application design would meet future proofing agent requirements and address common pain points that they currently experience when verifying Veterans identities In person.

#### Date Presented

Sprint 39

February 2024  

#### Summary 

We conducted this work to gain deeper insights and inform design iterations on the current version of In-Person Identity Proofing. Testing was conducted remotely on Zoom using the Figma prototype of Veteran facing In-Person Identity Proofing screens. 

#### Value Add

Testing the custom application further supported the solution that the design and research team presented.

#### Date Presented

01/03/2024

Sprint 36

#### Summary

To gain deeper insights and inform design iterations on the current version of In-Person Identity Proofing for participants using screen readers. Testing was conducted using a Figma prototype of Veteran facing In-Person Identity Proofing screens. 

#### Value Add

Without conducting this test, the design and research team would have been unable to ensure that our custom application meets accessibility requirements and that the application could be used by those individuals requiring assistive technology.
