Research Questions
==================

-   How might we ensure a positive and informative proofing experience for the Veteran?

-   How might we improve the usability of the application for Veterans?

-   How might we ease the anxiety/burden for Veterans when they aren't successful in verifying their identity?

-   How might we make the need to verify one's identity more palatable for Veterans?

Methodology
===========

The participants completed a usability test with the In-Person Identity Proofing custom application in a Quality Assurance (QA) Environment that was recorded on Zoom. Usability testing was deemed as most appropriate given there is an opportunity to improve the prototype through this evaluative research.

Before participants were given access to the custom application, they were briefed on the Think Aloud technique. This ensured that as participants navigated through the screens, they shared their thoughts out loud in addition to providing responses to prompts and questions from the moderator. The questions asked by the moderator were intended to investigate how well the Veteran understands the purpose of each screen, any reactions to what the Veteran sees, and whether the Veteran is experiencing any doubt or confusion.

After evaluating the usability of the prototype, the researcher asked follow-up questions about how the Veteran anticipated preparing and attending their In-Person Identity Proofing session with the proofing agent. This series of questions was intended to test how well the prototype prepared the Veteran for their in-person session. These questions also provided us with information about what the proofing agent needs to do for the Veteran to be successful and satisfied with the proofing process.

Hypotheses and Conclusions
==========================

1.  Veterans will be able to easily navigate through the custom application to complete in-person verification. 

-   Partly true. While most Veterans felt that the application was clear and easy to navigate, some Veterans needed more clarification, for example, a phone number to ask questions or more details on the site. There was little to no evidence of Veterans being confused about the task flow itself, but rather that Veterans had questions about what identity verification is as a service and the benefit to them.

-   7 out of 13 participants had questions surrounding various parts of the process. In contrast, 9 out of 13 participants concluded that navigating through the custom application to complete in-person verification was simple and straightforward.

"Doesn't tell me the exact expiration date [of the 10-day window to show up in person]." (P7)

"Clear and to the point and I like that." (P5)

2. If verification is completed successfully, Veterans will experience either no change or a positive change in attitude toward identity verification.

-   Mostly true. Several Veterans complimented the online application saying it was simple and straightforward. Still, Veterans were curious if there was another way to complete verification because in-person was not perceived as a convenient option for all.

-   5 participants wondered if there was a different way to do this online since that could be faster and more convenient. 

-   1 participant (P15)  said they would choose whatever option is easiest.

-   1 participant (P1) perceived that the online component would make the in-person appointment faster.

-   2 participants (P10 and P13) did not understand the purpose of verification after completing the flow.

"It's easier if you can do it online. But everything here, do it in person, it's pretty laid out." (P2)

"You guys are making it too easy. It's really straightforward." (P3)

3.  Veterans will need verbal explanations from the proofing agent to understand what In-Person Identity Proofing is and what kind of access it will grant them.

-   Definitely True. Participants expressed the need to talk to someone in person or on the phone for several instances throughout the service; 1) clarifying information that was on application screens and where they would need to go to complete in-person verification, 2) understanding the purposes of the service and what it provides to them, 3) needing another person to validate their understanding. The varying needs for a verbal explanation demonstrate that the in-person proofing application does not provide the assurance a human does.

-   11 participants desired a way to talk to a human, whether via phone or in person

"On the other screen there were phone numbers. I would like to see that here just to contact someone " (P3)

"I would say I do like in person. Because of my experiences over the phone, say. To me it's, uh, again I don't know I'm old school that way I like face-to-face. If there are things that need to be challenged or talked about then we're there in person to talk about it and there's less confusion." (P5)

4.  Giving Veterans 10 days to go to a VA facility for a walk-in appointment to verify their identity will make it easier for them to complete identity verification.

-   Partly true. For many Veterans, their initial reaction to the 10-day window was on the whole positive, with the time allotted seeming reasonable. However, concerns were raised for those who may need to set up transportation through VA, as distance from the site and transportation availability may impact their ability to show up within the 10-day window. Other Veterans noted the impact their work schedule or unforeseen occurrences might have on getting to a VAMC within 10 days.

-   10 out of 13 Veterans explicitly commented on the 10-day window.

-   4 Veterans had overall affirmative positive reactions to the 10-day window (P1, P2, P3, P7) 

-   2 Veterans showed concern about being able to make it within 10 days (P5, P15), bringing up the issue of transportation.

-   4 Veterans (P4, P8, P9, P12) had mixed reactions to the 10-day window, citing that it was reasonable, but also there might be unforeseen scheduling conflicts that could arise and factor into availability.

"A lot of people qualify for VA transportation. That may create a barrier for some people. I know in talking to Vets, they may recommend the closest VA, but the closest VA may be 80 miles away...if you use VA transportation, you need to schedule it to see if it's even available. They may need more than 10 days to get it scheduled. A lot of it works on priority." (P5)

"It's just getting your butt there and making it happen." (P9)

5.  Veterans will report positive feedback for the custom application design and flow.

-   Mostly True. Most participants reported positive feedback surrounding the application design and flow; however, some preferred options that did not require them to go into a physical location. However, the response to the presented design and process was mostly validated through positive responses to testing.

-   Out of 13 participants, 6 participants expressed positive feedback and 3 participants expressed a desire for a purely remote option.

"[Clicks the continue button] That's intuitive by the way. Very nice." (P10)

"I think it would be wonderful to take care of this online so I can get it done faster." (P4)

6.  Veterans who may have been unable to complete or experienced difficulty with remote verification in the past will report positive feedback about the availability of an in-person verification service.

-   Mostly False. Two participants (P9 and P15) did not have verified accounts and both had a form of visual impairment. Neither one compared their failure to verify with a positive experience with our application, and both had different concerns about going in person to verify. Only one other participant (P9), who now has a verified account, commented that they would choose in person because of previous negative experiences over the phone.

"When you're blind there are situations where [receiving help from someone else] is necessary. It's just a part of the territory. It's necessary to have a sighted guide or someone sighted even to deal with personal issues in my life." (P15)

"I would say I do like in person. Because of my experiences over the phone... I don't know I'm old school that way. I like face to face. If there are things that need to be challenged or talked about then we're there in person to talk about it and there's less confusion." (P9)

7.  If verification is completed successfully, Veterans will experience a positive change in attitude toward VA's ability to provide services.

-   Somewhat true. Two participants explicitly shared a positive reaction towards the VA given their experience using the prototype, while six others expressed positive attitudes about the IPP service but did not directly comment on a positive attitude toward the VA's ability to provide services.

"No, it was too easy! This is a VA website! [laughs]" (P3)

"My reaction is this is very straightforward and commonsensical. Usually the VA goes on and on and you have to pick out the information you need. This cuts to the chase and gets to the point." (P9)

Key Findings
============

#### Key Finding 1: Verification, without context, can be misunderstood and undesired but is appreciated when set up as a simple service.

6 participants (P1, P2, P4, P11, P12, P13) expressed confusion as to why verification needed to be done in the first place and were unclear of the benefits it afforded them.

"Why do I need to use Login.gov, what services am I going to get because I use this or because I get an account? I don't even know why I am doing this." (P13)

These observations suggest continued education on the purpose of verification, and when Veterans would need to do it in general, is also needed.

2 participants (P11 and P12) were offended by the need to verify given it's not something they desire:

"I know it's called verifying your identity proofing but making me prove who I am and that I served is just another hurdle that VA can't seem to get over." (P11)

"Confirmation is fine but don't say 'election' [in the anti-fraud letter sent to Veterans after completion of in-person identity proofing] because I didn't." (P12)

As Veteran Affairs expands its requirement for identity verification they must be sensitive to Veterans' perception of verification as for the VA but not for Veterans' best interest.

8 participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, P12, P15) perceived in-person identity proofing as cumbersome given the number of steps and were confused as to why a walk-in appointment required prior set up online.

"My friend would ask 'why do I have to go online first? Why can't I just walk up and ask how I get identity verified? It takes 10 min.'" (P1)

"If I could bundle I would." (P12)

"Personally I wouldn't [go in person] it would be a waste of time unless I get lonely which happens." (P3)

Participants' explanation of their interest in learning about other verification options suggests that providing options, even bundling appointments, would be preferred as it allows Veterans to act upon preference rather than feel forced.

A limitation worth noting is that although we provided a verbal explanation to Veterans that the usability test assumed the user wanted to complete in-person proofing,  9 participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, P8, P12, P15) were still confused as to why they were being required to set up an in-person appointment instead of being given a choice to verify online.

"I would be confused because it [opening screen indicating in person had been selected] routed me to go in person instead of online." (P3)

11 participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, P9, P11, P12, P13, P15)  said that they did not understand or desire to verify their identity, however, after experiencing our service, 8 of those 11  (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7, P9, P12) reported that it was simple and straightforward. This suggests that even though verification is perceived as painful, especially when isolated as a standalone service, the experience can still be well received by Veterans.

"No surprises...If you have to show up in person, and it prevents theft, that's good." (P2)

#### Conclusion

The positive reactions to in-person identity verification suggest that Veterans are open to a new service like in-person identity proofing as it allows preference, provides face to face support and there is a growing understanding that it helps prevent fraud. Participants' lack of understanding of the benefits or purpose of having a verified account, desire to opt-in to their preferred method of verification, and their confusion as to why they cannot just walk into any VA to initiate in-person identity proofing without going on a device, illustrates the prototype nature of in-person identity proofing. Identity verification is a new practice and continued effort is needed to promote not only awareness and education for Veterans and VA staff but also integrating it into the VA service ecosystem.

#### Key Finding 2: Veterans consider more than just proximity when selecting a VA for appointments: they take into account transportation, traffic, parking, available services, and site recommendations from fellow Veterans.

When Veterans made their site selection, they were able to view a map that suggested they could use this interactive component to locate nearby proofing sites. Veterans wanted to make sure that they get to the VA in person within the 10-day time frame, so proximity is usually the most common factor when choosing a site. However, we learned that several other important factors can weigh in on a Veteran's decision.

One Veteran (P4) mentioned that the availability of public transportation would be critical and two (P7 and P15) Veterans wanted to have information about VA Transport under the site information.

"When I moved to Seattle I didn't have a car. I had to think about bus routes. Knowing that it's accessible by public transit is important as well." (P4)

"[The intake application] is saying if you can do it in the next 10 days and it gives you the address, but for people who qualify for VA transportation, it doesn't give you any information about that...A lot of people qualify for VA transportation. That may create a barrier for some people. I know in talking to Vets, they may recommend the closest VA, but the closest VA may be 80 miles away." (P15)

Five Veterans mentioned traffic (P2, P4, P5, P7, and P10) and two mentioned parking (P1 and P5) as factors they would anticipate and plan around when traveling to their in-person appointment.

"Another thing I'd be interested in is wait times. When traffic is slowest, I suppose. These are the things I think about, even just traffic. Whether it's rush hour - I hate getting stuck in rush hour traffic - I loathe it." (P5)

"I would have to find parking which is the number one problem." (P1)

One Veteran (P13) said that they would like to see what services are available at each site, which could be helpful if they were looking to complete their verification along with another appointment. Two Veterans (P5 and P15) reported that they may go to different sites for different appointments, so having the service information could benefit them as they plan ahead.

"I go to the [VAMC] on the outskirts of town because that's where the women's clinic is. So it might be nice to have something on here to where...you click on it and it tells you what services are available. So if you need to go there in person to do this you can make it a dual trip to where you can get more things done at the same time." (P13)

Lastly, two Veterans (P2 and P5) said they might rely on previous experiences or recommendations from other Veterans when choosing a site.

"If a fellow Marine says this one is better, I'll see at least which one he's talking about." (P2)

"Oh, I guess proximity to where I am [is most important]. Although what my knowledge is of VA medical centers is that some are better than others. I might choose based on that experience." (P5)

#### Conclusion

Scheduling an in-person appointment does put some burden on the Veterans to make time and plan out the logistics of their visit. Stressful factors like traffic, limited parking availability, and planning out transportation could lead to a negative experience even before the Veteran shows up for their in-person appointment. While Veterans are willing to make these considerations for the sake of completing their verification in person, it does make the overall process feel inconvenient.

#### Key Finding 3: The Veteran intake application cannot provide the assurance that another human can.

Even though Veterans reported that the intake application was easy to understand and straightforward, many brought up calling the VA or the VAMC to help them prepare for their in-person walk-in, reschedule their walk-in window, or report identity fraud. Veterans would mention this when they had doubts or concerns, especially regarding making their appointment within a designated time window. Even when a number was not present on the screen in front of them, Veterans would bring up the desire to call in which suggests that some human contact throughout the process would be reassuring for them.

"Why call in? Sometimes you want 1-1, not a computer screen to make sure you understand."  (P12)

Six Veterans (P3, P4, P5,  P11, P12, P15) mentioned they would appreciate a phone number in moments when information they expected to see was missing. During the usability test, Veterans engaged with a Figma prototype in which there was a confirmation screen. On this screen, participants encountered the address of the VA medical center they selected as their proofing site. The prior screen had more details including a map and the addresses and phone numbers for each of the available sites. The participants picked up on the omission of the phone number on the confirmation screen. They mentioned that they would call the number for their selected site to confirm the logistics (location, hours, and travel) in advance of their in-person appointment which was not stated on the screen.

"I would call and let them know when I'm coming, what time, or talk to them about the best time and find out where they're located within the facility so it's not a 'try to scramble and find out." (P15)

We also learned what Veterans chose not to mention over a call due to the implications of the language in the application. Two Veterans (P5 and P8) mentioned that the term "walk-in only" made them think they could not call to schedule their verification appointment. Without this language, they might have used a phone number to call and make an appointment.\
"Appointments are walk-in only - I think it's clarifying. I can't call and make an appointment like a DMV thing. There's not confusion, maybe I'm confusing myself now. I can't make an appointment because I'm walking in. Does that make sense?" (P5)

"I'm thrown a little by that I guess you can't call to make an appointment...What really stuck is I have a case number and is only good for 10 days and I better make sure to make an appointment, I better go in and not call as they are walk-in only. After 10 days I have to start over again." (P8)

Interestingly though, a few Veterans (P9, P12, and P15) mentioned that they would use a phone number to reschedule their walk-in appointment if they could no longer make it in person within the 10-day time frame. These Veterans mentioned looking for a phone number for this purpose even when no phone number was presented. This behavior was particularly intriguing because no Veterans mentioned rescheduling their time window online, which suggests that human contact would make this part of the experience feel more secure.

"I would go back looking at the correspondence with that email and I would look for a phone number to extend or reschedule." (P9)

"At that step it gave you an address and if you can't do it in 10 days you need to call them and let them know." (P15)

One Veteran (P1) mentioned wanting to call a phone number so that they could call in to reset their password after verifying their Login.gov account. This suggests that there may have not been enough content to tell the Veteran what comes after verification. It also demonstrates another instance where Veterans would trust another person (rather than technology) to help them overcome a concern or hurdle.

"I would expect a phone number so I can call the person and reset the password." (P1)

Lastly, when presented with the idea of a letter to report fraud, six Veterans (P1, P2, P3, P10, P11, P12) wanted a phone number to file a report in the case of identity theft.

"That letter should have a phone number. If it's a fraud letter I am not going to do anything electronic. I need to talk to a human." (P1)

"I would call that number and probably drive over at the same time. and probably panic." (P3)

#### Conclusion 

The evidence presented for this finding supports how contact with another person can enhance trust and reassurance, but it also reveals how critical that point of contact is in moments that pose confusion, concern or a security risk to the Veteran. Remote self-service solutions may not be able to resolve concerns that a Veteran may have. Rather Veterans prefer having an option to contact a person, whether it is remote or in person, in order to respond to their concerns effectively.

#### Key Finding 4: Veterans desire alternate pathways should their plans change.

The Figma prototype did not include a pathway that enabled Veterans to reschedule or cancel their appointment, an omission that was noted by participants. Veterans expressed a need for more information about what they could do or should do if prearranged plans changed. 

Three Veterans (P7, P15, P13) directly posed questions surrounding what would happen or what they could do when they encountered vague pathways during testing.

"Doesn't tell you what to do [if there is a need to reschedule], leaves people in limbo." (P5)

"You can confirm that appointment, but if plans change it doesn't tell you what to do after that." (P13)

Veterans have an idea of what kinds of content would assist them when guidance is not provided. A few Veterans (P5, P15, P12) mentioned specific content that they would expect to see when no guidance was provided.

"Just a little bit less information, they don't give you a phone number, please confirm, within ten days." (P5)

"Get the contact information and set up a time when you can go in person to get your identity verified." (P15)

#### Conclusion 

Veterans identified specific features and content that are not outlined or presented in the Figma prototype. Veterans not only identified missing information with the prototype but made very specific suggestions of what they would expect to see to make the overall experience of preparing for an in-person identity verification appointment feel more secure.

#### Key Finding 5: Veterans have different levels of digital literacy, which directly impacts how they interact with modernized UI elements that are featured in our IPP application. These elements are also new to VA, which presents an additional learning curve for Veterans interacting with the application.

We are modernizing the VA experience, and because Veterans have different levels of digital literacy, we have to take those varying levels into account when we are designing features within our application. Veterans have a wide range of outside experiences with technology that shape their individual expectations of what an element on a screen should do.

A few Veterans (P9 and P15) called out the difference between their assumptions and the actual functionality of different touchpoints during testing.

"I would click on verify at this site and then hopefully it would zero in on this address." (P9)

"I would expect whether I clicked on the words verify or the button, either would work. It's not a narrow range for the mouse to click on." (P15)

Maps may be not glanceable for every Veteran interacting with the application and are not yet a VA standard in the design system. A couple of Veterans (P9, P12) identified that the map feature in the prototype was completely unfamiliar to them. Therefore, some Veterans are unfamiliar with how to view or use these maps as a tool within the application, while another Veteran (P13) was familiar with a map as a location tool within a digital space.

"No, I've never seen anything like this [map feature], they just give you a hard address." (P9)

"My initial reaction...I appreciate the information here.. I don't immediately see where the medical centers are on the map. Might be because the screen is really small. It would make it really helpful to see on the map. It would help me see where I need to go." (P4)

#### Conclusion 

Every Veteran has varying levels of comfort and familiarity with digital tools and services. Some Veterans might easily grasp touchpoints and features in applications, while others might struggle and pause when looking at the same screens. We have to design for the Veteran which also means providing information that allows the technology to work for them.

#### Key Finding 6: Familiar experiences instilled confidence in completing tasks, but led to assumptions around functionality.

Familiarity with certain aspects of in-person identity proofing, for example, verifying identity, interacting with a map, and/or receiving an email from the VA, impacted Veterans' comfort interacting with the Figma prototype. Certain assumptions held by Veterans around how UI functionality should work and/or next steps also impacted their perception of the prototype.

Some Veterans (P7, P15, P10, P5, P12) were already familiar with the concept of identity verification from their experience setting up a verified MHV account or other experiences like going to the DMV and getting a Real ID.

"That's a very similar process to getting your utilities set up with the city. It's not very hard I'd say. I think many of us who have set up a water bill would be familiar with that." (P10)

"ok I would bring my driver's license, utility bill, this is familiar because the Real ID asks for something similar" (P2)

In some cases, this familiarity led to incorrect assumptions around suitable documentation and/or processes.

"Also a passport might also be an option than state ID. If you list them all." (P11)

"I'd give them the last 4 because it's been drilled into us not to give anyone your SSN. I do know there are Veterans who have problems with that." (P12)

"If you don't have your case number you can give them your name and email that will be enough to verify you." (P8)

In the above examples, all are incorrect assumptions. Login.gov specifically cannot take passports or other modes of identification, being restricted to State identification or Veteran Health Identification Card (with proof of address for the latter). For IPP, Veterans are asked to provide their entire SSN, not just the last four digits and the case number, there is not an alternative at this time.

Another incorrect assumption five Veterans made (P4, P5, P8, P9, and P15) was that the accordion menu on the first screen of the prototype contained fields where they would need to enter personal information. Interestingly, this behavior was observed among sighted and non-sighted participants. This suggests that the UI, specifically the accordion components, were either misleading on their own or causing Veterans to draw assumptions based on their previous experiences with forms.

"It took me a second because I thought this would be for identity proofing but it's asking me for information...I'm a little unclear if I can complete this process here or in person."  (P4)

"Right here, I'm assuming it's going to take me to one of those areas where I can verify that information, some type of form I can fill out." (P15)

Some Veterans (P2, P9, P10, P4, P15, P5) recognized the map as a friendly and familiar tool and expected it would have the same features/functionality as other maps they have interacted with. As mentioned above in the previous insight, interaction, and familiarity with the map and other UI elements were highly influenced by the Veteran's digital literacy.

"What I normally see for hotels and other things. I get an address first and then have to click on it to see the map." (P10)

"This is familiar to anyone, they use this for retail stores." (P2)

Veterans are used to receiving emails from the VA, understand how to check for the sender of an email, and have learned to become wary of fraud and phishing schemes.

"VA. Nice and big and looks just about like every other VA email I've gotten." (P4)

"It's got the official VA letterhead on it so I assume it's from the VA." (P9)

"I've been misled before...I look for language as well, actual English, grammar. If I'm seeing things that are off, red flags are raised." (P5)

#### Conclusion

Overall, Veterans seemed to heavily rely on familiar visual cues and UI elements to navigate the IPP application. This instilled a certain level of confidence in completing the flow, but also led to assumptions that were sometimes incorrect. Future iterations of the application should consider how to compliment what is familiar or provide support when introducing new components for Veterans.

#### Key Finding 7: Veterans are careful when preparing for appointments. Repetition, hierarchy, and the ability to save information to refer to it later are reassuring and allow Veterans to catch details they may have missed.

In order to be prepared, Veterans prefer to be told what to do plainly and be given all of the information necessary to complete a task upfront. Because they have concerns over forgetting things, hierarchy and repetition (including being able to save and/or revisit information) are familiar tactics that help reassure Veterans that they have captured all information and steps needed to complete a task.

Veterans want information upfront and prefer formats that tell them what they need to know in a step-by-step fashion.

"Usually the VA goes on and on and on and you have to pick out the information that you need. This cuts to the chase and gets right to the point." (P9)

"Makes it obvious to me, the reader, this is what I need to do. Instructional, step by step...I could snapshot this or write it down if I needed to. Which I've been known to do just because my memory's bad." (P5)

Many Veterans (P7, P4, P15, P3, P12, P8, P1) reported that across communication modes, either on the application screen, in emails or through reminders, they would want more information. This information must be presented as clear, specific, directions-- for what to do and where to go to find a proofing agent once they arrive at a VAMC for IPP.

"Want location, room number, the person and the hours." (P12)

Veterans tend to skim or glance over blocks of text; repetition improves glanceability.

"A lot of people won't read past three [list of documentation types listed on screen]." (P7)

Once stated, Veterans expected important information to be repeated, and be consistent in phrasing, format, and content. Because of repetition, many Veterans (P1, P3, P4, P5, P2, P8) understood the necessary documentation they needed to bring with them for IPP.

"We like line items, numbers, we don't like paragraphs. It was repetitive. A lot of people would say that's childlike but that's good for us. we have enough on our plate." (P3)

Conversely, when language or hierarchy was not consistent, Veterans noticed. This led to them being concerned and or confused, feeling like they needed to be over prepared.

"Number four should be proof of address instead of it being folded into number three because on the previous page where I signed up it had four bullets instead of three and they just kind of put in ID and proof of address all together. That makes it, you think, well I thought there were four things I need to bring." (P13)

"[Might bring both forms of identification accepted] because you might be the one who's screwed over. Ultimately I'm gonna have to go back home and come back again. Do you need your proof of address in addition to your ID?" (P2)

To make sure that they are prepared, all Veterans who participated (P1-P15) shared a desire to save information (hard copy and/or digital) they deemed as important in multiple places for revisiting later.  Despite receiving a confirmation email, they reported that they would still capture the information on their phone or print a hard copy just in case.

"I always like to take pictures, I would do that or write it down, and the date." (P7)

"I would probably screen print that so I would have my itinerary... if I printed it, I wouldn't have to worry about remembering anything that's there. Then I'd put it on my calendar to make sure that I don't forget." (P10)

"I would make sure it's in my phone calendar app." (P1)

Veterans liked, and expected to receive, a confirmation email reiterating what they had just done, the next steps, and what they will need in-person at their appointment.

"And an email... I like that because I can turn around and forget something from five minutes ago... I can add it to my calendar from my email." (P3)

"I expect this. I get a text message and I get appointment reminders through emails as well. That's a positive action I like that." (P10)

Reminders would be useful to Veterans, especially those who may struggle with memory/recollection and or/or have cognitive disabilities.

"...a lot of us have memory loss and a lot of us don't pay as much attention as we should, I would just...like on line item 2 how they reminded how that you don't need to bring in your card. " (P3)

"Reminders about this, maybe halfways through or quarter through reminder is good." (P12)

#### Conclusion

This finding suggests that Veterans consider repetition and reminders as positive ways to reinforce information and tasks to be done. They are used to receiving clear, repetitious, direct orders from the military and following through. As they age, and/or experience cognitive/memory issues, repeated information reduces cognitive load and stress for Veterans. Given their familiarity with receiving multiple follow ups from the VA, repetition should be considered as an optimal approach in communications.

Screen Reader Prototype Takeaways
=================================

Our research included one participant with full visual impairment who reported themselves to be an expert screen reader (VoiceOver) user. A screen reader prototype was created on Figma by UX Designer, Sofia Kirman, that could be read by VoiceOver to ensure that the participant would encounter the same content and UI elements as sighted participants. We understood, however, that this prototype experience would differ from a typical web experience with a screen reader due to Figma's technical constraints. As the prototype was developed, we learned that Figma does not have a standard process that enables designers to make screen reader friendly prototypes, nor are components or text consistently read out by VoiceOver as expected. The designer used [documentation](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/7810391964695-Accessible-prototypes-in-Figma) from the Figma help center, which included an [Accessible Prototype Playground file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1167124335986833540) and a link to [VoiceOver instructions](https://support.apple.com/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac), to overcome several hurdles. Since the documentation recommendations did not resolve some errors, the designer had to "hack" some parts of the prototype to ensure that the content would be read out by Voice Over.

Development Takeaways
---------------------

-   Voice Over will jump to links and buttons first before reading out text boxes, even if all elements are placed in the desired order.

-   Prototype interactions on specific elements disable the VoiceOver read out.

-   Adding an 'On Click' interaction to a button would stop the screen reader from reading out content on the following screen.

-   Sometimes content must be artificially spaced out and altered to provide a more realistic screen reader experience.

-   Text elements (such as headings and list items) must contain the names of each element before the body text to help orient the user. For example, including heading level type and punctuation was needed for the following header on multiple screens, "Heading Level 1, In-Person Identity Proofing."

-   Irregular punctuation may be used between numbers to ensure that digits (i.e. in phone numbers or addresses) are read out individually rather than as a singular number. For example, a zipcode had to be written as "2 1 2, 0 1, 1 5 2 4." otherwise the screen reader read it as 212,011,524.

-   Voice Over on Figma is not mobile friendly

-   Our participant joined over their phone because that's how the device they are most comfortable using Zoom with. Since a screen reader cannot read the prototype on a phone though, our researchers had to control the prototype.

-   Conversation guides need to be reviewed to make sure that language is inclusive. For example, do not ask about what the participant "saw", rather ask about their experience and understanding of the present screen and its functions.

-   Screenreaders may cause participants to listen to all content and elements on a screen. When sighted and non sighted participants are recruited at once, researchers should consider how long it may take to run each usability test to ensure that both groups can make it through the full session.

Research Takeaways
------------------

We learned from the participant that in person services can introduce a set of unknowns making the experience feel overwhelming or burdensome. The participant reported that they would call in advance to make sure that their selected site would be ready for them and that a sighted escort would be available. The 10 day time window was extremely critical for them due to the uncertainty around the availability of VA Transportation, which is what they would use to get to their proofing site. Even though this participant had failed remote proofing and still does not have a verified modern credential, they ultimately did not prefer in person verification over a remote option. In fact, they said an in person experience would be more burdensome. They also stated that certain tasks will always provide accessibility challenges, so in these instances, it is necessary to rely on a sighted individual for assistance.

"If I can do it online, it's easier. It's less of a burden on the other party as well. But you know, on some things, when you're blind... sometimes, it's necessary to have sighted guidance...I would do what's easiest. Just like now, if I've got to go to a place to do it, I'll do it. The question is, is anybody prepared for it at the site they tell me to go to [Laughing]?" (P15)

This statement contradicts the assumption that underserved or marginalized groups, such as Veterans with disabilities, would benefit from in person proofing. In person proofing introduces a set of challenges that are different from remote and that would not necessarily make it a better option.

In the future usability tests, our team would like to use CodePen which is more likely to simulate a realistic interactive experience for non sighted users. We would also like to continue testing the hypothesis of whether Veterans with disabilities could prefer in person verification over remote. 

Recommendations
===============

Below are recommendations for both immediate and future changes for the Secure Sign In Transition team's IPP product as well as considerations for other VA product teams.

### Key Recommendation 1: When prompting a Veteran to verify their account, communicate why verification is important and list all of the options.

Veterans did not understand why they needed to verify their account for VA.gov. Some mentioned that verification is supposed to make it easier to sign in. One Veteran shared that asking Veterans to verify can come off as the VA doubting the identity of the Veteran.

We recommend better informing Veterans on why they need to verify their accounts both in upcoming messaging and in verification services. Educating Veterans on verification is important to helping them gain and maintain access to their healthcare and benefits. Making content on verification widely available and clear will help Veterans transition to using modern credentials.

#### Recommendations

SSiT 

-   Update home screen to provide more information on purpose and benefits of IPP

-   Repeat information on home screen in confirmation screen

VA

-   Consider a pathway for verification that enables Veterans to choose from options, i.e. in person versus remote for either ID.me or Login.gov

### Key Recommendation 2: When creating in person services, consider how to incorporate that service within existing infrastructure.

During our study, we heard that Veterans would not prefer to come in person to verify their identity unless they were concerned about sharing their personal information and documents online or wished to use the opportunity to socialize. Many Veterans were curious about online verification because it sounded more convenient for themselves and VA staff.  We recommend that if VA continues to develop and offer in person services like verification, they make that service available for walk in's or bundling. Walk in's without digital set up enable Veterans to access in person verification without dependency on having, being able to access, or knowing how to use a smart device or computer. Providing this flexibility was both appealing and necessary for some Veterans. Bundling could be critical for Veterans with limited access to transportation as it will save them from planning and making another trip to their VAMC.

In addition to making the service more convenient for Veterans, we also encourage VA to provide information about in person services that speaks to all Veterans but specifically those with caretakers or disabilities. Veterans have different methods of getting to VA and engaging with the staff, so providing as much information about in person appointments up front might lower the chance of the Veteran making a phone call in advance.

#### Recommendations

SSiT

-   For future iterations, add in content that would assure populations with disabilities that they will be accommodated (space, assistance, etc.)

-   For future iterations, enable IPP as a service that can be bundled in with other appointment types at the VA

-   For future consideration, enabling IPP to be done as a walk-in service without any digital set up 

VA

-   Include information that will prepare all Veterans for any in person interaction.

-   Veteran Affairs should consider enabling Veterans to do in person verification as a walk in with no prior set up required online

-   Offer information for Veterans with disabilities and caretakers, so that they understand how they may engage with a service.

### Key Recommendation 3: When providing information about a site for an in person service, include a phone number that the Veteran may call for follow up questions.

Veterans expressed delight when they saw a phone number listed with the available verification sites. On the following pages in our application, we omitted the phone number and we heard Veterans say that they would want to see the phone number repeated. When speaking about VA locations, we recommend including a phone number for the site that Veterans may follow up with or a number to the help desk.

#### Recommendations

SSiT

-   For future consideration, include phone number of selected site across Veteran touch points in application

-   For future consideration, provide suggestions throughout application for what the Veteran can call for and what they can find out or do in the app/online

-   For future consideration, determine support system for IPP, is there an unique support team for IPP versus site that IPP is occurring at

VA

-   Once a piece of information, like a phone number or address, is mentioned, make sure to repeat that information whenever the Veteran needs to confirm or retain the information

### Key Recommendation 4: Anticipate questions or issues a Veteran may have, and offer information or self service options that can save them a phone call.

Veterans stated that they would try to show up in person right away to take care of their verification appointment, but many expressed concerns about what to do if they could not get there within the designated time frame.

We encourage that all service providers include information on their applications and supporting materials that will help Veterans show up to their walk in's with the correct materials. Helpful information could include the site's hours of operation, acceptable forms of documentation, and what a Veteran will need to do if they do not bring the appropriate documents or if they cannot attend their original appointment.

#### Recommendations

SSiT

-   Add hours for specific VAMC selected on the confirmation screen (and other screens). This will be a change implemented once a pilot site is selected. 

-   Add phone number for specific VAMC selected on the confirmation screen. This will be a change implemented once a pilot site is selected. 

-   For future consideration, add a way for Veterans to reschedule, or at the very least, reassure them that if something happens, they are able to reschedule. This could take many different forms, content or other UI revisions

-   For future consideration, include a reschedule option in the email that is linked to a rescheduling pathway

-   Be as explicit as possible when giving directions; in particular callout ID types that cannot be used

-   Make passports available as an accepted form of identification

-   Provide guidance on what will happen if the Veteran does not have their case number upon arrival to the selected site

-   Build a case number retrieval flow and functionality to retrieve case number with SSN if forgotten

VA

-   Offer clear instructions for what a Veteran should do in the event they need to change or cancel their original appointment

-   Communicate how to reschedule or cancel appointments whenever a Veteran needs to make an appointment

-   State what not to bring to appointments

-   Emphasize the importance of bringing the correct materials and showing up on time by describing the alternative outcome

### Key Recommendation 5: When introducing digital elements to a Veteran, provide instructions on how to use the tool and refer to analogous use cases.

Veterans pointed out that the map was not a typical feature they would find on a VA website or application. However, most participants did not mind it and many had experience using maps on other websites. Some had concerns that this feature would not be well received by older Veterans or Veterans who are uncomfortable with using technology. To ensure that new features can be used by all Veterans, VA should provide brief instructions on how to use new features in addition to alternative routes that can achieve the same goal. For example, a Veteran may use the map to filter their results for proofing sites, but they may also choose to filter a list by proximity to their zip code. By providing instructions VA may also reduce any false assumptions Veterans may make about how a feature may work.

#### Recommendations

SSiT

-   For future consideration, add directional/instructional content when the map appears on the screen 

-   Provide Veterans with a quick "intro or overview" i.e use the map to select a VA location, enter a zip code and chose the location, something of that nature

-   For future consideration, remove the radio buttons all together and provide a larger button or play around with the UI, however limited, given the use of an existing library and its elements

-   For culture consideration, make address text clickable in location selection screen

VA

-   When presenting Veterans a design element that may be new to VA products, provide instructional content to familiarize them with the element's functionality and purpose

-   Consider adapting design elements that increase the ease of clickability, i.e. larger radio buttons, standardizing clickable text

### Key Recommendation 6: Write out content so Veterans can scan, save, and correctly recall information.

Veterans appreciated when we used numbered lists and bullets to break up information and make important details visible. For example, when we listed the materials a Veteran needed to bring for their walk-in, all Veterans preferred the format of the lists over the usage of accordions. Some Veterans commented that they had memory issues, and numbered lists helped them retain what they needed to remember.

Using lists rather than clickable elements also prevents users from perceiving that they need to take further action. When users clicked on the accordions, many, including a participant who used a screen reader, perceived the accordions as part of a form where they needed to submit information.

In addition to writing out content in a scannable format, VA should also keep in mind to write listed content in the same manner across all forms of communication. Eliminating inconsistencies will help the Veteran so that they do not need to cross-check information. Also, making information repetitive across communication and through reminder messaging will help Veterans learn and find information faster if they ever need to find a reference.

#### Recommendations

SSiT

-   Update home screen and confirmation screen to include bulleted/numbered way of laying out information so that it is stepwise and repetitive

-   Make sure content verbiage across application and emails is the same

-   Include recap information in confirmation screen to reduce need for support

-   For future consideration, send reminder emails, SMS messages, or phone calls for verification walk in appointments

VA

-   Continue to emphasize the importance of presenting content in plain language and hierarchy that is repetitive and list-like to ensure Veterans feel informed and assured

-   Ensure product strategies incorporate adaptations that enable reminder functionalities

### Key Recommendation 7: Make sure services are accessible to Veterans with assistive technology by using inclusive content and testing with the appropriate populations.

Accessibility should be kept front of mind as VA develops solutions for Veterans. Veteran facing developers should build, test, and communicate their solutions to Veterans. This means that both content in the research documentation and the prototypes should be created and revised to be inclusive of Veterans with disabilities and those who use assistive technology. We recommend adding information that may help Veterans with disabilities better understand and prepare for their appointments. While we did not have the opportunity to test with caretakers, this recommendation can also carry over to caretakers and adjacent populations.

-   Use inclusive language in conversation guides that can be used to engage with sighted and non-sighted participants. For example, use "what did you experience on this page?" instead of "what did you see on this page?"

-   Include a section in the conversation guide where you set up the Screen Reader speed with the participant

-   Test prototypes with a screen reader in advance of testing with a participant

-   If using Figma, make sure that all components are named intuitively and ordered in a manner where a screen reader can read them - this may also help with dev handoff if using CodePen later

-   Include content on service applications and supporting materials that informs users whether assistive services and technology (e.g. sighted escorts, VA transport, assistive tech on computers) will be available to them

-   Provide content service applications and supporting materials directed towards caretakers to inform them on how they may or may not attend an in person verification session
