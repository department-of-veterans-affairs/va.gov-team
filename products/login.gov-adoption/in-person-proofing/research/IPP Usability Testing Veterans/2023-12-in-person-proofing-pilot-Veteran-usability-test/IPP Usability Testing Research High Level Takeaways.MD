### High Level Takeaways
- Information on what verification is and why it is necessary to ensure more secure login services was provided at the start of the usability test, during the usability test via content in the prototype, and participants were prompted to explain what it is at the end.
  - Based on observations, the understanding of verification, as a process and its purpose, varies across participants. 
  - Negative reactions came from the need to verify again as well as the need to verify at all, given their perception that the VA has already asked for their information in the past and they did not understand the need to provide their information again
- Some participants welcomed the in person option to verify because it provided convenience given they could opt in rather than fail at remote first to access the service. Others appreciate the access it afforded Veterans due to barriers such as lack of access to technology to complete identity proofing or lack of familiarity with technology.
- Some participants perceived the in person proofing service as having too many steps 

## Prototype Specific Takeaways
- Accordion menus as a design element led to confusion because information seemed hidden initially
  - Desire for information to be immediately available on the initial screen
- More clarity in language of which identity documents are required and which are optional
- “Walk in appointments” is a confusing term given its contradiction
- “Case number” should not be used as a term as it can be confused with other benefit or health services 
- Veterans expressed a desire to be able to bundle a verification appointment with other appointments
- Transport options need to be included in the application
- A reschedule and cancel option need to be included in the application
- The location of the proofing agent needs to be more specific to ease concern of being able to find them for the Veteran
- The repetition of information throughout the application was appreciate by most participants
- Sending a physical letter to ensure no fraudulent activity occurred following completion of identity verification was seen as somewhat effective of a method.
  - High likelihood letter would be thrown away or not read
  - Barrier for those who do not have a consistent, or any, mailing address
- Concern was expressed that any mention of fraud would increase the likelihood of a negative reaction by the Veteran and a follow up contact would need to be provided to assuage those concerns. 

Overall, most participants perceived the service and application as to be expected.
