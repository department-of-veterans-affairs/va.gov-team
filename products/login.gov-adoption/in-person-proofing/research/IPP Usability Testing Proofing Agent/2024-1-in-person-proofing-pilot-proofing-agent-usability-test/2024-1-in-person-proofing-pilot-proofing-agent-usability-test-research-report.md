Research Goals
==============

1.  Evaluate the usability of the Proofing Agent-facing side of the In-Person Proofing application to identify opportunities for improvement and enhance the user experience.

2.  Test the In-Person Proofing application process with 10 Proofing Agent participants within a two-week timeframe.

3.  Conduct the usability test and complete the analysis within one month to inform design changes before on-site testing. 

[Link to Prototype](https://va-in-person-identity-proofing.vercel.app/)
=======================================================================

Participants interacted with the prototype flow under the "Proofing Agent" button. "Proofing Agent" refers to the role of the authorized VA staff member who will help the Veteran complete in-person identity verification. 

Research Questions
==================

-   How might we ensure a positive and informative proofing experience for the Veteran that the Proofing Agent can support?

-   How might we improve the usability of the application for Proofing Agents?

-   How might we help Proofing Agents ease the anxiety/burden for Veterans when they aren't successful in verifying their identity?

-   How might we support Proofing Agents to make failure to verify one's identity remotely more palatable for Veterans?

Methodology
===========

The participants completed a usability test with the In-Person Identity Proofing custom application in a Vercel Environment that was recorded on Zoom. Usability testing was deemed the most appropriate form of testing given there is an opportunity to improve the prototype through this evaluative research.

Before participants were given access to the custom application, they were briefed on the Think Aloud technique. This ensured that as participants navigated through the screens, they shared their thoughts out loud in addition to responding to prompts and questions from the moderator. The questions asked by the moderator were intended to investigate how well the participant understood the purpose of each screen, what reactions participants had to what the Proofing Agent asked, and where there may be moments of doubt or confusion.

After evaluating the usability of the prototype, the researcher asked follow-up questions about how the participant, as a  Proofing Agent, anticipated preparing, interacting and assisting the Veteran during their In-Person Identity Proofing session at a Veteran Affairs facility. This series of questions was intended to test how well the prototype matched the expectations of the Proofing Agent for their in-person session. The participants' responses indicated what a Proofing Agent might need to do to provide the Veteran with a successful and satisfactory proofing experience.

Participant Demographics
========================

All participants, seven in total, were My HealtheVet (MHV) Coordinators who work at various Veteran Affairs Medical Centers. For the purposes of this study, MHV Coordinators were identified as the optimal user group for the "Proofing Agent" role given their current responsibilities which include verifying Veterans. Furthermore, MHV Coordinators have the potential to model how verification takes place in person and what aspects of the verification process may be replicated.

Hypotheses and Conclusions
==========================

1.  Proofing Agents will be able to easily navigate through the custom application and complete verification without training.

-   Mostly true. All participants completed the verification process using the application and nearly all participants were able to find their way through each step by reading the instructional content outlined before each step. For the most part, participants were able to understand and move through each screen to complete the tasks that were being asked of them.

-   6 out of 7 participants stated that they liked the application and appreciated it, and they anticipated using it to verify a Veteran's identity without any barriers. 

-   One participant (P2) commented that while they could navigate through the application, some steps within the process felt repetitive.

-   One participant (P4) wanted more information on how they would generate a new confirmation case number for the Veteran. 

-   One participant (P3) provided a favorable response to the custom application in comparison to the process they use now, highlighting ease of use.

"Looks like I'm repeating the same things again." (P2)

"Create a new case number, we would have to know how to do that, we would have to learn the process of what the Veteran needs to do." (P4)

"Actually this seems so much easier. When you do the online process, there's so much back and forth. You have to get a code to your phone, then you have to take pictures, and then there's always an error message. It's very involved. This seems much easier to me." (P3)

1.  Proofing Agents will understand the purpose of each screen and affirm the content and design choices.

-   Somewhat true. Participants understood each screen, however, there were some instances throughout testing where participants had questions surrounding the next steps or made assumptions about what step to take based on both the content and design within the application. 

-   6 out of 7 participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6) understood the purpose of every screen.

-   One participant (P1) made assumptions about what they were doing within the application, rather than understanding what was being asked of them based on instructional language and the way the steps of the process were presented to them within the application.

-   One participant (P7) noted that providing more instructional content within the application would make it easier for them to fill in the information needed to validate a Veterans ID. 

-   One participant (P2) indicated that the content for validating documents could be simplified

-   Two participants (P4 and P5) needed clarification on the format of how to input personal information, such as the middle name or the Social Security number when validating a Veteran's ID.

-   One participant (P4) desired more guidance surrounding how they would use case numbers to assist a Veteran.

"I was expecting that I was verifying the identity, not just the document." (P1)

"We've seen a billion VHIC cards so maybe this [validate document checker list] could be simplified more." (P2)

"Create a new case number, we would have to know how to do that, we would have to learn the process of what the Veteran needs to do." (P4)

1.  If verification is completed successfully, Proofing Agents will experience either no change or positive change in attitudes toward the identity verification process.

-   Mostly true. Every participant that we spoke with had a positive reaction to the In-Person Identity Proofing application and process. They used words and phrases like "easier" and "time-saving" to describe their feelings toward this process in contrast with the current verification services that are available. 

-   7 out of 7 participants reported having a positive experience with the application and thought that it would improve the current verification process.

"This is only going to help in the end. Then we wouldn't have to send Veterans to a phone call." (P7)

"Seems like it's going to be shorter because you don't have to wait to verify the photo and you aren't starting over multiple times." (P6)

1.  Proofing Agents will anticipate questions from the Veterans and have a standard explanation for identity verification.

-   Somewhat true. Participants did anticipate questions from Veterans, but their explanations for identity verification were not standardized. Rather, explanations given for identity verification (and its parts) were situational, based on the agent and/or Veterans' personal experiences.

-   7 out of 7 participants asked follow-up questions in anticipation of Veteran concerns and offered suggestions on how we might make interactions even more clear for Veterans.

-   When participants recalled how they might explain identity verification to a Veteran, they demonstrated techniques that relied heavily on personal anecdotes that resonated with Veteran experience (e.g. marriage, cyber security, changing government standards).

"Right now, if we are going to be Proofing Agents, [we need to know] a little bit about what we are doing, I want to make sure I can answer those questions, information that is already on the ID." (P4)

"Sir, you married or single? Once we give you this access you will have total access to your records...if your ex comes in, she better look like you on the ID card. That's why we do that because you are going to have total access. We are making sure you are the absolute Veteran." (P2)

1.  Proofing Agents have methods for troubleshooting identity verification with Veterans. 

-   Somewhat true. Participants have a variety of methods when it comes to troubleshooting while verifying a Veteran's identity. However, many of these solutions are trial and error, and there are no guarantees that Proofing Agents can solve the issue if the problem resides within an outside system. 

-   5 out of 7 participants (P2, P3, P4, P6, P7) identified different ways in which they currently assist Veterans if the verification process does not go as planned or if problems occur that prevent Veterans from completing verification. 

-   Two participants (P2, P4) explained that in their experience, remote proofing is difficult for Veterans to complete, so Veterans come into an My HealtheVet (MHV) office to get help. 

-   One participant (P7) spoke to internal barriers with verification, explaining that even when Veterans come into a physical location, Proofing Agents may still have to reach out to help desks when they cannot finish the verification process themselves.

-   One participant (P4) mentioned that Veterans who come into MHV offices are frustrated about verification, and have exhausted all their options, and in-person assistance is vital to successful verification.

"[Veterans have to contact] ID.ME or Login.gov if we can't help them." (P7)

"I pray: I do whatever it takes to help the Veteran." (P4)

Key Findings
============

### Key Finding 1: VA staff are concerned that email access/verification can be a barrier, especially for those requiring care or who have a caregiver with medical Power of Attorney.

Nearly all participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P7) had questions or showed concern when it came to asking Veterans to verify their email addresses. Comparing In-Person Identity Proofing to the current verification process for upgrading My HealtheVet accounts, they had concerns about introducing a new step into the process and Veterans being able to remember and/or access their emails on the spot.

"The only thing we've ever asked for to verify a Veterans ID is their photo ID and we write down information from the ID. We've never asked for an email." (P3)

"I have to verify their email address, but my question is do I trust that they're going to know this? What if they don't remember their email or type it in incorrectly?" (P5)

"It's been a problem [if email on phone does not match email registered with]." (P2)

One participant (P4) shared a particular concern for email privacy and access, stating:

"Vets have to make sure that the email is not shared or registered to anyone else... I would ask them if this is something that is shared. If it's something they can't access, they put an email in there and then they change it." (P4)

Several participants (P2, P4, P5, P7) noted how email verification might be uniquely complicated for Veterans who are under the care of someone with medical Power of Attorney or reliant on a spouse or other caregiver for support when setting up the walk-in appointment for In-Person Identity Proofing and attending the in-person walk-in appointment itself.

"Make sure that email will not be a show stopper... Not necessarily older Veterans, it's younger ones coming from deployment with brain injuries...not able to do these things, have a person with medical POA. Person is not a Veteran so their email address is not going to show up." (P2)

"There have been times I haven't [been able to complete identity verification]. When the Veteran wasn't with them and I refused to... or other times I had to verify with Veteran and make sure they are able to speak." (P5)

"Seems there could be scenarios where a person has multiple emails--spouse email, household email-- I'm concerned about spouses putting the wrong email associated with the patient's account." (P7)

### Conclusion

Drawing from experiences upgrading Veterans from basic to premium MHV accounts, participants were able to outline a number of email-related scenarios that might slow down or complicate the IPP process. Particular attention was called out to cognitive/memory issues and scenarios where Veterans may have someone acting on their behalf with a medical POA or a spouse/family member helping them through the process. Entering the proper email address for In-Person Identity Proofing lacks clarity on how to support these use cases for both Veterans and Proofing Agents.

### Key Finding 2: VA staff want to make sure that we have an inclusive and secure process for using physical IDs to verify Veteran identities.

The majority of participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6) that we spoke to were surprised and delighted to see the Veteran Health Identification Card listed as an option for identity verification. They noted that it was an ID that most Veterans had and were actively asking to use.

"Oh! Very nice, health ID card. I do get asked that a lot." (P6)

"Looks like we can ask for a state ID or their Veteran ID. Excellent. Glad we have those 2 choices." (P3)

While liking the expanded options for identity verification, some participants (P4, P5, P7) asked clarifying questions about how they might verify proof of address with the Veteran Health Identification card and showed concerns about fraud when using this type of ID. 

"With this, we are going to have to stress the importance of the driver's license more than the VHIC card...If they don't have a driver's license, only have a VHIC, that could be a problem with proof of address." (P7)

"Unfortunately there's people who sell their VA ID cards and they sell the ID just to get discounts." (P5)

Several (P1, P2, P4, P5) participants pointed out how the current process of requiring a "valid" ID that is not expired might not be inclusive to all Veterans and listed common scenarios that might constitute a barrier for some.

"Should be one size fits all. Is this a Veteran or not, whether it's expired. For example, elderly Veterans who haven't driven in a while." (P2)

"There are a lot of people who travel around a lot. That does happen. It may not be up to date, misspelled first name or last name." (P4)

"She was in rehab, her spouse was stealing her identity, she had no valid docs." (P1)

### Conclusion

VA staff feel that the identity verification process should be as inclusive as possible. They support adding additional ID types and even question whether we should rely so heavily on the ID not being expired, as long as it can be used to positively identify the face of a Veteran. At the same time, VA staff are acutely aware of identity theft and are wary that certain ID types, such as the Veteran Health Identification Card, may present difficulties for straightforward verification and be particularly susceptible to fraud.

### Key Finding 3: Locating VA staff is situational and depends on many factors, including if the Veteran is new to a VA facility.

Nearly all participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7) spoke about how Veterans go about finding them within a VA facility and how that cannot be answered with standard directions, as coordinators' locations vary by building and work schedules.

"[I'm] only in the building on Mondays, for four days I telework."  (P6)

Nearly all participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7) have different ways of describing to, new or returning, Veterans where they are within a Veteran Affairs Medical Center. Depending on where the coordinators are located, they'll have different resources to assist Veterans with locating their offices.

"We give very specific instructions, this is the building we're in ... building 8, second floor, take the second hallway, walk into this clinic, look to your right, you'll see a door... we give very specific directions, we're used to that." (P3)

"When you first walk into the VA there's an info desk. There's ambassadors who will bring you to me." (P2)

"[It's] Word of mouth or if someone calls, I'll direct them, most everyone knows where I am." (P1)

### Conclusion

Overall, participants called attention to the various ways in which a Proofing Agent might explain to a Veteran where they are located. In all cases, participants confirmed that there is no standard way to give Veterans directions to where they are located, and there is no guarantee that what works for one location will work for another.

### Key Finding 4: VA staff had moments of pause or confusion throughout the verification process that were directly attributed to content and design elements.

A few participants (P1, P6) mentioned that the accordion element featured in the design caused confusion or raised questions when attempting to verify a Veteran's identity.

"Not sure why the plus signs are there." (P1)

"Check mark, validated document. If I click that, will it open up another field? If it does, it would make sense to me to open up a box where I can enter card information." (P6)

Most participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P6, P7) were able to consistently understand what a confirmation case number was and how to use it to complete the verification process. However, Proofing Agents could go through a potential learning curve when it comes to introducing case numbers and using them as a way to start verifying a Veteran's identity.

"Clearly it's asking for a case number... an 8-digit case number this Veteran has already received Via email." (P3)

"[Asking a Veteran for a case number] Do you have a case number when you logged in, when did you get it, is it 10 days old, you'll know it because it's 8 digits. I'd ask in reverse [to steps in screen]

(P4)

A few participants (P2, P6) found some of the instructional content confusing or repetitive on the screens in which they were asked to validate a Veterans ID.

"I thought I was selecting an ID type. Looks like it asked me the same thing three times." (P2).

"I would want it to ... on the very first one. I'd have skipped asking for ID. I'd select ID type and input information." (P6)

### Conclusion

Participants were able to move through all the screens outlined in the verification process, however, there were instances where questions arose surrounding some of the design elements, such as the accordion element, as well as content used within IPP. Participants also require clarification on how a Veteran receives a case number and how they, as Proofing Agents, would use the case number to assist Veterans when verifying their identity in person.

### Key Finding 5: Proofing Agents need clarification and brief instructions for validating a Veteran's ID.

Nearly all participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7) called out possible improvements that would better assist them with validating a Veteran's ID. There were questions and moments of pause through this particular step, which occurs after a Proofing Agent receives an acceptable form of ID from the Veteran and before they begin filling in the ID information.

"I wonder if there could be something in here [the application], that said, this is only validating the doc, the identity will be validated in later steps." (P1)

"Overkill, this validates the document dropdown for the kinds of IDs the state issued." (P2)

One participant also sought clarity surrounding the instructional content for validating a Veteran's ID and compared it to the current process of verifying a Veteran's identity.

"You're not taking pictures then. The person is determining if the photo ID is correct. Ok I can see that." (P6)

Participants were not familiar with some of the language for verifying a valid driver's license. Proofing Agents may need visual examples or better descriptions.

"Wow... polycarbonate card body? What does that mean...they can't be serious with this? I'm sorry this is just funny to me. That seems a bit much." (P3)

### Conclusion

While participants could complete the task of validating a Veteran's ID with the process outlined in In-Person Identity Proofing, it's worth noting that for a seasoned VA staff member, the proposed solution could be too involved and in turn cause the process to take longer than needed.

### Key Finding 6: VA staff liked the application, and made reference to its straightforward guidance but desire more guidance and instruction if problems arise.

All participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7) had an overwhelmingly positive reaction to the proposed application and gave specific callouts of what they appreciated about the process outlined.

"I like this, I like paper trails, I like to go back and be able to look." (P2)

"A lot of people will like it I think." (P7)

"It's a one-stop shop. You're definitely going to be able to get them in one setting and do the verification and complete it." (P6)

One participant (P1) offered a suggestion surrounding guidance when using the toolkit dropdown within the application, stating that would help them better understand and complete the process.

"The instructions could be out here a little bit more, especially the toolkit dropdown." (P1)

A few participants (P3, P6) struggled or had questions when attempting to fill out the information required once a Veteran provides the Proofing Agent with their accepted form of ID.

"I'm assuming I have to enter the information from the ID somewhere in here... is that what this Validate ID is? You have to select one of these?" (P3).

"For veterans who are a little older and not tech savvy or used to this process, this would be good for them because it's asking for specific information they can fill out on their own." (P6)

All participants noted that in order to best serve Veterans, they themselves need support, as well as information that pertains to verification in general.

"Right now, if we are going to be Proofing Agents, [we need to know] a little bit about what we are doing, I want to make sure I can answer those questions, information that is already on the ID." (P4).

One participant (P7) also called out that currently, when they are unable to assist Veterans, they have to turn to outside channels to troubleshoot.

"Direct them to phone numbers or online." (P7)

### Conclusion

Participants found value in the streamlined approach to verifying a Veteran's identity and appreciated the proposed process, making sure to call out that the overall process seemed simpler and a better solution to be able to verify Veterans' identities in comparison to the process they currently follow. However, participants did call out the need for more instructional content when validating a Veteran's ID or troubleshooting to better assist a Veteran.

### Key Finding 7: VA staff see the value in the in-person proofing service and welcome any ways to reduce the amount of work required for both Veterans and VA staff to complete verification.

Nearly all participants (P2, P4, P5, P6, P7 ) noted that IPP would assist in cutting down the amount of effort and time that is currently required to complete the identity verification process.

"There is a lot of need for the verification process." (P7)

Participants desired more standardized data entry guidance from the application as well as automated error checking. Most participants (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7) reported that manual data entry is burdensome, repetitive and that they don't understand its purpose.

"The only surprise was the manual entry vs taking the picture, but I completely understand that." (P6)

"I kind of expected something to verify if the address is wrong, this is fine." (P1)

A couple of participants (P2, P4) mentioned that even though going through the verification process using IPP wasn't perfect, it would be much better suited to their needs as potential Proofing Agents.

"If it takes me a little bit more time to do this...better than sitting on hold for 50 minutes." (P2)

One participant (P1) also noted that IPP has the potential to ensure that Veterans can pick the type of verification that is best suited to their individual needs and allow the Veteran to make a decision based on convenience and location to a Veteran Affairs participating site.

"[Who do you see using the in-person option] Veterans who live in the area or those who have consistent appointments. The younger, local ones would come in." (P1)

### Conclusion

Participants gave an overall positive reaction to IPP reducing workloads and mentioned that the process outlined in IPP would improve the identity verification experience for Veterans.

Recommendations
===============

Below are recommendations for both immediate and future changes for the Secure Sign-In Transition team's IPP product as well as considerations for other VA product teams.

### Key Recommendation 1: When presenting Proofing Agents with information, ensure that all content is presented in a manner that is easy to read, hierarchy makes the steps clear, and information is not hidden.

Proofing Agents did not respond positively to the custom application design elements, such as expandable accordion menus, that hid information from view. Some mentioned that they would expect to see an "i" icon that revealed more information in the hover state should information need to be hidden.

We recommend a content layout that lends itself to readability and information hierarchy to better inform Proofing Agents of what each screen is asking them to do without hiding any information they may need to know.

Recommendations

-  #### SSIT 

-   Remove accordion menus from all Proofing Agent screens 

-   Create content hierarchy on screens that informs Proofing Agents where they need to perform an action 

-  #### VA

-   Update guidance in the Design System to discourage the use of accordion menus in instructional content

### Key Recommendation 2: Proofing Agents might experience a learning curve for adopting  IPP as a service for in-person verification and need to be informed with instructional content before they begin the process in order to better assist Veterans.

Participants mentioned throughout testing that they could follow the steps outlined with the custom application. However, some parts of the process were unfamiliar and strayed from the process they follow now, so more context needs to be added.

Recommendations

-   #### SSIT 

-   Add content for Proofing Agent screens on what is a confirmation case number, how it is generated, and how a Veteran can get a new one

-   Add content on what steps enable verification, what is not verification, and how the steps for In-Person Identity Proofing are different from other services that are already being used in the Proofing Agent  facing screens

-   Identify alternative naming conventions for "confirmation case number", such as "confirmation number". Its similarities to benefits-related terms such as "case number" and the use of the term "walk-in appointment" caused confusion for users.

-   Create and provide a training program/curriculum to authorize VA staff to do in-person identity verification

-   Discovery research on software that MHV Coordinators use to verify identity should Identity Toolkit not be optimal, for example, MHV administrative portal and Veteran health records

-   Discovery research on how information can be looked up or changed on the Master People Index for additional instructional content

-   #### VA 

-   Establish content guidance on naming conventions for appointments or reservations for Veteran services to avoid duplicative or misleading terms

-   Update content style guides to include guidance for content that is used for in-person appointments and instructions for VA staff

### Key Recommendation 3:  A pathway should be designed for In-Person Identity Proofing for Veterans who depend on a caregiver with medical Power of Attorney to ensure access and reduce the likelihood of fraud.

Currently, In-Person Identity Proofing does not support a pathway for a Veteran that depends on a caregiver with medical Power of Attorney. MHV Coordinators know what steps to take for current verification processes for Veterans with caregivers and what to do to ensure fraud is not being committed. They desire guidance for In-Person Identity Proofing.

Recommendations

-  #### SSIT 

-   Add content that makes explicit that any email address requested must be the Veteran's email, not the caregivers', in both the Veteran-facing and Proofing Agent-facing screens

-   Desktop research to begin understanding the caretaker experience 

-   Design a user flow and supporting screens for a Veteran who depends on a caregiver with medical Power of Attorney to complete in-person identity verification. 

-  #### VA

-   Create a design pattern for screens and data fields that are standardized for when a caregiver with medical Power of Attorney must give proof of authorization before assisting with the service or benefits being accessed.

### Key Recommendation 4: Consider accepting more identification types for In-Person Identity Proofing, such as Veteran Health Identification Cards (VHICs), to ensure Veterans are not blocked by limited identification options. Expanding identification options also requires increased guidance for Proofing Agents to ensure fraudulent activity does not occur.

Veterans need flexibility in the required identification documents as not everyone has an unexpired state-issued ID. MHV Coordinators responded positively to seeing the Veteran Health Identification Card as an option but require guidance on how to verify the address, as it is required to ensure that no fraudulent activity is occurring.

-  #### SSiT

-   Conduct discovery research on other identification types that provide strong assurance per NIST 800-53 guidelines for consideration of additional identification options

-   Conduct discovery research into how identity is verified for the unhoused, elderly, and other groups that may not have a valid or accepted ID type

-   Add content to the current application, for both Veteran and Proofing Agent      facing screens, of what identification types are not accepted and why

-   Continue exploration of the integration of Doc Checker for the application. Doc Checker is a DMV-provided API that can provide guidance on verifying if an identification document is authentic.

-  #### VA

-   Provide feedback on NIST 800-53 version 4 guidelines should a fifth version be under consideration based on In-Person Identity Proofing findings

### Key Recommendation 5: Add context and instructional content to ensure that Veterans can access their email addresses during verification. The Proofing Agent also needs to know how to explain why email access is needed, as well as what to do if the Veteran needs to update their sign-in credential password or get a new confirmation case number due to an issue with the email address they initially gave.

MHV Coordinators expressed concern that accessing emails in general, as well as during verification can be difficult for Veterans. Veterans either do not remember their login information, do not understand why they need to access their email during verification, and/or are not prepared to access their email addresses when they come in person. MHV Coordinators have workarounds but appreciate the guidance provided by the touch points of In-Person Identity Proofing for both Veterans and Proofing Agents.

-  #### SSiT

-   More contextual content added to Proofing Agent screens to explain why the Veteran is being asked to confirm the email address associated with their confirmation case number

-   Provide instructional content in the Proofing Agent screens on how to update an email address with either Login.gov or ID.me for the Proofing Agent if they are unable to access their modern sign-in credential during in-person identity verification

-   More contextual content added in the confirmation email to make it clear that Veterans will need to verify the email address used to set up their walk-in appointment at the VA site

-   Design a pathway for Veterans to get a new confirmation case number

-   Design a pathway for Proofing Agents to generate a new confirmation case number for the Veteran

### Key Recommendation 6: Include instructional content and pathways for in-person services on how to reschedule, set up a walk-in appointment with no prior digital setup, or schedule VA Transport.

The 10-day window to arrive for In-Person Identity Proofing was seen as reasonable by MHV Coordinators. However, they wanted to know how a Veteran might locate the Proofing Agent, reschedule their 10-day window, walk in with no appointment for in-person verification, or set up transportation to their selected site via VA-provided transport.

-   #### SSiT

-   Design a reschedule flow for Veterans

-   Design a walk-in flow for Veterans with no prior digital setup before arriving at the VA site

-   Discovery research on how transport is set up for other in-person VA services

-   Based on findings, add content and link out to resources on setting up VA transport in Veteran-facing screens, the confirmation email, and on VA sites referencing in-person identity verification 

-   Provide contact information of the Proofing Agent for the selected site to understand where the Veteran needs to go and when the Proofing Agent is in office

-   #### VA

-   Create a design pattern and content style guidance for setting up VA transport for in-person services

-   Create a design pattern and content style guidance for rescheduling an appointment

### Key Recommendation 7: The IPP application must provide guidance on standardized data entry and automated error checking to reduce the likelihood of incorrect data entry.

MHV Coordinators were concerned during steps that required manual data entry as there is a risk for error and they expected the application to provide guidance on how to correctly format numerical data and correct them if they input the information incorrectly.

-  #### SSiT

-   Provide an error message/alert when a Proofing Agent misses something when filling in information.

-   Disable the "continue" button until the error is resolved

-   Provide data field guidance on format of Social Security Number entry; hyphenated or not

-   Provide data field guidance on Date of Birth entry, MM/DD/YYYY

-   Add Suffix and Middle name field

-   Discovery research on whether information from Veteran intake screens or MPI database can auto-populate in the Proofing Agent application screens to reduce errors associated with manual data entry

-   Autocorrect if confirmation case number, Internal Control Number (ICN), or Social Security Number is not correct in digit place amounts (e.g., confirmation case number is 8 digits, Social Security Number is 9 digits)

-  #### VA

-   Create a design pattern for standardizing numerical data entry for Social Security Numbers and Date of Birth

-   Create a design pattern for standardizing name entries for middle names and suffixes

### Key Recommendation 8: Reduce duplicative work or the need to work across several applications.

MHV Coordinators found some steps of the application excessive in steps and work, such as manually entering the identification information and cross-checking it in the Identity Management Toolkit application. MHV Coordinators recommended hyperlinks and autocomplete from prior data entry by the Veteran as a consideration for future improvements.

-   #### SSiT

-   Link Proofing Agent facing application directly to Identity Management Toolkit for easier access for Proofing Agents during the "Validate ID" step

-   Future consideration: Link application to Master People Index (MPI) to verify information from identification to reduce inter-app integrations and remove Identity Toolkit as a step

-   Simplify the screens where PAs accept and validate a Veteran's ID

-   Allow all content related to validating a Veterans ID to exist within one screen, reduce the number of screens that PAs have to click through to complete the validation of the ID

### Key Recommendation 9: Veterans should be able to select the verification method that works best for them or an alternative should they not be able to complete the verification method they prefer.

MHV Coordinators liked In-Person Identity Proofing as an option and encouraged making it as clear as possible all of the options available for identity verification, to ensure Veterans can act on preference.

-   #### SSiT:

-   Create a landing page in the verification flow with all verification options to enable Veterans to learn about their options and choose preferred or available methods
