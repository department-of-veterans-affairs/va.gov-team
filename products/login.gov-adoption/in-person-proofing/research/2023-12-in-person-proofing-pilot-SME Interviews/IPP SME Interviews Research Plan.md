# Research Plan for Login.gov Adoption, In-Person Identity Proofing Subject Matter Expert Interviews


## Background
Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to offer more digital services to ensure access and security for all Veterans. In order to achieve increased security measures for VA.gov, Veterans will need to  create modern credentials, such as Login.gov, which require verification of one’s identity. However, the process of remote identity verification can be very confusing and frustrating, and it has a high chance of failure. Through discovery research and literature review, Login.gov Adoption has identified that in-person support is not only desired by Veterans, but it is needed to help many subpopulations of Veterans to verify their identity successfully. For example, in-person proofing could be a favorable option for Veterans who are not comfortable with processes involving photographing and uploading a digital image of their identification. Currently, VA has sites set up so that Veterans may verify their identity for specific services, such as MHV premium. However, the process of identity verification has been found to be inconsistent and unregulated across sites. Login.gov has developed identity proofing services at United States Postal Service sites which are made available to those who have failed remote proofing.


In order to support Veterans who may be unable to verify their identity remotely, Office of the Chief Technology Officer has tasked the Login.gov Adoption team with creating a custom service that meets NIST Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) guidelines, 800-63, and enables Veterans to complete identity verification in person at VA facilities. The service consists of an In-Person Identity Proofing custom application and an appointment at a VAMC with a designated proofing agent. The custom application is a new product that will allow proofing agents to validate proofing documents and use the Identity Toolkit to help Veterans complete identity verification at VA sites. Login.gov Adoption is a team within OCTO Identity and is working in partnership with Login.gov.

[Product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/in-person-proofing/product/product-brief.md)

The custom service requires in-person support at brick and mortar VA facilities. To ensure the feasibility and viability of in-person identity proofing, the Login.gov Adoption team will conduct subject matter expert interviews with key stakeholders, as well as VA staff, that have experiences that may inform the design of the in-person proofing service. These interviews also offer an opportunity to identify possible VA staff candidates for usability testing of the application and participation in an on-site testing pilot.  

## OCTO Priorities


The research supports the OCTO priorities:
Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online.
Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov.
Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.
Improve the Veteran login experience
Solidify the VA.gov platform
Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy
## Veteran Journey
The In-Person Identity Proofing product and service is a means to enable Login.gov access. Therefore, the product and service can be applicable throughout the entire Veteran journey. Given that Login.gov enables the ability to apply for and access services and benefits, this product and service can be pertinent in the “Getting Out” and “Starting Up” phase. 

## Research Goals	
Evaluate the feasibility of the in-person identity proofing service.
Understand the VA staff workflow and ways that the in-person identity proofing service might fit into that flow.
Identity assumptions and requirements that are necessary to uphold for the viability of the in-person identity proofing service. 

### Outcome
The subject matter expert interviews will enable the Login.gov Adoption team to better understand VA staffs’ user journeys and perceptions of the In-Person Identity Proofing service. The researchers will also learn about what the VA staff needs to enable the Veteran to successfully verify and have a satisfactory experience. These results will then inform necessary changes to the application and in-person interactions in preparation for on-site testing. 

### Research questions

How might we ensure a positive proofing experience for Veterans with VA staff support?
How might we improve the ease of adoption and use of the service for VA staff?
How might we help VA staff ease the anxiety/burden for Veterans when they aren’t successful in verifying their identity?
How might we make failure to verify one’s identity remotely more palatable for Veterans and VA staff?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

VA Staff will be able to easily guide a Veteran through the in-person proofing product and service. 
VA Staff will report positive feedback on the service flow.
VA Staff will be able to adopt the in-person proofing service into their current workflow without training. 
VA Staff will be able to identify ways to support Veterans throughout the in-person identity proofing service to help them successfully verify. 
VA Staff will report neutral or positive feedback that the in-person identity proofing service will work in most VA facilities. 

## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Subject matter expert interviews will be conducted. These will be semi structured interviews featuring two parts. The first part will be a contextual inquiry into the individuals’ current work and experience with identity proofing or verification. The second part will be a presentation of the IPP user journey for both Veterans and proofing agents, including assumptions or requirements currently made to ensure the success of the Veteran to verify. The participant will then be asked follow up questions to react and give input on the user journey.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

Login.gov Adoption has conducted stakeholder outreach in partnership with Identity Product Owner, Thomas Black, to identify subject matter experts. The following stakeholder groups have been identified for recruitment:
