## Design Log

### In-Person Identity Proofing Pamphlet 

#### Deliverables

[In-Person Identity Proofing Pamphlet ](https://www.figma.com/design/HdYyoAYefTSyHNjVuUdT2I/IPP-Pilot-Materials?node-id=0%3A1&t=Mku0YQmuuBGqCMns-1)

#### Date Presented

Sprint 45
05/06/2024

#### Summary 

Pamphlet designed to inform and educate Veterans on creating and signing in to access their benefits with[ ID.me](http://id.me/) or[ Login.gov](http://login.gov/)

#### Value Add 

Without designing this educational pamphlet to share with Veterans who participate in the pilot, there could be a potential gap in knowledge and understanding about verifying their identities and verification options. This original print design provides information that Veterans need to feel comfortable and confident making the transition concerning their sign-in options when they learn about it through the pilot.

### Future State Flows 

#### Deliverables

[Bundling User Flow ](https://www.figma.com/design/OKnM2rn0Oyw5UhCUQ41VTi/Future-State-Flows?node-id=9-1079&t=Yw4Pg81NRDNR5oG3-1)

[Rescheduling User Flow ](https://www.figma.com/design/OKnM2rn0Oyw5UhCUQ41VTi/Future-State-Flows?node-id=9-923&t=Yw4Pg81NRDNR5oG3-1)

#### Date Presented

05/06/2024

Sprint 45

#### Summary

1. Future state flow for IPP that would allow a Veteran to bundle the walk-in IPP appointment with other appointments
2. Future state flow of IPP that would allow a Veteran to reschedule their walk-in IPP appointment

#### Value Add

Without exploring the future state of In-Person Identity Proofing, it would be difficult to ensure that In-Person Identity Proofing provides pathways beyond the happy path. The future state flows ensure that we address expectations and assumptions uncovered during both rounds of usability testing and SME interviews and provide support for multiple user pathways.

### In Person Proofing Flyer

#### Deliverables

[In Person Proofing Flyer ](https://www.figma.com/design/HdYyoAYefTSyHNjVuUdT2I/IPP-Pilot-Materials?node-id=2%3A324&t=SzeF3HCTFsWfJCng-1)

#### Date Presented

01/04/2024

#### Summary

The flyer was designed to inform and educate VA staff about In-Person Identity Proofing pilots in order to allow them to opt in to participating.

#### Value Add

Without this design mockup, VA staff would not know the purpose of the pilot and be unable to make an informed decision in participating.

### Lo-Fi Workshop

#### Deliverables

[Lo-Fi Wireframes for Workshop ](https://www.figma.com/design/zVHX0aBO0eC0sYvqW39zUG/In-Person-Proofing-Lo-Fi-Workshop-(7%2F26%2F23)?node-id=0%3A1&t=3PPVbWeDhEan2NmN-1)

[Workshop Meeting Notes](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/in-person-proofing/meeting-notes/07_27_2023_IPP_Workshop.md&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1716995535203508&usg=AOvVaw3wX9qLW7QAXomyVxhblEgG)

#### Date Presented

07/27/2023

#### Summary 

Prototype of In-Person Identity Proofing service prepped for workshop conducted with OCTO, NIST, and[ Login.gov](http://login.gov/) to evaluate the security assurance of the service.

#### Value Add

This workshop was the first meeting between the Office of the Chief Technology Officer, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Login.gov to establish a common understanding for why an in person verification service is needed and how this service can be developed to uphold NIST security guidelines. In this meeting, we were able to identify the most effective and secure pathway, the necessary technologies, and the key players of the service. We also set up monthly check-inâ€™s with Login.gov to ensure smooth and transparent collaboration. Without this workshop, we would not have established important relationships and common understanding to kick off the work on a brand new service.
