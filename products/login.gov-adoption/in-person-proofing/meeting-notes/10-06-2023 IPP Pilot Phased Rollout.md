Notes

-   Focus on IPP Pilot

-   3 lanes to the research approach

-   Comms campaign

-   IPP

-   Co Creation (generative)

-   All three are on the table, but today's meeting is IPP focused

-   There is a need for more secure login, we want prioritize solution with veterans to ensure user centered design

-   They are critical for success

-   Reviewed Pilot goals

-   Goal # 1

-   Goal #2 

-   Objective 1 and 2 

-   No comments

-   Objective 3

-   Robyn: "Should there be a result around: successful creation around X number of Vets" "We needed X number of people and we accomplished that"

-   Objective #4 

-   Robyn: "Another call out, I am looking for objectives in the Key Results"

-   Pilot Approach:

-   3 phases, with complementary tests and metrics

-   2 Usability Phases and 1 On Site Testing

-   Sending over details on nature of participants and fasciitis

-   Robyn: "Are these phases back to back?" Kirk: "We will be doing Usability concurrently, with a gap between this and third phase, allowing time to synthesize results" Robyn approved of this approach. 

-   Test Usability with no prior training:

-   Creating a Wizard type experience, with self help components. 

-   Chicago

-   Lots of facilities, MO team is here 

-   Tom in chat: "+1 for Chicago as the Login.gov in-person lead is there too"

-   Robyn: "Let's have a backup location, it's kind of cold in Chicago. Do not want geography to impact results. Lets get some insight from folks to see how institutional choice may impact the study. But we also want to be pragmatic around resources."

-   Interested in knowing what type of IDs are common. May not support VHIC, but we want to if that would be something that people want. 

-   We will have a variety of Vets with varying stages of login types

-   On Site Testing

-   No questions about objectives

-   Robyn: "We should talk it through, very cool, but logistically how will this work. There are other groups who have done that, how can we learn from them."

-   "Lets assume Chicago, couple ways to get people in the room. How do people do this now? Have we talked to anyone about this"

-   Phil: "We are trying to draw a balance between organic and controlled. For instance we do not have a person sitting full time. We need someone onsite with some flyer, paper or digital, to help control the flow. Need to draw a balance between our needs and not impacting normal business operations."

-   Robyn: "I see that this will need to be more controlled and not organic. Ask Parigean to ask Veterans: "Do you live in Chicago? Not sure if that is OK to ask", Phil suggested asking: "Do you have access to this location?"

-   Robyn mentioned three criteria:

-   1\. No Login.gov account

-   2\. ?????

-   3\. Ability to visit location 

-   Lets see how Perigean can meet these needs first. 

-   Phil expressed concerns about getting them access and if for instance there is a failure of the Identity Process, we do not leave the Veteran hanging. 

-   Robyn: "This is 100% inline with research best practices around increasing access. Can you (MO????) for Id Proofing"

-   Phil: "No not directly"

-   Robyn: "Prioritize research participant experience"

-   Robyn: "One thought, if you can capture people that just walk in, is there some 'interviewy' process. How does Perigean handle this? 

-   Phil: Clarifying questions: we intercept Veteran, 

-   Robyn said Brian would have more info about the consent form. Don't know if we use the Perigean form. The format would be: consent form and explicitly state you are transferring PII (no PHI) to Perigean. Another group created an encrypted Sharepoint folder and used this transfer data securely. 

-   Next Steps Slide

-   Tom had some call out, but I missed them

-   Robyn there are some logistic challenges that we need to get ahead of. I know that there are other intersecting projects at VA and how this fits in with IPP is a mystery. Tom,this is the first question to answer: "Are MHV people the ones to do this process? Start this now, there can be a lot of waiting. This could go smoothly or be a blocker." Tom: Leaders need to be aware of all these new initiatives. This should help solve some challenges with how this project impacts other projects. Reduce the surprises. 

-   robyn : Things that could slow you down: 

-   You will need to recruit agents, start that search early. 

-   Took me 6 weeks to get a meeting with help desk 

-   I think Veteran will be straight forward, but start the conversation with Perigean

-   This use case is different so don't want to be shot down without being able to make your case. 

-   UAT

-   This should be done post Usability testing

-   Sometimes we use VA staff or sometimes they use Veterans. We use a staff model because vets dont want to do Usability and UAT.
