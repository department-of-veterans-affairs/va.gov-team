Agenda:



1. Introductions
2. Overview of IPP
3. Discussion on non Veteran experiences

Notes



* Porta
    * Product for IPP initiative
    * Need to better understand non-Veteran experience, eg VSOs, POA
* Lesley
    * Design/Research Lead, OCTO Benefits Portfolio
    * Accredited representative team
* Julie
    * Designer, OCTO Benefits Portfolio
    * Lens: Compensation based benefits
    * UX Design and Research
* Review IPP prototype
    * Consider cohesive experience for non-Veterans
* OCTO Goal:
    * Improve login experience of Veterans
    * As of today, 4 credentials, consolidating to Login.gov and ID.me provide most secure credential offerings
    * About 6 million Veterans that need to either create or start using Login.gov and ID.me credentials
    * Only 3 out of 10 Veterans can complete in person identity verification remote
        * Currently, USPS offers an in person component that satisfies a step within verification but not holistic and more as a back up
* Login.gov Adoption Goal (Product Owner: Tom Black)
    * Reduce friction for Veterans to create and start using Login.gov or ID.me
        * For Login.gov this requires in person verification as well
    * VA is authoritative source for identity data for Veterans
    * Collaborating with Login.gov to help stand up an in person proofing pilot
        * How does Veteran register for this process to verify in person?
        * Upon coming to a VA facility, how do we set up a process that enables a “proofing agent” to enable a Veteran to complete this process
        * Standing up an application and service, how do we ensure that we are coordinating with teams already supporting non Veterans that can help inform how we stand up the services for proofing agents?
    * Research:
        * Consideration of VSOs, attorneys, and claims agents
        * Initial pilot targeted to VA employees to build off of external tool connected to MPI, ie IAM Toolkit aka Identity Verifiers or MHV coordinators
    * Long term goal - Ability to use application across different stakeholder groups that have POA
    * NIST guidelines are very stringent of what needs to happen
        * MHV has in person verification process but through gap analysis determined they did not enable compliance with NIST guidelines
* Share out of IPP Prototype
    * Have to be a way to automate this more given there’s so many fields to fill out
    * Mobile passport application for Customs
        * Takes photo and fills out data fields
        * Decreases friction of inputting data
    * Consideration of trainings and certification process for proofing agents
        * Login.gov Adoption response: We want to ensure minimal training is required to increase ease of adoption by many possible proofing agents
    * Why VHIC instead of VIC
        * As for the VIC, I wouldn’t recommend using it as an ID for proofing purposes of identity for Login.gov. VIC does not do any in-person proofing and is only used as validation of Veteran status to partake in discounts at private retailers. Validation from an identity purpose is only through the login credentials used to access VIC. The VIC application process itself asks for a current government ID only to ensure the personal photo being applied to the VIC matches their government identification. As for the VIC card itself, the photo on the VIC does not align to the same guidelines required for other official government identification cards, such as the VHIC, driver’s licenses, or passports. Additionally, exploration is happening now to see if the legislative requirement for a photo on the card can be amended.
* Representative facing team is starting research
    * Initiating exploration of representing facing team experience 
        * Possible offering in that experience
    * Continue Login.gov Adoption and representative facing team engagement
        * Possible timing:
            * Team is onboarding, upon onboarding completion engage Login.gov Adoption
            * Alex Prokop coordinating with authentication team
                * Intention to stand up portal for representatives 
                * Possible placement in dashboard area
* Outcome:
    * Continue to engage with Lesley and Julie to share updates and coordinate
    * VBA has VSO liaison 
        * Enables VSO reps, attorneys, and claims agents
        * Marty
        * Currently exploring VSO journey for engaging with Veterans
