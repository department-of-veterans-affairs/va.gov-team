    * Can do that, have not done yet

* Rahul: API documentation for Login.gov?
* Carrie: What do we need to capture on the DL level and backend level to meet IAL2 standards?
* Akhlaq: where will the data live and how do we send PII bundles?
* Carrie: We use USPS’s API to create the barcode number. That is what ties our authenticated accounts to their system. So when the user walks in, the USPS retail person scans the barcode/barcode number as the very first step
    * But their system does NOT allow for appointments, so we could not include that in our workflow
    * Their system is the RSS system…retails services something or other….I can find the name but not sure it matters
* There is an external way to communicate with the system (12:59PM)
*
