**H1: Register to verify in person**

**What is in-person identity proofing?**

In-person identity proofing is a way for Veterans to verify their identity for their Login.gov account at a VA Medical Center.

**Why verify?**

By verifying their identity, Veterans will upgrade to a more secure Login.gov account and obtain complete access to their healthcare and benefits on VA.gov.

**What can I do in this application?**

This application allows a Veteran to locate a site that offers in-person identity proofing, learn what they need to bring, and register themselves for a walk-in appointment.

## **H2: Sign in with your Login.gov account to begin.**

**\[CTA: Login.gov\]**

If you decide not to verify your identity in person, you may exit the application by closing this tab at any time.

# **H1: In-Person Identity Proofing**

Identity Proofing is the process of verifying your identity. You have chosen to verify your identity in person at a participating VA Medical Center. If you decide not to verify your identity in person, you may close this tab at any time.

**Please note that any form of ID you present must be authentic and not have expired.**

You will need to bring the following items with you:

## **H2: Confirmation Case Number**

Once you complete the steps on Login.gov, we’ll generate a Confirmation Case Number that will be valid for 10 business days.

## **H2: Social Security Number**

You do not need to bring your physical Social Security card.

You will need to provide VA staff with your Social Security Number so that they may verify your identity.

## **H2: Your State-issued ID**

At this time, the following forms of identification are accepted:

- A valid, unexpired state-issued driver’s license **or** identification card from any of the 50 states, the District of Columbia (DC), or other US territories (Guam, US Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico)

## **H2: Your email address**

To make sure that we are verifying the right account, you will be asked to tell the proofing agent (the authorized VA staff member who will be helping you) the email address that you used to set up your Login.gov account and register for your walk-in appointment with. This should be a private email address that only you can access. Upon successful completion of in-person identity verification, you will also be asked to sign in to your Login.gov account using this email address at the end of the walk-in appointment.
