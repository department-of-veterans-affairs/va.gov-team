# Communication Campaign

## What is this directory

This directory contains documentation and content related to the communication campaign designed to support login.gov adoption and VA's larger secure sign-in transition efforts. The campaign has 2 main work streams: 

-   Organic adoption: communications focused on awareness and encouraging those without a modern credential to adopt one

-   Reactivation: communications targeted at users who have both legacy and modern credentials, pushing them to use their modern credentials as their primary sign-in method.

## Current Status 

Last updated: May 21, 2024

This work has been paused since January 2024 and is under evaluation for re-priorization as VA OCTO re-evaluates their approach to deprecating legacy sign-in credentials and migrating Veterans to more secure credentials.
