##Call Center Focus Group

This will be attached to the knowledge materials resources for call center representatives
Normally attach Word Documents for call center resources

Include a schedule of the communication campaign. Perhaps a calendar?

Maybe change to “’already’ have an account” to make it clearer

What about non-Veterans who log into VA.gov?

Include something about USPS in person proofing, for the Veterans who cannot verify identity online

Include something about rerouting through ID.me when signing in with MHV or DSL. “Other sign in options, with other security features”

Next steps: Async review of document, and follow up meeting will be scheduled.
