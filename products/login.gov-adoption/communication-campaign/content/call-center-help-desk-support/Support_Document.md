Secure Sign In Transition Overview
----------------------------------

##### What sign-in changes are happening on VA.gov?

As VA continues to use technology to improve services for Veterans and their families, we must evolve our security standards to continue to protect their identities and personal information. One big step we're taking is to transition all Veterans and other beneficiaries who use VA.gov and other VA online services to a modern, secure sign-in account by December 31, 2024.

Here's what will change for Veterans and other beneficiaries startingin about a year from now, by December 31, 2024:

-   Veterans will have 2 sign-in account options that meet modern security standards: Login.gov or ID.me. They'll be able to use their account to sign in to VA.gov, VA mobile applications, and any VA online service to manage all their VA benefits and care.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hnAfRPvSc7ld6yY3JPFh8w4wYmC1poZE1yzpcq_gZCP2jyXA2pRbpNl3W53XYeFcvFDE_wkr0wU_MbbFJ0aW0bI2lA5PJuHxy-Dvzoq8k1U2acd0ALt5YVwol09ir-cJ3tLxRtVhcbfh)  ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/YDjXftQNteYQqPK6OngKkKnnczOVE72JG9xf2XcaBgElVKHt9JNXQG8W92wOdeaV5_Kvplqp4CZp948-IghXAMPzM7svemcxQ_dqb4wGd0fKT9j62q0TxFrvPnisjk4zDzCT5q-i0XC-)

-   Veterans will no longer have the option to sign in to VA.gov or other VA online services with their My HealtheVet or DS Logon username and password.

-   Veterans will need to use a unique email address and set up multifactor authentication for their account as part of the requirements of both Login.gov and ID.me.

##### Why will VA allow only 2 sign-in account options by December 31, 2024?\
Here's why we're transitioning to only 2 modern, secure sign-in account options (Login.gov orand ID.me) by December 31, 2024:

-   Identity theft and related medical identity theft are serious issues that can cause severe financial hardship and disruption in medical care for Veterans and their families. In 2022, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received more than 1.1 million reports of identity theft. [reference: [FTC news release](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/new-ftc-data-show-consumers-reported-losing-nearly-88-billion-scams-2022)] And Veterans, service members, and their spouses reported more than 193,000 cases of identity theft and fraud. [reference: FTC 2022 data book]

-   We're required by law to help all Veterans begin using a sign-in account that meets modern security standards of identity verification and multifactor authentication and to simplify the sign-in process for Veterans. Login.gov and ID.me accounts help us meet both these requirementsboth better meet these standards than using a My HealtheVet or DS Logon username and password.

-   Veterans have told us many times over several years that they want fewer account options---and they want to be able to use their chosen sign-in account to access all of their VA benefits and care.

Why is VA choosing to allow both Login.gov and ID.me rather than just Login.gov? [For response to inquiries only for now -- don't post on FAQs page]

At this time, both Login.gov and ID.me are modern, secure accounts. The accounts are similar in capabilities and cost.Â 

Login.gov is the public's one account for government and we want to encourage Veterans to use it. But ID.me does offer some features that make it easier for some Veterans to set up their account and verify their identity. For example, ID.me offers supervised video calls to help people who need more support to verify their identity. ID.me also offers easier access for Veterans who live in countries outside of the U.S. So, we need to provide both account options to make it as easy as possible for all Veterans and beneficiaries to make this change.

##### Will Veterans have to add multifactor authentication by December 31, 2024?

Yes. Both Login.gov and ID.me require multifactor authentication (MFA) as part of the account set-up process. Multifactor authentication is an extra layer of protection on your account. It helps make sure that it's you trying to access your account---and not a hacker. You may be familiar with this from other apps where you receive a phone call or text message with a unique authentication code when you sign in.

Communication Campaign
----------------------

##### Overview

To prepare for these changes, Veterans who only have a My HealtheVet (MHV) or DS Logon (DSL) account are being encouraged to create a Login.gov or ID.me account and sign in with one of these accounts the next time they need to access or manage their VA benefits and health care online. Veterans who already have an existing Login.gov or ID.me account are being encouraged to get in the habit of using those accounts to sign in to VA.gov now.

Veterans will receive a series of messages via 4 main methods to inform them of the upcoming changes:Â 

-   GovDelivery Email

-   Unified sign-in page updates

-   Veteran Resources and VA News Newsletters

-   VA.gov Blog Posts

If a Veteran continues signing in with My HealtheVet or DS Logon and they do not want to create a Login.gov or ID.me account, they will need to complete multifactor authentication. They'll see pages with ID.me branding, see image below of ID.me logo, as ID.me provides the multifactor authentication service and security features for MHV and DSL. However, this does not mean that the Veteran has an ID.me account. They will still need to complete multifactor authentication to access their MHV or DSL account and will still need to start using Login.gov or ID.me to sign in by December 31, 2024.

Email CommunicationsÂ 
---------------------

Veterans will receive emails starting in January 2024 that will continue every month until December 31, 2024.

Email campaign communications will be tailored to 2 audiences:

-   Veterans who have not created a Login.gov or ID.me account

-   Veterans who already have created a Login.gov or ID.me account but their last login was with their DSL or MHV account

The following section on email communications will show what type of messaging Veterans will see if they do or do not already have a Login.gov or ID.me account. Both emails will direct Veterans to the unified sign in page to either create a Login.gov or ID.me account or login with their Login.gov or ID.me account if they have one already.

Text from the email:

Dear Veteran,

In about a year, on December 31, 2024, we'll transition to only 2 modern, secure account options for VA.gov and other VA online services: Login.gov or ID.me. You'll then no longer be able to use your My HealtheVet username and password or DS Logon account to sign in to VA onlines services anymore.

With Login.gov or ID.me, you'll still have access to all the same information and services you use today, with the added value of an account that protects your data at 2 levels - so only you can access and change your stored information.

Learn more about Login.gov and ID.me to decide which account is right for you. We encourage you to create an account now so that you have plenty of time to get used to it before the change.

[Learn more about Login.gov and ID.me]

We're here to help. Learn more about Login.gov and how to create an account. If you have a technical issue while you're trying to create an account or sign in, call our MyVA411 main information line at 800-698-2411. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Text from the email:

Veterans: Use your (Login.gov/ID.me) account to manage your VA benefits online

Our records show that you have an ID.me account. We're contacting you to encourage you to start using this account when you sign in to a VA website or mobile app.\
Why to start using your (Login.gov/ID.me) account

In about a year, on December 31, 2024, we'll transition to only 2 modern, secure account options for VA.gov and other VA online services: Login.gov or ID.me. You'll then no longer be able to use other accounts (like DS Logon) to sign in to VA online services anymore. We encourage you to start using your ID.me account now so you have plenty of time to get used to it before this change.

(Login.gov/ID.me) accounts meet modern security standards. The account protects your data at 2 levels - so only you can access and change your stored information.

When you sign in using you (Login.gov/ID.me) account, you'll have access to all the same VA information and services you access today with any other accounts you may use (like DS Logon)

[Sign In to VA.gov]

We're here to help. Learn more about Login.gov and how to create an account. If you have a technical issue while you're trying to create an account or sign in, call our MyVA411 main information line at 800-698-2411. We're here 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

##### Why am I receiving this email?

You received this email in preparation for changes to how you sign in to VA.gov. On December 31, 2024, you will only be able to access VA sites with either a Login.gov or ID.me account. Veterans will need to sign in using one of these 2 account types that meet our new, stronger security requirements.Â 

To prepare for these changes, Veterans who only have a My HealtheVet or DS Logon account are being encouraged to create a Login.gov or ID.me account and sign in with one of these accounts the next time they need to access or manage their VA benefits and healthcare online. Veterans who already have an existing Login.gov or ID.me account are being encouraged to get in the habit of using those accounts to sign in to VA.gov now.

Can I still use a DS Logon or My HealtheVet account to sign in?

Yes. At this time, you can use your DS Logon or My HealtheVet account to sign in to VA.gov. After December 31st, 2024 you will no longer be able to use your DS Logon or My HealtheVet account and will need to have set up a Login.gov or ID.me account to access your VA.gov benefits and services.

Unified VA.gov Sign-In Page Updates
-----------------------------------

All visitors to VA.gov will see the same sign-in page updates, regardless of whether they already have a Login.gov or ID.me account. Starting in late January 2024, all visitors to the Unified Sign-In Page will see an alert box at the top notifying them that they will need to create or start using either a Login.gov or ID.me account. There is a hyperlink in the alert box that will direct users to a resource and support page on creating an account for VA.gov that features information on how to create a Login.gov or ID.me account. [Link to resource and support page for creating an account for VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/resources/creating-an-account-for-vagov/#:~:text=If%20you%20need%20help%20creating,on%20the%20Login.gov%20website.&text=If%20you%20need%20help%20creating%20an%20ID.me%20account%2C%20you,on%20the%20ID.me%20website.)

Unified VA.gov Sign-In Page AlertÂ Â

Will there be any other changes to the Unified Sign-In Page?

As the campaign continues, there will be updates to the unified sign-in page to encourage Veterans to create Login.gov or ID.me accounts. For example, DS Logon and My HealtheVet buttons will eventually be replaced with hyperlinks. VA staff will be notified of these changes before they happen so as to be prepared for questions and support needed by Veterans.

##### When will DS Logon and My HealtheVet go away permanently?

DS Logon and My HealtheVet will go away permanently on December 31, 2024.

##### How do I sign in to VA.gov?

Before December 31, 2024, you can sign in to VA.gov with any of these 4 accounts:

-   Login.gov

-   ID.me

-   My HealtheVet

-   DS Logon

If you don't have an account, you are encouraged to create one with Login.gov or ID.me now by clicking on the "Create an account with Login.gov" or "Create an account with ID.me" on the sign-in page so that you are prepared for the sign in changes happening by December 31, 2024.

##### What if I get an error message when I try to sign in to VA.gov?

If you get the message "We're sorry. Something went wrong on our end," take\
these steps:Â 

-   Clear your browser's cookies and cache. Depending on your browser, you'll find this information referred to as "Browsing Data," "Browsing History," or "Website Data."

Account Creation and Usage
--------------------------

##### Should I create a Login.gov or ID.me account to sign in to VA.gov?

We encourage you to create a Login.gov or ID.me account. By December 31, 2024 all VA websites will follow a new sign-in process through VA.gov.

Login.gov is a secure U.S. government account that meets modern security standards. You can use Login.gov to access VA benefits, services, and information in a single, secure account. And you can use your account to manage other government benefits and services (like Social Security benefits and federal job applications).Â 

ID.me is a commercially-owned account that also meets modern security standards. You can use your ID.me account to manage VA and other government benefits and services.Â 

You can also choose to create an ID.me account. If you do not have a state-issued ID or a U.S. Social Security number, it is recommended that you create an ID.me account.

##### How do I create a Login.gov account?

You can create your account on the Login.gov website ([secure.Login.gov](http://secure.login.gov/)).

Here's what you'll need to create your account:Â 

-   An email addressÂ 

-   A unique password that includes at least 12 charactersÂ 

When you set up your account, you'll need to set up multifactor authentication. You'll need to choose at least one of these authentication options:Â 

-   Entering a security code from your authentication applicationÂ 

-   Using your security keyÂ 

-   Entering a security code that you receive by text or by phone call; international numbers cannot be usedÂ 

-   Entering a backup codeÂ 

-   Using your federal government employee or military ID (PIV or CAC)Â 

The first time you sign in to VA.gov with your Login.gov account, we'll ask you to verify your identity.Â 

Here's everything you'll need to verify your identity:Â 

-   Your driver's license or non-driver's license state-issued IDÂ 

-   Your Social Security numberâ¯Â 

-   A phone number on a phone plan that's in your name

##### How do I create an ID.me account?

You can create your account on the ID.me website.Â 

Here's what you'll need to create your account:Â 

-   An email address

-   A unique password that includes at least 8 charactersÂ 

The first time you use your account to manage your VA benefits or information, you'll need to verify your identity.Â 

Here's what you'll need to verify your identity:

-   A phone number in your name

-   A government-issued photo ID, like a driver's license, state ID, passport, or passport card

##### What's multifactor authentication and why does VA.gov use it?

Multifactor authentication is an extra layer of protection on your account. It helps us make sure that it's you trying to access your account---and not a hacker. It's also sometimes called 2-factor authentication.

Each time you sign in to a VA website or app, you'll use multifactor authentication to verify your identity.â¯You'll do this using a device that only you should have, such as your mobile phone.Â 

You'll get a unique code by text message or phone call, or through another option you choose. Other options may include a supporting app like Google Authenticator, a security key, or backup codes. You'll then enter that code to access your account.Â 

This way, even if someone were to guess or steal your username and password, multifactor authentication can stop them from accessing your account.

Troubleshooting Signing In
--------------------------

##### What if I have trouble uploading my ID to verify my identity?

If your ID was rejected, first identify why they were rejected. You may need to retry taking and submitting high-quality photos of your documents. Here are some suggestions:Â 

-   Use a high resolution camera like a smartphone or tablet camera. Your computer webcam may not take clear photos.

-   Use a solid, dark background.

-   Take your photos in a well-lit area with indirect light so that there is no glare on your ID.

-   Take your photos straight on and not at an angle, making sure to match the orientation of your ID.

-   Do not crop out the edges of your ID.Â 

-   Make sure there are no other objects in the photo

-   Check that ID barcodes are not damaged or dirty.

-   Try to hold your phone still while taking the photos. It may help to prop your arms on the table to steady yourself.

If you are still having trouble verifying your ID online, there are a couple of options. Login.gov will give you the option to [verify your identity in-person at a local US Post Office](https://www.login.gov/help/verify-your-identity/verify-your-identity-in-person/). ID.me has an option to verify over [video call](https://help.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/360052242853-Verifying-your-identity-on-a-video-call).Â 

##### What if I cannot verify my phone number on Login.gov?

If you do not have a phone number in your name or have trouble verifying your phone number, you can use your address to verify by mail instead. You will get a letter in the mail with a verification code to finish verifying your identity.

Login.gov will send the letter to an address that they have verified and associated with you. If you need to change this address, you will need to start over and verify your identity again with the new address.

Letters are sent the next business day via USPS First-Class Mail. The verification code will expire 30 days after the date when you submit your request. You should receive your letter in 5 to 10 days. If you do not receive your letter or the verification code has expired, you will need to request a new one by following the steps:Â 

1.  Go to [https://secure.login.gov](https://secure.login.gov/).Â Â 

2.  Select "Send me another letter" when asked to enter your code.

##### What if I cannot verify my phone number on ID.me?

If you do not have a phone number in your name or have trouble verifying your phone number, you may have the option to finish verifying on a video call with a Video Chat Agent. To set up a video chat with an ID.me agent, go to <https://help.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/360052242853-Verifying-your-identity-on-a-video-call>

##### Can my ID be expired?

Login.gov does not accept an expired ID. ID.me accepts state issued IDs that have expired within the last 12 months but you will need to show documentation of renewal, extension, or a temporary ID from the DMV.Â Â 

##### What if I don't have a valid state issued ID?

If you do not have a valid driver's license or state ID card you cannot use Login.gov for identity verification. You will need to create an ID.me account instead and use your passport or verify via a video call.

##### I don't have a smartphone. How do I verify my identity through ID.me?

You'll need either a landline or mobile phone, and a computer with an internet connection.

At this time, ID.me does not support:

-   Phones registered under a family member or spouse

-   Virtual phone services like Skype or Google Voice

-   International phone numbers

If you don't have a phone that can receive text messages, during the set-up process:

-   Choose "phone call" when asked how you'd like to receive your 6-digit code to set up your phone for 2-factor authentication.

-   Choose "email" when asked how you'd like to receive the link to download the ID.me Wallet app to get started using ID.me.

If you don't have a phone that can take photos, during the set-up process:

-   Choose the "verify by answering questions" option when asked how you'd like to verify your identity, or

-   Be sure you have a photo of either your driver's license or passport on your computer, or that you can scan one in, so you can upload it to verify your identity using one of these forms of ID.

##### How can I verify my identity if I live outside the U.S.?

If your address is outside the U.S., you can use ID.me to verify your identity. You'll need to show your identity documents on a video call with an ID.me representative. To do this, follow these steps to create an account. After you create your account or sign in, you'll be redirected to the verification process. During the verification process, when prompted to choose your verification method or document, select "I don't live in the United States" or "I don't have any of the documents listed above". Next, select "Get started", then follow the prompts to verify your identity on a video call. You must enter your personal information, submit your documents, wait for them to be reviewed, then join a live video call to get verified.

Make sure to have your identity documents ready. If you don't have a U.S. Social Security number, you'll need to show a valid U.S. passport as one of your identity documents. If you do not have a passport, you will need to [apply for government-issued photo identification](https://help.id.me/hc/en-us/articles/12252554988055).

##### What if I'm having trouble answering the ID.me security questions?

Try answering the personal security questions again, following these tips:

-   Pull a copy of your credit report from Experian, a credit reporting company, and use it to double-check that the answers you're providing to ID.me during the proofing process match the information in your report.

-   If you think your credit report has the wrong information, you'll need to file a dispute with Experian.

-   If you've recently moved, changed names, or have a different permanent address, try using your previous information.

-   Make sure you enter a phone number that's registered in your name.

If you answered the security questions, but are still not verified, you can try using your driver's license or passport to verify your identity. Be sure to follow the image guidelines provided when you upload a copy of your driver's license or passport.

##### What if I lose my means of multifactor authentication for my Login.gov account?

If you are locked out of your Login.gov account and do not have access to or have lost your multifactor authentication method and do not have a backup, you will need to delete your current Login.gov account and create a new one.Â 

As a security measure, Login.gov requires that you follow the steps listed below and a 24 hour waiting period if you have lost access to your authentication methods and need to delete your account.

-   1\. Go to your government application sign in page or to <https://secure.login.gov/>

-   2\. Sign in with your email and password

-   3\. On the authentication page, click on "Choose another security option"

-   4\. Scroll to the bottom and click on the "deleting your account" link

-   5\. Read through all the information carefully to make sure deleting your account is your only option

-   6\. Click on "Yes, continue deletion"

-   7\. You will receive two emails.

-   The first email confirms Login.gov received your request. Your account is not yet deleted. Additional action is required.

-   The second email is sent to you 24 hours later. Follow the directions in that email to complete the deletion process.

Once you've deleted your account, you can then follow the directions to create an account on Login.gov and use the same email address that you'd used previously.

##### What if I get an error message when I try to sign in to VA.gov?

If you get the message "We're sorry. Something went wrong on our end," take these steps:Â 

-   Clear your internet browser's cookies and cache. Depending on your browser, you'll find this information referred to as "Browsing Data," "Browsing History," or "Website Data."

-   Make sure your cookies are enabled in your browser settings. Depending on the browser you're using, you'll usually find this information in the "Tools," "Settings," or "Preferences" menu.

-   If you're using Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge, and clearing your cookies and cache doesn't fix the problem, try using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox instead.

-   If you're using Chrome or Firefox and it isn't working, get the latest updates for your browser.
