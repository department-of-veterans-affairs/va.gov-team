## Sitewide Content

### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Dawn Munoz

### Notes:
- Close to moving into a variation of Phase 1 in terms of appointments
appointments has lived on VA.gov for some time
- Viewing appointments was on MHV but managing apointments was on VA.gov
- Processes for appointments are going to change as everything pertaining to appointments is moving to VA.gov
- Getting ready to launch into the try me phase 
- For veterans who are already familiar with managing appointments on VA.gov: "if you have been managing your appointments on VA.gov then you will continue to use the same tool"
- MHV is going away as a sign in in January
- Tricky messaging because there is a difference between MHV sign in and MHV portal
- Difficulty in conveying how to sign up for VA.gov by using a Login.gov account
- Forming a "glossary of terms" to help people understand the differences in the language
- Content brief is to show what studies show but they are not necessarily style guides
- Things from content briefs are taken in as findings
- LGA team will follow up with Susan Haidary to understand coordinator workflow and connect with potential MVP sites

## MHV Comms Working Group 

### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Dawn Munoz

### Notes:
FAQS: Bank of questions and answers for presenters on MHV on VA.gov project
- Use content for other channels

Track how we are doing with communications
In comms plan, desired measures were provided - now we have to put those in place and communicate them to leadership

Danielle and Treva will provide a 10 min preview on a call of MHV on VA.gov
- High level
- Product line people will attend to answer questions
- Working on some slides
- Use MHV on VA.gov briefing
- Focus briefing more on what veterans need to know rather than what the project is about

Change management process
- Pro triangle assessment
- Sent out to key stakeholders
- Look at how assessments of awareness and knowledge will be made
- Important to capture the questions for the FAQs and to gauge where confusion and uncertainty lies
- Adkar assessment
	- awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, reinforcement


MHV coordinators wanted to know if they will be supporting veterans upgrading to Login.gov
- He can upgrade veterans to MHV premium
- If options are taken away and it’s all Login.gov and ID.me, they can’t help the veterans as of right now
- Can they do that? The answer is complicated
- This is something that the LGA is pursuing - how can we enable MHV coordinators and other staff members to help transition veterans?
- Should email be the first encounter of MHV sunset (outside of blog posts)
- Treva, Rebekah, Ngozi from MHV and Danielle from VA
- MHV coordinators and help desk will need to be involved - Susan Haidary

### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Carl Dickerson, Aliyah Blackmore, Dawn Munoz, Joe Niquette

### Notes:
- Sitewide has given feedback to Carl's reactivation emails
- Sofia got a response to use [OIT Brand System](https://digital.va.gov/oit-brand-system/)for sourcing CLP images
- Went over Verify you identity FAQ page
- Remove references to DS Logon going away
- From Joe: "I still think it’s a valid question as to whether the first time we mention “you’ll no longer be able to use your DSLogon account” is within this email. My personal recommendation would be to not mention anything about DSLogon at all. Generally the goal of this email is to get more folks using login.gov rather than dslogon..but we can encourage login.gov without mentioning dslogon."
- is there a benefit to triggered email vs sent ones
- doesn't seem like we are ready to communicate about sunset: if we don't want to socialize MHV and DSL yet then we should harp on Login.gov and ID.me to be the preferred method
- Next steps:
  - Carl will adjust email content to communicate that there is a preferred sign in option
  - Dawn will touch base with John and Tom how we are communicating the sunset


## June 29, 2023

### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Carl Dickerson, Aliyah Blackmore, Porta Antiporta, Joe Niquette

### Notes:
- Currently the email links to the sign in FAQs on VA.gov instead of CLP
- Change language from recommend to need and should
- What do we do in the event that a veteran loses an MFA device?
  - give out a resource that may not live on VA.gov and just listen out if this is a common issue
- Review Verifying your Identity FAQs
  - Porta and Joe weighed in on questions pertaining to ID.me
  - Joe recommended not getting too specific in answering questions and linking to the Login.gov and ID.me pages where needed
  - there are security concerns in being too specific
  - If answers are too speciic and it doesn't line up with reality it could result in a dispute
  - more specific questions need to be owned by ID.me and Login.gov
  
## June 28, 2023

### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Carolyn Williams, Carl Dickerson, Kristin Oulette, Laura Willwerth, Sara Smith

### Notes:
- Kristin really liked our journey map overall and wants to use it as an example for discussions with other teams
- Kristin asked if we have a plan for after the alert phase. We responded that we are aware that we will need to provide support for people who may have missed the deadline but we are also going to have services that will support those with tech issues or who fail (IPP). We will need to consider this issue further though and come up with a more solid plan if we notice (early) if veterans seem to be having problems or falling off from comms
- Laura asked if we can track analytics on blogs. We will try to get the analytics to tag  news.gov but we can also track clicks on the newsletter and other places (like socials) where blogs are posted
- We should think about how we discuss ID.me and how we might include it in our content as an option for those who are unable to create a Login.gov account
- Next steps: As we continue to detail our solutions we will share them with Sitewide and refer to where we are on the journey and what we are hoping to accomplish. Next meeting with IA is in a month but we will maintain our weekly content syncs with Sitewide and MHV

## June 22, 2023

### Attendees: Carl Dickerson, Aliyah Blackmore, Laura Willwerth

### Notes:
- Laura and Aliyah provided feedback on email draft. Carl will take their feedback and slim down the content
- Laura did give a quick overview of Medallia. She noted that Danielle was already working on pulling identity related feedback
- Our campaign page is set up for G-Analytics and Medallia
- We need to form a schedule around how we check on this data
## June 12, 2023

### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Danielle Thierry

### Notes:
- Set up this meeting to understand how Danielle uses Google Analytics to look at data for blogs (acc to Tim Hudak from VEO)
- https://news.va.gov/119761/securely-accessing-your-va-account-online/ was not distributed through normal pathways, according to Elizabeth, so this could explain why there is not a lot of comments on it
- Discovered that news.va.gov is not tagged for Google Analytics tracking - we might need to reach out to the Analytics team if we want blogs tracked moving forward
- Google Analytics can be tracked for campaign landing pages
- When using Google analytics:
  -  In the future the data used for PACT will move to GA4 but for now use Va.gov production and All VA.gov Website Data
  -  Put link to URL into search bar
  -  Look at Page views, Avg time on page, Entrances, Bounce rate
  -  Under events you can see what event action people are taking
<img width="673" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-12 at 1 18 31 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/125686639/f7fe02b7-9e1a-4187-94bb-d76065cf3ed1">

- Save a report and name it and export
- Can create dashboards 
- Under audience and user explorer you can try to track where people came from (although Danielle has only gotten this to work a few times)
-  Danielle and Sitewide use Medallia data from online survey
-  Resources and support requested to have a button for "how would you rate your experience on this page?" < Good or Bad
-  Medallia allows you to customize
-  VAMC have a survey for experiences online
-  Danielle can share the data for FAQs which are usually complaints about the process



## June 8, 2023

### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Carl Dickerson, Aliyah Blackmore, Laura Willwerth, Joe Niquette, Amber Parsley, Ngozi Abolarin

### Notes:
- Last week we made edits to the Account Creation and Sign-in Page and there was discussion around the differences between the Login.gov and ID.me IAL2 processes
  - No forced verification but there is very limited access with IAL1
  - We had this discussion because need to find out what types of confirmation emails are being referred to on the sign in page. There is a confirmation email that users receive when they create an account as well.
- Account Verification FAQ Page
- Remove first FAQ after speaking with Carnetta
- will look into/vetting requirements for phone to be in your name for Login.gov (because it doesn't say that on Login); and adding a note that if you can't fulfill the phone verificaton step, they can send you a letter in the mail.
- need to align the language for the CTA -- currently one says "go to Login." and other says "visit DSL"
- changing question from verifying at VA health facility to verifying at USPS
  - explain the steps to verify your identity in person
  - explain that IPP happens after you have failed the online verification option
  - more people are verifying online successfully (using Login.gov and ID.me)
  - Joe: there will be an executive order released for VA to have an IPP solution
  - There may be a future FAQ for an IPP process at a VAMC owned by VA

## May 31, 2023
### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Carl Dickerson, Aliyah Blackmore, Laura Willwerth, Danielle Thierry

### Notes:

- Login.gov blog rework

- Make post about account creation and mention post office 
- Go online and create a login.gov or id.me account and then discuss options for verification failure
- Right now in person is only for failure
- Link over to the Login.gov material

- Acknowledge that people are having trouble
- Danielle’s paragraph: “We know that some Veterans are reporting having trouble verifying their identity to create a Login.gov account. We encourage you to create your account now and contact the Login.gov help center if you need support. If you can’t verify your identity online, you can now go to select U.S. post offices to verify your identity in person. You also have the option to create a verified ID.me account to manage your VA benefits and health care.”

- Next blog: IPP at post office for veterans having trouble with the account creation
  - resolve for lack of awareness around Login.gov

Video for MFA can be linked to CLP

Can we send out a broader security message without focusing on Login.gov?
No: Make Login.gov the heart of the message rather than down further
Add in person verification

- Might be a good time to ask John, Tom, and Carnetta about adding information about IPP to Sitewide

- VA benefits for Campaign landing page
  - Transitioning service members
  - Family member hub
  - Disability and healthcare

### Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Laura Willwerth
### Notes:
- PDF:
  - Account creation guide is IAL1 only

  -  landing page will be a hub for all Login.gov content
  -  we will start off by linking existing content and we may consider adding new content that pertains to the campaign
