# News.VA.gov blog with VEO
November 29, 2022

## Goal: What do we need to do?

* We need to post a blog on [news.va.gov](https://news.va.gov/) by end of December.
* The focus of this blog post is to raise awareness about Login.gov.
* We won't mention anything about other credentials sunsetting.
* This is the first blog post in a series that we will write to help Veterans understand they need to migrate to Login.gov.

## Purpose: What do we need to communicate?

* Describe what Login.gov is.
* Describe the benefits of using Login.gov.
* Describe how to set up a Login.gov account.

## User stories: What is a user trying to do?

* As a Veteran, I need to understand Login.gov and its benefits, so that I know why I should set up Login.gov as my primary or additional credential.
* As a Veteran, I need to understand how to set up Login.gov, so that I can try and set up Login.gov on my own terms.
* As a Veteran, I need to know where to go for help if I face an issue while setting up Login.gov, so that I can finish setting up Login.gov.

## Audience: Who do we need to communicate to?

* Veterans, Caregivers and anyone who may be acting on Veterans' behalf.
* Readers of [news.va.gov](https://news.va.gov/).

## Research: What have we found in discovery? What content already exists?

* Discovery: "Don't sell me, just tell me" – For Veterans, credential service providers (CSP) are a necessary evil. We should provide clarity by telling them what is required, rather than trying to sell them on something that isn’t really a choice.
* Discovery: "Humanized, contextualized, and dedicated help" – Respect Veteran independence by allowing them to navigate Login.gov setup on their terms, but provide respectful, flexible, and dedicated help so they can succeed before giving up entirely. Once they reach the point of frustration, they are lost for good.
* Discovery: "Veterans have paradoxical views on security" – Veterans distrust the government, but overestimate it's online security. They worry about personal privacy, but feel like so much is already known about them that their My HealtheVet account being compromised doesn't pose much of a threat. 
* Discovery: "Meet Veterans where they are" – Veterans are no strangers to creating new accounts, using MFA and navigating appointments. Leverage what is familiar to them to make the process understandable and proactively address their concerns. 
* We can draw on the existing communication that was added to TAP (see Appendix).

## Channels: Which channels or digital touchpoints will we use to deliver this content?

* This will be posted on VA news: https://news.va.gov/

### TAP Communication

#### Create your Login.gov account

To manage your VA benefits online, we encourage you to create a Login.gov account now.

Login.gov offers these benefits:
  * Access to VA benefits, services, and information in a single, secure account
  * A secure sign-in option that protects your privacy and complies with the latest federal security standards
  * A single account to manage your other government benefits and services (like Social Security benefits or federal job applications)
  * An account created, maintained, and secured by the U.S. government

At this time, you can also use your DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me account to sign in to VA.gov. But VA will soon no longer offer DS Logon as a sign-in option. And soon all VA websites will follow a new sign-in process through VA.gov with Login.gov as the recommended account.

Follow these 7 steps to create your Login.gov account

1. Go to VA.gov. Select Sign in from the site header. A sign-in screen will appear.
2. Start creating your account. Select Create an account with Login.gov. The Login.gov sign in page will appear. Select Create an account. This step will ask for your email address.
3. Provide your email address. Enter your email address and select your language preference. Then read and accept the rules of use and select Submit. This step will take you to instructions to confirm your email address.
4. Confirm your email address. Open a new browser window to check your email inbox. Open the email from Login.gov and select Confirm email address. This step will take you back to Login.gov to create your password. Note: If you enter an email that’s already connected to a Login.gov account, you’ll get an email from Login.gov that tells you how to reset your password instead.
5. Create your password. Enter a password that meets all the security requirements listed. Enter the password again to confirm. Then select Continue. This step will take you back to the Login.gov sign-in screen.
6. Sign in to Login.gov. Enter your email address and password. Then select Sign in. This step will take you to the authentication method setup screen.
7. Set up multifactor authentication. Select multifactor authentication. Choose at least 1 of these options:
   * Using face or touch unlock
   * Entering a security code from your authentication application
   * Using your security key
   * Entering a security code that you receive by text or by phone call
   * Entering a backup code
   * Using your federal government employee or military ID (PIV or CAC)
8. Follow the instructions to set up your multi-factor authentication method. Then select Agree and continue. Your account is now set up.

#### What to expect when you use your Login.gov account
The first time accessing a product or service through a VA website or app that requires a higher level of assurance, Login.gov will prompt you to verify your identity. Follow the instructions to provide some personal information and upload a photo of your government-issued ID. This process helps VA make sure that you’re you before they give you access to your personal information.
Then each time you sign in, you’ll use multifactor identification to verify your account. This process adds another layer of protection. 

#### Need help with your account?
Contact your benefits administrator. Or go to login.gov/help, or call the help desk, (844) 875-6446, M-F, 11am-3pm
