## TAP Curriculum Revisions

Melissa Rebstock requested TAP Curriculum revisions that included adjusting language to encourage creation of ID.me and Login.gov credentials. The following activity worksheet was created for ID.me and a PDF of a revision featuring comments is included in the folder.


Activity Worksheet: Create an ID.me account

To manage your VA benefits online, we encourage you to create a free ID.me account now.

ID.me offers these benefits:

-   Access to VA benefits, services, and information in a single, secure account

-   A secure sign-in option that protects your privacy and complies with modern federal security standards

-   A single account to manage your other government benefits and services (like Social Security benefits or federal job applications)

-   Offers access to [other websites and discounts](https://www.id.me/privacy?_ga=2.5549872.284209752.1709741728-782667316.1684915095) on commercial services.

-   At this time, you can also use your DS Logon, My HealtheVet or Login.gov account to sign in to VA gov

Please note: With the exception of DoD services, DS Logon will be discontinued as a sign-in option. Soon all websites will use a new way to sign in through VA.gov with Login.gov and ID.me.

Follow these 7 steps provided in Table 1 to create your ID.me account.

Set up multi-factor authentication

 |

ID.me recommends that you set up multi-factor authentication so that if someone guesses your password, they can't sign in as you. Select Set up multi-factor authentication then choose your preferred authentication method before selecting Continue.

 |

Secure your account

 |

Test your multifactor option to secure your account. For example, if you selected receiving a 6-digit code to your phone as your preferred authentication method, make sure you can receive the verification code on your phone and enter it on your ID.me screen. Once you have entered the code, select Continue.

Verify your ID.me account

 |

Verifying your identity for your ID.me account is critical. Doing so will allow you to access your benefits and healthcare on VA.gov. Click on the link to ID.me My Account to verify your identity. Enter your personal information and give consent to ID.me to collect biometric data and sensitive personal information. Then enter your phone number to receive a link where you can submit a photo of your identity document. You may complete verification by submitting your information through a remote process or submitting your information and meeting with an ID.me Trusted Referee over a video call.

WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU USE YOUR ID.ME ACCOUNT
==============================================

-   The first time accessing a product or service through a VA website or app that requires a higher level of assurance, ID.me will prompt you to verify your identity. Follow the instructions to provide personal information and upload a photo of your government-issued ID. Verifying your identity helps VA make sure that you're you before they give you access to your personal information.

-   Then each time you sign in, you'll use multifactor identification to confirm that it is you signing in to your account. Multifactor authentication is an extra layer of protection on your account. You'll do this using a device that only you should have, such as your mobile phone. You'll get a unique code by text message or phone call, or through another option you choose.
