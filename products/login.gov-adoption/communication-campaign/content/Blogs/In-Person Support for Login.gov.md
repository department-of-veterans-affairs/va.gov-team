**Login.gov offers in-person option for Veterans who can’t verify their identity online**

By VA Office of the Chief Technology Officer

To address growing concerns of cyber security and improve accessibility for all, VA is working hard to update and modernize our online experience. As part of our efforts, we’re encouraging Veterans to create a Login.gov account. Veterans can use this single, secure account to sign in to VA.gov and other online services to manage their VA benefits and health care.

Thousands of Veterans have already created Login.gov accounts. But some are reporting problems with verifying their identity online during the account creation process. To help make the process easier, Login.gov now offers an in-person option for people who can’t verify their identity online. 

**When you can use in-person identity verification**

When you create a Login.gov account online, the last step of the process to link your account with VA is to verify your identity. Login.gov asks you to provide your Social Security number and phone number and upload a copy of your driver’s license or state issued photo ID. This step helps to make sure that you’re you–and not someone pretending to be you.

Some Veterans find that this last step doesn’t work for them. For example, the system may not be able to read the information on your photo ID.

If you can’t complete the online verification process, Login.gov now gives you the option to go to a participating U.S. post office to verify your identity in person.

**How in-person identity verification works**

If you choose the in-person option, Login.gov will send you an email with this information: 

- link to find your nearest participating post office
- enrollment barcode to scan when you get to the post office

You’ll have 30 days to go to a participating post office and complete the process. You don’t need an appointment, but you’ll need to bring these documents with you:

- A copy of your enrollment barcode, printed or available to scan on your mobile device
- Your driver’s license or other state-issued ID (**Note:** Your ID can’t be expired and it must be the same one you used online)

A post office employee will review your documents and input your information into their system. After 24 hours you’ll get an email from Login.gov. If they successfully verified your identity, the email will include directions for how to finish setting up your account. If they couldn’t verify your identity, the email will include directions for what to do next.
