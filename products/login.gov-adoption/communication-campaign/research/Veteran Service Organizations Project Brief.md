# Veteran Service Organizations Project Brief 

>[!WARNING]
>  Deprioritized, focus on VA staff and Veteran stakeholders at VAMCs


## Background 

The Login.gov adoption campaign wants to partner with Veteran Service Organizations to broaden the reach of the Login.gov campaign, and better assist Veterans in the transition in setting up accounts and maintaining access to their benefits.


## Problem Statement

There are over 50 Veteran Service Organizations that assist Veterans in accessing their benefits. The relationship VA has with these organizations is unknown, and how best to partner with and leverage these relationships is a gray area. 


## Project Objectives



* Understand the Veteran Service Organization landscape, and identify partner organizations to work with.
* Veteran Service Organizations are prepared for the sunset of DSL and MHV, and are able to assist Veterans in creating Login.gov accounts.
* Veteran Service Organizations are equipped with the campaign knowledge to communicate with Veterans using campaign materials provided by.

* Co-creation workshop with VSOs to identify key components of toolkit


## Milestones

* Group interview with longitudinal study participants to understand a sample size of Veterans’ impressions of VSOs and their participation.
* VSO partners have been identified

## Questions



* What VSOs have been involved with OCTO’s work in the past?
* What is the average Veteran’s relationship with VSOs?
* How much technical support do VSO representatives provide when assisting Veterans?
* How much time do VSOs have to implement and support the communication campaign? 
* Do VSOs send physical communications, such as direct mail? How might our team work with VSOs in this operation? 


## Use Cases



* Enable VSOs to implement the communication campaign independently and provide a farther reach to users through VSOs and the VA.
* Establish standard procedure for VSO engagement for future projects.
* Provide guidance for future projects on how to design communication campaign toolkit
