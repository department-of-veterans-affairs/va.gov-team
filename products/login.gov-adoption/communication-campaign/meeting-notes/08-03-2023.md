## MHV Presentation Feedback




One suggestion I have is to have a section on Login.gov to trigger the Login.gov ID Verification process if it has not been done. 

The way Login.gov works is a user won't be prompted to verify unless the agency requires it. 

The Veteran will go to Option #1 and select LOGIN.gov and sign in and once they receive their code it will produce that 1st pic pop up, which will then redirect the Veteran to VA.gov. Thanks Louis this is helpful to know, we'll investigate further

 \
Can we stress - email does not mean Secure Messaging.  SM will not be used for this communication, thanks. \


May I ask, what demographics are you using or considering for testing? i.e. Age? Technical Knowledge? Medical/Physical Challenges? The criteria for the initial messaging will focus on what credential the user has.  \


What happens if none of these approaches work? We need to asses the impact of these efforts first and better understand the challenges of users. We know they will be there. Then we will figure out next steps. There is an initiative to 'grandfather' existing users, but it has security and policy implications so we aren't ready to present that option yet \


We need many more workflows available to us....

For the program office: How will reactivations  with a sign in partner such as login.gov  affect the MHV Premium Account monitors? Will this activity show on our reports if the pt. falls within our operational denominator criteria?  \


i had a silmilar issue with a pt choosing option 1 vs option 3 , they get stuck in a loop on photo upload with option 1 and the issue goes away if they choose option 3 \


I see the VA is starting to send out articles about LOGIN.gov.   But another confusing aspect is the title itself.    \
When Veterans see the red tile, they actually think they "logging in" to the web site and not registering for a LOGIN.gov.    \

I believe there needs to be more information pushed out so every generation is aware what LOGIN.gov actually is.  

Over the last two weeks, I have been receiving calls from Veteran stating they need to change their email addresses for verification because they are no longer using the old email addresses they originally utilized to create the accounts. ID.Me will allow the Veteran to add a second email address then remove the old email address as the primary email address. Will Login.gov have something similar?

that makes sense, the verification flow, because one can create a USA Jobs account, which uses Login.gov, without the need for ID verification. 

Can Login.gov PLEASE, PLEASE create a Step-by-Step video on how to set up a new account from va.gov AND how to do the verification process . PLEASE (step-by- step that an 80 year old can do it)

is sign-in Option #1 going to be changed from only steering toward ID.me?  Can it give them the Login.gov option? or will it just stay in Option#3?

Could Login.gov be built into the traditional way to create an account? because that flow works most of the time.....

Does Login.gov have a solid help desk the PTs can call?

Does Login.gov have a solid help desk the PTs can call?

but the message that runs in the background states that it is for HRC not LOGIN.GOV

800-983-0937

Please know...that they will more than likely come to the MHV Coordinator "before" calling the helpdesk.

plan for using Veteran ID Cards or Military Cards for identifications?

What is the process to have the email changed for the login.gov?

Can you give a reason why anyone off the street can go into SSA.GOV/USAjobs.gov/OPM.gov etc. create an account and have the capability to log in, change their banking info WITHOUT being "verified", but a Veteran that needs their medication; for in some cases for survival need to be verified? 

I have found with Login.gov that in order to take a picture of the ID it has to be vertical not horizontal, which is where a lot of Veterans get stuck because they don't know they have to turn it. Is there anyway to add that to the site so that we don't have so many people getting stuck?

How will each VA site keep track of the number of sign-ups? If they sign up with Login.gov/ID.me they are an automatic Premium acct. How do we keep track for reporting to our local senior leadership. ( MHV use VSSC and MVAH use Cerner_Oracle) 

Can you give a reason why anyone off the street can go into SSA.GOV/USAjobs.gov/OPM.gov etc. create an account and have the capability to log in, change their banking info WITHOUT being "verified", but a Veteran that needs their medication; for in some cases for survival need to be verified?

at the apply for jobs level, what is the worst possible outcome, eventually hire verification will catch the criminal out, with MHV access, comes access to medical records, and can change mailing address for medications for theft of meds

In the FAQ's on MHV under sign in partners, login.gov is not mentioned.

El Paso is seeing veterans not wanting to send log.in.gov a photo ID due too Identity Theft concerns

MHV will be moving away from the Sign In page three Options to give the Veteran the same sign in experience on VA.gov, My HealtheVet and My VA Health.

i have pts get in a loop where it asks for a photo over and over then i have them stop and cjhjoose option 3 then it allows them to complete the process

you can use the mhv credential but it uses the ID.me tech to do 2 factor.

The Veteran that I was talking about earlier had to sign in and enter a MFA 6 digit code three different times before we could upgrade his account.

this is when they choose option 1 to create login.gov just wonderign why as it should go to the same place

what is projected date of removal of the old MHV login and password?

what is the projected date of the change on the MHV site to the two which will be available come December 2023?

I agree and have asked about this "recommended" sign-in partner connected to Option 1 (which directs us all to id.me since the very beginning of this sign-in page re-design, even if it takes us to VA sign-in page). If you use MHV credentials, it will link/associate with id.me. 

 

Most Vets think that is what they HAVE to do.

so If they have a MHV log in they will STILL need ID.me??

That may be the very reason contributing to id.me 'numbers' for usage.

You should be offering calls for the Veterans re login.gov and id.me!

What about access.va.gov are the travel staff being trained to start supporting users to switch to login.gov or id.me?

Respectfully its not a training problem in reference to the difficulty in authenticating Login.gov accounts its a functionality problem. 

i direct them to create the account with option 3 vs option 1 and it fixes the ID loop id just like to know why as it should be the same page right?

When is Option 2 being removed?

so we have to fix option #1 ID detail issues before you can take away Option 2 and we are JUST NOT SEEING that functioning fixed yet.

i think you will lose quite a few users since it is so difficult to use and glitchy

I have been assisting Veterans with Login.gov photo step taking them horizontal and using their provided 'frame' for aligning the ID photo.

Do you have pamphlets to give out to the Veterans explaining what LOGIN.gov is?  When they get redirected to the website, it is "information overload" for them.  

I thought the Login.gov was the preferred as the ID.me was a third party application?

It does help us to start with Login.gov or id.me if it does not work.....

you need to fix these sign-in issues before your get rid of Option 2.

So when option 2 goes away, Veterans will have to choose 2 factor via id.me and then when MHV sign in goes away they will have to create login.gov correct?

How come id.me and login.gov do not fix there loops?

why not put some thing on the web site??? 

With the change and migration have we tested that this will be viable with My VA Health and CERNER live sites

With myhealthevet they could walk into any medical center in the country, create an account and get authenticated. If that's not the process its a down grade.

Why do we have to fix the issues of id.me and login.gov? Have the training done for the veterans. These issues have been going on for 1-2 now and is still not fixed by these two "secure" signs.

Can We be trained in authenticating thru login.gov having authority 

OK. Since they are our "Partners", is there any way that we can have more authority and access to help since we are the first place Veterans turn for help?

I am not feeling much like a "Partner" in this relationship.

I don't understand, I am very familiar with the elements of my PD and I feel like the "asks' of the MHVC's are getting further and further from that with every call

Who do we send the patients to when then need step by step help and will spend hours trying to do this? We can't spend an hour on the phone or in person to assist them. We are already swamped with our real job. We get so many calls that we can't help but the patients force us to stay on the phone while they go step by step. All we can say is this is not our program so we don't know how to help them. 

again..........any way for future plans to 'grandfather' Veterans in the Login.gov credentialing?

We can talk more about the impact to My HealtheVet account creation and upgrade to Premium on a future MHV Connection call.  So that we can focus on  our processes. 

This should have been done all along getting back to ID.ME and Login.gov   Ridiculous!

Yeah can we have more administrative tools for these partner sites. One of the biggest issues I run into with log in problems for any of them Login.gov, ID.me or DS.logon I don't have any tools to really help outside of doing a 30-45 minute phone call with the Veteran in my office.

is the being pushed by the VBA? shouldn't the VA as a whole encourage all of our Veterans to create some sort of credentialing account to access any of their information online, not just us - My HealtheVet? Especially, since they will no longer be able to create MHV accounts?

again..........any way for future plans to 'grandfather' Veterans in the Login.gov credentialing?

This is crucial

Do we know how many/what percent of, MHV users have proofed login.gov or ID.me accounts?

Once again, please create a one page pamphlet I can give out to the Veterans when creating a MHV Login.  People do not know what LOGIN.gov is and are skittish.    Knowledge is power! 

Is the call center prepared for all the calls?

Grandfathering Premium MHV users over to "veryified" Login.gov account holders.  

any literature we can use...everything on the website points pts to registering for MHV

PMIs the call center prepared for all the calls? the call center sends them all to us to help!

True, we are the National Call Center and have no help!!!!!!!!!!
