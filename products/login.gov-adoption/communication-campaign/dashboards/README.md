Secure Sign-in Transition - Communication Campaign Dashboard: https://va-gov.domo.com/page/923236635

The intent of the Secure Sign-in Transition Dashboard is primarily to track the effectiveness of the Secure Sign-in Transition campaign. The dashboard provides metrics and trends related to credentials and credential usage. The dashboard reports metrics associated with communication campaigns to provide insight into their effectiveness.

## What is being reported
The dashboard contains metrics and trends related to the following areas:
* Credential Totals (number of accounts)
* Credential Usage (number of authentication events)
* Identity and Authentication-Related Support Tickets
* Communication Campaign

#### Credential Totals
The dashboard provides a monthly trend of the total number of active, identity verified Login.gov, ID.me, MHV and DS Logon credentials which are held by VA users.  There are six views which provide a trending view of:
* Monthly total of VA identities with a DS Logon credential
* Monthly total of VA identities with a MHV credential
* Monthly total of VA identities with either DS Logon or MHV credential
* Monthly total of VA identities with either DS Logon, MHV, ID.me or Login.gov credential
* Monthly total of VA identities with a Login.gov credential
* Monthly total of VA identities with an ID.me credential

Within each of these views, the dashboard highlights how many identities have Login.gov or ID.me credentials (or both or neither).

#### New Accounts
For each credential type, there is a view which provides the trend, by month, of new accounts that VA MPI is tracking.

#### Credential Usage
There are 4 views which provide usage metrics for the different credentials. These are:
* Monthly total of distinct VA Identities who have authenticated with any of the 4 credential types
* Monthly total of distinct VA Identities who have authenticated, broken down by credential type
* Another view with same as above but viewing authentications by credential type as a percent of total users who authenticated
* Montly total of distinct VA Identities who have authenticated, broken down by credential type and application accessed
