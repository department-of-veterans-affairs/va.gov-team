# Login.gov Organic Adoption Product Outline
---

## Problem Statement

The Login.gov adoption team aims to consolidate the pathways to sign-in to VA.gov and prioritize Login.gov as the preferred credential option while eliminating duplicative and non-compliant legacy credentials. Veterans will be informed of the Login.gov credential option as well as educated through multi-channel communication on how to create a Login.gov credential. The consolidation of login credential options ensures a more secure process for Veterans, as well as reduces roadblocks and pain points for Veterans trying to access their benefits and services. 

## Vision
* One sign-in to access all products and services through either a “public” (Login.gov) or “private” (ID.me) credential option for VA.gov.
* All users will migrate from legacy MHV and DS Logon credentials to Login.gov and/or ID.me credentials.
* Veterans will be informed and empowered to create either a Login.gov and/or ID.me credential through a multi-channel communication campaign with in-person options to create an account.

## Desired User Outcomes
A Veteran user will have more seamless and secure access to VA services as well as other government agencies that use Login.gov. Their accounts and experience will be more secure and will help them accomplish their tasks more efficiently.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increase the speed of implementation of the CX EO, “the deprecation of outdated and duplicative credentials” represented by MHV and DS Logon. 
- Increased security of MFA and compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance for Identity
- The VA will no longer have to pay for DS Logon, MHV will not have to devote personnel to maintaining their credential
- Simplified management of user authentication processes
- Improved security measures across all VA products and services
- Increased user satisfaction and trust in the VA's digital platforms

## Use Cases
- As a person who accesses VA.gov, I want to use modern and secure Credential Service Providers (CSPs) so that I can ensure that my information is safe when accessing VA services.
- As a person who accesses VA.gov, I want an easy and seamless experience when using a Credential Service Provider so that I can access my information and VA services. 
- As a person who accesses VA.gov, I want to be informed and educated about the need to change my credentials or start using Login.gov credentials so I understand why I have to switch.
- As a VA.gov user, I want to know who I can go to for help in order to answer questions or create a Login.gov credential so I can complete the task with minimal frustration.

## [Initial Migration Strategy](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1716212156492/ce3927c86b7e8580657b85199503319209ac1dcc?sender=u1b0df595924572baa8a94764)

## Standards of Practice
Ensure adherence to the following directives and guidelines for identity verification:
 [VA’s 6510 directive](https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID=824&FType=2)
[NIST 800-63](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/63/4/ipd)

- Our work will put Veterans first.
- Our work will consider the full Veteran experience — from logged out to logged in, from online to offline.
- When we know information concerning Veterans, we'll elevate it and present it to them in a way that helps them understand their experience and complete tasks.
- Our work will employ user experience research, human-centered design, a trauma-informed approach, and risk management procedures to ensure all Veterans are supported in the digital migration.
- We will work to grow the design system so it better accommodates authenticated tools, flows, and use cases.


## Potential Solutions
- Outreach through multiple channels to existing Login.gov users that they’ll need to use Login.gov as their primary account.
- Outreach through multiple channels to existing legacy credential users that they’ll need to create and start using Login.gov as their primary credential.
- Veterans visiting VAMCs will be able to complete sign up and verification for a Login.gov account.
- Identity verifiers and proofing agents, such as MHV coordinators or VHIC Associates, will be able to verify a Veteran’s identity through an in-person visit.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      | % reduction in login-related support requests            |  % increase in successful logins                  | % increase in user satisfaction regarding the login experience                   | % decrease in security incidents       |
| KPI      | Time spent on the IAL2 account setup process            |  % of organic Login.gov IAL2 accounts successfully set up by users referred from VA.gov & related comms campaigns                 |  % increase in user satisfaction regarding the account creation experience                   | % decrease in droff offs       |

                 
                 

#### Baseline KPI Values
 - Baseline values for the most critical metrics will be collected from existing VA authentication systems and user feedback.

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
- Objective: Streamline user authentication across all VA products and services
  - Key result: Increase successful account creation by 20%
  - Key result: Increase successful logins by 20%
  - Key result: Reduce login-related support requests by 30%

## Assumptions
 - The adoption of Login.gov will be accepted by internal stakeholders
 - The integration process will be seamless and not disrupt existing services
 - Risky assumption: Users will quickly adapt to the new authentication process

## Solution Approach
 - Implement Login.gov as the primary CSP for the VA to consolidate user authentication
 - Conduct an assessment of existing VA authentication systems and develop a phased integration plan
 - Align stakeholders, allocate resources, and communicate changes to users
 - Monitor progress and address any technical or user-experience issues
 - Continuously iterate and improve upon the solution based on user feedback and metrics

### Initiatives
 - Initiative: Phased integration of Login.gov across all VA services

## Launch Strategy
 - Outreach through VA newsletters, social media, and targeted communications
 - In-app notifications and prompts to guide users through the transition process
 - Collaboration with veteran organizations and communities to raise awareness

## Launch Dates
 - Target Launch Date: tbd
 - Actual Launch Date: tbd
 - Impact Evaluation Date: tbd
