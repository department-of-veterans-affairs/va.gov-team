## Discussion

#### Start looking at first few pages in the flow, before Login.gov
* How are users prepared to start verifying their identities?
* What do you need to bring with?
* Login.gov realized they don't know as much from the VA side, about what happens preceding the identity verification flow.
* They focused on entry and exit points, including fail points...
* Started building out beginning of the flow (starting from VA screens)
* Showed exit point: if someone fails
* Focus is to make sure users feel prepared. We focus on the identity verification but we don't know what happens before that.
* Wondering: What questions do users have before they start the flow?

#### Deferring identity proofing
* Login.gov: Are there are a significant number of users that enter the account creation flow and verify later?

#### Failed identity profing
* Our Q: Does a user know that even if failed IAL2 proofing, they still created an IAL1 account?
* It's not clear what re-triggers the identity verification
* It won't mention IAL1, it will just say you failed to prove your identity.
* A Veteran likely doesn't know the difference between an IAL1/2 account. There were asked to set up an account, they created an account, but they failed identity verification. It feels like they've failed set up, but they've technically not failed.
* Worth looking at the content on the VA side: this is what Login.gov sends someone to if they fail: https://www.va.gov/auth/login/callback?auth=fail&code=009

#### ID proofing issues and solutions
* We know there are some known issues with screen reader users using this flow. Any recommendations or changes you're working on?
