## Discussion

#### Login.gov's wrapping up a study about SMS as MFA
* Recruited with Perigean
* Focus: SMS as MFA
* But learned other things too about account creation, authentication, and MFA in general
* Generated lots of follow up research questions, currently in design exploration
* Still finalizing reports, don’t have specific recommendations or roadmap implications (things to fix) yet
* Wish: Want to do more screen reader research. This was requested and participants had self-identified as screen reader users, but learned later the users weren’t 'true' screen reader users.

#### Still working on recommendations, but have identified opportunity areas
1. Differentiate between account creation and signing in: Many people go straight to login rather than account creation. They miss the button, even when prompted.
2. Password creation: More user friendly. So more people can pass through password creation.
3. 2nd MFA method: Encouraging people to adopt a back up MFA method. Many contact help desk: locked out, 1 method had failed.
4. Troubleshooting: In research they tested a happy path (MFA method worked) vs. sad path (didn’t). How would they troubleshoot?. Help them navigate once they run into blockers.

#### Most recently, we ran a generative discovery study
* We looked at entire account creation process.
* We assumed people would struggle with MFA setup. But we found MFA setup felt not as difficult as expected.
* Instead, found a lot of difficulty with passwords, both setup and using them over time.
* Most people would choose SMS for MFA, which we know.
* Also looked closely at security keys: VA wants to offer these as an MFA option.
* In discovery, learned: Most people won’t set up a security key unless prompted/recommended. Less familiar to people. They were open to using it as a backup option, but would need to have it recommended to them, and we’d need to onboard them to it.
* IAL1 flow - MFA is potentially the hard step. But feeling confident it might not be as risky as feared.
* IAL2 flow – obvious identity verification is another story.
* Note: Login.gov has a separate identity verification team (Princess).

#### Research gaps we're thinking about
* Has Login.gov does any research with folks less digitally connected? Our past participants have been more comfortable with tech. Thinking of running a study: severe cognitive disability, or unhoused Veterans. Those who are less digitally connected.
* Has Login.gov looked closely at security keys as an MFA option?

#### We all noticed passwords can be an issue
* Login.gov's study wasn't a focus but insights observed in research, as part of account creation. Issues remembering passwords, password strength.
* Similar to what we learned in discovery.
* Can we share anything with Login.gov related to this?

#### Potential for security keys as a back-up method, but issues to consider
* Login.gov's study was on text & voice one-time codes. So they heard opinions about security keys through that lens. eg. “Text and voice is more convenient” or “I wasn’t given a security key.” Onboarding might be challenging.
* Also, participants were mobile-first: Security keys might need to work with mobile devices, not just desktops.
* Login.gov ultimately finds that people love their phones, they’re easy. Texts come from friends and family all the time. Driving users to select phone as MFA method.
* What about a back-up option? It's what we thought in discovery. eg. Login.gov knows people choose phone or SMS, but people assume the phone won’t change or they won’t lose access. And we can’t send you text messages if your number changed. Encourage a backup option. Might be security keys.
* Currently backup codes are thought of as low-entry point (as a backup option). But if security keys were easy to provide eg. at a health appointment? Might be a good way to bridge the challenge.
* Right now, most users don’t know what it is and don’t have them.
* If we're learning about security keys, we'd be interested to see what you find.
* Login.gov's also wondering, why we're specifically interested in security keys?
* Well, we're interested in security keys as an option. Our team trying to learn whether it might be useful.
* Our assumption was validated: They might feel unfamiliar, people might not choose it.
* But we reframed our question to: Is this a good backup option? Can we give them out at health appointment? Good option for someone unhoused? Can be used at public library? And we don't know the answers yet.
* Also, people assist Veterans & family who might need to get access. Security keys might work for non-Veteran roles. Share their account with that person. Tangibility of security key made the process make more sense for non-veteran users.

#### Speaking of caregivers...
* Caregivers has come up with some participants in Login.gov's research. People may share their accounts, or some participants rely on caregiver, official or unofficial. May have login issues.
* One participant with a disability relied on someone who lived with them, but they weren’t always able to help with logging in - issues with their device.

#### Who takes part in research? Who's missing?
* Login.gov looked for self-reported cognitive disabilities, but hasn’t looked for unhoused Veterans with limited digital device access. Although, other Veterans have suggested to them that they should involve people who are unhoused.
* Login.gov's interested in unhoused Veterans! They haven’t been able to study this. And would love to collaborate on something like that.
* Team Ada at Login.gov works on identity verification (Princess’ team). Can we put the teams together? One study instead of 3?
* Amanda's in touch with Princess about setting up a meet and greet soon.
* John would likely be interested in discussing the potential for collaboration between partners on this study.

## Next steps

#### Action items for the VA
* @Anthony: Share analytics for migration when dashboard is ready
* @Amanda: Connect with Ponja directly RE: analytics for identity more generally (not just migration)
* @Tyler: Share findings related to passwords from our study
* @Tyler: Provide VA personas
* @Tyler: Reach out to discuss potential for collaboration on less-digitally connected Veterans study. Maybe around April.
* @Amanda: Set up meeting with Ada team next week (in progress)

#### Action items for Login.gov
* @Login.gov team: Share findings/report/recommendations from most recent study, when it's ready.
