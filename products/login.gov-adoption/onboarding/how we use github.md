## About Github
### What Github is
Github is a service that offers distributed version control of documents. It’s used for things like bug tracking, software feature requests, task management and wikis ([Source](https://github.com/)). It’s most commonly used by engineers, but other disciplines can benefit from it too.

### Why Github is important to us
Teams across OCTO (Office of the Chief Technology Officer) use Github to document work.

Besides helping a current project team or program document and stay-up-to-date, Github also makes it easier for cross-team collaboration. Other teams will look in Github to understand what we’re working on, make connections between our work and theirs, or carry on with the same or similar work in the future.

Working in Github is part of the VA.gov’s commitment to keeping things open. Because [making things open makes things better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better).

## How we use Github
### Where we work
The CEDAR Identity Product Team (also referred to as the Login.gov Adoption Team) uses the [department-of-veterans-affairs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs) repository. Our work sits in the [login.gov-adoption folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/).

### Access to Github
When you’re onboarded to the VA, you’ll need to be given permission to access the [department-of-veterans-affairs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs) repository. When you join this project you should receive a [Welcome document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/onboarding/welcome%20to%20the%20team.md) which explains how to get access to this Github repository.

### How we create or move work to Github
We can work directly in Github, creating, writing and collaborating on documents there.

Another option is moving things into Github. While this method requires us to be more careful about version control (something that working directly in Github helps avoid), it does mean we can work in Google, where many of us feel comfortable.

When a document is created in Google (or anywhere that is not Github) it needs to be moved into Github as soon as possible. Ideally, changes should be made in Github from there on. This should be reflected in the document, like this, for example:

When changes are made to a document outside of Github, this should be reflected in Github.

### How our repository is structured
We structure our repository in a way that makes it easy for us and others to find things. Here is how we structure it:
