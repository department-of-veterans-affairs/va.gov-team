## CEDAR Identity Login.gov Adoption Project
### Background
VA needs a streamlined way for Veterans to sign-in and securely access products and services. The fragmented sign-in experience is confusing for Veterans and non-Veterans faced with multiple pathways and credential options. Further, the credential options are insecure, non-compliant, have poor user experience, or are expensive.

The External Facing Identity Strategy is focused on consolidating the pathways to sign-in to VA.gov and provide Login.gov as a credential option while eliminating duplicative and non-compliant legacy credentials.

### Key priorities
1. My HealtheVet (MHV) coordinators in-person proofing (and remote video)
2. Non-Veteran user roles focusing on caregivers, beneficiaries, and delegates
3. Inherited proofing/Migration of My HealtheVet (MHV) users to Login.gov
4. Security keys as a multi-factor authentication (MFA) option distributed during in-person proofing
5. Transition Assistance Program (TAP) curriculum evaluation
