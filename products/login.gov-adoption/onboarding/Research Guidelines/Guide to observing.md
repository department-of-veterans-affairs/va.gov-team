## Before the session

* Review the conversation guide and prototype to prepare.
* Prepare yourself by clearing your space and muting distractions like Slack notifications.
* Log into your Zoom account. You can change your display name to just your first or preferred name.
* Open the **Mural board** and familiarize yourself with the space. This is linked in the meeting invitation.
* Find the relevant session on the board, based on the participant number, date and time of your session.
* Open (or join) the #feedback-backchannel on DSVA Slack. Your moderator will start a thread for the session.

## At the start of the session

* Join the Zoom waiting room. Before you're admitted, the moderator will ask for the participant's consent to have you and other observers join the session.
  * If they say no, the moderator will message on #feedback-backchannel and you can leave the call.
  * If they say yes, the moderator will admit you to the meeting.
* Join the meeting with your **camera on** and **microphone muted**.
* The moderator will verbally introduce you and the other observers. If there's time, the moderator will ask you to say hello. Otherwise you can keep your **microphone muted**.
* Turn your **camera off** when the moderator says so. For the rest of the session you should keep your **camera off** and **microphone muted**.

## Throughout the session

* Please don't use the Zoom chat. If you would like to message during the session, use the thread in the #feedback-backchannel. Remember that the moderator will be distracted, but they will try and look out for your messages.
* As an observer, don't worry about taking comprehensive notes. There are people on the team who have been assigned to take notes, and we'll also receive a transcript after the call.

### If something goes wrong

* The moderator's number one priority is to **keep the participant safe**.
* If a Veteran appears distressed, they will take a moment to check in with them, offer to move on and skip the question or topic, or they'll suggest taking a short break.
* If a Veteran continues to give signs of distress, the researcher will follow an emergency exit strategy that they have prepared for.
* If a Veteran experiences a medical or psychological emergency, then the researcher will follow [a protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Requestingemergencyassistance) to request assistance.
* As an observer, it's also important to look after yourself during research. If you no longer feel safe or capable to continue observing, you should feel empowered to exit the call. The moderator will likely be distracted, but you can message them (directly or using #feedback-backchannel to let them know you left). They will check in with you after the session finishes.

## At the end of the session

* Continue to keep your **camera off** and **microphone muted** at the end of the session.

## After the session

* After the session, write your top 3-5 key takeaways in Mural. This might be something you find interesting, insightful or surprising.
* Feel free to reach out to the researcher if you need to debrief further.
