## Before the session

* Review the conversation guide and prototype to prepare.
* Prepare yourself by clearing your space and muting distractions like Slack notifications. Find your headphones.
* Log into the Perigean Zoom meeting (you will be the host). Change the display name to your first name.
* Turn on transcriptions by clicking the LIVE TRANSCRIPT button in the bottom toolbar, then, in the Live Transcription section, click the ENABLE button.
* Open the #feedback-backchannel on DSVA Slack. Start a thread:

      "P2 - Grandfathering Migration Usability (1) starts in 10 minutes :thread:"
* Copy these instructions and comment in the thread:

      How to observe or take notes for this session:
      
      * I’ll let you in from the Zoom waiting room if or once the participant agrees to have you join.
      * Please review [these guidelines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/Guidelines) before you join the session.
      * Please capture your notes or observations in this [Mural board](add link).
      * If you have questions for the participant, write them here and I’ll do my best to work them in.
      * If you have concerns or questions for me, write them here and I'll reply during or after the session.

## At the start of the session

* If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.
* Turn your camera on, but don't require the Veteran to turn their camera on, it's up to them. If they choose to have their camera off, ask if they'd prefer you turn your's off.
* Go through the consent process slowly and intentionally. Remind the participant of their autonomy and choice.
* You can *only* record the session if the participant gives you permission to record. Once you start recording, you must let the participant know they're being recorded and have them acknowledge that they give permission. Remember to hit **record to cloud**.
* Ask if participants are okay with notetakers and observers joining the session. If they are, add them to the meeting and ensure they are on camera with their name visible on the screen. Introduce them to the participant. Then, ask all third parties to turn off their cameras so you can begin.

## Throughout the session

* Follow your participant’s lead in how they self-identify. Use the words they use to describe themselves.
* Continue to provide opportunities for refusal throughout the study. For example, if you’re asking a sensitive question, remind the participant that it is optional.
* Leave space for the Veteran to share their questions, reactions and experiences. Silence can be helpful to allow someone time to think.
* If someone asks you how something works or what happens when they click on something, remember that we're here to learn from them, not to give them advice or onboard them to a new product. It can help to say something like, "I'm wondering, how would you expect it to work?" instead of answering the question.
* When a Veteran shares a tough experience with you, show compassion but avoid unpacking trauma (which, as researchers, we're not prepared to do safely). It often helps to say something like, "I'm so sorry that happened to you" or "that sounds very frustrating," and then redirect back to your script. Remember that keeping to our [scope of practice](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma) helps us avoid causing additional harm to the Veteran.
* If you don't know the answer to something you can say something like, "I'm not sure. But I'll ask Perigean to share a link to the support line on VA.gov so you can contact the right person at the VA." It helps to remind the participant of your role and what you can or can't help them with.
* Keep an eye on the #feedback-backchannel when you have a moment, while the participant is reading, for example.

### If something goes wrong

* Our number one priority as a researcher is to **keep our participants safe**.
* If a Veteran appears distressed, you can take a moment to check in, offer to move on and skip the question or topic, or suggest taking a short break.
* If they continue to give signs of distress, follow the emergency exit strategies in our conversation guide.
* If you find yourself in a session with a Veteran experiencing a medical or psychological emergency, then you need to follow [this protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Requestingemergencyassistance) to request assistance.
* As the moderator, it's also important to look after yourself during research. If you no longer feel safe or capable to continue, pause the session by saying "I need to take a moment to set up the next task," get in touch with Perigean to describe the situation, and feel empowered to use an exit strategy from our conversation guide as soon as it feels necessary. After the incident, you should follow [this protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Creatingasafespaceforresearchmoderators) and reach out to your research lead immediately.

## At the end of the session

* Say thank you with intention. Remind the Veteran that our team couldn't do this work without their wisdom and help.
* Ask them how they are feeling. Give them time to debrief and use this time to transition out of the session.
* Try to have a quick look at the #feedback-backchannel in case there is anything that needs to be addressed before you finish.
* Inform the participant of what they can expect next, including information about payment and further contact from you or Perigean.

## After the session

* We have scheduled debriefs throughout the research schedule. But if you need to debrief more immeditately, reach out to your research lead. It can help to reflect, particularly if you have a difficult conversation during a session.
* After the session, you can review the #feedback-backchannel and Mural board. It can be helpful to add your own reflections while they're still fresh.
* Perigean will keep the recordings for up to 1 week following the study, your research lead will download any recordings needed and follow [these guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recording-user-research-sessions) to handle recordings safely.
