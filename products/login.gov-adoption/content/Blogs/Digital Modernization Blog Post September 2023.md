# Digital modernization and the focus on providing Veterans a better sign-in experience



By VA Office of the Chief Technology Officer



Lately you may have read a post or heard discussions around Login.gov and signing in to VA more securely and may find yourself asking, “why the sudden focus on signing in?”. The purpose of this article is to help Veterans better understand the digital modernization efforts happening at VA and provide more information about the secure sign-in options available to them now.


**VA and government wide modernization efforts**



_“VA will deliver self-service tools on par with top private sector companies and will have the best online experience in the Federal Government. Every digital service will be customized to the individual using it \[...]” -_ The VA Digital Modernization Vision (2017)



Since 2017, we’ve been working with partners across the government to update our websites and technology to increase security while giving people easier access to their government benefits and services. We’re following the guidelines set by 2 presidential executive orders: 



- [Executive Order 14028](https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity), Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity
- [Executive Order 14058](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/13/executive-order-on-transforming-federal-customer-experience-and-service-delivery-to-rebuild-trust-in-government/), Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government

 

Currently Veterans have 4 account type options for signing in to VA.gov–Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon, and My HealtheVet. Listening to feedback from Veterans, we understand that having multiple, undifferentiated options can create an overly complicated sign-in experience and generate frustration amongst users, especially when services are down or not working.  As part of our digital modernization efforts, we’re working to provide a single, more secure way for Veterans to manage their VA benefits and health care online. To do this, we’re encouraging Veterans to create an account with one of our more secure sign-in partners and use that account from now on when accessing health care and benefits online. 



**The most secure options for signing in: Login.gov and ID.me**



_“As part of the department’s digital transformation efforts focused on continuous improvement, we’re embracing the innovative technology designed by Login.gov to provide our Veterans a seamless sign-in experience to better serve, engage and enhance the customer experience.”_

Soon all VA websites will follow a new sign-in process through VA.gov with Login.gov as the recommended account. Login.gov is a U.S. government account built on modern security standards. It encrypts your stored information at two levels to ensure that only you can access and change your information. You can use your Login.gov account to access VA benefits, services, and information in a single, secure account. You can also use your account to manage other government benefits and services (like Social Security benefits and federal job applications).

ID.me also provides a secure sign in experience, but is commercially-owned and built on bank-grade encryption technology to protect your data. You can use your ID.me account to manage VA and other government benefits and services as well.



**DS Logon and My HealtheVet**



DS Logon and My HealtheVet are accounts managed by the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs respectively. At this time, you can use your DS Logon or My HealtheVet account to sign in to VA.gov. However, we recommend creating a Login.gov account for continued support and security.
