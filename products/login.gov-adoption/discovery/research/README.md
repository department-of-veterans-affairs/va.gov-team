## Research Activity Log

### Proactive CSP Migration (Deferred Proofing Mobile)

#### Deliverables 
[Proactive CSP Migration (Deferred Proofing Mobile)](https://www.figma.com/design/jJlPBVVNvfNEtraWd3nyJf/04-2023-Proactive-CSP-Migration-(Mobile-Prototype)?node-id=0%3A1&t=G7zipAK78BLcHgVE-1)

#### Date Presented

Sprint 18

4/26/2023

#### Summary

Mockup of mobile view of unified sign in page with messaging to encourage migration to[ Login.gov](http://login.gov/).[ Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/Research/2023-04%20Proactive%20CSP%20Migration) on this prototype was conducted by the Identity Core team.

#### Value Add

Without designing these mockups and ideating on the best ways to present messaging to Veterans surrounding upcoming changes related to account migration, the team would not have identified messaging that would increase the likelihood of Veterans creating a modern sign-in credential.

### Deferred Proofing Email

#### Deliverables 

[Deferred Proofing Email Mock Up](https://www.figma.com/design/3HCgH1yKgrh0ukdP3idWyj/04-2023-Deferred-Identity-Proofing-Usability-Test-Email?node-id=0%3A1&t=A6xp6FDI1071y6Ve-1)

#### Date Presented

Sprint 17

04/12/2023

#### Summary

Mockup of email and user flow to encourage Veterans to create a Login.gov account. 

#### Value Add

We designed a mockup of an email that communicates upcoming changes to Veterans regarding their benefits on VA.gov. We learned that Veterans are more likely to read through an email than a modal and they have ways for making sure that the email is secure. The findings that came out of this research informed emails that we would use to communicate changes to Veterans over a long period of time to ensure that all Veterans would be aware and active during the transition from legacy to modern credentials.

### Deferred Proofing Modal


#### Deliverables

[Deferred Proofing Modal ](https://www.figma.com/design/hRn7aMTMJcL7f1GWIWP8C9/04-2023-Deferred-Identity-Proofing-Usability-Test-Modal?node-id=0%3A1&t=vwiC7uKSoeuwQD54-1)

#### Date Presented

Sprint 17

04/12/2023

#### Summary

Mock up of modal and user flow to encourage Veterans to create a Login.gov account.

#### Value Add

We designed a mockup of a modal prototype that communicates upcoming changes to Veterans  regarding their benefits on VA.gov. We learned from our research that Veterans are likely to click out of modals without reading the content, so other methods for communicating important information would be more effective.
