# About this research

## Study
[2022-10-Research-LoginGovFieldResearch #185](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/185)

## Background
Currently there are multiple ways to sign on and access My HealtheVet (MHV) and other VA services. These login options do not all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. Through our research we hope to explore how the VA can most successfully migrate existing users, and onboard new user to Login.gov (which is a compliant, single sign-on credentialing platform). While Login.gov does currently exist, our research hopes to uncover the best ways to support Veterans, non-Veteran roles, and VA staff in this transition.

## Research Goals
* Understand how we can intervene to ensure that new generations of Veterans use Login.gov to access My HealtheVet from the start.
* Understand what in-person support will enable Veterans to create and use a Login.gov account to access My HealtheVet.
* Understand how the greatest number of Veterans can use multi-factor authentication options, including security keys.
* Understand how setting up and maintaining shared access might work for Veterans and non-Veterans.

## Recruitment
We worked with Perigean to recruit 10 Veterans for interviews. We also used intercept testing to interview a further 27 Veterans, before or after a healthcare or eligibility appointment.

## Date
This research took place from October to December 2022.
