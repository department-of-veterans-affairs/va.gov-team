### **Intro – 5 Minutes**

> Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Ponja] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about [Login.gov – a secure sign-in service used by government agencies].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45–50 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs and other members of the public. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

> If no: Use TTS/GSA Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
> If yes: Admit observers.

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction (first name and position with Login.gov).  
Once complete, ask them to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype, which is a clickable design.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some might not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Do you have any questions before we begin?**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

> If yes:  
> _Start recording._  
> “I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?”
