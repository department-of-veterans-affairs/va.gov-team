## **Research Plan for Login.gov, Fraud Alert Communication, October 2025**

### **Background**

As Login.gov continues to expand, keeping security at the core of the user experience is essential. Fraud alerts and communication are one of the key ways Login.gov uses to protect its users.  
The goal of this study is to evaluate how users perceive these banners so we can refine communications that both safeguard users and reinforce Login.gov’s security. This usability study is conducted in partnership with the Office of Veterans Affairs.

#### OCTO Objectives

**Improve the Veteran experience with Login.gov**  
Veterans and their families will gain stronger protection against scams, feel more confident in knowing what steps to take, and experience less confusion or stress when encountering alerts.  
Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov.

#### Veteran Journey

Veterans who interact with government websites and applications may need a Login.gov account now, or in the future, to access their VA services. This could occur anywhere within the Veteran journey but particularly when they are trying to access benefits and need to create a Login.gov account.

### **Research Goals**

The goals of this study are:

- Assess user comprehension of the banner messaging.  
- Measure the degree of trust and credibility users attribute to the communications.  
- Test participants’ perception of fraudulent messages vs. legitimate ones.  
- Understand whether the banners prompt intended protective actions or behavioral changes.  
- Identify opportunities to improve clarity, tone, and placement for maximum impact.

#### Outcome

The outcomes of this study will provide a clear understanding of how well users comprehend the banner messaging and whether they find it trustworthy and credible. We will gain insight into how effectively users distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate messages, as well as whether the banners encourage the intended protective actions or behavioral changes. In addition, the research will highlight opportunities to improve clarity, tone, and placement to maximize both impact and user confidence.

#### Research Questions

> _Note: These are not questions asked directly to participants._

- How clearly do users understand the purpose and meaning of the fraud alert banners and new communication?  
- Do users find the messaging trustworthy, credible, and authoritative?  
- Do the banners motivate users to take the intended protective actions?  
- What, if any, barriers prevent users from acting on the banners as intended?  
- How can the wording, tone, or placement of the banners be improved to maximize clarity, engagement, and impact?

#### Hypothesis

Login.gov is implementing new content that alerts and educates users on account safety and potential threat. Our hypothesis is that if this messaging is clear, credible, and actionable, users will be more likely to notice and understand the alerts, trust the information, and take the recommended steps to protect themselves. Conversely, if the messaging is unclear or lacks credibility, users may ignore it, misinterpret the risk, or experience unnecessary anxiety.
