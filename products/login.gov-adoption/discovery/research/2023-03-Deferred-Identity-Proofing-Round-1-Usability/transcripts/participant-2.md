### Transcript

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000

> M: Awesome. So [participant 2], I just wanna confirm, are you comfortable if I record this session?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000

> P2: Yes, I am.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000

> M: Thanks so much. Alright, I think we can get started now, if that works for you, [participant 2]. Awesome so I just want to start by learning a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA. And particularly with using some of our online services. So I'm going to just ask you a couple questions.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:36.000

> M: How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000

> P2: I got out of the service in '94.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000

> M: Okay so quite a while. And how often would you say that you go online to manage VA benefits or healthcare, or look up some information?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000

> P2: This year a lot more than I did in the past to be honest. Yeah.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000

> M: Okay. And what does a lot look like is that a couple of times a month?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000

> P2: Probably 3 to 4 times a month. Yeah.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000

> M: Okay. And when you're going online, do you know which website you're usually going to?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000

> P2: Hmm what is it? MyHealtheVet [MHV]. Yeah, that would be MHV. That one!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000

> M: MHV okay. Great. Yeah. That's helpful.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000

> M: And are you usually going to MHV and just like kind of looking for some information or are you usually signing in?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000

> P2: Looking for information.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000

> M: Okay, and how often do you? Would you say you are actually signing in? So you're entering your username and your password when you go to MHV.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000

> P2: Well, every time I log on in, so that'd be 3 to 4 times a month.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000

> M: Yeah. Okay. Do you remember – I'm gonna test your memory a little bit here – do you remember which way that you're signing into My HealtheVet? There's a couple different options.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000

> P2: I got it as a favorite, and then I click on that, and then it drops on down, and then there's like 4 choices. I think I click on My HealtheVet. That, yeah.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000

> M: Okay, okay, so it sounds like, you're on the MHV website. And then you're choosing MHV as your sign in option.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000

> P2: Right.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000

> M: That's really helpful. And that's usually how you would sign in? Is there ever a time when you're choosing a different side?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000

> P2: Nope.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000

> M: Okay, that's really helpful. So next, I mentioned that I'm gonna show you a prototype today. So that's that kind of pretend version of the website. And this is so that we can get your feedback. This is for, you know, a time for you to share your opinions about what we're looking at. So I'm gonna send you a link into the zoom. And I'd just like you to open the link on your computer. And then, are you familiar with sharing your screen?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000

> P2: Not really?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000

> M: Okay, that's okay. I'm gonna talk you through it. So I've sent you a link in the chat.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000

> P2: Got it.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000

> M: And so if you go ahead and open that link, you might not be able to see me for a second.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000

> P2: Okay. Let me click on that link then.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000

> M: Okay. So you see that opening up?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000

> P2: Yes.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000

> M: Alrighty. So once that opens up, you're gonna try and find Zoom again.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000

> P2: Yup, I see you.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000

> M: Okay, perfect. And then at the bottom of the zoom window, we were talking about this earlier. It says a couple of different things, and there's one in the middle. It's green, it says, share screen. You see that? Okay, perfect. So if you click on that, it's gonna give you a couple of options, and you can go ahead and try and find that window that you just opened.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000

> P2: This one? Okay.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000

> M: Perfect, alrighty. It's just loading and I'll let you know what I can see. Once it comes up.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000

> M: Now, what I'm seeing is basically what you're looking at on your screen so that VA email that's coming up on your end.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:45.000

> P2: Okay.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000

> M: Okay, great. So we're gonna keep this prototype opened throughout a lot of the conversation you can always come back to the Zoom window if it's feeling a little funny talking to the computer. Alright.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000

> M: So what I'd like us to start with is just imagining that this is an email that you've received. So it says, Dear Martha, so you received this email from the VA. I'm gonna give you a second now to read the email more closely. And when you finish, what I'd like is, if you can summarize what you've read for me.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000

> P2: Okay.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000

> M: Okay. So just to start, can you tell me a little bit about what you just read?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000

> P2: It says that my login for the DS Logon – that's gonna be no longer available. I'm gonna have to create a new account at Login.gov.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:22.000

> M: What does what does that mean to you?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000

> P2: I don't know, more or less that I have to create another account, create a new password and user ID for another area.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000

> M: And I'm sensing a little bit of confusion like it's not feeling super clear yet. Is that true?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:49.000

> P2: Correct. Yeah, I'm not real sure what the DS Logon site is off the top of my head. That's where the confusion is. And I'm like, okay, if that's the original login site, that's fine. And I'm used to creating other usernames and passwords. And other accounts for things.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000

> M: Okay, that makes sense. So it's not so much confusing that you'd have to set up another account but it's quite confusing that you're not really sure what DS Logon is. Okay, that's helpful.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000

> M: And so what is this email asking you to do?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000

> P2: I'll go to Login.gov and create an account, you know, so I can access my records.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000

> M: And when you read this email, let's say you decided not to set up an account. What do you think would happen if you didn't set up an account?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000

> P2: I won't be able to access anything on the internet.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000

> M: Okay. And so, if you were someone who was reading this and wasn't completely sure what DS Logon was, but knew that you'd receive this and it's telling you to set up an account, otherwise you might not be able to access anything on the internet, what would you do next?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000

> P2: I would say if I did not recognize the DS Logon account information, I'd just delete the email.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000

> M: Okay, yeah. So it feels like it might not be relevant for you, or you're not exactly sure what it is. And so you might ignore the email.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000

> P2: Oh, yeah, just the way things are with phishing and scams and stuff like that. If I don't recognize the site right off the top of my head, I'm gonna delete it. Or not even open it up.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000

> M: Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:03.000

> M: So if I told you you needed to set up a Login.gov account, what comes to mind? Any sort of reaction to that?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000

> P2: Not really no.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000

> M: Okay, it. Sounds like you've set up some accounts in the past.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000

> P2: Yeah, that's what I was doing this morning. I've been doing about 6 of them.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000

> M: 6 of them. Oh, gosh, okay, yeah. So it sounds like something you're used to being asked to do.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.000

> M: Okay. So for the purpose of the rest of our conversation, and I'm gonna explain a little bit about DS Logon now. DS Logon is another way that you can sign into VA services. So we were talking about how you use MHV to sign in. DS Logon is another sign in option that you can use. And so I can see how it's slightly confusing, because you're used to using MHV. So what we can do for today is try to imagine that this email said you know MHV will stop working soon and we need you to set up a Login.gov account.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000

> M: How would that may be change how you reacted to the email?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000

> P2: Well, I know I'm familiar with the MHV site. So then I would take the proper steps to create the new account.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000

> M: Okay, yeah. So you'd feel less hesitant or like this might be phishing because you recognize the name, MHV.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000

> P2: Correct.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000

> M: Okay yeah, that makes sense. And again, imagining this, said, MHV will stop working soon, if you had any questions about what you were reading in this email, what would you do?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.000

> P2: Let's see here. I'll look for a phone number for a support group. [sees phone number] Yeah, that phone number. There's a support help line so I could contact them. To make sure that this is legit.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000

> M: Okay, so that might be the question you have. Is a phone number your preference when you're trying to contact the VA, or any type of service?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000

> P2: Talk to a live person. Yes.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:19.000

> M: Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. So what we're gonna do next is imagine that you decided to continue today to set up this account. Okay. So if you wanted to set up the account, what would you do next?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000

> P2: Well one thing I would print off this email, so that I can reference it. It's just me. I can't remember things, and I can't go back and forth.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000

> M: Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? So when you say you know you wouldn't want to print the email, and you don't want to go back and forth. Are you kind of speaking to like wanting to have one thing open on the computer at a time?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000

> P2: I just get, yeah.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000

> M: And so you'd rather have the printout next to you.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000

> P2: Correct. Yup.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000

> M: That's helpful. Okay.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000

> P2: That's just me, you know. But yeah, then I will look at the email and make sure that go through the steps. And yeah, go to VA.gov and sign in with my login and account and follow the instructions.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000

> M: Okay, perfect. So yeah, that makes sense. So it sounds kind of straightforward if you decided to set up an account. So let's go ahead and click on that blue button that you see there.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000

> P2: Go to the VA?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000

> M: Yeah, that's perfect.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000

> M: Okay. So I think, it might be loading. It looks a little blurry. Okay, we'll give it a second.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000

> P2: Yup!

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000

> M: Let's try to refresh the page. Yeah, up there, let's try that and see if it makes it a little less blurry.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000

> M: Oh! There we go! Perfect!

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000

> P2: Okay, yeah, yeah, that I recognize. Yeah. Like, I said, then I usually go down to MHV.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000

> M: Okay, so this looks familiar. Usually, you'd click MHV.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000

> P2: Oh, yeah.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.000

> M: That, okay, perfect. So after reading that email, we had decided we were gonna set up this Login.gov account.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000

> M: So we open the sign in screen. And what are we going to do next?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000

> P2: The Login.gov, click on that one, or actually, or create an account [link below sign in options]. I would create an account, since I would assume I don't have one.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000

> M: Okay, so you've gotten an email telling you to set up Loging.gov and so you open VA.gov, and you're like, okay, I've got to setup Login.gov.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000

> P2: Yup!

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000

> M: That makes sense alright. So I'm gonna throw a curveball at you. So the next thing that we're actually gonna do now is sign in with DS Logon. If I tell you we're gonna sign in with DS Logon – remember that email said, you have a DSL account it's going away soon and we need you to set up Login.gov – and now I'm telling you to sign in with DSL. How do you react to that?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000

> P2: Little confused, and ask, why?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000

> M: Yeah. What if you wanted to ask someone, why, right now, do you know what you would do?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000

> P2: Call that number.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:04.000

> M: Yeah. Okay. Do you think of yourself as a patient enough person that you might decide to call that number?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000

> P2:Oh, yeah, I'll call them. Yeah.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000

> M: Okay, yeah, that's helpful. So I'm gonna let us continue.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000

> M: Now, [participant 2], and I know that you use MHV to sign in. So you're gonna have to use a little bit of an imagination today. And we're going to pretend like you use DSL. Okay. So if you click on DSL next, and then we're just gonna continue as if you're signing in with DSL today, so we won't have you put in a username and password again, this is just a prototype. We're gonna have you just click login now. Yeah, that's perfect. Alright.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000

> M: So we're gonna stay on this page for a minute now. Okay, so I'm gonna give you a minute to read this more closely. And then, same thing. I'll ask you to summarize what you've read to me.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000

> M: Okay. So can you tell me what you just read?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000

> P2: It says that we're gonna be navigated away from VA.gov to Login.gov to create an account. Once I create that account I'll be sent back to VA.gov.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000

> M: Okay, Gotcha. And is there anything about that that is confusing or surprising?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000

> P2: Yeah. I thought I was just back to Login.gov. But that wasn't so. I was just you know, like going back and forth so that was a little bit... I did read it a couple of times, just to understand.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000

> M: Okay, so yeah, it sounds like, you're gonna be bounced around a little bit. And it feels clear enough now, but it took you a little bit of time to understand what was going on.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000

> P2: Correct.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:43.000

> M: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And so what would you expect to happen next if we were gonna continue to Login.gov?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000

> P2: Click on the button, then it would take me to that Login.gov and I would have to create a new account password and user ID. And then, once that isd done, any other information, and once that's done, submit it, and then I'll be sent back to VA.gov.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000

> M: Okay. Gotcha, yeah, that makes sense. If you had a question on this page, do you know how you would get help?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000

> P2: Okay. Yeah, I'd probably go up to contact us or hit the back button and look for a number.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000

> M: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So let's go ahead and click continue to Login.gov, and we'll start to set up that account.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:52.000

> M: Okay, great. So before you click on it here, can you tell me what you would do first if you were setting up a Login.gov account?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000

> P2: I'm looking at the page right now, looking for anything that says, like, yeah, first time using Login.gov. Yeah and create an account. Anything like that. And then you got help and you got contact information there which is very needed. Yeah, that's what I was looking at. And then, yeah, first time users and create an account. Yeah.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000

> M: Okay, so that felt pretty quick for you to figure out where you needed to be on this page.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000

> P2: Oh, yeah.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000

> M: Okay, let's go ahead and click. Create an account. Okay, so as we go through the next couple of screens, [participant 2], I would just love to if you can tell me out loud what you would do next. And if there's anything that seems confusing or surprising or different, you can ask me about it. So we can talk about it some more.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:02.000

> P2: Yup, first thing I'm gonna want to scroll down to make sure I can see everything. If there's any like any hidden buttons, you know, like anything like that. And I would look at the enter your email address. I would type that out, select your language, English, yup. I have read and accept. I click on that and open that all up and scroll through see if there's any hidden buttons. You know any boxes that you know... And click. I have read and just scroll down and make sure I'm not missing anything, and then click, continue.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000

> M: Perfect. Okay. Let's click on I read and accept and continue. And same thing on this screen. Let me know what you're seeing here.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:16.000

> P2: Alright. I'm gonna open up my email, whatever email you know. And look for that email and then open it up. Follow it, you know. Click on the link if it needs, and then also get me back here.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000

> M: Okay and right now we're on your computer. If you were gonna check your email, would you do that on on the computer as well? Or would you do that on your phone?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000

> P2: I would do it on my computer.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000

> M: Okay, gotcha. So for today, we're just gonna have you click, check email. And we're gonna pretend, like you received this email.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000

> M: Is there anything jumping out at you here, as you know, potentially confusing? Is this something you've done before?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000

> P2: I don't think there's anything confusing. Oh, yeah, I've done this numerous times. Okay, confirm your email.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:41.000

> M: Okay, so sounds straightforward. We'll go ahead and click, confirm email address, and we'll continue back to Login.gov.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:49.000

> M: Okay, perfect. So on the screen, same thing as before. If you could talk me through what you would probably do if you saw this screen.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:00.000

> P2: Okay, email is confirmed. Great. I just gotta. I'm just going to assume that my user ID is my email address.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000

> M: Does that feel like it's not clear?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000

> P2: No. I find that a lot of sites that I work with use that, you know, and it it's just. That's the one thing I notice. I'm like, okay, right to the password. So it's not letting the person know set up your user ID. What's my user ID?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:38.000

> M: Okay, so it seems like you never had to set up a user ID, it's skipped right to jump to the creating a password. And so your assumption would be that your email would be your username. Okay, perfect. Thank you.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000

> P2: Correct. I'm going to assume. Maybe some people might not get that. Like, now, I gotta create a user ID? Or do I create a user ID?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000

> M: Yeah, that makes sense. And what about setting up a password. It sounds like you've set up a lot of accounts today even, is setting up a password something that you have any hesitation about, or frustration, or anything like that?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000

> P2: No. I enjoy it!

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000

> M: Alright perfect! What do you enjoy about it?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000

> P2: I just gotta write it down on in my pad.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000

> M: Okay. So that's where you keep them.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000

> P2: Yup!

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000

> M: Alright, so you would probably create a password and then grab a pen, write it down, and then maybe click, continue.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000

> P2: I would show password and make sure it's written down correctly. And password strength. Make sure it's correct, and it passes all the protocols for it, and such. So then yeah, then hit continue.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000

> M: Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and click continue.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000

> P2: Alright. [Sees MFA screen and sighs].

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000

> M: So I heard a little bit of a sound on the other end. Can you tell me what that was? What was that describing?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000

> P2: Two-step authentication method setup... It's very needed, but sometimes it can be a pain in the butt. For one, I'm not doing the face or touch unlock because fingers and thumbs. Yeah, it's just a pain in the butt. Security keys, no, I don't like using the USB port. Text, messaging or voice mails, I get that. Do that all the time. And then I think the authentication application that's sort of like a third party software. You gotta like type in a number in a certain timeframe I got like 3 of those. Then you just gotta remember which one goes to which one you know.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:37.000

> M: Okay, so you're leaning towards it sounds like setting up text or voice message or potentially, the authentication application.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000

> P2: Yeah. I don't. This is more like another hassle. It's just another thing to do, but I totally get that it's needed.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000

> M: Why do you think it's needed?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000

> P2: All the schemes and all the phishing, people taking people's identity. Identity theft? So yeah, it's a major thing. It's a major thing.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000

> M: So from your perspective, you want to have this setup. But you don't wanna have to deal with it – or it's a little bit of a nuisance dealing with it.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000

> P2: Right, right.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000

> M: Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So let's set up text or voice message today. So if we were gonna set up text or voice message, what would you click next?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000

> P2: [clicks text]

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000

> M: And then you can go ahead and scroll down and we'll hit continue. So what we're gonna do now is set up – oh, let's see if it works. Hmm! I think this seems like a prototype problem. Let's click up above the one you almost chose, the authentication, application and click continue.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000

> M: Okay, so it looks like the text message one wasn't working, which is helpful for us to know. So we're gonna pretend, like you're setting up an authentication app today instead.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:59.000

> P2: Let me give it a nickname...

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000

> M: Tell me what you're thinking when you read through this page.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000

> P2: I'm confused.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000

> M: Okay, tell me about what's confusing.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000

> P2: Where to scan the bar code, where to get the app? I'm looking for the app. So where would I find the app to scan? Or am I thinking wrong?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000

> M: So it seems like not clear how you would, or where you would scan this barcode, and maybe what app that it's talking about.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000

> P2: Correct. I don't see a name. Open your authentication app. Okay, where do I go to get it?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000

> M: Yeah, I can see how that's not making a lot of sense today. Let's just imagine you were setting this up and you saw this, and you were like, wait this is kind of confusing me. I actually don't want to use this method. What would you do?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000

> P2: Click go back, and try another. I'd try another one.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000

> M: Okay, you'd click the back button. Well, for today, it seemed like you were leaning towards setting up a text message, and obviously we weren't able to do that today. But let's continue with the authentication app, and we can talk through at the end about how this would actually work.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:04.000

> M: So we'll just scroll to the bottom. We don't actually have to do any of this for the prototype, and we'll just click, submit! Okay, perfect. So let's say that the two-factor authentication was added to your account, and then we'll keep going. So what is the screen telling you?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:36.000

> P2: Oh, it's telling me that a text message was added to my account. Even though we were trying to do the authentication app.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000

> M: Yeah, that is, that is quite confusing.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000

> P2: Add up second method as a backup. Okay? So I can create another one.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000

> M: Do you think that's something that you would choose to do to set up a backup method?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000

> P2: Yes. In case there's no text messaging or voicemail service I would want to have another choice to receive that information like the email or something like that.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:38.000

> M: And you know some of the options we talked through. It felt like you were leaning towards a text message or maybe using the authentication app which turned out to be maybe not something you would do. Do you remember anything else on that list that you might set up? We kind of said no to security keys, no to to the face or touch...

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000

> P2: Right. And I didn't think I had like the government ID. Only 3, of those, the other ones that I remember actually listed off so.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000

> M: Yeah, yeah. So it might feel like, you all have one option.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000

> P2: Yeah, one or 2 options.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000

> M: Okay, so for today, we're just gonna we're actually gonna skip setting up another meeting. And so if you scroll down a little bit so you can see the whole screen, we'll click. Yeah, we'll click on skip for now. Perfect. Okay, so what's the screen telling you?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000

> P2: You're going is your account setup is complete. We'll share this information with the VA. My email address. Like a privacy notification more or less. And then, yeah, agree to the conditions and continue.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:11.000

> M: Do you know why it's it's telling you that it will show the information with the VA?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000

> P2: I'm going to assume. It's part of the VA website that I'm creating this. So it's gonna have to be a sharing with the VA.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000

> M: Okay, so it feels like, maybe we're on the VA website. Ad that's why it's being shared with the VA?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000

> P2: Yeah.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000

> M: Okay and so if we clicked on a green, continue, what would you expect to happen?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000

> P2: Hopefully. It takes me to my home page. VA.gov.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:02.000

> M: Okay, yeah, alright. So let's click on a green continue, and we'll see what happens next. Okay, so we're seeing this screen now. This looks like it might be a duplicate, I'm not gonna not gonna lie to you. So let's click on a green one more time. We'll pretend like that didn't happen. Alright! Here we go!

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:38.000

> M: So is this the kind of you talked about? You felt like you would get back to a homepage and potentially on VA.gov, is this sort of looking like what you had expected?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000

> P2: Yeah.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000

> M: And before we before we read this too closely, yet I would love to just reflect a little bit on what we just did. If you can describe what we just did.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000

> P2: We were at Login.gov creating an account. Well, actually, we were on the VA.gov site first, and then we went to the Login.gov and created an account. We are told, you know, after creating an account on Login.gov, it would be then to the Va.gov site. And that's where we are now.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000

> M: That's helpful. So I'm gonna give you a second now to read this screen a little bit more closely. So we're seeing some sort of pop-up here. When you finish reading that, I would just love if you can summarize to me what you've read.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000

> M: Okay, so what's this telling you?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:25.000

> P2: The popup is more or less saying that I can use my Login.gov account for all VA digital tools – I'd have to check into that further cause that's new to me. And if I want to use the account for any non VA Digital tools and other government sites, I would need to log back in to Login.gov to verify my ID. I did not know that either. So, possibly given the time, and how busy I was, I would probably click on that verifying. Learn more about verifiying Login.gov. And then just probably search around. Just see what else is available.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:24.000

> M: Okay. So there's a lot of a lot of different things that you're picking up on here that I want to chat through. So the first one, I think, that you mentioned was VA digital tools – you said you never knew about it, so it doesn't feel very clear. What is VA digital tools?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000

> P2: I would have to search to see where, if there's a tab, you know, behind this, you know. And actually, those what sites are.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000

> M: Yeah, okay. And so you know, you set up a Login.gov account. You know that you can use it with VA Digital tools. But you don't know what VA digital tools are. Okay got it.

> P2: Correct.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:12.000

> M: And then there's this note, and it's telling you that you can use your account for non VA Dgital tools on other government websites. What does it mean by other government sites?

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000

> P2: Hmm. I'm going to assume it like... not sure. It could be like social security.gov or IRS.gov or anything like that.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000

> M: Yeah. that makes sense. Are any of those other websites ones you use?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000

> P2: Social security. Yeah, I got my own account. I direct clients to that for their social security benefits. And then IRS is for any research or information education.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000

> M: Okay, alright. So, feeling pretty clear on what other government websites might mean.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000

> M: Why might you want to use this Login.gov account for those websites? Can you talk me through how that would work?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000

> P2: I would not know to be honest.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:31.000

> M: Yeah, yeah, that's fair. And so we talked about how it's letting you know that you'd you might need to verify your identity if you wanted to use this one. And you mentioned that, depending on the time, if you were already going through this account setup process, you might just decide to continue and verify.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000

> P2: Right.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:57.000

> M: Yeah. And so, if you wanted to do that, what would be the next thing you did on this page if you wanted to verify your identity with Login.gov.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:09.000

> P2: Oh, maybe go to like my profile, click on that to have to see what that leads me to what I scroll down. See what else is there on this page before moving forward. So yeah, I would look for like anything that, like my profile information.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000

> M: Okay. Gotcha. So you talked me through what we were doing, we went to VA.gov. We went to Login.gov. We set up an account. We came back to Va.gov. And then here is where things got a little bit confusing is kind of how I'm seeing it?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000

> M: So we know we've signed in with Login.gov, we know that we can use it for VA additional tools, but we're not totally clear on how we would verify our identity if we wanted to.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000

> P2: Correct.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000

> M: That's all very, very helpful for me to understand. If you wanted to get out of this this pop up, do you know what you would do next?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:14.000

> P2: I would click close.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000

> M: Yeah, okay, cool. So that felt pretty clear. So let's go ahead and click close. And now can can you just confirm and tell me where we are now?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000

> P2: Let's see, I'm at my VA, might be MHV.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000

> M: And I know I know you mentioned at the very beginning that usually when you go on to access VA benefits and healthcare and things like that, you start on  MHV. Does this look like MHV?

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000

> P2: I know it is not. I don't think it does. But I'm not a 100% sure.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000

> M: Yeah, yeah, that's okay. So this has been been really helpful. Thanks for answering so many questions already. We're gonna do one more thing. And so I'm gonna just talk you through how we get to that next task so if you click just at the top of your screen somewhere in that dark, you can just click there and then it'll help us move on hopefully to the next task. Yeah, there we go. Okay.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000

> M: So we're on VA.gov, and let's say it's a couple weeks later and you've decided to come back to VA.gov and sign in. So let's click on that sign in button. I'll give you a second to find that.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000

> M: Yeah, perfect. So why don't we go ahead and click on that. So we're seeing the sign in screen again. And you know, we've set up Login.gov. We also have this other account that we used before. What what are we gonna do when we see this sign in screen a couple of weeks?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000

> P2: I would probably sign in with MHV. I'm just familiar with it.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:18.000

> M: Okay. And knowing that you have set up Login.gov, how would you start to think about that extra sign in method. You still have MHV and you have Login.gov, what's the difference?

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000

> P2: I wouldn't would be more familiar with MHV. I'm more comfortable with that. If both sides are basically the same you know, I'd have to play with Login.gov, to make sure to become more familiar with it. So I'm able to navigate through it well. To alleviate any headaches, trying to find things easier, and if they're the same, I'm just going to assume that they might be. If they're the same then it all depends on which one I feel like going to. If both have the stuff that I need, I'm gonna go to the one that I can access easily.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:47.000

> M: Gotcha. Okay. So you know, you've set up Login.gov, but you're very familiar with MHV, and so it would probably take less for you to continue using MHV, because it's familiar.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000

> P2: Correct.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:57.000

> M: You know what to do with MHV. You're not sure with Login.gov. If you started to learn how it works, and you started to sign in with it more often, you might decide to use it more often.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000

> P2: Correct.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:07.000

> M: That's really really helpful. So let's go ahead and click Login.gov. And now we're at the sign in page on Login.gov. We're gonna imagine you're signing in with Login.gov.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000

> P2: Yup!

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000

> M: Okay, so we're back VA.gov, and we're seeing a different pop-up. And remember, this is a couple of weeks after we've set up a Login.gov account. I'm gonna give you a second to read this again.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000

> M: Okay, so what is this telling you here on this screen?

00:48:42.000 --> 00:49:00.000

> P2: This is like another pop-up, like what we had previously, acouple of months ago, about using a Login.gov account that I can use for the digital tools. And if I want to go out to other different government sites, I could use that login also. It's just more or less learning all the different... verifying the identity. It takes, the time frame says about 20 min to create. It's telling me what information I will need to do it. And it's giving me the option to either do it now, or can you continue later on.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.000

> M: Okay, so it feels kind of familiar because you've seen that other popup previously a couple of months ago. And it felt like it was giving you a little more information about what we meant by other government websites.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000

> P2: Yup, that helps. Yeah.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000

> M: Do you think that this was more helpful than the previous screen that we talked about?

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000

> P2: Yeah! List of the government sites. So like social security benefits or Federal job applications, and other government benefits sites. Yeah, this is a lot more information, a lot more information than the previous pop-up.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000

> M: Okay. Yeah. So you feel a little bit more clear about what this means. 

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000

> P2: Oh, yeah, it clears up the muddy water.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000

> M: Okay, yeah, that's helpful. And you also mentioned it tells you how much time it takes to complete. And then what you need to verify your identity. Reading this screen, what would your thoughts be? Do you have any hesitations about starting this verification process?

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000

> P2: No, this spells it out. The timeframe and what information you need, instead of just filling it all in and then realizing you need your driver's license.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000

> M: Yeah, I get that. So you like that it told you a little bit about what to expect before you start.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000

> P2: Correct. Yeah, that's really helpful.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000

> M: If there was something on this screen that you did have a question about, what would you do in order to get help or an answer to that question?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000

> P2: That's what I was just looking at yeah, I don't see it. It's not in the popup. I'd probably click on learn more. If there's a phone number, if not, if not, I close out of it. I'll find a phone number up here in the contact area.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000

> M: Yeah. And let's say you did that.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000

> P2: I'd probably give them a call then and like, hey, this is what I'm trying to do.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000

> M: Okay, if you close this, pop up. And you wanted this information you wanted to like, revisit this information, how would you find this information again after you click close?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000

> P2: Good question. Probably, I'd try logging in again and seeing if it pops up again.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000

> M: Okay, yeah. So you give you kinda guess a little bit about how you'd find it again.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:38.000

> M: Well, you've answered all of my questions on this prototype, so I'm gonna let you stop sharing your screen. You've answered a lot of questions. Out of everything that we talked about out of anything that was confusing, anything that was interesting?

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:32.000

> P2: My question is just looking at those 4 tabs. Is that all linked into the VA.gov? That's just my general question, cause you're never shown or taught, you know, it's like, hey, go to the site, have fun! And I'm like trying to follow the yellow brick road. For me, I got MHV, that that's the only one I go to. I'm familiar with it. I got find the information there. Now do those other 3 ones link into each other? Do they all play together?

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000

> M: Yeah, yeah, I can see how. It's quite confusing. There's 4 different options, I think MHV that is a common option that people use. Do you remember how you were introduced to MHV?

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000

> P2: Probably last summer. Sometime. Yeah.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.000

> M: Did you find out about it from someone else? Or did you just decide to set it up?

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000

> P2: Oh, oh. From one of the VA doctors.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:58.000

> M: Okay, right. So yeah, I think it's a common method that people use to sign in, particularly if you found out about it while you were at a VA medical center or seeing a doctor. There are other options that you can use to sign in and that's what those 4 different options are. All of those are basically a way that you sign in to access the VA sites.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:10.000

> M: So you can go to MHV, but you can use Login.gov to sign in, and so you'll be sent from Login.gov back to MHV. And then you continue just as normal, what you usually do.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000

> M: It sounds like you usually go to MHV, you sign in with MHV, and then you continue on to MHV. So it's not the most straightforward process which we understand, and so what we're our team is interested in is how can we make it a little bit more simple and also more secure for people to sign in to access VA benefits and services. 

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:49.000

> M: And so Login.gov is one option. You saw that you'd need to set up that two-factor authentication which you know helps with security, but is also a little bit of a burden sometimes, and so some of the questions I'm asking you are to help us understand where things have gotten confusing or where things could be easier to do.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000

> M: Is there any other questions you had for me? 

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:33.000

> P2: I did have one. Like the second two-step authentication. So like you get the text message, or if you don't choose that, or what is there certain ones that you have to like download onto your desk or your iphone, or your app, or your android like that, too?

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:07.000

> M: Yeah. So the authentication app. So the way that it works is you would download an app on your phone, and then once you have the app downloaded on your phone, which it wasn't very clear, it didn't tell you which app to download. You can download a couple of different ones. So a common one is called Google Authentication, or something like that, there's another one called Authy.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000

> P2: Yup! Yup, I think I've got that one. I've got like 2 of them on my phone.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000

> M: So it sounds like it's something you've set up before. But maybe it was a little more clear when you set it up with the other services that you were using it with.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000

> P2: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000

> M: Well, thank you so much. I see the time, and I really appreciate our conversation today. You're feedback is very helpful, and we're gonna continue to work through this so that we can make everything a little bit more clear before we make any changes. I do want to reassure you that the way that you're signing in right now like you don't need to change any of that. You can continue as you are. All of the changes that we're talking about, these are not happening yet. So continue as you are, and don't worry about signing in with MHV.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000

> M: The last thing to say is the folks who are contacting you to set up the interview, Perigean. They're gonna be the ones who are paying you for the interview. So if you have any questions about that, you just let them know and I think that's everything.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000

> M: Do you have any other questions?

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000

> P2: No, I don't think so.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000

> M: Awesome. Well, thank you so much. It was really great to meet you.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000

> P2: Yeah, same here, thanks. Guys, have a good day.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000

> M: Bye, you too!
