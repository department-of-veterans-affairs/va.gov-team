### Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000

> So I started recording. And I just wanna confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000

> That's fine!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
> Okay, thanks. So much. Alright. So we've gotten through the introduction. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000

> No!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000

> Awesome. Well, like I mentioned. We're here to learn a little bit more about how you use some of the Va's online services, and specifically how you sign in to them. So I'm gonna ask you some questions just to get to know a little bit more about your experience before we start looking at that prototype that I mentioned.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000

> Okay to start. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000

> Since 1990.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000

> Okay, a little while.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000

> And what about going online to access Va services? Have you been doing that since the nineties, or a little more recently?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000

> No, no, it's probably just been in the last couple of years, as technology advances, there's always changes.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000

> Yeah. Do you remember what kinda introduced you to some of the VA's online services. When you first started going online.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000

> They were like explaining that you can go online to contact them if you have questions, to refill your prescriptions, look at any test results.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000

> Okay, great, yeah, that makes sense. So you were talking to your doctors. And were they telling you about my healthy vet that? Does that sound familiar?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000

> Yeah, that's what I normally use. They do offer 2 options, but I have tried the second option with ID.me, or whatever it says. But I've not been able to get through. So I just continue with my healthy vet.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000

> Gotcha alrighty. So when you're when you're signing in, it sounds like you're using my healthy vet to sign in. And ID.me is not really working for you. Do you know which website you're on when you're when you're going online to access to talk to your doctor, for example?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000

> Do you mean like windows, or something, or chrome? Is that what you referring to?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000

> What would you type in if you were gonna go online to talk to your doctor?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000

> I just put in my healthy vet.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000

> Okay, so you're on the my healthy vet website.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000

> Correct.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000

> And then you use my healthy vet to sign in. Okay, that's helpful. And so when was the last time you signed into my healthy vet? Do you remember?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000

> Yesterday.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000

> Okay, how often do you feel like you're signing into my healthy vet?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:17.000

> Well, lately I've been using it a lot because I have missed a couple of appointments and it's very frustrating because I live in XXXX and when I have to travel to XXXX, missing an appointment is upsetting and I called acupuncture yesterday, because I had received a message that they had tried to call me wondering why wasn't at my appointment, and I said, my appointment is not until the 11th. She's like. No, dear, it was just today. I'm like, Oh, my God! And now I don't have an appointment until May 31, so I'm not happy because my acupuncture and physical therapy they go hand in hand. So I went on there to double check, to make sure that all the appointments that were in the system or in my phone. So I didn't have any other issues. And then there was medication that I had try to refill. I never got any medication. Oh, I had to actually go to the Va pharmacy in XXXX to find out why, and they said, Well, you don't have any more refills. I'm like what so then I had to come back home and go into my healthy vet, send a message to my doctor in order for her to refill the prescription, so I could get my medicine so it's it's been a little frustrating, because there were times when I would go into the system, and there was nothing there. There were no doctors, I couldn't access the pharmacy, and I was having to call. So I go. What is wrong with my healthy vet, because I'm not able to see any information at all, so I don't know if the system was down or they were working on it. I really don't know, but that was kind of aggravating.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000

> Yeah, okay, so it sounds like a couple of moments that we're aggravating for you in the last couple of weeks. That sounds a frustrating. And you mentioned that you are using my healtyh vet on your computer at home. Do you ever access MHV from your phone?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000

> Sometimes.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000

> Okay. Well, that's really helpful. And what about other VA websites. Have you been to any other Va websites besides my healthy vet?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000

> Do you mean, as far as like going into VA administration?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000

> Yeah, that might be one.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000

> Okay, up in the regional office. I've used it for that, and I've also had to update my banking, information, address or contact them because of fraud, or ask questions about my home. Various different parts of VA Administration.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000

> Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. And when you're on the Va administration website? Are you usually signing in as well?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000

> Yes, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I don't know. I have so many passwords, and when I change them I always write them down and say, I went into the website today with the password that I wrote down tomorrow, it doesn't work. And then then I have to call, and they're like, well, you know, try to reset it and go other these extra steps. I mean, you're trying to do something. You just want it to work, so I don't know why a password work one day, and then it doesn't work the next day. So that's been a really big issue.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:16.000

> Right? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, Gotcha. And when you're on the Va administration website, how are you signing in? Do you remember which kind of method you're using to sign in?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000

> I can sign in through my healthy vet.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000

> Gotcha. Okay? So you'll use my healthy vet when you're on the MHV website, or when you're on the VA administration website, Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful.

> That's correct.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000

> Is there anything else that you want to share with me more generally about signing in before we move on?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:56.000

> I don't know if the other option under ID.me would be better than signing into my healthy vet, but I can't comment because I can't get in it.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000

> Yeah, yeah, that sounds like, so you've tried. And you've not been able to set it up. That's really helpful to know. So I'll ask you a couple more questions about ID.me in a little bit. So that's very helpful.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:24.000

> So I mentioned a prototype when we first got on the call, and so I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on Zoom, and what I'd like for you to do is just open up this link on your computer. Once you open up the link, I'm gonna ask you to share your screen. Is that something you're familiar with doing?

[screen sharing troubleshooting]

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:26.000

> Alright. Thank you for working through that with me. So now we're looking at the va.gov home, page, and what I'd like you to do for kind of the rest of our conversation is we're gonna imagine that you've come online because you needed to update your address okay? So you're on the Va administration website, you need to update your address. So the first thing that you need to do is sign in, so can you show me where you would find the sign in option on this page?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000

> It's on the top right hand, right works in blue sign in.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000

> Perfect. Yeah, let's click on that.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000

> Oh, hold on! I gotta run and get my cable before my battery dies. Hold on, please!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:23.000

> Okay. Okay.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000

>  Okay, so you I'm gonna click sign in.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000

> Okay. If if we just stay on this page for a second before we click anything, it sounds like normally you would click my healthy vet on this page right?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000

> Correct.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000

> Okay. And these other options are any of the other ones looking familiar to you?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000

> I mean, I recognize all of them, but I'm not able to access any of them.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000

> Okay, so you recognize them because you've seen them, probably on a page like this before. But you don't have access to any of them. And you mentioned that you've tried to use id dot me, but it's not worked for you.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000

> what about these other 2? login.gov And Ds log on. Have you ever tried those ones?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000

> I've tried DS log on, but I don't know how to access it.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000

> Gotcha. Okay, that's okay. And so whenever you're coming online, you're always choosing my healthy bet. And it seems to work well for you most of the time.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000

> Yeah. It's the easiest one.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000

> Okay, so I'm gonna throw a little bit of a curve ball at you right now. And what we're gonna do today is we're gonna pretend like we're signing in with Ds log on. So I know you're not using Ds logon. We'll talk a little bit more in a second about why, that's why that's what I'm asking you to do.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000

> But for now let's just click Ds log on so you can go ahead and click on that button. Perfect. And then we're not gonna enter any information throughout our conversation today. So you're just gonna click login here and we're gonna pretend like you put in your username. And you put in your password, and then you click login. So whenever you're ready you're welcome to click that button.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000

> Perfect. So we know you don't have a Ds log on account right now. But we're gonna pretend like you put in your username and password. And we're gonna click login. So you can click on that grade button. There on your screen. Perfect. Okay. So now we're on this page. And what are we seeing on this page? Right now? You describe that to me.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:22.000

> It's just showing you how to create a login.gov account you know the DS login will stop working for VA digital tool soon, and it has a little paragraph there and then at the bottom it says note this account will only work for VA digital tools. And the features you may need to verify your identity again to use login.gov on other government websites. Create your login and continue with the Ds Login, for now.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000

> Okay. Gotcha. So we're gonna talk a little bit more about what we're reading here. But just to start, we've imagined that you've signed into the Va administration website because you needed to change your address and then you're seeing this.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000

> So. What do you think you would do if you saw something like this when you were trying to change your address?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000

> Well, I would first have to create a Login.gov to access the website, as a starting point.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:18.000

> Okay. So first off, you'd think if I wanna continue and access the website, I need to set up this account.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000

> That's sounds logical to me.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000

> Yeah, that sounds logical to me. And then you read through some of the things you were noticing here you said this was about creating a Login Gov. Account. Why is it recommending that you create a login.gov account?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:48.000

> Well, in order to access any information, you're gonna have to be able to create a login in order to advance forward to enter the information that you need to make changes, or any other information without that you're not gonna be able to continue forward cause even though it says continue with Ds Login. Now, if you don't have a login account, you're not gonna be able to move forward.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000

> Gotcha. Okay? So you need to have a login Gov account in order to move forward and access the website. So that's why it's telling you to create an account? that makes sense. And what about here? It says you can create a Va only login Gov account without needing to verify your identity again. What is that talking about?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:46.000

> It's stating that you have a premium Dslog Login account. And then it's saying you can create a Va login.Gov. Account with, without needing to verify your identity. But even though it's saying, if there's a if they're talking about a premium Ds log account, it's really not gonna make any difference. If you don't have access to Ds login website, I mean, I know I have a premium account under my healthy that. But I'm sure that's different than a premium ds log on logon account. Those are 2 separate entities.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:29.000

> Right? Yeah, yeah, okay, and so is, is it a little bit odd that they're mentioning that you have a premium Ds logon account, if they're also telling you that you can't use it anymore. Is that what's confusing?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000

> Logically, I'm not understanding, because you would have to have a premium Ds Login account In order to do anything to me. And if you don't have that, it doesn't really matter if there's saying, if You can create a Va log of accounts without needing to identify without needing to verify your identity. Again. But if they don't have any information about me in the Ds Login system, all of this is just a mute point.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000

> Gotcha. Okay? Because you're somebody who has premium my healthy vet, then, this is kind of irrelevant. Is that what you mean?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000

> That makes logical sense to me.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:49.000

> Yeah, that makes sense that makes logical sense to me as well. what we'll do is we'll imagine that this is saying because you have a premium. My healthy. That login account. You can create a Va only login. Gov. Account. Does that change? How you might interpret what it's saying to you?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000

> Because you would have to have a premium Ds log account first, that would be the first part of it, and because you do have a premium Ds login account, then I would be able to go in and create a Va Only login account, but that's only if I'm already a premium. Yeah, you have to. Ds login user. So no, to me it's the same.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000

> Gotcha? Yeah, yeah, I definitely get that. Okay, I get that. If it was saying, you know, let's pretend the screen looked different, and it said, Because you have a premium, my healthy bed account. You can create a Va only login.gov account.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000

> Well, that makes sense that makes sense to me. It would be easy, because I'm already a premium my healthy vet user and so then the next step would be to just create my Va only login gov account, and I wouldn't need to be verified each time.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000

> Gotcha. Okay? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And thank you for working with me because I know you don't use Ds log on, and I know this, says Ds log on. So it makes it kind of confusing. But that's really helpful. Everything you said so far.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000

> What about verifying your identity? Can you tell me what that means? What is verifying your identity?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000

> They would want to see your name. They probably want you to verify your date of birth, and maybe the last four of your social.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000

> Okay? And is that something that you would do one time? Is that something you would do every time, or sometimes?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000

> Well, I would think, if there, if you're setting up for the VA only login that you'd only have to do it one time.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000

> Okay, gotcha. Okay? And then why is it saying, Va, only login, what does that mean?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000

> I would assume that it's only for veterans to use.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000

> Okay, so it's a login. Yeah, it's a login account that is specifically for veterans to set up and to use with the Va.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000

> All this automation.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000

> Yeah, okay, yeah, it's this is all a little bit of a brain twister. So thank you for working through the questions with me. At the bottom of this it says, note, this account will only work for Va digital tools. What are VA digital tools?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000

> I could only assume that it would be something that would be with in a dropdown box, but without having... I don't know. You kind of stuck me there because I'm not really clear as to what they mean by digital tools.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000

> Yeah, that's that's a fair answer. That's really helpful. Alrighty, and then the last sentence I'm gonna ask you about on this page. It says in the future you may need to verify your identity again, to use login.Gov on other government websites.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000

> Well, that's make sense, because I do use FEMA, ever since Hurricane Ian. So that makes perfectly logical sense to me, because it's a different. It's a totally different entity. It's not the VA. It's another government system.

> So it's telling you that you could use this login with another government system? Okay, and what would you need to do if you wanted to use this login with another government system?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000

> If I understand you correctly, I would have to log in to that other site. I mean, I know with FEMA I do have a different username and password then I do then what I use on my healthy vet.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:55.000

> Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So if you wanted to use your login that you're setting up right now with Fema, you would just need to log in on the Fema website with that username.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000

> That's correct.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000

> Okay, that's really helpful. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like we're creating a login Gov account now. So what would you do if you were gonna create the Login Gov account? You can show me on your screen.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000

> I would click on create login.gov account.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000

> Okay, perfect. And then what are we looking at here?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000

> And then it's asking you to answer your email address and your password. And then sign in.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000

> Okay. Is this something that you'd be able to sign into? You know, we're not gonna make you put in any information. But this is something that you think you have an account for?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000

> Not if it's under login.gov.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000

> Okay. And so would what would you do on this page? If that's the case.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000

> Then I would click on create an account.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:03.000

> Okay, great. And for the next couple of screens, if you can do the same thing, just tell me all loud what you would be doing when you're looking at this page, and then we can keep clicking through.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000

> Okay. So it's asking for you to create your account so I would enter my email address then it's asking you to select your email language preference.
I would put, it's already highlighted as English, and then I would put a check mark or X where it's asking me to read and accept the login Government rules or use. Then I would press, continue.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000

> Perfect, let's go ahead and do that. You can click I read and accept, and then we'll click, continue.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000

> Okay, now is telling me they sent an email to my address with the link because they're wanting to confirm It's my email address, and then follow the link, too. Continue creating your account. If I want you me to check my email, once I check my email, if I check it. And I don't see any information. Then I would say I didn't receive an email to Resend. I'd have to wait for them to resend it, and for some reason there's a problem with my email address. They're asking me by have a different email address to use.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000

> Gotcha. Okay. That's really helpful. Is this something you've done before?

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000

> Yes, I've had to do it before. I know it's all for security reasons, but I'm like, Oh, my God. Why do I have to do this again? But anyway, I know it's for my own security.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000

> Okay, great. So it's a little bit of a nuisance. But you kind of understand why you have to do it. That's helpful.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000

> Correct.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000

> So let's click, check email and we're not gonna obviously go check your email. Now. But we're gonna pretend like you got sent this email. Now. It says, confirm your email and let me know what you're seeing here. And same thing you were doing before...

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:08.000

> It says, thank you for submitting your email address. Please click the link below or copy and paste the entire link into your browser, telling you that if you don't do it within 24 h it will expire. Then you click on confirm email address.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000

> Perfect. Let's go ahead and do that.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:28.000

> So now a once you 2 create a strong password, and it must be 12 characters long and not be commonly used. Password, and this can be tricky at times, because I have, like a systematic system that I use, and normally it would be like XXXX and then it would be a couple of more letters XXXX and then show you the password. Even then, when you click, continue, for whatever reason it'll say doesn't accept. Sometimes it'll say there's no capital letter. Okay, that's a easy fix. So after you've corrected and put the capital letter and you hit, continue. It's still giving you error. So then you have to say, Okay, maybe it doesn't like the XXXX. So you're going back and forth trying to figure out what is wrong with the password that you've selected. And normally, sometimes I can get it the first time, sometime it takes 2 or 3, and then it's gonna tell me if the password is strong enough or is weak, or it's acceptable.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000

> Okay, gotcha, that's really helpful. So you definitely have a system and you kind of know what to expect even while you're like troubleshooting with like an error message or anything like that. You kind of have experience with working through that. That's that's really helpful. So on this page. It's it sounds like you'd kind of know where you would start. And then if it came back, saying, You know you didn't put up a capital letter, you would go and fix that that's really helpful, so we won't have you create a password for real today. So you can click, continue, I mean, we're just gonna keep going through these this setup.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000

> So let me know what you're seeing on this page.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:54.000

> It's asking me for authentication methods setup to add more security to the authentication options below and they're asking, do you want face our touch, unlock a security key government employee id which that's not applicable to me. authentication application not sure about that one, and then text or voice message are the options.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:19.000

> Okay, great. So that was really helpful already, just going through the list. Which option do you think that you would choose?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000

> Personally, I don't use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram. None of that stuff, because I don't want my face splattered all over the place. I'm just not comfortable. So that wouldn't be something that I would use. The security key I've heard about. And for me that might be the best option, and then either text or voice message.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000

> Okay. Gotcha, that's really helpful. o why don't you go ahead and click whichever option you want to set up?

[troubleshooting issues finding tab]

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000

> Perfect. Alrighty. Okay, so we're back here. Thanks for working through that with me. So what is the screen showing you?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000

> It's telling me, okay, to add a security key that meets whatever FIDO stands for, as your often authentication method. You can add as many security keys as you want. So get started first. Give your security Key a nickname. Okay, and. I would just say VE.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.000

> Okay, great. And what made you want to choose security key as an option?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000

> Well, there was another study, and they were explaining to me how secure it is, and would I prefer a security key than other methods, and I thought about it because they said, You can use it, you know, on your your laptop, and you could set it up where you would just put it into the port on your computer and you know keep it there or carry it with you, and I believe they said if even if I carried it with me, if I were to go to the library or someone else, I or somewhere else, I would be able to use it, because that's my own personal security, key, so I like that, I like that, option.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.000

> Okay. And have you tried that before since you heard about it?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000

> No, I haven't, because I thought they said they were still doing the study, and I guess it was still in the preemptive stages, cause I thought they were gonna send me a key. So I can actually try it. But when I got home I have all these gadgets in my my art room. I'm always trying to figure out. What is this for? What is this for? So I actually may have one, I think, in my art studio, but I've never done anything with it.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000

> Okay. Gotcha.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:43:03.000

> I need direction, because automation for me can be a little bit scary at times, and I only go to websites that I actually use. I'm not. I guess I'm not normal because everybody goes into Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff. I'm not comfortable using all of those specific entities. This is not for me.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000

> Yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So if you were gonna use something like that, you do seem to have some interest, you think you might even have a security key. But you would need someone to help walk you through exactly what the like setup process looks like that makes sense.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000

> Right cause. Like, I think I do have one. Yeah.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000

> Okay, well, let's click on. Continue, we're not gonna actually set up the security key today. But that's been really helpful to chat through.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:52.000

> If you were using your security key, then you might enter in this code and then we're just gonna click, submit we're just gonna move on so we can get your feedback on a couple more things. So what does this screen telling you?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000

> That they've added my authentication method. Now they want me to add a second method as a backup.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000

> Okay, what do you think you would do on this screen?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000

> If I was actually going to do this, I probably would have selected voice or text as my authentication. I would have the security key as the backup. I would have reversed it.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:34.000

> Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Gotcha. That's helpful. So you would probably want to have the backup, and you'd want security key to be your backup, and you would probably usually use the text message.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000

> That's correct. That's really helpful. Alright. Well, today, we're gonna skip setting up a backup method. So let's click, skip for now and then we're gonna continue to the next screen.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000

> So what is the screen telling us?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000

> It's basically telling me that they've set up my account. They have my email. And I have been linked to the VA system. But it's only for information regarding VA, as it pertains to my account.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000

> Okay, great. So you've set up the account. It's only for the Va. And that's why it's telling you they're going to share the information with the Va.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000

> Correct.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000

> Okay. What do you expect to see when you click agree and continue.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000

> I'm not sure. I guess I'll find out!

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000

> Okay, that's fair. Let's go ahead and do that. We'll click agree and continue, and we'll see what comes up alright.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:59.000

> Okay, so it's telling me that I've signed in with login.gov and that I can use the login.gov for all my va digital tools. And then I currently have a Va login.gov account, and if I wanna use my account on other government websites I'll need to go back to login.gov to verify my identity.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000

> Okay, so is anything you're reading here, surprising to you or something you haven't learned already.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000

> No, not really!

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000

> Okay. And so why is it telling you that you've signed in with login.gov?

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:03.000

> Because all of those steps previously got me to this point.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:13.000

> That makes sense. And there's a link here that says, Learn more about verifying your identity with login and this might feel a little repetitive. But can you tell me what you think that link is about?

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:33.000

> It would give you a breakdown of all the different ways that you can verify your identity, and just go into more depth about each one.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.000

> Okay. And what's an example of one of the ways that you might verify your identity?

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000

> Voice or text.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000

> Okay. And so earlier on, when we chose those like voice or text message, and we talked about security keys. Are those ways of verifying your identity?

> Yes.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000

> Okay, that makes sense. That's been really helpful. And we're kind of getting to the end of the session. So one thing I'm curious about is when we started this, we said, you know, you were coming to the Va website because you needed to change your address. But when you tried to go in, it said, you need to set up a login.gov acocunt right? So we went and set up that account, and now we've finished. And so, if right now you wanted to go and I change your address, what would you do on this screen?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000

> Well, if I close this screen out, what's underneath that it says, my VA. Got to your profile, and oh, I can't move it right...

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.000

> Yeah, it won't move. That's actually perfect. I just wanted to confirm that it was easy enough to close the popup. That's perfect. That's okay. Let's let's stay here for a second.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000

> Oh, oh, gosh! I'm sorry!

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:02.000

> That's okay. That's perfect. So it was easy to close the pop up, and you would have probably went and searched around the website and been able to change your address. We're gonna do one more thing before we finish. Okay. So we were just pretending we'd signed in right. And then let's pretend like we signed out.So we finished that session. And now we're a couple of weeks have passed, and you wanted to come back into your account because you needed to change something let's say you needed to update your mailing address again. And so let's say that you were gonna sign in. How are we gonna sign in now?

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:46.000

> Well, since we went through that process, I should be able to either use my healthy vet or login.gov.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000

> Okay, and how are you gonna decide which one of those to use?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000

> I would probably revert back to my healthy vet because I'm the most familiar with that one. Adn then in my spare time, I would try to go in on login.gov, just to become familiar. But I have to be familiar with the site in order to use it over and over again. And right now that's my healthy vet, because I know how to maneuver around to get to the information and make changes that I need to change.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000

> Okay, yeah, so you know how to get to things like messaging your doctor, or whatever else you need to do in my healthy vet. So you feel more familiar with that. Okay, that makes a lot of sense.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000

> And why did we set up login.gov? In the first place, if you can remember, back to that first part of the call.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:07.000

> I think it has something to do with security, and also not having to be too repetitive in logging in, because you're already verified because you have that premium account.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000

> Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna pretend like we're signing in with login.Gov. So we're just gonna click login.gov. And then we're just gonna click sign in. We're gonna pretend like we put in our email address and password. And we're going to click sign in perfect. And then we're, I'm gonna give you a second to read this screen. Okay?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000

> Alrighty. So what is this telling you?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:17.000

> It was talking about being able to access VA and using the login.gov for outside of the VA, FEMA, social security. Whatever other Government agencies that you need assistance with.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000

> Yeah, okay, perfect. So we talked a little bit about that earlier. Right, so how you might use your login account with things like FEMA. And if you wanted to use your login.gov account with FEMA, what would you do next?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:54.000

> Well, I would have to be into the FEMA website, and of course they're still gonna need to identify me. You know, with the basic information. And then, after they verified that information, and they should just take me right into the FEMA site, or I can take care and make changes. Send a message. Whatever I wanna do.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000

> Gotcha alright. So we'll go to FEMA, the website. And it's gonna tell you, okay, you need to verify your identity now with FEMA, and then you can go on and use this login there.

> And when you're doing that, is that what is that going to be similar to what we did today when we set it up with the VA?

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000

> No, I don't think so, because they already have most of my information already in the system. I would think I would do more, when it's outside of the VA.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:59.000

> Okay, got it. So the Va. Already has some of your a lot of your information in the system and so you'd have to do it. You'd have to.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000

> The only only time that I've had to do that is for whatever reason, I had a brain freeze, and I couldn't remember my password, it would ask me to for either my username, and then it would ask me the last 4 of my social or my complete social my date or birth phone number information like that. And then it would send me a link to change my password. After I happen to verify.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.000

> Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So that's kind of what you're expecting to do when you try and use this with FEMA?

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000

> Yes.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000

> And if you said no thanks, I don't want to verify. Do you think anything would happen?

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000

> Well, it might ask me another question. Why I didn't want to, or it would just say, 'Okay, thank you.'

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:03.000

> Okay. And and you could kinda continue on using this account with the VA?

> Yes.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000

> Okay, that's helpful. Well, I see we're nearly finished here. So if you want to stop sharing your screen, you are welcome to. I think somewhere on the top of your screen, if you move your mouse up there, it might say, stop sharing but I'm not gonna be able to see it.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000

> So there you go. Well, we talked about a lot of things today, and I asked you a lot of questions. So that was really helpful for me, I think. Was there anything that stuck out out to you? If there was any last thing you wanted to comment on before we wrapped up.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:53.000

> Yeah, when when these surveys come up and you, you know, interview and talk with the Veteran, how is this information being used to better serve us?

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:00.000

> Yeah, that's a great question. So what we're looking at right now is how we we can get Veterans to adopt a different type of login method and we don't really know exactly what that process is going to look like. But we do know it's going to be a little complicated for Veterans, and we want to figure out how we can make it easier. So some of the things we talked about today – I'm asking you questions to understand, like, where things that we've written are not clear enough. And so then it's making it harder on you. And we'll see your feedback as well as other veterans. So this week we've spoken to 10 Veterans. We have a really similar conversation, and we'll take all the feedback. And we'll say, Okay, this is what we're noticing on this page. This button needs to be here we're not able to find this button needs to be here. We're not able to find this, and we'll start to change things and then we'll do this again. So we'll talk to veterans again, and we'll see if it's working better. So it's it helps us make like little changes over time before we make a ton of Veterans see something or use something that doesn't really work that well for them. Does that make sense?

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:17.000

> Yeah, because I know that security is a really big issue. And even though there are a lot of different information in the dropdown box, even, still, you still have to call the VA. Or they have to send you a document because you can't do it online and I'm like, Well, well, why do you have part of the information online? But you don't have the rest of the information online, and then you still have to call, or you still have to submit a paper form. And then once you get the paper form and send it back to them. Then they input the information, and then they still send you paper verifying that they have made the changes. I don't know why it can't be simplified where you can just do everything online, whether it's your banking information, your address, whatever it is. So they're not multiple multiple steps, because that can get frustrating. After a while. You're just like, Okay, take a deep breath. Let me try this again.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000

> Totally. Yeah, totally. No. I definitely understand that. I mean the VA, like any government service is complex. There's a lot of different people working on a lot of different things. I think over time things will become more streamlined. I do think that there's a lot of folks at the VA who are thinking about these things right now. I don't know which individuals would be the ones to help with this, but hopefully, there's some reassurance that there's a lot of us doing things like this to try and make small changes and yeah that's kind of what we're we're here to do, and why we need to have conversations with folks like yourself. Because it's really really valuable to have your feedback to.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000

> Okay, well, you're welcome.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000

> Well, thanks so much. It's it's been a pleasure we've taken up the whole hour. So I'm gonna let you go. So I don't take too much of your time. But I do. Wanna let you know that Perigean, the people who sent up this interview, they're gonna be the ones that manage paying you for your time. And so, if you have any questions about that, you let them know, and I think that's everything to do. You have any other questions for me?

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000

> No, that's it. I'm just looking for better choices down the road, more simplistic because I, for one, like things that are easy, because when it comes to automation, if I spend a whole hour trying to do the same process when that hour is done, I am done, and then I'm on the phone you know, calling and as you know, then you could be on hold for the 3 min, 30 min, 45 min, and then, when you think you have the right person they're like, what we have to transfer, you. And I'm just sitting there, and if I could see myself as I'm waiting on the phone, it would probably be a really comical event.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000

> Yeah, yeah, no. I hear you. I definitely hear you.  I know the VA is constantly making changes to make it better for Veterans. Well, we appreciate your time a lot today. So I'm gonna let you go.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000

> I hope you have a good rest of your day, or your day, or your evening, and thanks so much for chatting today.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000

> Bye.
