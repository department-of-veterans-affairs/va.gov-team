### Transcript

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000

> Okay, I started recording. I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000

> Yes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000

> Great. I'd like to start by learning a little bit more about your experience with the VA and some of our online services. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000

> I was medically retired in December of 2015.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000

> Okay, gotcha. And how often do you go online to access and manage your VA benefits and healthcare?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000

> Definitely a couple of times a week for sure.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000

> Okay, yeah, pretty frequently. Do you remember the last time that you signed into the VA online?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000

> Last night.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000

> Oh, wow! Great! And why were you signing in last night?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000

> I have an appeal going, and I just was checking status to see if anything had been updated.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000

> Gotcha!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000

> And also on Friday I renewed my prescriptions online as well.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000

> Oh, fantastic! Do you remember how you sign into the VA?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:46.000

> Yes, I have the VA app on my phone, and so I use the VA app, and I think it uses Login.gov as my login procedure.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000

> Okay, great. And why do you use Login.gov to sign in?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000

> I know I used to use like DS Logon, or something like that, was what it was called? But once it updated it said there was a more streamlined process, and I had done a survey kind of like this with the VA. And they said it was an easier login, and they walked me through it when I was doing that survey thing, and it was way easier. So I just been using that one.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000

> Oh, great, great! So you used to use DS Logon, but being able to be introduced to Login.gov you discovered that it was easier. So you now use that one.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000

> Yeah, and I think now I can use – with the Login.gov – I can use my fingerprint, so I fingerprint login with the VA.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000

> Okay, that's great.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000

> Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing in before we move on?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000

> I don't think so.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000

> Okay, so next, I'd like to share some ideas with you, so we can get your feedback in a minute. I'm gonna send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier that a prototype is like a pretend version of an email or a website. So it's going to look similar. But it won't work as you might expect, because it's not a real email or a website. Are you dialing in from a phone?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000

> I am. Yes!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000

> Okay, actually, I'm gonna need you to call in on your computer.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000

> Let me go into my office now. We'll do that real quick.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:04:00.000

> Okay, thank you so much.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000

> Perfect. Okay? So I'm gonna share that prototype with you in the chat. If you can open up that link on your computer. And are you familiar with sharing your screen in Zoom?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000

> I think I am. I see here real quick.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:20.000

> Okay. I can walk you through it, if not.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000

> Okay, maybe I do need help. So.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000

> Okay, sure. So you've opened up that link in a browser.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:42.000

> Yes.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000

> Great. So if you come back to the zoom application on your laptop. Down at the bottom of the screen of the zoom window there should be a green button that says, share screen. Great. Perfect, and I can see what you're looking at. If you want to make that a little bit bigger, then I can get a better look. Okay, so now that you have this open, I'd like you to start by imagining that you've just received this email, and I'm gonna give you a second to read this more closely now. And when you're finished I'd like you to summarize what you've read.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000

> Okay. So it just looks like, it's telling me that the DS Logon will soon stop working. So it's want me to create the Login.gov.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000

> And do you have any initial questions? After reading this email?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000

> I don't think so. It's pretty straightforward.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000

> And what is the email asking you to do?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000

> There's a blue link that says, go to VA.gov to create an account.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000

> Okay. And in this scenario you've just received this this email. And would you be interested in sending up a Login.gov account right now?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000

> Yeah, because I'd want to continue being able to get my VA, I just want to continue to be able to view my account.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.000

> Do you have any hesitations about setting up a Login.gov account?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000

> No, I mean like, I said, I already have one, but I didn't see when I initially, when I got the email from the web sort of thing that I did. It was kind of straightforward – like pretty straightforward – and it was just, you know, saying, hey, it's still secure. This is a login, the DS Logon is going away. And so I get, you know, things change and times change things. So I don't think it would be any issue at all.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000

> Great. Why do you think the VA is recommending that you set up a Login.gov account?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:40.000

> That, I don't know. I'm guessing that stuff, just, you know, gets out of date, and it's time for upgrades and migrations and stuff like that.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000

> If you had a question about that email, what would you do?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000

> Honestly, I probably reach out to other Veterans, gotten the same thing, or had any questions. Otherwise I'd probably I'd go to the bottom, and I know usually the bottom of the page. You can say contact us, or whatever, and kind of get some questions answered. So that's probably what I'd go to.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000

> Gotcha. Okay? Well, yeah. So we've already clicked ahead on that button. And is this page what you expected to see after after seeing that email? This is where you thought you'd end up.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000

> Yeah, I figure it would take me to a login account, and I did say it did say the login that I could log in with my DS Logon. Still, I didn't say that it was completely shut down yet, so I see that I can do that or I can go to My HealtheVet, ID.me or Login.gov.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000

> Okay. And can you tell me what you would do next?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000

> For me. I would, I guess, since I already have one it's kinda different. But because of the email, I would click on, create an account with Login.gov. Cause that's what the email was about.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000

> Okay. Earlier, you mentioned that the email said that you needed to log in with DS Logon.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000

> I would probably jump because the email was saying that they were gonna go away from DS Logon. I would probably go to create an account with Login.gov.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000

> Okay, okay, well, today, we're going to imagine that you're gonna sign in with DS Logon. So you can click and we're gonna pretend that you've entered in your username and password. Yup, and before we read in detail, can you describe to me what we're looking at?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000

> So it looks like once I got logged in, it's saying that it's taking me away, taking me away from the VA. So it looks to me like it's gonna automatically take me to Login.gov, or I can click to stay here if I wanna not do it right now.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000

> Okay. And why do you think this appeared on your screen?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:19.000

> I'm guessing it's just because the email, where it stated that Login.gov was gonna be required after the DS Logon went away. And so I'm just guessing it's trended now to get you that way, to get you to take care of it now.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000

> Okay? And do you have any initial questions after?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000

> I don't think so.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000

> What do you expect to happen next?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000

> I mean at this point, just to get done. I'd probably click on continue to Login.gov. And go through that process to create the new account.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000

> Okay. Okay, so let's go ahead and setup Login.gov. And on the next couple of screens I'd like for you to describe out loud what you would do next.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000

> So what we would do on this page?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:23.000

> So on this page, it looks like if I already had a Login.gov, I would sign in with username or email and password. And if I didn't, it does say, first time, user create an account. So as a first time user, I could click create an account.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000

> Do you have any concerns about this page?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000

> I don't think so. It looks pretty straightforward to me.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000

> Okay, so let's so in this scenario, remember, the email wanted you to create an account. So we're gonna click, create. And what would you do on this screen?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000

> So it's just asking me to enter my email, then my language preference, and then there's a rules of use. So opening that and reading, and then clicking, I read an accept, and then looks like, continue.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000

> Great. Let's imagine that you've done just that and press continue. And what would you do here?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000

> So it looks like, according to this, it sent me an email with a link to confirm that I entered the current email. So I go back to my email and confirm that link. And then, and it's this check email so I'm guessing this link will take me. I don't know. Receive an email. So I guess if – I'm guessing, like most websites, go to email, confirm it. This maybe goes away like some with you, confirm or automatically confirms for you on the screens are on waiting. And then if it didn't, if I didn't receive that email, then I can resend it or I can try a different email address, if that, didn't work, I can enter a different email.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000

> How would you check your email if, like, what device would you use?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000

> I mean, I have a laptop at home, but use my phone more than I use anything, so probably might be.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000

> Okay, so let's click check email and pretend that you've gone to go check your email.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:50.000

> And you can go ahead and read this page and tell me what you would do next.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000

> So it took me my email, it brought me to the email to confirm it. So looks like if I just click confirm email address, it'll confirm me. So I'll put the I will click to come from email address link in the box.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000

> Okay, let's go ahead and confirm. And what would you do here?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000

> So it's asking me to create a password. It has to be at least 12 characters, so I could create it, and that looks like it has the strength bar here is kind of show me if it's a good password, if it has enough characters and stuff in it, and then just click continue and if I have any questions, of my password. It looks like there's the quick link tips to check, answer those questions which is nice?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.000

> Thanks. Yes. So let's pretend that you've entered in a password and click continue. And can you describe this page to me?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000

> So it looks like it's just trying to set up another option for security to get into login numbers, which is what I did, that. So I have. I have the touch unlocked the fingerprint unlocked, but it gives other options. A government id are they authentication, application, text or voice, or the list of codes. It looks like I would just click one of those and then click, continue.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000

> And which option would you choose?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000

> I went with the face or touch of mock, so probably, that one.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000

> Okay, yeah. So let's click on that one. And then imagine you've set this up. Okay, so what about this page? Can you describe?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000

> So it looks like it set up the touch code for me. And then it's give me an option if I want to add another one. Another method, I'm guessing it'd be one of the other 4 or 5 options that were on the last page I'm guessing I would click on one another option to give me another backup one in case, or I could skip it and move on to the next.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000

> Okay? And what would you do on this screen?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:45.000

> I would probably just skip, since I already have a password and my fingerprint, I would probably just skip, for now.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000

> Okay. Well, today, we are going to skip for now. So tell me about this screen that you're seeing. What do you think this means?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000

> So it looks like it's basically confirming my email and just making sure this is the email. It's going to the VA so that they can use it to connect my account.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:30.000

> Okay. And before you click on anything, what do you expect to happen when you click, agree and continue?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:46.000

> I'm guessing it'll probably take me to the login screen to actually login. But I'm not sure.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:57.000

> Okay, let's click agree and continue and see where we end up.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000

> Now, before we talk about the screen, I'd like to reflect on what just happened in your own words.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000

> Can you tell me what you just did?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:17.000

> So it looks like, because I went through this whole process, and I set up my and password and all that stuff and I've confirmed my email this is actually the login page. So this is the homepage from my when I login. This is what I see with, you know, with my information. So it looks like it actually just took me right to the login screen, which is awesome. I don't want to go back and re-type it all in.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000

> Which Login screen?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000

> VA.com it looks like.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000

> Okay. Do you have any concerns about what just happened?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:59.000

> Nope, I actually like it since, like I said on usually once you set up an account and there wasn't anyway to save your account, you still have to go back in and type everything in to login. It says you're logged in. So this is kind of nice that it actually just takes you there.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.000

> Okay, yeah. So after that whole process, it already brought you back, signed it.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000

> Yeah.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000

> Great. So I'm gonna give you a a second to read through this screen, and I'd like you to summarize it to me.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000

> So it looks like the login that I created works only on the VA website. If I'm trying to go to another government website, I had to go back in and verify my identity with Login.gov.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000

> Okay. If there was an issue on this page, what would you do?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000

> Looks like there's a link in blue underline that says that I can verify. I can learn more about verifying my identity with Login.gov. So just click the link and go to that page and see what it said.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000

> Okay. We're nearly done so. Thank you so much for answering so many of my questions today. So next we're going to close this popup. And click anywhere in the top blue section. We're gonna pretend that you've signed out and now I'm gonna ask you to imagine that it's been a couple of months since you've set up your Login.gov account. But you've come back to your computer since then, and you're going to sign in to Login.gov. Can you show me how you would sign into Login.gov this time?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000

> Yeah, so it sounds like you would go straight to Login.gov.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000

> Let's imagine that you've enter in your that username and password that you've set up. Click, sign, in. So before we read this in detail. Can you describe to me what we're looking at now?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:59.000

> So it looks like it's allowing me to verify my identity for use of Login.gov outside the VA.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000

> Okay. And why do you think this screen appeared?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:18.000

> I mean, it was the last thing that was said before that if I wanted to log into sites other than VA.gov, I'd have to go back in a verify my identity. So it's just asking me to verify that identity now, which is awesome cause I see that I can do so [to access] like social security benefits or federal job applications. So that's kind of nice that the next time I log in it'll just ask me to do that and get that done with on the VA website, I won't try to go to another website. And go through all the processes already. Got my stuff saved right here, so I can just do it.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:51.000

> Okay, do you have any initial questions? After reading this page?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000

> I don't think so. I was wondering how long it was gonna take where it tells me right here, about 20 min. It tells me stuff I need to have so I can gather those things before I continue. Then I can either continue or not continue. So as long as I had on my documents, I would just continue and go and verify.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:21.000

> Okay. So it sounds like you would be interested in upgrading your account today.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000

> Yeah. And why do you think the VA is recommending that you upgrade your login?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:41.000

> I mean, since it's asking me, since the same things like social security benefits or federal job applications, I'm guessing any government websites, seems to me like Login.gov will be the go-to login for that. So it's just gonna make it easier if I already have it done for any other options that I go to for any other government websites.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000

> Okay, yeah. So this would be the way that you would log in to those other websites it sounds like, okay, great. If you chose not to upgrade your logging.com account. What do you think will happen?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000

> Well, there's a link to click it. I guess if I didn't want to, I could just click it and see where it took me. I'm guessing I could probably still log in. It would just be VA only, and it wouldn't let me go any other government websites like I said before.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:49.000

> Okay, if you had a question about this screen, what would you do?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:58.000

> I would definitely click to learn more about verifying and see if that took me to a page, or I could close this out and go to the contact us page up here on the VA website. Go through those channels.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000

> Okay. That sounds good. Okay. So we've covered a lot today. And I just want to spend a couple of minutes now reflecting before we wrap up. Can you summarize what it is that you did today as you click through that prototype?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:34.000

> Yes, I created a Login.gov account. It was pretty straightforward. A step by step walkthrough, and then I went through the verification process, verifying my identity with Login.gov. And I was able to get all signed in, and then we got to the point where I was asking me about verifying for a non-VA Login.gov account and going through that process.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000

> Okay, thanks for that. Out of everything that you looked at today is there anything that sticks out to you? Something that may have been confusing or interesting?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000

> No, I mean like I said before, I like that I created the account and I didn't have to go and enter all those credentials, you know, into a login bar again. If I go to try to log into something, and then I have to create an account sometimes I get frustrated. That I have to go and enter everything I just entered, just to get logged in. I like that. This took me, and just let me log right in I was already logged in once I entered that went through the verification process. I was where I wanted to go. In the first place.

> Okay, that's great. Is there anything that we could do to make it easier for you to set up a login account to use with the VA?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:02.000

> I don't think so. I mean, this is pretty straightforward. I mean, what's the with the tabs to be able to the links to be able to ask questions or learn more Those are nice to have those on each page. So if I do run into an issue, I just click those. I think it would be pretty self-explanatory, straightforward.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000

> Okay, cool. That's great. Thank you for that. Those are all the questions that I have for you today. Do you have any questions for me?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000

> I don't think so.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000

> Okay, cool. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:34.000

> Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on this site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Before you go I wanted to make sure it's clear that everything that we did today wasn't real. So you haven't actually set up an an additional Login.gov account – that you already have. And you can continue signing in, as you normally do.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:02.000

> And lastly, Perigean will be sending a thank you note with little blurbs that you can pass along to any other Veterans that you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies. They'll also be in touch about payment as well.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000

> Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000

> You as well. Thank you so much.
