### Transcript

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000

> Okay, great. So are you comfortable if I record this session today?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000

> Yes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000

> Awesome, alrighty! Well, let's start by learning a little bit more about your experience with the VA and some of our online services. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000

> Over 30 years.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000

> Okay, so quite a while. And how often would you say you go online to access or manage anything related to the VA?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000

> Maybe once or twice a month I go on for different things. Maybe to check benefits. But since I worked on transitioning over to healthcare, I kinda go in that way to get to my healthy vet, too, and talk to my doctor.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000

> Okay, gotcha. So it sounds like sometimes you're starting on my healthy vet. And then, when when you're looking at your benefits, do you know which website that you start from to going to look at that?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.000

> So I go into the eBenefits website because it will transition over to the new website without me having to do the extra layer of authentication.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000

> Okay. Okay, so tell me more about that. What's it like when you start the process? If you can kind of walk me through that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000

> So, I go to my eBenefits. And then, when I have the main screen on, I'm usually looking at disabilities to check the status of things. I have ongoing. I click on disabilities, and then it it will bring up what I have. That's currently in the queue. Then I will just select one of those items. One of the disability claims that I have there. I click on that and then it will bring up the status, whether it's a gathering evidence. Reviewing, evidence. Whatever the case may be, and it will say at the top there will be a blue layer that says, 'Try our new website,' and I'll go there because that lets me get to that other website. And that almost gives me a different level of detail that's easier to read. But I mean I don't usually go right to the new website because there is an extra layer of authentication that's kind of a pain, and I don't have to do it if I go through eBenefits first.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000

> Okay, that's really helpful. I think I'm following. So it sounds like you're going in through ebenefits. Do you know which sign in method you use when you're on the E benefits website?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000

> Yeah, I use, yeah, DS Logon.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000

> Okay, great. So it sounds like you start any benefits you sign in with the DS logon, and then eventually, you probably end up at VA.gov. It sounds like that might be the new website? Okay, great. And that's a bit easier for you, you find, rather than starting on va.gov.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000

> Yes. Yeah.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000

> And signing in there. Great. Okay. That makes sense. That's really helpful. Do you remember the last time that you signed in?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000

> Probably would have been about a week ago when I did a refill on my medications.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000

> Okay. So that would have been probably on my healthy vet?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000

> Yeah. But I go into the the VA portal first to get there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000

> Okay, gotcha. So there's a couple of different places that you're comfortable starting from. And when you went into the VA portal, do you know which sign in method you would use to refill your prescription?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000

> Yeah, so I use DS.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000

> Okay. Gotcha, that makes sense. So that's really helpful. I think we'll talk a little bit more about that throughout our conversation today but I think we can get started with looking at that prototype that I mentioned so what I'm going to do is send you a link in the Zoom chat and I'll send that right now and then.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:52.000

> I'm just gonna ask you to open this up on your iPad. And then, once that's opened up, I'm gonna ask for you to share your screen. So I'll give you a second to open the link and then let me know if you're comfortable or you're familiar with sharing your screen.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000

> Yeah. The link just disappeared.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000

> Okay, might be a little bit funny on the ipad. Let me think where it might show up. I'll send it again, and we'll see.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000

> Okay, yeah, I got it. There.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000

> So is that opening up now on your side?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000

> Yes.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000

> Okay, awesome. And then I think, to share your screen on the ipad. And is that something you've done before?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000

> I have!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:57.000

> Okay, let me know if you need any support, and I can help walk us through it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000

> So far, I don't think I'm seeing your screen.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000

> Are you still on the zoom window? Are you on the?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000

> I'm on the zoom window. I hit share content in the zoom window.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000

> And you can see that?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000

> No, I'm not seeing it yet, so let's think, at the top of your screen does it say something like 'sharing screen'? I think, if not, it might not have started yet.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000

> Okay, yeah. Cause, the website is still not up. Let me try something here. I wonder if it's that browser? Okay. So I got the screen up. Now, I just need to. I the link that you send me. Now we just need to figure out why this sharing is over.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's think it is a little funny on my end.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000

> Sometimes you disappear, so if you're on the zoom window, do you see?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000

> Kind of like a a bunch of different options, like muting.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000

> And you know, chat. Oh, there we go!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000

> Yup, I just I found something.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000

> Alright, I'm gonna give it a second to load.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000

> Okay, it, looks like you're sharing your screen now, so I can see the zoom window.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000

> And then, yeah, perfect. That's great. Okay? So I'm guessing that you can see exactly what I'm looking at.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000

> You've got this email on your screen, and then maybe me in the upper right hand corner. Okay, perfect.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000

> Right.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000

> So this is an email. Let's pretend that it's addressed to yourself, and what I want you to do as we start our conversation today is to imagine that this was received to you. You got in this email from the Va and I'm gonna give you a second to read this more closely. And what I would like for you to do is just summarize to me what this email is telling you.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000

> Ds logon will no longer work, and you have to do login.gov if you wanna access your the benefits, healthcare, etc.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000

> Okay. And I know that you use Ds log on right now. So as someone who's using Ds log on. When you read something like this, what's your reaction?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000

> My reaction is that the VA i continuing to vend out their services to private contractors. And and they're moving it out from under the Department of Defense.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000

> Okay. So you I sent maybe a little bit of frustration with with realizing that.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.000

> There's frustration there, and, I've tried to get a Login.gov account before, but they want you to do this authentication where you have a video with them. And I am just not interested in doing that.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.000

> Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So part of it is that your you're kind of like, oh, okay, they're contracting out to a private contractor. And then the other part of your reaction is actually to do with your experience with Login. Gov.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000

> Yeah. And also the familiarity with DS Logon. So that's something that I would use in the service to access different DoD websites it's just it's kind of frustrating with the change. And it's frustrating when you log on to VA.gov, and they are like 4 different options there.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000

> Yeah, okay, that makes total sense. So you've been using Ds log on for probably quite a while as well.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000

> I have. Yes.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:33.000

> Okay, yeah. So that makes sense. And then when you talked about your hesitancy with login.gov, and needing to maybe do a video, can you tell me a little bit more about your experience with login gov so far or your understanding?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000

> Well, it was probably a couple of years ago I was using Login.gov, attempting to use it. I was gonna apply for federal civilian jobs through U.S.A. Jobs, and that site uses Login.gov. But they wanted me to do this thing where you take a picture of your ID, or your scan your ID, and then, if for whatever reason they can't read it, then they want to do a video conference with you, a short video conference, to authenticate who you are. To me, that's that's just too intrusive. And I know they don't work for the government either, so I don't have a real high level of trust.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So it's not even just the hassle of having to do something like that. It's actually like you don't. You might not feel comfortable with having to do something like that.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000

> Yes.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000

> Yeah, that's really helpful. I'm gonna give you just a second to look at this email once more. Is there anything else that's jumping out at you?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000

> Well, it says it's a US government account. And this account will only work for VA digital tools.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:13.000

> Oh, yeah, okay. So the note says, if I want to use Login.gov for other sites I need to log out and log back in.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000

> So tell me more about you've kind of noted a couple of things the first one you said outload was secure US government account. What does that mean for you when it's saying got it?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000

> It makes it sound as if it's a government account. It resides on a government server.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000

> Okay, does that change how you feel at all about it? Based on what we were talking about?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000

> If it's true. Yes, it may. Yeah.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000

> Okay, but still not completely confident that that might. That is the case.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000

> No.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000

> Okay. And then you also picked up on VA digital tools. What is the digital tools mean to you?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000

> I assume the tools are the the different things I can do on the VA website. Or when I log into it, whether it's going to my healthy vet, whether it's filing a claim, checking the status of a claim, sending messages, refills, things like that. I assume that's what they mean by digital tools.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:34.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And the last thing that I think you mentioned was uhing to potentially log back out and log in again if you were gonna use this with other government websites. Can you tell me more about that note? What does what does that mean for you? How would you assume that this works?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:58.000

> What it sounds like to me is that it's even though it's a Login.gov account, that it's kind of somehow still piped into one channel at a time. In other words, you need to log out you, close down your browser to clear the cache, to allow it to go into another government site.

> So it's not like you could, if you're logged in there, you can go to all these different other government websites that require a login account?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000

> No, you need manually close and go back in and go through the site. It's not seamless. To have access to all the things you actually have to do it for each one. I don't know if DS Logon is that way or not, because I don't really use it that way.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:57.000

> Yeah, okay, that makes sense.So one thing that it does say in here is you're creating a VA only Login.gov account. What does that mean?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000

> It means I've got another account. I've got to manage. I use a password keeper already, I couldn't manage my passwords without it, and this is just another to manage. So VA login.gov, all other government agencies Login.gov.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000

> It's just another thing to remember and to keep track of? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So you know, if this was an email that you received as somebody who uses DS Logon right now, how do you think you would? What do you think you would do if you received this email?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000

> It doesn't seem like I have much of a choice. I'd have to comply with what it says, otherwise I lose access to what I want, the information I need digitally.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.000

> Right okay, so because you're using quite a few different VA services, you would feel like you're kind of forced to set up this login to account.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000

> Yeah.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000

> Okay. Alright. Well, that's been really helpful. I think what we'll do is we're gonna continue through this. So I'm gonna let you just click on. Go to va.gov to create an account. Alright, and then tell me what we're seeing here.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000

> That's the screen you see if you go to VA.gov right now.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000

> So it looks familiar? And we've got a couple of different options like you mentioned that at the start. Usually you would probably click on Ds log on here?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000

> Yes.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000

> And so based on the email that you just read, what would you do if you saw this screen?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000

> Well, I would go to DS Logon because [the email] said something like log on the DS Logon, and it'll help you set up your Login.gov. That's what I took from it.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000

> Yeah, okay, let's go ahead and do that. Okay. Perfect. So we're not gonna have you enter any information today. So you can just click login. We'll pretend like you put in your username and password. I'll just give this a second to load. Hmm, okay, sticking a little bit of time. It might be worth refreshing. The page I'm not sure how easy that is to do on the ipad. Yeah, or go back that works click login once more.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000

> Okay. So we're gonna stay on this page for a second. That's perfect. So what does this page telling you?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000

> It's just like jump linking me to Login.gov.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000

> Okay. And so if you were, you know, in this process of setting up a Login.gov account, what do you think you would do next? Probably continue to Login.gov.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000

> Okay, let's go ahead and click on that. Okay, so what does this screen here? If you can describe it to me?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:57.000

> Yeah, this is a typical new account set up screen. Or if you're an existing user, sign in with your credentials.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000

> Okay. And so what would you probably do on this page?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000

> Create an account.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000

> Okay, let's go ahead and click on. Create an account. Alright, and then for the next couple of screens, I'd like you to do the same thing. So just describe to me what you would do next, and then we'll talk about it. If you have any questions or anything comes up.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000

> Yeah, enter in my email address, leave the default language. I probably would not read and accept the Login.gov rules, but I would check the box and hit, continue.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:46.000

> Okay, let's go ahead and click that box, and then we can hit. Continue. Okay, what are we seeing on this screen?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000

> Yeah, this is you signed up with your email. And it's gonna basically send you an email to that account. So they know it's you.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000

> Okay, is that something that feels familiar for you? Yeah.

> Yeah, that's familiar.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000

> And right now, we're on your ipad. Is setting up an account like this. Something that you might do on your ipad.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000

> I might, but I'm more likely to do it on my desktop computer. Get to a large monitor there, that is just a lot easier to use.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. So if we were on your desktop computer, how would you check your email? Would you check that on your desktop computer as well?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000

> Yeah, I check it on there. I just open up my Microsoft outlook that has all my different email accounts going in there. And then I just look for the email in there.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000

> Okay, great. So for today, you can just go ahead and click check email. And then we'll continue on to this next screen. So we're just imagining that you're checking your email right now. And you receive something like this.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000

> So that's in my email. And then click on that, and then it probably redirect me back to the login website.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000

> Okay, great. So that sounds pretty straightforward for you. We can continue on. You can go ahead and click, confirm email, address. Alrighty! What are we seeing here?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000

> The dreaded password creation screen.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:32.000

> And why is it dreaded?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000

> Okay.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000

> So this is. This is where I can currently have my password keeper open, and I would have it generate a hard password for me, and then I would drop it in there and then make sure it met all the parameters, and save it and both on this screen and my password keeper.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000

> Okay, gotcha. So it sounds like you have a bit of a system for how you would do this.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000

> Yeah.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000

> Like I said, I can't remember my passwords, especially when they get so long, and the requirements are so varied.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000

> For sure, so you'd probably generate a really strong pass through, store it right away, and then you would continue on, okay, yeah, that's helpful.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000

> Yup.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000

> Okay, well, let's imagine you've done something like that. And then we'll go ahead and click, continue. So what are we seeing here?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.000

> Oh, good Lord! I'm seeing a lot of 2 factor authentication options.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000

> Okay? And you said, Good Lord! Can you tell me a little bit about how you're feeling when you see a page like this?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:34.000

> There are a lot of them, and my only my only question would be – so I use a 2 factor authentication to login, and most websites nowadays it'll generate the code and I punch it in. I got away from the text messaging, that works great on my computer and my laptop. But the mobile apps, pardon my language, they suck. Because even if you were to select face or touch, unlock a biometric option, it never works. It always ask you to enter stuff in again. So this is great for the website. And if I'm here I would just go with the authenticator application. It'll pop up with a QR code. I'll scan it, add it, and I'm good to go. But there's just a lot of options here, and I wonder how many people that's gonna confuse.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000

> Yeah, okay. Alright. So you're seeing like, almost too many options here. And then, from your experience like you've started to move towards using authentication app.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000

> Yeah. So you might use that, but might still have concerns about how that will work on mobile.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000

> Well, yeah, cause currently, it doesn't work on mobile.  I mean alright, I use both Android and iOS, and it is about a 70 to 30 doesn't work to work ratio. So it's just very sketchy.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000

> Okay. Gotcha, alrighty. So you have a little bit of hesitance. But also quite a bit of experience. Now with using 2 factor authentication. So let's go ahead and set up the authentication application. So you can go ahead and get ready to do that. Alright perfect. And then tell me what you're seeing on this screen.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000

> Yeah, so this is what I expect to see. You name it. And then I, on this instance I would open up my Microsoft authenticator app I would add a new one by clicking the add button, and then with scan, that QR code, and then it would add it to my index of 2 factor accounts. I have.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000

> Okay, perfect. So sounds familiar. You already have the application and you'd kind of know exactly what to do here.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000

> Yeah.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000

> That's perfect. We can go ahead and continue on. So we'll pretend, like you entered in that code from the application. And then we'll see this screen here. Alright! So what's the screen telling us?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000

> Well, I've added my first authentication method. But that green note up there with the check is puzzling, because I don't remember adding a text message to my account. [prototype error]

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000

> I'll be honest with you, I think that's just a symptom of this being an early prototype.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000

> I probably would add another method, which I would probably use my a text message on my cell phone. So I, yeah, that's what I can do here.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000

> Okay, yeah, okay, perfect. And then for today, we're just gonna skip that. But it sounds like you'd know what you would set up as as a second method, and you might actually go ahead and do that.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000

> Yup.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000

> That's perfect. Okay, we can click on skip for now and then let me know what you're saying next.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000

> Account set up complete, agree and continue.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000

> Alright. So before we continue on this screen, what does it mean by your account Setup is complete. If you can just tell me in your own words.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000

> I have a valid username, password and 2 factor authentication for security.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000

> Okay, great. And why is it saying that it's gonna share this information with the Va.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000

> Because it's only good for the any for VA access. Nothing else. But I don't know what sharing with the VA means. So it's obviously not the VA that houses this, if it's going to be shared with the VA?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000

> Right? Okay? So it's a little confusion, cause you're not sure, are you?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000

> Who do you think houses this? If that's if it's not the VA.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000

> I would imagine it's some third party contractor, whether it's whoever it is, is Google Services or Microsoft Azure. I'm not sure.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:04.000

> Okay, Gotcha. And then, if we clicked, agree and continue, what are you expecting to see next?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000

> They probably sign me out of Login.gov, and take me to like a main home screen.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000

> And when you say a main home screen, can you tell me what kind of website you're imagining?

> Well, I hope it would redirect me back to a VA website. That's what I would hope.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000

> Okay, alrighty. So let's click on agree and continue, and we'll see what happens next. Okay. So before we read this too closely, what kind of website does it look like we're on right now?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000

> Looks like it's the VA.gov website.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000

> Okay, so sounds kind of what you were expecting to find.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000

> Yeah.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000

> Okay. And we're seeing something kind of pop up here. I'm just gonna we're just gonna leave that for a second. And I wanna just reflect on what you've just done. So this might feel a little repetitive. But can you tell me what we've just done?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000

> So we we basically went soup to nuts. Looking at all the options to log into the VA government website, came to a screen that had the 4 options. I selected Ds Log on, which is what I would usually do, then it it took me to a 'you need to set up a new account because the VA is eliminating the Ds log on' So you need to do a Login.gov. You need to go through and set that account up, go through the authentication, verify your email, and then, after it's done all that and you verified everything, then it's gonna take you to the logged in version of the website.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000

> My only not my question. So at the very beginning, when we're given those 4 options to log on if we're getting rid of DS Lon, and I click on Ds log on, do I need to go to another screen telling me we're getting rid of Ds Login, and I need to make a Login.gov account? Because it seems like there could be a note right there on that 4 option page if you click on Ds log on you, you will be asked to create a login.gov account. It seems that it puts in an extra click and to me, it's okay, but a lot of people might get hung up at that part.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:41.000

> Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. Why do you think that like, was there any purpose of signing into Dslog on first?

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000

> Nope. There was no purpose at all [to signing into DS Logon first].

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.000

> Okay, yeah, okay, that makes sense. So you're almost imagining, like, why didn't I just go straight to login.gov, and set up the account if that's what I have to do.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000

> Correct. Yup, yup.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000

> Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. And your summary is really helpful. So I think we'll continue on now. So we're looking at this screen. I'll give you a second to read this more closely.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000

> Okay, so the last part of that. The second sentence you'll need to go back to Login.gov to verify your identity, if you want to use Login.gov for other accounts. So I can't use. Well, can I? I guess I'm not really clear what that means.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. You're not exactly sure what you can use Login.gov for and what you can't?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000

> Right, yeah.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000

> Okay, and what about verify your identity? What does that mean? What do you think that entails?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000

> I would assume... Well, I don't really know. That's kind of nebulous, I mean, do I need to log in to something? Do I need to provide a social security number, date of birth? Do I need to do another email check? I mean, I really don't know what it means.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000

> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So it seems like it's pretty clear we've set up a login Gov account. We signed in with the login.gov account, and we are on va.gov right now. But it's not necessarily clear where else you could or couldn't use the Login Gov account. And then also what it means by verifying your identity.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000

> Right.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000

> Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. So let's imagine that now you know we've signed in with login. Gov. And you wanted to go and complete one of those tasks that you regularly do. So. Let's say, refill your prescription like you just did recently. What would you do next on this screen?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000

> Yeah, close this out.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000

> Okay.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000

> I would click on my help.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000

> Okay, yeah, perfect. So like, I said at the start, not everything's gonna work. When you click it. So that's perfect. For now but it seems like it was pretty easy for you to close the pop up and kind of move on would you have any hesitation about being able to now complete Those regular tasks that you used to do when you signed in with the login. Gov?

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000

> No!

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000

> Still, seems like you'd be able to continue and use the Va website just like you used to?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000

> Right.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense alright. So we've answered quite a lot of my questions so far. The next thing I'm gonna have you do is just click anywhere in that dark part of the top bar on the screen, and we're gonna imagine that you've now signed out. Okay. So it's been a couple of weeks since you set up this login.gov account to use with the Va. You've signed out. And and today you're coming back online because you needed to. Let's say you needed to refill a different prescription, so can you show me how you would sign in to start?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000

> Well, I since I know what it's gonna do, I would click on refill and track your prescriptions, and it would just ask me to log in anyhow. Yeah.

> Gotcha. Okay? So you'd go straight for the task that makes sense.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000

> Yeah.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000

> For today. I'm gonna have you click sign in up in the top right corner just because we can't click on everything on this on this yet. But that's perfect. You click sign in there. Okay? And so now we're seeing the sign in screen. And how are we gonna choose to sign in today?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000

> Not DS Logon, so I click on Login.gov.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000

> Okay. And how come you're saying, not Ds log on?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000

> Because they're going to take me to another screen and tell me to set up and Login.gov account, and I already have one.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000

> Alright. So based on the previous experience, you would say, like, I guess I'm not supposed to use that anymore I'll use the Login Gov. Account.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:08.000

> Right, and maybe a note here kind of saying, if you previously established the login.gov account, do not select this option.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So let's click on login. gov and we'll go ahead and pretend like we're signing in with Login. We're not gonna put information in, but go ahead.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000

> Yeah, enter my username or my email address, my password and then click sign in.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's click on sign in.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000

> Alright, and then we're seeing some more information on this page.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:34:07.000

> So I'm gonna just start by giving you some time to read this.  So first of all, just how, what's your reaction when you're reading this here?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000

> Why? I mean, I'm going to VA.gov. I am not trying to go to any other government website. I mean the interesting thing about the DS log on, and I'll use this as a reference point, there was a link I could click that would show you can use DS Logon to log into all these government websites, it would list them all with all the hyperlinks. If I was on it on a page like that, and I wanted to go another one, then I'd expect this to pop up.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000

> Right, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So you're not currently like trying to go onto another government website.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000

> Correct.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000

> So this feels kind of out of place. Okay? And if it was, let's say that you wanted to go to another government website.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:30.000

> And you wanted to see this pop up maybe when you tried to access that website, what do you think it would be asking you to do in order to get access to that to that next government website...

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000

> Probably what the lower left button says verify your identity on Login.gov.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000

> Okay. We've talked about that a little bit throughout our conversation. But what would that mean if you can kinda describe to me what you'd expect to do?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000

> So I think I would expect to do a process very similar to the login.gov for the VA. But it sounds like I'd set up an entirely new Login.gov account for another government or entity? Or can I use the same credentials? And then I just need to verify my identity. And I'm not really clear what that means.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000

> Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So based on what you've done already with the Va, you might expect that you have to do something similar with the next government website.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:24.000

> But then that gets a little complicated with like, am I setting up another login.gov account?

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Is there anything else that's jumping out to you as you read this?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:59.000

> Once your identity has been verified, you can use your login.com account to not only va digital tools, but also manage other government benefits.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000

> Hmm! That I'm reading that I'm kind of. There seems to be contradictory, messaging seems like I need a Login.gov account for the VA. Specifically to do VA things.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:28.000

> Use VA digital tools, but then here it says, it appears to say, if you verify your identity again, you cannot add only use login for the VA. But you can use it for these other things. That's what I'm taking from there.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000

> Yeah, and when you're saying it's contradictory, I think I'm following along. So does it feel like it's contradictory to what you were previously told or did?

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000

> Because the messaging behind signing in for Login.gov was that it was just for the VA digital only tools. And you needed to verify your identity for all these other things, and I have not yet established whether verifying my identity means I can use the same credentials, and I just need to show you a state issued id or if I have to set up a whole new credentials. So that part there is kind of fuzzy.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000

> Right, and because that parts a little fuzzy, it's almost hard to understand the rest of the message?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000

> So this is like the 'aha!' moment. So why didn't you just ask me to do the whole thing at the beginning? And we could just dispense with all these little Va digital tools only not be a digital dissolving whatever?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:40.000

> Yeah, that makes a lot of sense I think that's been really, really helpful to hear how you've kind of noted throughout the process, like where things might be different.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:39:01.000

> I'm curious, so at the very beginning, when we started talking about login.gov, we talked about maybe an apprehension to doing something like remote video where you have to show your Id, or if felt a little bit intrusive, I think is how you described it does this right? Here where it's saying you need these things to verify your identity. Does it feel like you're going to need to do something like that?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000

> Yup. It does!

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000

> Okay, okay? And I'm curious. So obviously, that's happening remotely you're on a call. Maybe like this, it sounds like it's how you're imagining it. And you're showing somebody your Id, or you're taking a picture of your Id. Would that process feel any different if you were doing it in person with someone?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000

> Yeah, I mean, cause I guess that's kind of how I'm used to doing those types of things is in person.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000

> Yeah, okay, does it feel less intrusive for you? Or maybe just more familiar.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000

> Probably just more familiar.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:02.000

> Okay. So if there was an option for you to do something like, verify your identity in person, that might be something that you're more interested in rather than doing it online.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000

> Yeah, I mean, it's depending on where am I going to do it? The thing with this is – you take it to take a picture of your state ID and if the for some reason, when you submit the email to them with the attachment, or however you send it to them, if the text isn't rendable, and that's when you get the feedback, that you need to get on a call with us to, so we can do it in person. So I mean all 3 of those things to verify my identity so that's kind of sounds like the same path. It's going down.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000

> Okay. So from your experience, you would first have to maybe take a picture or enter these things in. And then, if they couldn't access it, or for whatever reason, then, you might have to get on a call with somebody.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000

> Correct.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000

> Okay. Gotcha. At the start, we didn't ask you to verify your identity. We let you set up the login gov account, and then later on, we're asking, you know, if you want to verify your identity, you can access other government websites, and you noted that you know may why didn't they just kind of ask me to do this from the beginning. Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:49.000

> Well, to me it seems it's almost like a switch and bait, because all the messaging upfront was okay, 'You need to set up this account to use VA digital tools, and it's only good for that purpose.' Then we go through this entire – call it elongated, whatever for some people it's longer than others – setup process, and then you go back to, it looks like, the first time I've freshly logged into the VA.gov website. And then it's like, 'Oh, by the way, you could do this.'

> So this is actually where I initially gave up on this a while back, was what I got to this point, and they couldn't read my ID. I said, forget it. I just I don't have time for it.

> So it seems like you're doing twice the effort for the same result. But you've also planted a seat in someone's mind that Login.gov is only good for the VA digital tools.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000

> Yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So it's like, maybe over complicating things a little bit. And also I think you use the term switch in bait. So we've kind of changed what we're saying. It feels like on the screen. From what we said previously, yeah, that's really, really helpful.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000

> Yup correct. Right.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:01.000

> What if you know this process started from your interaction with the VA. So let's say you were going into a Va healthcare facility, and someone said, You know you need to set up a login.gov account, we can do it right now, and we can check your ID. What would your reaction be? And you know we have to be a little bit hypothetical here. But what do you think you would realistically respond if someone had offered you?

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:32.000

> Oh, that'd be great, especially if you had a self service terminal or something on the way into the clinic or the hospital or what not and you could go through the process there. But that, especially when you're talking about a Veteran population that may not be as savvy with technology, I'm somewhat savvy but you're going to have a lot of people who will really struggle getting to this point.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000

> Okay. Gotcha. So you think it would maybe avoid some of the like technical complications of having to try this on your own.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000

> Correct.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. Well, that's been really helpful. I don't know if there's anything else on this screen that that I needed to ask you about. But is there anything else you wanted to talk about here?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000

> No, no, that's pretty straightforward.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000

> Okay. Great. Well, you can go ahead and stop sharing your screen hopefully that's simple enough on zoom. Yeah, perfect. There we go. So we're almost finished. So we're about to wrap up. It sounds like you had a pretty good understanding of what we were trying to do today. And as a DSL user, it was really interesting to understand how you might react to receiving an email like that. I think I've covered, you know, all my questions for today. But was there anything else that you wanted to add about anything we talked about?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000

> No, not really. I mean, I think it's moving in the right direction. I just say keep the messaging as simple as possible, because you have to develop these htings for the person who has the smallest knowledge base.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000

> For sure. Yeah, yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. And it's really helpful to know where things have gotten overly complicated or could have been a little bit more simple. So I appreciate that a lot from our conversation. Well, I think those are all my questions. And did you? Wanna did you have any other questions for me?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000

> No, no, I don't. Pretty straightforward. I appreciate the time.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:37.000

> Okay. Well, I appreciate your time. It's been really helpful, like I said we could not do the work that we do without getting feedback. And you know, having these conversations with Veterans like yourself. So been really helpful, there's a couple of things I wanted to cover before we wrap up. So Perigean, the folks who set up this interview they're going to send you a thank you note after the interviews finished, and it's just going to have a little blurb which you're welcome to share with other veterans if they wanted to get involved in something like this. And then they're also going to be the ones that manage your payment. So if you have any questions about that, you just let them know.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000

> I also wanted to just kind of clear up. I know you're using Dslog on right now to sign in with the Va. And everything that we were looking at right now is not real. So you can continue to access your VA services as you have been. And yeah, I think that's everything. Thank you so much again.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000

> Okay, yeah, I appreciate those comments. Thank you.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.000

> Yeah, thanks. You too.
