### Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000

> Okay, perfect. So I have started the recording. And I just wanna confirm that you're comfortable. If I record my screen and the audio as we talk to me.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000

> Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000

> Okay, okay, perfect. And throughout the session if you can't hear me or there's any issues with volume again, you just let me know. Okay. I can always start yelling a little bit alright.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000

> Very good. Okay.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000

> So let's start by learning a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA, and particularly with some of our online services. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000

> I was drafted 1968. I went to OCS and became an officer and led a combat infiltrate platoon in Vietnam, 70 and 71. I left used the GI bill to go to school and I didn't know I had PTSD until some 25 years after the war. My wife had a traumatic brain injury, and I became the principal caregiver, and so the stress from that, plus the PTSD, kind of did me in. And so I had to seek help and I went out on disability. So I guess it's since 2009 I've been involved with the VA.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000

> Okay, thank you. That's really helpful. So it sounds like you've been a veteran for a couple of years now, and you were in the service for a while. That's helpful to know a little bit more about your background and your experience. And what about going online? When did you start going online to manage things like your healthcare, for example, with the VA.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.000

> I was reluctant. I didn't like to do Zoom, and I've only recently been doing Zoom recent last 4-5 months. But I could go online to order my prescription and to have comments to my primary physician and other people at the VA Hospital in XXXX. So, and then the check at my appointments and things like that. But not have meetings like this. I have had conferences over the phone with people at the VA Hospital. That's the extent of it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000

> Okay, okay, so a little bit of reluctance about starting to do some of these things online. But you do have some experience messaging your doctor and doing things like that. And what about signing in? We talked a little bit about that when you joined, about issues you have. Do you want to tell me a little bit more about that?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000

> For some reason I cannot use the recommended sign in. I'm not even sure is that DS? I think it's called... Is that what they recommend? But I use ID.me and that's fine.

> I have a something that keeps all of my passwords together. So I go there. I type in ID and make sure. Remind me what the password is, and then that works fine. So I use that to go on the the VA website.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And so it's sounds like, ID.me is working well for you, and particularly because you can save your password inside that password manager.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000

> Yes, yes.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000

> And when you joined you said that you tried to set up login.gov. Do you think login.gov is the one you're trying to think of right now? You, said Ds. But I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000

> Boy, I'm not really sure. I'm not that tech savvy.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000

> Yeah, that's okay. I think throughout our conversation saying, 'I don't know' is a perfectly good answer for me. It's helpful to know that it's not always easy to remember all the different options right?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000

> Yeah.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000

> And so usually, when you go and sign in, you mentioned that you use the mobile app. Is that usually how you sign in? Or do you use your computer?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000

> Yeah. Oh, yeah. I use it on my phone and that's really helpful. I have the app. It just says VA. And then I tap that, and then they ask me enter the password and stuff, my username.

> That was the other thing. When I tried to use the DS sign in or whatever it's called, I couldn't figure out what my username was, what username I used. And so that's difficult. I mean it's fine.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000

> Okay. So you know, you probably have DS setup. But you're not exactly sure what your username is. But so that's why you've been using ID.me. Okay, gotcha.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000

> Yes, yes, yes, oh wait no! Here's what happened. They told me, my username. Okay, then I tried to get the the password, and I couldn't figure it out. Then they asked me 3 questions. What was the name of your first boyfriend or girlfriend, and what street did your best friend live on when you were growing up? I thought I knew all the answers. When I plugged them in, they were rejected. So that was the other thing. Yeah.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000

> Okay, okay. So you had trouble kind of recovering your account.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000

> Yes, yes. So I gave up. Yeah.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000

> Okay. And is that around the time when you set up ID.me?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000

> No, it's just morning this morning when yeah, I got the call – were you the one that contacted me?  So I thought let me try it, let me see if I can do it, and found out that I could not [access DS Logon].

> Gotcha. Okay, okay. So you've been using ID.me it sounds like for a little while now, and you're actually not able to get into your Ds logon account right now.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000

> That's correct.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.000

> Okay, that's really helpful. It's really helpful to understand what we're what you're using and what your perspective is. Right now, I think what we'll do next is we're gonna start to look at that prototype that I mentioned. Okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on Zoom so I'll send that right now. Do you see that coming up on your side?

[sending link]

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000

> Healthcare disability. Education. Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. I've seen this before. I think I have.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000

> Okay, perfect. So we're gonna keep that website up. And then I, what I want you to try and do is we're gonna share your screen. Is that something you've done before?

[troubleshooting screen share]

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000

> Yeah, perfect. Alright. So now I'm looking at the VA website, and you're looking at the VA website. Okay?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000

> Okay. Yeah.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000

> Alrighty. So you said this looked familiar to you. Is this something that you would use when you're going online to do stuff like message your doctor?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:09.000

> I think I have, or something similar to this. Download medical records, request. Yeah. The DD214. The other stuff I already have, I mean, are already got. My disability cost my healthcare is on track, I mean, so. But yeah, the records is the ones I've used recently yeah, I don't know. A couple of months ago. Get your VA Medical records. I was having a I'm having acupuncture done at the VA Hospital. I'm also getting massage done, all paid for by the VA. And I had some X-rays done on my upper upper back and neck, and then my lower back, and what I want us to do is have them available for the acupuncturist and for the masseuse is that a guy who yeah, and so that's... this is where I went to, or something similar to this, to request it, and they mailed me out. A film type thing, or whatever like it, like in an X-ray form. And yeah, so I've used this before. Yes.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000

> Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So it sounds like you're familiar with this website, especially with the records. Let's let's go ahead and scroll up a little bit on this website. So if we can see the top of the screen. Yeah, that's perfect. Alrighty! So for today, what we're gonna do is we're gonna imagine that you come online because you wanted to access your records.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000

> Okay. And so the first thing that you decide to do is sign in. So we're gonna click, yeah, perfect. So it looks like you found the sign in quite quickly. And then we're gonna stay on this page for a second. Is this looking familiar to you?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.000

> Yeah, yeah, this is the one I tried to go on today. I use the ID.me all the time. But then, you see below it says, DS log on. That's where I had my problems.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000

> Right? Okay. So you've had issues with Ds log on. But you at least can get into all the Va. Stuff with ID.me right now.

> Oh, yeah, my ID.me and probably I haven't tried the other 2. My health. That probably looks something like something I could do. I don't know.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000

> Okay. Gotcha. Well for today, I'm gonna throw a little bit of a curveball at you. We're gonna imagine that you're signing in with Ds log on right now. Okay, I know Dslagon's not working well for you, so we'll have to use a little bit of an imagination. But we're going to click on Ds log on.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000

> Perfect, so we're not gonna enter any information in today. So you can just click login. And we're gonna sit on this page now. So before we click anything, I'm gonna give you a second to read this screen. Okay?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000

> Okay, I read, I saw something like this today. Okay.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000

> Okay, yeah, tell me more about that. So this looks familiar to you?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000

> Yeah, I had where they said they wanted to verify my identity. And they asked me whole bunch of things to include my social security number. And so I know I provided the information at least twice, and it still can't go through.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000

> And so was that when you were trying to get access to your Ds logon account, okay? Alright. So this looks kind of familiar. And what what is this telling you? On this screen that we're looking at right now. What's the message it's trying to get across?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:39.000

> To create the sign in to get into the account, to take advantage of what's available on the website.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000

> Okay. So they want you to be able to get into your account. So you can go onto the website and do whatever you need to do.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000

> Yeah, sure. Be it ordering medication, checking with your main provider, whatever.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. And what are these different buttons? So what are the options it's giving you? Can you describe those to me?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:11.000

> Well, the 2 at the bottom. You can create a new one if you don't have an account, and then continue with your DS Logon for now, and I tried both. I think, yeah, I tried both. They told me that though the email address that I gave already is being used. So that's what I knew that I must have signed up before.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000

> Okay, Gotcha. And when you say they told you who was telling you this?

> Oh, you know, the computer messages.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000

> Okay, yeah, okay, that makes sense. And if we were gonna click, create login.gov account. What would you expect to happen next?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000

> Go to another link, and they'll ask me my name, my address, my phone number, my years of service, maybe my rank, what branch of service, and possibly where I've gotten any past treatments, my hospital.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000

> Okay, yeah. So some information about you as a Veteran and some of your, maybe your medical history?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000

> Yes, yes.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000

> Okay. And so we're just gonna look at this a little more closely now. So the first line it says, DSL, we'll stop working for VA Digital tools soon. What does that mean?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:46.000

> Good question. I have no idea what a VA digital tool is to be honest with you, I mean I would be thinking it's a mouse that I'm moving around and being able to touch a link and press the button. I don't know.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000

> Okay, okay, that's a fair answer. So it's not clear what VA digital tools is.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000

> What about the part that says DS Logon will stop working soon. What does that mean?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000

> To be honest, I don't know. I really don't know. Yeah, I don't know.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:44.000

> That's okay. And what if this said ID.me will stop working for VA digital tools soon. How would you react to something if it said ID.me will stop working soon?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000

> I would want to contact someone in authority and say what the hell is going on here. I mean, why are you ending it? Why are you causing such anxiety to us poor Veterans?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000

> So you'd be frustrated. Maybe a little bit concerned.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000

> Yes, yes, very much so.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:24.000

>  And you said you'd want to contact someone so if you were looking at this screen and it said something like, ID.me will stop working soon. How would you go and contact somebody, or figure out who to contact?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:36.000

> I would call the my doctor, my main provider, and they've been pretty good about responding to questions I had, and problems, and then they would get back to me on the phone. I imagine that they would be trying to get in touch with someone who knows more than just medical stuff, cause you know, this is technical. It's IT, right?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000

> Okay. So your first idea would be to call your medical team who you have a closer relationship with. And you'd hope maybe they could get more information.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000

> Yes, exactly. Exactly.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000

> Yeah, okay, that makes sense and and I do, wanna reassure you, it's not saying that ID.me will stop working soon, so I'll use some hypotheticals.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000

> Sure!

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000

> Okay, so what about at the bottom? It says, 'note: this account will only work for Va digital tools. in the future You may need to to verify your identity again, to use login.gov on other government websites. 

> So yeah, me, I'm trying to figure out what they're saying. Oh, yeah. Well, I guess it looks like in the future they're gonna have to get my social security number again, my address, and all that pertinent information, and I have no problem with that.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000

> Yeah, okay, so verifying your identity means that they're gonna need your social security number and maybe your address. So a little bit of information about you.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000

> Yes, right. I just hope they don't ask me who was the name of your girlfriend when you were a kid, cause you know I gave him the name, but they didn't like it.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000

> Yeah, that's that's a tough question. So it'll ask you for some information. And then why is it saying that this account is only going to work for the Va until you give them that information. Do you know what that's about?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000

> I think it's limited to the VA. No other government agency, or any private agency.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000

> So you could only use this account for the VA?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000

> Yes, right.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000

> And is there any way for you to use this for another government agency?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:32.000

> No, and I can't think of any other government agency that I would be trying to use it for.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000

> So even if it was just for the Va, you would, that would be okay if you were able to set up the account because you really just need it for the Va, yeah, okay, that's helpful. Next, we're gonna click on create login.gov account. Okay, so we're gonna find that link. Yeah, that's perfect. So before we move on again, I'm not gonna make you enter any information today. This is just kind of like a pretend picture of the website.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000

> So what are we looking at right now?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000

> This is creating an account for the first time users. I would think. Add an email address, they want you to create a password and then sign in at the very bottom, says, create an account. Oh, so you have 2 options. One is, if you are already a member, you can sign in, and if you're not, you can create an account.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:43.000

> Gotcha. Okay, that's perfect. So if we're creating an account today, let's go ahead and continue, and I'll let you click what you would choose if you were going to create an account.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000

> You want me to fill in the details or not?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000

> No, you don't need to fill them in.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000

> Yeah, we'll just pretend like you fill them in, and then you can go ahead.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000

> Okay, so I wanna create an account. I'll get it.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000

> Yeah, that's perfect.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:02.000

> Okay. Then I enter my email address. I would ask for English as my default and then continue.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000

> Yeah, that's perfect.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:13.000

> Then go and check my email and type whatever link that they're asking me to check. Follow and continue, okay. And I check email. Okay, let's confirm your email. Okay, thanks for submitting your email address. Please click the link. Let's say I've done that, confirm email address.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000

> Okay. So we'll stay on this page now for just a moment. So that's that's pretty straightforward so far, you've put in your email address. Yeah, right? Then you got sent an email and you clicked on a link, and then you continued, if you were doing something like this, you were setting up an account on your computer, would where would you check your email, how would you check that? Would you open up your phone? Would you? Yeah?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000

> I have these little boxes at the very top of my laptop computer. So just go back to the first one, and then, you know, travel along.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000

> Gotcha. That's helpful. We can continue so same thing you were doing before. Just let me know what you'd be doing next on this page.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000

> I would create a password which I use all over the place. I'm sorry. I just use the same password. I shouldn't. So I put that in, can I hit continue?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000

> Yes, you can.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000

> Now, here's the authentication. Okay, face or touch unlock. They have face? I didn't know that. Wow! I didn't know that. I mean, I've got the phone one from my cell phone.

> Security key, I don't like using them. I'm not a government employee, I don't like the authentication application. I got that on my cell phone. I never use it.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000

> Text or voice message, yeah, I do that all the time. Yeah. So that's what I would do.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:27.000

> Okay, okay. So that was, yeah, that was really helpful. So you went down the list and you kind of felt like text or voice message was the best option for you.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000

> Yes, yes, exactly. Hit continue.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000

> Okay, yeah, I think it might actually need to click text or voice message first. So if you click, yeah, let's try clicking that.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000

> Click, okay, I'll click that. Okay. Got it alright.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000

> Yeah. Continue. Yup. Alright. Yeah, perfect, and then we'll go down and click, continue perfect alright, and then let me know what you're seeing here.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000

> Send your security code via text. I'm not sure I know what a security code is. And phone number, yeah, the phone number. I would type in my phone number. Oh, then they'd send me the text message, and then I would have to remember that 6 digit number, and I'm thinking, man, I'm so thankful my memory is not shot because I can remember it for maybe 30 seconds, maybe 20 seconds and transfer it.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000

> Okay. Gotcha alright. So you put your phone number in. You would choose text, message, and then you get sent that probably 6 digit code, and you'd have to remember it for enough amount of time that you can enter it in.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000

> Yes.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000

> Okay, that's makes sense. So let's click. Send code we'll pretend like you got sent this this code and you typed it in. Okay. Perfect. Alright!

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000

> Okay. I'll submit it. You got the first. Yeah, it says, the second method. I have a backup, I guess it would have to be my email.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000

> Okay, that's what you would choose. Yeah.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:05.000

> Send it to my email. I'd rather not get a phone call.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000

> So you know, send it to my email.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000

> Okay, so that's what you would hope to choose for your other method. So for today, we're gonna yeah. We're gonna oh, we're gonna actually skip creating, adding another method.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000

> So we'll continue on as if we skipped that. Okay. So now we're on. Now we're on the screen? What does this screen telling us?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000

> Your account set up this complete, alright, and do you want me to agree and continue?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000

> Before we do that, let's go back. If you're able to click back, you can even do it on the keyboard. If you click the back button. Oh, that's perfect! There you go alright. So on this screen, it said, your account setup is complete. It felt like that, was pretty straightforward for you. It does say something on there that I wanted to ask you about, so it says we'll share this information with the Va. Why do you think they're sharing the information with the Va.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:14.000

> Oh, okay. You know, I was under the mistaken idea that this was the VA that I was working on? And it's not. It is, I guess, a group that is working either for or in connection with the VA. Is that correct?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000

> Gotcha, you know, I'm gonna be annoying person right now. I'm not gonna answer your question just yet, but I'll answer all the questions at the end.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000

> When I get you on the witness stand, I'm gonna cross examine. Haha.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000

> Yeah, I'll definitely make sure there's time at the end. Haha. So reading that you actually kind of realized, oh, maybe I haven't been on the VA website this whole time? I didn't realize that. Yeah, that's helpful.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000

> Yeah, yeah.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000

> Alright. Well, let's go ahead and click, agree and continue. Okay? And then before we click anything on this screen, I just wanna give you a second to read what you're seeing here.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:28.000

> Okay. What? I don't know which other government websites. I really don't know what that would be for – well, let's say I need to contact the Attorney General or the Department of Defense. I guess I could use that information.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000

> I've been hacked several times, and so I've been in touch with the Attorney General's office, and DoD to no avail. It couldn't get the money back. But in any case, yeah maybe that's what it's for.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000

> Okay, so you have some idea of what the government websites might be. But it's not super clear?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000

> Yes, it's not. But yeah.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000

> Yeah, okay, why is it telling you that you've signed in with login.gov.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:39.000

> Because there are at least 3 other ways to sign in, and I'd imagine each one is independent of the other. And so they're trying to show that you're in login.gov, you're not in ID.me or DS or whatever the others were.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:56.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. And before we got to this screen we went through all those other ones where you were putting in your email, and you were verifying your email. and you chose to get a text message code and did all of that. What was that about? What were we doing before we got to this page?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000

> Oh, we're providing the pertinent information for me to use the tools.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000

> Okay, okay, so we're providing the information for you to use the tools. And what and what did you receive at the end of providing all that information?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000

> Assurance that it would be shared with the VA website, and then I could sign in and take care of business.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And then we see this link here that says, 'Learn more about verifying your identity with login.gov' What would you expect to see if you clicked on that link?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000

> If I need to make any changes or improvements. And just to see what I've already done.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000

> Okay, yeah. Gotcha. So it would tell you a little bit about what you've done, and then what you might need to change or improve.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000

> Yes, yes.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:30.000

> Okay, Gotcha, and you know why, when we first started this process, we talked about how you were coming on to the Va website so that you could access your records if you wanted to access your records. Now, do you know what you would do? So what would be the next step you take?

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:11.000

> Okay. Let's see my VA, my VA. Or my health. I'll go to one of those and try to try to see you know what I can that way.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000

> Yeah, okay, and when we see this white box popping up, kind of in the middle of the screen, if you wanted to, if you wanted to get out of that box, how would you do that?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000

> Hit close.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's do that. Next, let's click close.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000

> Alright out of there, claims and appeals, you know. I got a 100% disability for having PTSD. And then a 10% hearing loss from explosions. So 10%. And then a 100%. And so there's no nothing for me to claim or repeat. Healthcare is yeah. I would definitely when you use healthcare, send the secure, yeah, I've done that matter of fact, I sent a message today to Dr. He told me yesterday or 2 days ago I didn't read the message until today that they're not going to, recommended chiropractor for my back because of my aorta, and they don't want to apply pressure down below so anyway, i've used this message today, just a few hours ago. And you know I'm always I'm always getting notices about my appointments. So, if yeah, and I have it for an hour. So that's even better. And again, yeah, so yeah, I would use this information to help me.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000

> Yeah, that's that makes sense. Okay, so this is looking like certain tasks that that you actually have a lot of familiarity with, especially with your healthcare tasks. Right, when when you're doing a lot of these healthcare tasks like your messaging with your doctor today, are you on the my healthy vet? That website?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000

> I used a VA link. I'm not sure, you know.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000

> Yeah, that's okay.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000

> [takes out phone to show camera] Can you see you see where it says? I don't know if you can see it.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000

> I can't really see it. I think you're showing me the VA app right?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000

> Yes, it says VA yeah, okay. I just click it. And now it says the touch ID for VA, US Department of Veterans Affairs, signing me in and good afternoon, XXXX. Claims and appeals. Health care, letters, payments, and so I already had. That's what I do right. I go on my website here, my cell phone and I've I've got all the information right here.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So you find the app works pretty well for you, especially with ID.me. Yeah, that's really helpful. So you've answered a lot of my questions already. There's a couple more things I wanted to ask you about. So one we're going to do next is just click at the top of the screen in that dark part of the screen Just click anywhere up there. Yeah, that works. And see if that lets us go.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000

> It says, the transcript from this meeting may be saved and shared with apps and others by participants, with relevant permissions based on the settings. Yeah, that's fine. No problem.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000

> Awesome. So I think that might have been from the zoom window. So if we're are you back, we're back on this Va website. I just wanna make sure. Yeah, okay, perfect. So let's click at the top kind of just above where your pointer is right now, just below that. Right below that. Why don't we click where it says, Va, you see where it says, Va, yeah, that's perfect. Right there. There we go! Alrighty. So we've just went through a number of different steps to set up an account right. We were on the Va. Website at just now. We're gonna imagine that we've signed out. Okay. So we finished doing whatever we were gonna do, and we signed out and a couple of weeks go by. So now it's May and we're ready to sign into it to the Va. Because we need to do something else right? So what will we do?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000

> What will we do next? To sign in?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000

> I would hit the sign in Button.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000

> Perfect. Let's go ahead and do that.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:55.000

> Alright, and then, knowing me, I go ID.me. And my health vet, I think I've used that before. But how should I try that?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000

> Well, for now let's just stay on this page for a second. So ID.me, we know, is familiar. My healthy vet you might have tried before, and then just now we set up a new account in this scenario. What type of account did we set up?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000

> Login.gov.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000

> Okay. And why do you think we set up that account?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000

> It's the first one. The more the preferable one. I would think.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000

> Yeah. Why do you think it's preferable? What made you think that?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:42.000

> I think it has closer ties to the Government, and they've got it in the name, Gov. I don't know. Not sure.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000

> Okay, so not really sure. But you know it's the first option, and that it probably, or might be, connected to the government. That's helpful. Okay? So if we were gonna sign in again today, it seemed like you were probably gonna choose id.me, is that right? Okay? And so right now, you've got ID.me and you also have Login.gov, in this scenario. And so why would you choose login.gov instead of ID.me?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000

> Well, we went through the whole process, and I figured, well, let me give you a shot, I mean, see if it works for me, and and if it didn't work I go right back to ID.me

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000

> So it's almost like you'll give it a try if it doesn't work otherwise I've got another option, and I'll keep using that. Okay.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000

> Yes, exactly. Exactly.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000

> Yeah. And if it didn't work this time, do you think from then on you'd use ID.me?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000

> Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000

> Yeah, yeah, that's helpful. Let's go ahead and click on login.gov. Which might feel a little bit confusing. But we're gonna try it out. And then we're gonna pretend like we're signing in. Okay? So we don't need to enter any information but what would you click next?

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000

> Sign in.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's click on that.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:39.000

> Alright. So I'm gonna give you a second to read this screen. Now.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:59.000

> Oh, I never noticed you could use it for social security and federal job applications. Yeah, okay. State Issued ID. I mentioned that would be my driver's license. Yeah, I mean, down below, you can see what we will need to verify your identity. Yeah. Okay. Alright. Good. Yeah. I'm finished.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:19.000

> Alright. Okay, that's helpful. So it sounded like you had a bit of a maybe a good reaction to seeing social security benefits.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000

> Yeah, I, mean, I've had to get try to get in touch with social security. I had to ask them to deduct more money out of my monthly payment, so I don't have to pay as much income tax, you know.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000

> Okay. And so what made it positive? Was it just that you recognize social security as something that you also use?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000

> Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.000

> Gotcha. Okay? And so right now, you know, in this scenario we've set up a login Gov account. Could you use your login.gov account tab account? Could you use your login.gov account to access social security?

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000

> That's what it says here. Yeah.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000

> And let's look at that first sentence. So it says you are using a Va. Only login.gov account. What does that mean?

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000

> Well, after reading about social security, I am not really sure I know what it means. Because reading about social security use, this doesn't make any sense that it's only for VA. I mean you're say you are using VA only login government account. I really don't know. I don't know.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000

> Yeah, that's okay. So it kind of feels like the first sentence is, maybe contradicting what it's saying about social security. Gotcha.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000

> Yes, the thing about social security. Yeah.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000

> Okay. That's really helpful. And then you notice that it says what you will need to verify your identity. It says you need a state issued Id. A social security number, and your phone number. So if I told you that right now we were gonna verify your identity, what would you expect to happen next?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000

> You would want my social security number, my address. I guess my driver's license number, which I don't – my son has memorized his – I don't. I'm lucky enough to know my social security number. But yeah, that's it, you know. And then my phone number.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000

> Okay, alright. So you would expect to enter some more information if you were, gonna verify your identity.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000

> Exactly. Yes.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000

> Okay. And why would you verify your identity?

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000

> There's been a request by someone in authority.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000

> So someone in authority is that somebody from the VA?

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:24.000

> Well, here would be someone working for the VA Login.gov people.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.000

> Okay. So login.gov is working for the Va. And they want you to verify your identity.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000

> Right working in coordination with the VA. Yes, yes.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000

> Gotcha gotcha. Okay? And so it feels like, does it feel like there's an option? Or it feels like you have to verify your identity.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:56.000

> If they don't recognize the first sign in, then they have to verify.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000

> Okay. So this is kind of like, something almost went wrong the first time. And so now we need you to verify your identity.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000

> Yes, yes, exactly right. Right.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:12.000

> Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. And when it says, No, thanks, I don't want to verify. Why do you think it's giving you that option?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000

> You know, that I don't know. I really don't know. It's like someone is afraid to give up informaiton. Lot of people are reluctant to give their social security numbers of the phone. And so maybe that's one of the reasons why they don't wanna do that.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000

> Gotcha. Okay? So they're trying to give somebody who might not feel comfortable sharing this information away out.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000

> Yes, yes, exactly right. Right.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000

> So let's say that you weren't comfortable sharing your social security number. And so you are, gonna choose? No, thanks. I don't want to verify?

> Should I choose that?

> What would happen if we clicked on that?

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000

> Well, then, they would try to find out other ways to determine if it's really me that is trying to get on this website. Otherwise I'm not really sure.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000

> Okay. Otherwise, we're not sure what would happen. Okay?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000

> Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:36.000

> So it feels like it's pretty important for you to at least either verify your identity or be able to do some sort of backup way of verifying your identity in order to keep doing things with the VA online.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000

> Yes, yes.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:46.000

> Okay. Okay. Gotcha. And when you set up your ID.me account – I can't remember how long ago you setup that acocunt. But do you remember that process of setting up the account?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000

> I didn't think it was that bad to be honest with you, and of course, definitely easier than what I tried to do today with the DS. And I was quite proud of myself being able to get it and get it done without much trouble.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000

> Yeah, that's great. Yeah. So it was a good feeling when you set it up. And it also wasn't as maybe as hard as you expected or definitely not as hard as what it was trying to okay.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.000

> Yes, yes, and I think I might be wrong, but I think I might be able to use ID.me on different sites that deal with government functions.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000

> Gotcha. Okay. And so what does that mean? You can use Id dot me at different sites. Can you tell me more about that?

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:47.000

> Yeah, well, like I said, maybe State Government, DMV, the court system, anything involving the Federal Government. Something like my congresswoman or senator. 

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Okay, gotcha. So let's pretend like you were. Gonna use your your id dot me and you you can go ahead. And actually, why don't we try and close this screen so you can come back to zoom? So somewhere on your screen, I think, towards the top it does it look like it says stop Sharing.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:40.000

> Alright at the top. Let's say it says, let's see. Stop sharing. Oh, yeah, okay, I just oh, okay, yeah.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000

> It might be like a red bar. There you go, perfect! Alright! So now we can just have a chat to finish up.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000

> So we're talking about ID.me, and how you might be able to use it for – you listed quite a few examples which was helpful. Let's say that you were going to try and use your ID.me account with the DMV. How would that work? Where would you start?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000

> Well, I would. Google DMV and then go to their website. And when they start asking for information, I would give my ID.me.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000

> Yeah, yeah, okay, perfect. That sounds kind of straightforward. We've answered a whole lot of my questions today.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:38.000

> If you are going to go, tell your grandk what you just did, or your grandkids. I think you said there was multiple downstairs. Yeah.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:50.000

> Yes, with the 3 year old, 5 year old, and then my son's wife had 2 previous kids that were 10 and 12. We got some cats, too, if you need a cat. How about a rooster or 2? We got roosters in the background.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:05.000

> Oh, awesome! Well, let's let's say you were gonna go to chat to your rooster after we finished, and you were, gonna tell them what we did today. How would you describe what we've just done?

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:18.000

> We went over, how easy or how difficult a website for the VA, maneuverability, was. This is geared towards Veterans who are using VA facilities. In my case it would, it's the hospital, and they want to ensure things are better and still working well, so that future Veterans will have a little bit easier.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. And it's been really helpful to have this conversation for those exact reasons.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:03.000

> And actually, the person who contacted you earlier who set up this interview. They're going to be the one that manages payment. So if you have any questions about payment. You can let her know, and Shannon's also gonna let you know she's gonna give you like a little bit of a blurb that you can share with other Veterans in case anybody else wanted to do something like what we've done today.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000

> But I think that's you've answered all my questions. I do want to give you a couple minutes in case you had any questions for me.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000

> No! But again I've had so much, so many good things. I had my colon cancer removed 7 years ago at the Va. Hospital. My cataract removed or fixed, whatever you want to call it, and I'm getting all my free medications, which is good, and I just learned I can get the – I've had 2 treatments already, I'm going back tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock, for a third treatment and about 2-3 weeks a massage. But this ain't like the regular massages. This is by Guy, who knows about the pain in my lower back and knows how to move that leg. So I just wanna say, get treatments at the Va. Because it really works. And it's helpful.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000

> That's great. That's really great to hear. I'm glad you've had that experience. Well, it's been lovely chatting with you today, and you know it was really helpful to hear your feedback, and also just to get to have a nice conversation with you.
