### Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000

> Alright! So are you comfortable with me recording this session today?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000

> I am.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000

> Okay, awesome. Thanks so much. Alrighty. So I've started the recording. I think we can get started if that sounds good for you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000

> Absolutely.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000

> Okay. So I think to start, I'd just like to learn a little bit more about your experience with the VA and some of our online services. Like I said, we're specifically interested in that sign in process.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000

> I'm gonna start by just asking a couple questions about tha so I know a little bit more about your experience. How long have you been a veteran? By the way?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000

> I served 25 years in the Air Force.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000

> Okay. And when did you become a Veteran?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000

> In August of 2020.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000

> Okay, so not too long ago. And how often have you been going online to manage your VA benefits or your healthcare?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000

> You know, I would say, maybe once every 6 months at this point. When I started it was probably weekly, but now that everything's pretty much been established from healthcare to dependent education benefits, things of that nature, it's really just maintenance and just checking in on things here and there.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. So you said about every 6 months or so right now, do you remember the last time that you signed in online?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000

> For the MHV, well, I signed in this morning just to kinda make sure I knew my password, and I'm on my work computer. And usually I use my personal device. But I mean this morning. But prior to then I would say, maybe 2 months ago.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000

> Okay. And you said you signed into MHV this morning.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000

> Yes.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000

> Is MHV usually the website that you're going to when you're trying to do something related to the VA.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000

> Yes, primarily, just because now I think it's just like setting up medical appointments so that's usually the one I go to the most.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000

> That makes sense. And do you remember when you're signing into MHV, Ccn you describe to me which way that you sign in?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000

> So I just go to the MHV. And then I use the MHV login.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000

> Do you remember why you set up the my healthy vet login, or how come that's the one you're deciding to use?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000

> I don't remember. Honestly, I think it may have just been the easiest to set up. Versus using the DS Logon, or I think ID.me is the other one maybe.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000

> Okay, yeah. Do you have any of the other sign-in setup as well?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000

> Yes, so the DSL I use for my retirement pay, and things like that. But for that, in order to login you have to have a much more extensive username and password. So I have that kind of stored in my personal laptop, and then Real ID [ID.me], I have that. But I just use it mainly, for, like those those companies that give military discounts a lot of times, they make you login to Real ID [ID.me]. So I don't really know why I chose MHV. I think it. I think it may have also been like a requirement if not mistaken. They wanted to create some sort of an account. When you enrollment VA Benefits.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000

> Okay, yeah, I think it's common for people when you're going through the like eligibility and enrollment process for healthcare to be introduced to MHV. So yeah, that makes sense. And that's helpful to understand why you're using different signs for different things.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000

> Is there anything else you wanted to share with me about that before we move on?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000

> No, I think that's it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000

> Okay, well, let's go ahead and get started. I mentioned that we were going to be using a prototype today. So what I'm gonna do is I'll send you a link in in the zoom chat here, and then I would just love if you can open this up on on your end and then I'm gonna ask you to share your screen with me. So if there's anything that you wanted to like, you know, minimize, or whatever on your screen. Now I'll give you a second to do that while I send the link in the chat. And then, once you got that link, are you familiar with sharing your screen?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000

> Yeah, I use teams every day. So I just gotta find it here on.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000

> Okay, yeah, on zoom, it's it's at the bottom, and it's green.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000

> Yeah, perfect.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000

> Okay, share screen. Got it here.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000

> So can you see that now?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000

> Yeah, that's perfect. So now I can see the VA.gov website on your screen. And then I can also see it looks like you've got MHV website up. Is that right?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000

> Oh, yeah. I moved it from one screen to the next.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000

> So I believe it here. I guess it'll be better.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000

> Okay, yeah, absolutely. No. That's fine.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000

> Okay, yeah, is that okay, does that work for you? Okay, okay, perfect.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000

> Awesome, so we're looking at the VA.gov homepage right now.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:43.000

> And what I would like for us to do today is imagine that you just went online because let's say that you needed to access some information, or you were, you know, gonna refill a prescription or something like that. Okay and the first thing that you needed to do was to sign in. So can you tell me what you would do first if you were signing in?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:04.000

> Oh, yeah, I would just go to the sign in button, my username and password, and then attempt to go to whatever actually benefit I was gonna use setup, an appointment, you know, like the records or education.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000

> Okay, well, let's go ahead and click sign in.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000

> Does this page look familiar to you? And you mentioned that usually you'll choose to use MHV that particularly because it feels a bit easier to use than DSL or ID.me.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000

> Yes absolutely.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000

> So for today, what I'm gonna have you do is click on DS Logon. We know that you have a DSL account setup. It sounds like you're using it to manage your retirement.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000

> Okay, so we're gonna pause here now. So we've signed in with DSL. Can you describe to me what you're seeing on the screen right now?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000

> Yeah, it's asking me whether or not I have a DSL account, or if I need to create one.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000

> Okay. And so you're seeing a pop-up that's asking you if you have a DSL account or if you need to create one? That's helpful.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000

> Yes.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000

> So I'm gonna give you a second to read this in a little more detail. Then what I'd like for you to do after that is just summarize what you've read for me.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:37.000

> Okay. This is basically saying that, from my understanding, DS Logon, it's gonna stop working. And you can create a VA healthcare login using a package. And basically, the information is just gonna merge. So you don't need to verify yourself all over again.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000

> Okay. Great. That's really helpful. So it sounds like DSL is gonna be going away. And you're gonna need to set up a VA healthcare account and your information is going to be sent over. So you're not going to need to verify your identity again.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000

> Correct.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:25.000

> That's very helpful. And so, as someone who uses DS Logon to manage retirement information and maybe other things, what's your reaction to what you're reading right now?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:43.000

> I mean doesn't surprise me. I mean, you know, throughout my 25 years of military the the way you log in to some of the secure portals changes regularly. As a veteran, now, and no longer having like access to a CAC card. I'm not gonna lie, it's troublesome, but it's just like, okay. Now the assumption would be, now I have to create a whole new login and password. But it did say it was gonna merge. But now you know to me it's like, well, now, I have to remember a new way to login as opposed to in the past where you go to the website, and you have the 4 or 5 options to choose from, as to how you're gonna get into the system. So I'm assuming the DS Logon will go away. And now what would be replaced by the VA login.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000

> Okay, so that's really helpful. So during your time in the military, this kind of asked to set up a new login, it was kind of common. So you're sort of not surprised, but because you're now a veteran, and you're using systems kind of in a different way. It's a little bit more annoying. Maybe, because now you're gonna have to set up something and remember something.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000

> Correct.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000

> Yeah, that makes sense to me. And this VA only account, can you tell me a little bit more about what you're imagining?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000

> I would imagine that it's just like one stop shopping for all things VA. I mean, it matches the healthcare and benefits, so I would assume you go to this one login and at that one pages where you can set up a VA appointment. You can look at your benefits maybe browse additional services that the VA offers. Just a login that allows you to access all things VA without having to go to multiple different pages or sites.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000

> And when you say, multiple different pages or sites, can you give me maybe an example of what's coming to mind for you?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:46.000

> Yeah, I remember, you know, when I was transitioning to retirement and just trying to get access to the VA benefits and healthcare and disability. It just seem like I had to go through so many different channels and it wasn't like it wasn't all at one place, you know. It felt like I had to use this website and click on this link and that links send me to another link and then another link, you know, and then it just seemed like it was a it was a labyrinth, you know, to get to where I need to be as opposed, to one website. That may just have healthcare education services, and whatever else you click on, it takes you right there.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think a labyrinth is a good way of describing it. And so there's a lot of jumping around. There's different websites, there's different sign-in methods. I think that's all making sense.

> And so you're kind of reading this message here to say that maybe that will be begin to kind of consolidate things.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000

> Yes.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000

> And so there's one place where you would be able to access that information.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000

> Yeah, that.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000

> Yeah, I also mistaken, too. I think I remember like I would log in to some secure port. Let's say I login with DSL. And then I try to access the VA benefits. It would then have me log into the VA's site, and I use my VA credentials essentially the Login, so you know, if I'm already logging in using one secure website. It would make sense to me so automatically give you access to the other site as opposed to having, you know, having to identify yourself once again.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000

> Okay. So sometimes you might be on MHV. But you need to access your things on eBenefits or something, and you're gonna have to sign in twice.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000

> Yes.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000

> Yeah, I got you. Okay, that makes sense. So that's really helpful.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000

> Is there anything else in this message here that is sticking out to you?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000

> No, nothing else.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:58.000

> Okay. And so when we see these different options, if you were browsing this in your own time, what do you imagine that you would do in this moment? You've come online, you need to complete some task like message your doctor, and then you see this come up, what do you think would happen? Realistically?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000

> Realistically, I would probably forget my password or something, then have to recreate the password. But on a good day I would just you know, go to continue with, continue with, I guess it's gonna be called the VA Digital tools, something along those lines? And then I would put in my username and password hopefully gain access on the first attempt.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000

> Okay. Gotcha. So you're looking for something to say like continue and set up your VA-only account. And we've got a couple of different links here, and I'll just give you a second to look more closely at these links and let me know if either of them or any of them are things that you would think to click on next.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000

> It looks pretty self explanatory. I need to create a login, or if I already have one, then just go with continue with DS Logon for now.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000

> Okay, great. So for today, what we're gonna do is continue to create a Login.gov account. So I'm gonna let you click on that.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000

> Okay, perfect. So if we were creating a Login.gov account, what would you do next on this page?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000

> I'd click on create an account button.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Go ahead and click on that. Alright. So for today you will not have to fill out the information. We'll just  continue and I'm imagine that you're doing it.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000

> So on this screen is anything jumping out at you? Is it feeling straightforward?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000

> Can you tell me how you would be filling this out?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:09.000

> Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty clean and simple. I would just enter my email address, select my preferred language, and then I mean, usually I don't read out the rules of use. But click on the box and hit continue.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:20.000

> Okay. For today, we'll click on that box that I read and accept and then we'll click on continue.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000

> So let me know what you're seeing on this screen here.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000

> It's basically saying that it has received the information. I inputted and it needs me to verify the email address. So now I would like check email. And it does. It looks like some sort of verification email will go to martha@gmail.com. That will confirm that I actually did create the account.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000

> Okay, this, sounds like something that you might be familiar with. Okay, great.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000

> Yes, absolutely.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000

> So let's click on check email, and we'll continue.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000

> We're obviously not gonna open up your own email today. Is this looking familiar so far?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000

> Yes.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000

> Okay. And when you're doing something like this, let's say, you know, you're sitting on your desktop – I think you said you're on your work computer right now – If you were setting this up, and you were on your desktop or work computer, how would you confirm your email?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000

> Yeah yeah, probably a computer or cell phone. I think most people have their personal email address link to their cell phone, Gmail or mail app. I'll use an iphone, and then probably my cell phone because again, it's already I'm already logged into it all you have to hit the mail button. And then I would actually see that email. I would confirm there and then see if I have access.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000

> Okay, great. So you might be working through this account creation on your computer. And then check your email on your phone and then would you continue the rest of the process on your phone? Or would you come back to your computer?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000

> No, I would use the computer.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000

> Okay. Great. That's really helpful. Let's go ahead and click confirm.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000

> Alright. Is this page looking familiar? Any thoughts when you see a a page asking you to create a password?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.000

> No, I mean, I usually use the same sequence to create a password usually and I'll XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX. Yeah, but it looks me looks very common.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000

> Okay, okay, great. So you're familiar with setting up passwords. You kinda have a model in your head for how you might go ahead and build that password.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000

> Yes.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000

> So let's click on continue, and we'll we'll continue to set up this account. Alrighty, so let me know what you're seeing on this page.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000

> Basically authentication setup. So multi factor authentication is pretty common nowadays, I guess, especially for some of these secure sites. It's giving you multiple options whether you want to do face or touch, security key, using ID of some sort of government ID, authentication app, text or voicemail, or backup codes.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000

> Okay, so this kind of similarly to that verifying your email address, this feels like something you're familiar with. Can we go through this list? And you can let me know whether this is something you would or wouldn't set up, and maybe why?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:05.000

> Yeah, I mean immediately, I probably go to the text of voice message, probably because 90%, 99% of the other sites that I go to that require multi factor authentication and again, I usually have my cell phone on me. So the text is easiest. I can click on that button. Look at my phone, get the 6 digit code, or whatever it is, type it in, and then continue on the website.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000

> I've never used like face or touch unlock, but like my iPhone, your face ID. Security key, I mean, I wouldn't use that, especially as a Veteran, and I don't have like security, encrypted keys laying around the office. I guess if I was a civilian government employee, maybe I would have a CAC card that would give me access to DoD or government computer systems. Authentication app, I use this one for work. I think I have the Microsoft authenticator. For some of the sites I need to go to, but again, that's strictly for the work related purposes.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000

> So text of voice. Probably the best text, 99% of the time, and then backup codes, I've never seen that one before. That seems like way too much.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:19.000

> Yeah, okay, that was really helpful. So it sounds like, text was a pretty obvious choice for you.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000

> Yeah.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000

> And then if you were gonna set up a backup method, let's say, do you know which one?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000

> I guess maybe the authentication app, because again, I have Microsoft authenticator. When I usually what I'm accessing work sites from my cell phone occasionally every my user in my pastword is stored. But I would say maybe once every 2 weeks in it like requires me to re-authenticate myself on my cell phone. I'm assuming. As some sort of security, you know, security factor. But so I would think probably authentication app second would be a backup, just because that time to have to use that as well.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense let's go ahead and click on text or voice message, and then we'll we'll continue and set that one up.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000

> Alright, so let me know what you're seeing here.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000

> It's just basically getting me to say that I'm getting ready to input my phone number, which will then send the code to my cell phone number. And then I received it. I'm assuming I'll receive the code as a text. I'll put that code in, and then it will allow me to process one side, authenticate myself.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000

> Okay, awesome. Yeah, sounds like, something you're familiar with. Let's pretend like we're sending that code.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000

> So you know, you put your phone number in, and then I suppose you might need to choose text message for the the page to continue. So just above send code yeah, I think you might have to click on that. I think it's highlighted now.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000

> So on this page, it looks like this is where we're entering that code that you just described. So we'll go ahead and click, submit, and then we'll continue through alrighty.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000

> So what is the screen telling you?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000

> That I've successfully accomplished the first authentication method. Now it's asking if I would like to create a second.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000

> Alright and realistically. What do you think you would choose to click next on this screen?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000

> I probably skip it for now.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000

> Okay, awesome. Let's go ahead and skip it for now.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000

> Basically, my account is complete. It shows me the email address that I've used to set the account. And that would be all, it will use the information to connect to your account, and then I would have to agree to be able to move on.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000

> Okay, perfect. And what kind of account do you think you just set up?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:19.000

> I've now set up the new login for the VA. The system that's going to replace or take the place of DS logon.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000

> Okay, perfect. And do you have any questions when you're reading anything on this screen?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000

> No pretty good itself. Explanatory.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000

> And when you click a green, continue, what are you expecting to happen on the next?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000

> It would be similar to that of what I would see following the login through DSL, or MHV or ID.me.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000

> So you're gonna end up like where you would have ended up if you signed in with a different sign in method?

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000

> Yes.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000

> Okay, that's helpful. So let's click on and continue. And then I'm gonna give you a second to kinda look around this page. We won't click anything yet, and then we can talk a little bit about what you're seeing.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:28.000

> Well, first, it's just telling me that I did login with Login.gov, and that I can use login that go for all VA digital tools. Because I currently have a VA login account. If I wanted to use the account for other government websites I'll need to go back to Login.gov to verify my identity.

> So I think that's like what I was referring to when I first created these – access to the different sites, to go from one to the other. It will require me to reverify myself.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000

> So is anything that you're reading here surprising you, I guess, from what you were expecting you were you were setting up?

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000

> Yeah, I mean that my first thought it's just that, you know. It's almost like frustrating, like. Now I got it, and now I'll have to re-verify myself if I want to go to another site. After I went through all that to get to the secure site.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000

> So you kind of went into this process thinking, all right, like, I guess DSL's going away. But at least this method is gonna mean that I don't have to continue to verify myself on all these different sites. And now you're being told that you might need to do that.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000

> Yes.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:53.000

> Okay, yeah. And when you're reading it says, other government websites, is that what you're imagining? You're imagining MHV, eBenefits, those are some of the other government websites?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000

> Yes, absolutely.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.000

> VA related things. Okay, yeah, that's perfect. And when you see verify your identity, what does that mean to you?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:13.000

> I probably need to put some sort of, you know, key indicator, like date of birth, or last 4 digits of social. Or, like verify your discharge date. Some sort of identifier that's related specifically to me that allows the system to know that if I have that information, you know more than likely it's me.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:41.000

> Okay, yeah. Gotcha. So putting in some kind of string of information that might be, yeah, like a unique identifier, let's say, and that would be part of signing in.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000

> Yeah, I would imagine it to probably be like that second authenticator. If I remember correctly, let's say I click on a link in this site to go to benefits, it would probably ask me to login using 3 or 4 choices, whether it's DSL, you know ID.me, or whatever the case, may be and then I choose. The second step would also be an authenticator which would be some sort of personal identifier.

> Gotcha. If you wanted to go from this screen to send a message to your doctor, what would you do?

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000

> First, I would close out. In order to get to the page I would need to close this out, and then – I've never had to send a message to my doctor, but now I clearly see here where it says, send a secure message to your healthcare team.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000

> Okay, yeah, that's helpful. So it seems pretty obvious to you how to kinda close out of that pop-up.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000

> Yeah.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000

> And then you're maybe less familiar with sending a message to your doctor, because you've been on MHV. But it still was pretty obvious how you might continue on with that task.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000

> Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:28.000

> Yeah, awesome. So what we're gonna do now is if you scroll up to the top, you can just click anywhere in that kinda dark top of the screen. We're back on the Va.gov homepage now, and we're no longer signed in. So what I want us to do now is imagine that it's a couple months after you signed in to VA.gov with DSL and set up this new login method. And you're coming back to VA.gov because you need to do another task. So we're gonna sign in again. So I'm gonna let you click to sign in which you felt familiar with.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000

> And then we're gonna say on this page for a second. So which method would be be using a couple months later, after we had set up this new account, what do you think you would be choosing to sign in with?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000

> The login.gov.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000

> Okay. Can you tell me why that is?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000

> Because I would have remembered that I had to create a Login.gov account. To basically to access it. The previous time that I was in the site.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:43.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. And when you're seeing like, you still see the option for DSL, for example, why do you think that is?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000

> Maybe the government is just slow, and haven't had the opportunity to remove the homepage.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So you feel like, it's gonna be removed. It just hasn't been removed yet, and you're gonna start using Login.gov.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000

> Yes.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000

> And I know that you have ID.me and you also have MHV. What would make you choose to use Login.gov instead of using ID.me or MHV?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000

> I mean, maybe it's the first option. It does kind of stick out to me more than the others with the red background on the white, you know. I mean, that may sound silly, but it is kind of like it jumps out ahead of the other one. So maybe I would just say, oh, yeah, I remember Login.gov and just click on that one.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000

> Okay, okay, yeah, that makes sense. And let's say, you know, on this day you were like, Oh, shoot! I know I have a Login.gov account. I can't remember my password for that one. What would you do on this page?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000

> More than likely I would try to log in to one of the others, just because I think it'd be easier to see if I can get access through. Probably MHV, instead of having to go through the, you know, forgot password and all that kind of stuff. I think, that I would have a better chance of gaining access, using one of my other logins than to go through the steps to recover your password, or recover your login.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000

> Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So it's almost you almost would use it as kind of like a backup method.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000

> Yeah.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000

> Okay, cool. Let's click on login.gov and we'll continue to this screen. And so if you were seeing something like this, remembering like, it's a couple months later, when you'd set up your account, what do you think you would be doing next?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:50.000

> I would attempt to log in, you know, with my strong password, I would hope that there's an option for me to store it. I mean, usually with these sites, you know you can. Once once you have logged in, you know it gives you an opportunity to save it in the system. So usually it doesn't automatically properly. I think a lot of times when I click on it, it, when I click on it auto populates. Or once I put my email address. Then, like the system itself, would have the little password store thing pop-up and say like, do you wnat to store this log in?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000

> So it sounds like having the email address and password stored in one of those password managers would be helpful for you because you could just kind of auto populate this and then continue, yeah. Let's sign in.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:23.000

> So we see this screen now, so I'll give you a second to read this.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000

> It's basically saying that if I wanna access the site outside of going through the VA. Then I would need to go through a bunch of steps to verify my identity, to get that full access. It would take approximately 20 min, and I would need a state issued ID, social and be able to provide my phone number.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:34:02.000

> So when, when it's saying full access, or when you're imagining what full access means, can you describe to me what that is?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000

> I guess I would imagine it would allow me to gain access to medical information. You know any additional services that they offer?

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000

> I would hope it would almost go back to that screen I referenced earlier, like that one stop shop where everything is at one place, and you don't have to go digging for the information that you need.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000

> Yeah, gotcha, okay? And is anything that you're reading here, confusing?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000

> No, it's more frustrating than confusing but again, I think it's like, oh, here we go! Another 20 min. To create a whole another account. But no, I don't think it's, you know, it's pretty self explanatory.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000

> We talked a little bit about verifying your identity earlier. Is this a kind of a different way that you're understanding, verifying your identity?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000

> Yeah, I mean, it definitely says, state issue id, social security number. Usually it asks for like your last 4 of your social, not the whole entire social security number, that does seem different. But the phone number, I mean, I don't know. I'm assuming the phone number would be like to send you a text message. I don't think any system could verify based on your number solely as if you know their cross-referencing Verizon, or something like that.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000

> So, yeah, so it's definitely different. Because now it's asking for a state issue ID, your full social security number and your cell phone number.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:06.000

> What would motivate you to do something like this to continue and verify your identity?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000

> Honestly, I'm not sure. I mean I would definitely say no, thanks, I don't want to verify. But if there was a portion of a site something within the VA that I have to gain access to, and it's required, then I would be forced to, but I don't think I would do it, you know voluntarily.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000

> Yeah, okay, cool. So you'd need this to be almost like mandatory in order to say, Yeah, okay, I have to do this.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000

> Absolutely.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000

> So you'd probably click on. No, thanks. I don't want to verify.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000

> Yes.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000

> Okay, perfect and not very verifying your identity. Do you have any kind of concerns or hesitations about how that would or wouldn't maybe affect what you need to do with the VA?

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000

> No, I mean from my understanding when I read it initially. It's telling me I'm I would need to do this to gain access outside of the VA's portal. So I don't see why I would need to gain access? You know why I would personally need to go outside of the portal the VA's portal, if I have the VA access. You know. Why, would be the whole other account? Why would I need to access any of that information outside of the normal page?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000

> Right? Okay, so, you're not really understanding like what you would need outside of the VA.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000

> Yes.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:58.000

> I think we can go ahead and close the prototype so you can stop sharing your screen if you would like to.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000

> I just want to spend a couple minutes reflecting before we wrap up. So if you can just tell me in your own words what what you have just done today, what did we do when we went through that prototype?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000

> Well, we went to the steps to create the new login that's going to take place of one of the previous points of access. And in order to gain that access, we had a create a new account, but I mean, the information did say it should merge over. But yeah, basically, we just went through the steps. And it was made aware to me that they're gonna go away with one of one of the access points, and I would need to create a new Login.gov account.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:03.000

> Okay, yeah, that means so it it was obvious, at least by the end of the process, that DSL was going away. And we haven't really talked about that merging of of accounts. What does that mean to you? What were you expecting?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000

> I guess my expectations would be once I gain. Once I created the account and gain access. All of my previous you know education, benefits medical disability, you know. I would assume that would have already merged into this the new portal, you know. So while creating a new login for the portal, my information once I gain access and authenticated myself. All my personal information would already have been basically merged into that system.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So any healthcare data or anything like that is gonna be shared. So you're not gonna have to like lose all this information just because DSL's going away.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000

> Yes.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000

> And did that feel like that was clear, that had successfully happened by the end?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000

> Not necessarily. I mean, I think I gained access. But I mean nothing like stood out, that said, you have officially no, I don't even really know how to explain it. You know. I guess it's something that popped up to say, like, you know it. You have successfully logged in, you know you. You now have access to your information, or you know, education, whatever. Whatever, however, is, gonna list it but thing if it you know, once you once I logged in and I got the successful. You know the green popup, whatever it was, maybe something that would have said. You know I now have full access to my information – I just made an assumption that it did. I don't remember seeing anything confirmation that it did.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000

> Reading it provided some comfort that I wouldn't have to go through – assuming I won't have to go through a whole other 1,000 steps, you know, to finally gain access to the admission that I needed. But you know again, if you sort of just make an assumption, because I never saw all that information.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000

> At the beginning it felt like, okay, maybe this means I'm not gonna have to sign in on these different websites and this is going to like kind of merge everything together, and then by the end it felt a little bit like you were realizing that that might not be true, and you might need to actually continue to verify your identity, to have access to other websites. Do you think that's a fair reflection?

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000

> Yes, absolutely.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:31.000

> Okay. And I just wanted to confirm throughout the process we talked about a couple of different sign-in methods that you already have, like, currently setup and I know you've got ID.me, which you kind of use for those discounts. And MHV, and DSL. Did you already have a login.gov account setup?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000

> I don't think so.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000

> That's how I remembered our conversation. But I just wanted to confirm so that's helpful.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000

> I think you know, I think we've covered all my questions. I want to give you a chance to ask me a couple of questions.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:13.000

> No, I don't. I think this – allowing veterans to provide their input – into these new process and procedures. I think it's great.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000

> Yeah, I think it's it's hard for us to convey how much help that it gives us. I think it'd be really, really hard to do our jobs if we didn't have input from yourself and from other Veterans. Because there's just so many things that we're not noticing that you've picked up on today that that will be really helpful for us.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000

> Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000

> So, yeah, I appreciate your time a lot, and I know the rest of the team as well.

> I do want to reassure you that everything that we were looking at is in testing. We're not exactly sure what changes will will be made, so I do want you to feel confident you can continue to access things as you as you have been.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000

> The folks that set up the interview that you were speaking to earlier, Perigean, they're going to be the ones that manage paying you. So if you have any questions about that, feel free to and I think they're also gonna send you a note asking for you to pass this along to other veterans in case they wanted to sign up, and do something similar to what you've done done. Nut I think that's it, and we give you a little bit of time back as well.

> Thank you! Bye!

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:44.000

> Great. You too.
