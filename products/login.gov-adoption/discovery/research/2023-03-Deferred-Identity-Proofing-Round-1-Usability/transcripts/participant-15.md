00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000

> Okay, let me start the recording. There we go. Okay. So I just wanted to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio today?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000

> Yes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000

> Okay. Thank you. Now we can get started. So like, I said, we're interested in learning a little bit about your experience with the VA nd how you access some of our online services. So to start, how long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000

> Well I got out in 76.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000

> Okay. So quite a while, that's okay.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000

> Yeah long time. I don't even wanna add it up.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000

> Yeah, that's okay. How often would you say you go online to manage anything VA related.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000

> Pretty often, let's say, 3 times in a month.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000

> Okay, yeah. And do you remember the last time that you signed in?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000

> This morning.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000

> This morning, okay, can you tell me a little bit about that. Where did you start when you when you went online this morning? Do you know which website you are on?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000

> I went to my healthy vet, and then I logged in because I had to talk to my PCP.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000

> Okay. And when you're signing in on my healthy vet and do you remember which sign in method that you use when you go to my healthy vet? There's a couple of different options.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000

> Yeah, the second one, there's 3 of them, the 2nd one says, 'continue to my healthy vet only.' I believe that's what it says, and that's that's where I go.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000

> Okay. So you're on my healthy vet. And then you're clicking something that says, 'continue to my healthy vet, only.'

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000

> Right cause. There's a couple of options. I think one of them is ID.me and the other one is, I don't remember.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. And are you aware, if you have multiple options setup, or you're using just that one option?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000

> I have 2, but I don't think I have others set up to enter my password automatically. That's easier for me.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000

> Okay. So you're generally using my healthy vet to sign in, especially because your password will fill in automatically for you.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000

> Yeah, the way it's set up there. Just put it in. It goes in automatic.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000

> Yeah, yeah, that's definitely helpful. Do you remember which other one you think that you might have set up as well?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000

> I think it's the ID.me.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000

> Okay. Yeah. Alright. Well, we'll talk a little bit more about that today. And you said you were going online because you were chatting to your doctor. It sounds like, do you usually go in through my healthy vet? Are you ever going to other va websites like there's va.gov, for example?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000

> I don't go to va.gov for that. But I go to va.gov for other reasons. I'm a fiduciary for another vet who mentally kind of challenged right now. So I go there to do fidiciary stuff, only go there like once a year, for that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000

> But and then I go to va.gov to pay ... [check video]

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000

> Okay. And when you're doing anything related to the fiduciary position, are you signing into VA.gov.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:05.000

> I think I go to va.gov FAST. I think it's ID. me. I'm not sure.

> [link: FAST](https://www.benefits.va.gov/fiduciary/fiduciary_FAST.asp) 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000

> Okay, yeah, that's okay. It's helpful for me to understand. Even that it might be difficult to remember which method you're using for different websites.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000

> It sounds like for you, though, when you're on VA.gov, you might be using a different sign in way compared to when you're on my healthy vet.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000

> Yes, I'm not using my healthy vet.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000

> That's really helpful. Is there anything else you wanted to share with me more generally about signing in before we continue?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000

> No, not really!

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000

> Okay. Okay. Well, I mentioned that we were gonna be looking at a prototype today. So I'm gonna send you a link in the zoom chat. And this is basically gonna open up a prototype on your screen. And then I'm gonna ask you to share your screen with me. Is that something you're familiar with? Okay? Awesome.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000

> Yes.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000

> So I've sent that link in the chat. And then once you open that up, just let me know if you need any support, sharing your screen. Perfect. Yeah, that looks like it's coming up, awesome. So now I can see what you're seeing. It looks like we're on VA.gov.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.000

> And so what I'd like for us to do is imagine we're in a scenario right now. So I'd like you to imagine that you've went online because you need to do a task on VA.gov, so let's say it's related to the fact that you are a fiduciary.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000

> Okay. And so the first thing that you need to do is to sign in. Can you show me how you would sign in?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000

> I would just go to the sign in button here.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and click that. And then is this page looking familiar to you?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000

> Yes, ID.me, my healthy vet. And I think that Ds logon... I never use it. I use that id me on my healthy vet.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000

> I remember seeing 3, though, when I, when I go there I usually see 3.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000

> Okay, so you're remembering that when you go to my healthy vet that you usually only see 3 options, right now we're seeing 4 options. And it sounds like the familiar ones for you or ID.me and MHV. Have you ever used DSL?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000

> Can't remember. If I did, it was once. I don't remember. I don't use it.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000

> Yeah, that's fair enough. And what about Login.gov? Have you heard of login.gov, is that something you've tried before?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000

> You know something – with the Login.gov – I was trying to help my brother get healthcare at some point and I think we had to go to Login.gov, but because I was doing it from [a different state than my brother]. We were on the phone. We couldn't get it done correctly, so I don't know what happened to that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000

> Okay, yeah, alright. So you actually have experience trying to help somebody else set up a Login.gov, and it didn't actually go very successfully.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000

> Right.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000

> So for today, what we're gonna have you do is imagine that you're signing in with –

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000

> If I could just add, I think the glitch that we had was – there was some redundancy in the verify who you are, or something. And my brother has early onset dementia, and it just didn't work.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000

> Okay. And when you say redundancy in the identity verification part, do you remember a little bit about what felt redundant?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000

> I think it was after you enter some information to verify who you are. I don't know if they sent an email to his phone or something or maybe sent a password. But because he wasn't computer literate as much, it was hard for me to help him with it. 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000

> That makes sense. And were you on the phone with him, you said you couldn't actually see his screen or anything?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000

> Yeah, I was on a phone pulling up my screen and telling him to pull up his screen at the same time. 'Okay, so hit that.' And he was getting messages, saying – I don't exactly remember. It was very confusing. 'Check this over, check that.' I don't remember.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000

> Okay, yeah, that's sounds very confusing. And probably frustrating. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that today. Actually so for now, what we're going to do is we're gonna actually pretend like we're signing in. I'm not gonna have you enter any information today. But this might be a little bit of a curveball, but we're gonna pretend like we're signing in with Ds log on today. I know you don't really use Dslog on. I think what might be helpful is, if you think about this like we're signing in with my healthy vet it's the same kind of thing...

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000

> So I'm just gonna have you click on Ds log on. And then we're just gonna click login. Okay? So just that gray box.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000

> Yeah, that's perfect. Alright. So let's pretend like we just signed into VA.Gov using myhealthy, alright and then I'm gonna just give you a second to read this screen. And after you've read this, I would just love, if you can summarize for me what you're reading here.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000

> And you want me to read this box that's white, okay?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000

> Yes. Please.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000

> Alrighty. So let's just start by – can you just summarize to me what you just read?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000

> So what I read that one of the long-in portals was gonna be obsolete. They would use another. This other one which would minimize number of times you have to identify yourself. But if you go to other websites, you may have to do this double identity thing.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000

> Okay. Gotcha. Alright. So it sounds like something's gonna go away and we're gonna ask you to set up a new account. And it's gonna minimize the amount of times you have to identify yourself. Can we talk a little bit more about that when when we, when you're saying, minimize the number of times you have to identify yourselves, can you describe to me what that means?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000

> What that means to me is like when you get in, it says, okay, so to verify your identity we're gonna send you this code to a text number. Alright. Then you get the code. Now you have to punch in this number. Like that.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So that sounds like something that you've done before.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000

> Yeah, too many times.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000

> Okay so the VA is telling you that Ds logon is gonna go away soon. And if you set up a Login.gov account, we're going to minimize the number of times you're going to have to do something like you just described. And then you said, but if you went somewhere else, then you might need to do something more.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000

> Can you tell me more about that part of the process? Can you describe to me what that means for you?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:53.000

> It means to me other than a VA healthcare website or healthcare portal, or something like, where I use the F. A. S. T. Maybe I still have to double, identify, or whatever they call it. I don't know what a websites are available to people from on the government website, but.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.000

> Okay, so it sounds like there's a bit of confusion around what other government websites you would need to access but it's clear that maybe you would need to do something extra if you wanted to do that.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000

> Right.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000

> Okay, that's helpful. And so if it said to you – instead of this saying, DSL will stop working soon, if it said my healthy vet will stop working for VA digital tools soon, how would you react to reading that?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:06.000

> I would really scrutinize it a lot, because I use my healthy vet regularly. So I would be like, okay, what do I have to do? And I would focus on on it. Whereas, I don't use DSL logon, so it's not triggering me. But if it's in my healthy vet, I say, okay, let me create this new account.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:37.000

> Right. Gotcha. Okay. So you would focus on this a little bit more because it would feel more risky, I suppose, because you use my healthy vet a lot.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000

> I don't know if I would say risky, but more pertinent, important to me.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:53.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. And is that because you are imagining my healthy vet, like the website that you using that, you went to?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000

> Yeah. Based on on what we're reading here. Yeah. Well, not that the website would go away. It will stop working, so if it's my healthy that will stop working. So maybe they will be changing the name of it, and I would have to use whatever new's coming out.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000

> Okay. Gotcha. Alright, that makes sense. And you did say that because this is Ds log on, you know you don't use Ds log on. You would probably ignore this. So if you were gonna ignore what you're seeing here today, what would you do next?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000

> I don't know that I would just ignore it completely. I would look at it, you know. Create a login account because it says DS Logon will stop working. Then I would go, it's kind of not relevant to me. So I'm like, okay, you know, whatever. I would just close it and go to the website that's behind it.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000

> Yeah, okay, yeah, how would you get to the website? That's behind it.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000

> I believe if I hit that close button, then this website behind it would just light up.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000

> Gotcha. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So next we're gonna imagine that we're creating this login.gov account. And we're actually going to go through the steps to create an account. Okay? So if we were going to create the Login Gov account, do you know where you would click next?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000

> I would go with here, where it says create Login.gov account at the bottom of this white box.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and click on that. Awesome. Okay. So if we were setting up a login.gov account, can you tell me what you would do next on this page?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000

> I would just go to each box into your email address, password. Wait a minute. No, I would go to create an account.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000

> Okay, yeah, let's go ahead and click on that.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000

> English would be my default. I'd read and accept the login.gov rules of use. Well nobody reads those rules actually, but I would probably click it so it wouldn't stop me from going forward.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000

> Perfect. Yeah, let's click on continue. Yeah, okay, what about this page? I'll give you a second to read it.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:40.000

> So we sent an email to you. So I would open my email in another tab. And confirm my email address. Oh, no, it says, check email, okay that's new. Cause I'm used to going to another tab.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000

> So we're not exactly sure what the button would lead to here?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000

> But I didn't even pay attention to that button to like, came back and looked at and said, check email. So I figured if I hit that button it'll go to my email.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:24.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. And when we were talking about your brother and you helping to set up his login.gov account or trying to help we talked a little bit about maybe how the confusion or the redundancy was about checking your email do you does this look familiar is this ringing any bells, or you think maybe it's a different part of the process where the confusion was?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000

> As I think about it, now, I can remember the confusion. I told you he has some dimension. So he went to setup an account, so we're setting up the account, then it bounced back saying 'there's already an account for this email address.' Yeah, that's where the confusing set in.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000

> Okay. So then it was hard to kind of figure out where that account was or what the details were to get into that account.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000

> Right!

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000

> Gotcha okay, that's helpful. Alright. So we're back in this scenario where you're setting up your login.gov account. And we're gonna check our email for today. I'm gonna have you just click on check email, that big blue button. So we're just gonna pretend like, you're getting an email. Can you tell me if this is looking familiar?

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000

> I wouldn't have any questions. Buttons really big. Confirm your email address. I'll just click. I would click it and hopefully it took me back where I need to be.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000

> Okay, gotcha, and we'll we'll sit on this page now, just for a minute. It sounds like you said you would be open up your email and another tab. So you feel kind of familiar with opening up multiple tabs on your computer?

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000

> Yeah.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000

> And when you're setting up something like a Login.gov account, or any sort of account, is that something that usually would do on your computer? Or is that something you might do on another device, like your phone?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000

> I don't set anything up on the phone cause it's too small for me. So I don't use that for those things. I would just go and open another tab. I like everything big.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000

> Yeah. I totally get that. I can't do very much on my little phone. Awesome, alright. So now we're here, and this page is saying, create a strong password. I'll give you a second to look at this, and then just let me know what you would be thinking about if you saw this page.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000

> Okay, I would just be thinking about what password that I would create. 12 characters long. That'll be something I can remember hopefully.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000

> Yeah, okay, do you have any concerns when it comes to passwords or using them over time?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:02.000

> No. I might be lax in that area, you know. People say, oh, your password, you should change them so often. The scammers and the hackers. From my perspective, they come after people with money, and I don't have any. So if you want to know who I am, whatever. So I don't get into changing passwords all the time, and security. I think the security that's built in is sufficient. I'm not doing a whole lot of stuff.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000

> Yeah, no. That makes sense. So it's it's kind of a little bit easier on you if you're not having to change your password. So often, and you're not super worried about any reason why you would need to either. That's that's really helpful. Well, we're not gonna have you create a password today. But we'll just pretend like you did. So we're just gonna click continue. Now and then we'll see what's on the next page. Tell me about what we're seeing here.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000

> This is like a double verification. So authentication. Yeah, just scanning these, the only one that I would be interested in is the text or voice message because I don't want to do face or touch. And the rest of it, you know I don't have government ID, and I don't have security keys, and you know none of that stuff applies to me.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000

> That makes sense. And a text or voice messag  something that you've already set up before. We talked a little bit about that before.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000

> Yeah, well text message. They'll send me an SMS, not voice message. Or using email.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000

> Okay, gotcha. So text or email would be your preference. So on this page you would you quite quickly figured out you would use the text messages. And we're not really seeing a good backup option here or another one that you might have chose?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:43.000

> I've always shied away from the face. I don't know, I guess you would have to have the camera on, and it would take a picture or something. I didn't know how it would work. I've never got into that.

> I've used the face and the fingerprints, and all that more biometrics to just, you know, having the system. I guess people were powering on whatever you know I might be.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000

> Okay, so let's click on text for today. And we'll continue as if we're gonna set that up. Yeah, perfect.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000

> A list of 10 codes. Really? I don't think so.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000

> You're not the first person to say that! Let me know what you are seeing on this page.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000

> Okay. They have my number there and then say, how should we send it, text message or phone call. So I would take a text message.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000

> Okay. Yeah. Okay, let's go ahead and click. Send code. So we're just gonna imagine that you put in your phone number. So we're gonna imagine that you were sent to security code to your phone. And then you put it in here onto the screen. Does that feel familiar to you, or do you have any questions about how that works?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000

> I like for it to remember this browser, too, so I don't have to do it again.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000

> Okay, yeah, right, we talked about that at the beginning. I remember. So let's click on, submit. I'll give you a second to read this page.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000

> Okay, second, as a backup. So I assume that's mandatory.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000

> Let's go ahead and skip for now. Then it sounded like we kind of went through all the options earlier awesome. So what is this page? What do you think this means?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000

> I'm finished with the account, so I can go forward and do my business.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:16.000

> Yeah, why do you think it's saying that it will share information with the VA?

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000

> So I can go to the various VA portals, the accounting, whatever it is.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:34.000

> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And what sort of account would you say, you've set up?

> I think I've set up an account to deal with any federal agency.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:50.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And if you had any questions on this page let's say that you were like, I don't understand what's going on. What would you do?

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.000

> Let me scroll and see if there's anything. There's a help button down here, and the privacy and information there. And if I wanted to contact someone. So there's 3 options. Kind of figure out what's wrong. Maybe the help might do it.

> I don't know what I would be looking for, but. It's 3 buttons there. Try to get the issue solved.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000

> Yeah, yeah, okay. You found that quite quickly. Let's say you were gonna contact somebody. Who are you expecting to talk to on the other end of the line?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000

> I would expect some administrator who could explain to me.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000

> Okay, and would that be somebody that works at the VA?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000

> I doubt it. It would be some, probably a government IT person.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000

> Okay. Gotcha, yeah, that makes sense. Alrighty. And what if we clicked, agree and continue on this page? What would you expect to see next?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000

> I would expect to go back to with where we started, so I can enter – I don't know what we were trying to go.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000

> Yeah. At the very beginning, we pretended like you were gonna come online to do a task related to being a fiduciary. And so you might expect that we would go back to the VA and you could continue and sign in and start doing that. Okay, Gotcha, let's click, agree and continue.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:05.000

> So before we look to closely at this page, I just want to talk a little bit about what we just did I know we've talked about this before, and it might feel repetitive. But this is just for me to make sure I'm understanding everything.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000

> So in your own words, can you tell me what we've done so far in this session?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.000

> What we've done is we've created a Login.gov account. Username, password, secondary authentication and then skipped the second mode of – I don't know what they called it, but we skipped that.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:01.000

> Okay, yeah, that makes sense. That's really helpful. I'm gonna give you a second now to read this a little bit more closely. And then same thing as we did before. I just like for you to summarize to me what you just read.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:26.000

> So from what I've read here – what I've done is only for VA, using Login.gov only for VA, and if I want to use it for... I don't know... social security. Whatever. I guess other government websites. Then I have to go back, and I'd have to verify my identity.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000

> Can you tell me what verify your identity... What would you expect that to take?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000

> If it was simple, just the authentication... I don't think so. Verify my identity. I don't know.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000

> Yeah, that's that's a totally fair answer.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000

> I mean, you have a lot of things that the people use now, last 4 digits of social security. I don't know how serious they are. If they want you to upload a government issued ID or something, you know I've had to do in the past for other stuff, but I don't know.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000

> Yeah, okay, yeah, that makes sense. It felt like it was clear to you that you've created an account that's gonna work with the VA. But if you wanted to use it on, for example, social security, then you would need to verify your identity. It's not super clear what verifying your identity would mean. That's really helpful.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:23.000

> I have one question. So we talked about authentication when we set up that text code right? What's the difference between authentication and verifying your identity for you?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000

> That's what throwed me for a loop right here right now. I think authenticate is like to make sure that they're really talking to me. Put my phone number in there. This is actually me. And identity verification, they need another type of identification. Like I said, maybe upload your driver's license or your passport. Something like that. I don't know.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000

> Okay, that's helpful. And so again, we're back in this scenario you've signed in and the VA asked you to set up a login Gov. Account. So you went and set up your account. When you finished, you saw this screen. What do you think you would do next if you saw this screen?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:24.000

> I might go and learn more about this verifying the ID, because maybe I want to use it on a couple of government accounts. You know the social security, and then save them, to connect them both, or whatever.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000

> Okay. And if you are gonna if you are, gonna use this login.gov account with social security. What do you think that you would need to do in order to use this account with social security?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000

> I would probably go back to where I said skip, and I can't remember exactly what was on there, but it was like another identity factor or something like that. I probably would actually have to complete that process.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000

> Gotcha. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Alright, that's all. That's been super helpful for me. So the next thing we're gonna do, is pretend like you were gonna continue on – You needed to do some task on va.gov. How would you get out of this, this popup?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000

> Just hit the X close.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000

> Okay, let's go ahead and click on that.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000

> Perfect, and then if you just click at the top of the screen and that kind of dark part of the screen, just click anywhere. Yeah, that should work perfect. Alright. So now we're gonna stay on this page. So, we're kind of pausing, and we are gonna imagine that you've now signed out of VA.gov and a couple of months past. So let's say it's a month from now, and you need to go back onto va.gov, and you need to sign in. Can you show me how you would sign in this time?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000

> Am I trying to go to the VA. Or just general? Like I have double portals, or whatever. Because if I'm at the VA, we'll just go to the sign-in button.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000

> Okay, and what that makes sense. Can you help me understand the double portals?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000

> I was thinking if I wanted to go to another government website like the social security or something, then I would have to change this in the URL to just VA.gov and go from there, maybe.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:05.000

> Gotcha. Okay, okay, so let's go ahead and use that first option.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000

> So you're just signing in on va.gov, so you can click on sign in. And then, yeah, perfect. So this page looks familiar. We talked about it a bit earlier, knowing that you've set up a new account with the VA. But you also have these other accounts with the VA, how are you gonna choose to sign in this time around?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000

> Well, my original one is gonna get chucked. The DS Logon. Or which one did I sign up? Login.gov? So I would use Login.gov now.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000

> So you're kind of aware that one of your logins are is going away. That's why you set up Login.gov. Alright. Let's click on login.gov then. And then on this page, can you tell me what you would be doing on this page?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000

> I'm here because my information is already valid. I would put in my email address my password sign in.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's click on sign in. Alright. So again, in this scenario, it's about a month after you set up your login.gov account. And you see this screen. So I'm gonna give you a second to read this, and then we'll talk about it.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000

> So first of all, can you tell me what you what this is trying to tell you?

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.000

> It's trying to tell me that if I go forward that I would only have access to VA tools. But if I wanted to go to another account, like social security or like tasxes, then I have to do the verify identity process which takes about 20 min. And here, I thought that you would have to upload state issued ID. And verifying documents.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000

> Okay, and based on kind of what we've already talked about. Did anything here contradict that, or confuse you?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000

> It's what I expected.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:30.000

> Yeah, we talked, we talked about how you thought verifying might involve some like an Id or social security number. So this does seem like it would fit in with what you were expecting, and and I can understand that you might use this for something like so security, or maybe for, like the Irs like you said I think that's really helpful.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000

> Or Passport renewal? Maybe.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000

> Right okay. So Login.gov is something that you can use for different government websites. Can you describe to me how it's used for those different websites? So like, let's say we did verify your identity so you could use this account now for other websites. What would that be like? How would you use it for another website?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:10.000

> I could use the Login.gov to go to my social security information. Maybe log a question or check, if miraculously they increased it, or something like that.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000

> Yeah, right? Okay. And to do something like that, where would you start? Like if we were gonna open another tab right now and do that right now. What website? Would you type in?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:50.000

> I think the Login.gov would have a list of all of those websites, not just the VA. I would think so.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000

> So you could kinda start from Login.gov. Okay that sounds pretty clear. Let's say that you did have a question about what we do need to do. So something on here was not making sense, and you wanted to contact someone. Can you just describe to me how you would do that? At this point?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000

> Learn more about verifying your identity. Click on the only option on there, really.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:38.000

> Gotcha, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Perfect, I think, if answered, all of my questions. If you'd like to you're welcome to stop sharing your screen so there should be a button somewhere near the top of the screen. And then we'll just chat for a couple of minutes before we wrap up.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000

> Awesome, perfect. Well, you answered a lot of questions for me today. If you are going to tell a friend about yours, let's say what you and I did today. How would you describe to them what what you did?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000

> Okay, I would say, knowing that maybe they have the same type of access, the government is changing the way we log on. So and they have some new information. But, I would tell them that there's a benefit, because you can have all of your access with one login.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000

> Yeah, cool. That makes sense. That's been really helpful.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000

> And what do you think that the VA ultimately recommended that you set up login.gov. There could have been another option. For example, why do you think that chose login?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000

> To centralize a collection of data. So we can know where everybody is. At every every moment. You know what they're doing.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.000

> That's a fair answer. And if that is kind of what you think in this scenario, how do you feel about that?

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000

> I mean. That's what that's what I think in my world of thinking, in my practical application, I really could care less.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000

> Okay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. So do you kind of think of it, like, the VA is telling me to do this. So I'm gonna go do it. And I'm not gonna like, think too much into like what they made me do this specific thing.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000

> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000

>Yeah, okay, I think that's fair.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000

> But if you want to discuss, you know the conspiracy, we can go deep into that.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000

> I think we might need another hour if we were gonna get into that!

> Well, I think you have answered all my questions. It's been really really helpful to have this conversation with you, but I do wanna give you a chance to ask me any questions. If you had any, or, if anything came up during the session.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000

> No, you know know, I expect them to roll that out, though the login.gov. So if it's not already rolled on already, we'll see.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:45.000

> Yeah, so right now, you are able to use login.gov with the Va, but some of the things that we were looking at right now are not necessarily like decisions or real, you know, real things that are are ready to be put up online so I do want to reassure you that if for whatever reason you wanted to use login.gov with the VA. You are totally welcome to if you wanna continue signing in as you have done, like. Please don't feel like you need to change anything based on our conversation today.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:07.000

> Okay. Awesome. Well, I really appreciate our conversation. It's been great having a chat with you, and it's been really helpful to hear your feedback as well. I think we're kind of wrapped up here.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000

> I want to make sure that you're aware that Perigean, they're the folks who set up the interview with you, they're gonna be the ones that are managing, paying you. So if you have any questions about that, you just let them know they're they're also gonna send you a little note about how you can get other veterans. If you have any other veteran friends or folks that you know, that wanted to do something like we've done today they'll send you a little blurb, and you could share that with them so I think that's everything for me.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000

> Did you have any other things you wanted to ask? Okay, awesome.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000

> No. No. Okay.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000

> Alright. Well, thank you so much, and have a great rest of your day.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000

> Thank you. Bye!
