# About this research

## Study
[2023-03-Deferred-Identity-Proofing-Round-1-Usability #235](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/235)

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research), we defined different pathways for the migration.

This initiative focuses on one migration pathway: moving select DS Logon users to Login.gov and allowing them to defer identity proofing to a later date, while still maintaining the same access to VA services that they had with their Premium DS Logon credential. In this case, Veterans will receive an IAL1 Login.gov account which works “as normal” for VA services, but can’t be used by other government services until it’s upgraded to IAL2. In order to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account, Veterans will have the option of identity proofing at a later date. The [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/legacy%20CSP%20migrations) has more details on this product.

We will run a few rounds of testing to review the effectiveness and usability of this deferred identity proofing user flow. Following Round 1, we will include follow-up testing to address any issues that surface. We will also include at least one round of accessibility testing with blind and low vision users. The [research overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/README.md) has more details on what is upcoming.

## Research Goals
* Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue.
* Review whether Veterans understand the type of account they've set up and its limitations.
* Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

## Date
