# Non-Veteran user roles outline
> [!Warning]
> After initial discovery work ending in December 2022, MFA Security Keys pilot and Non-Veteran User Roles research were deprioritized in favor of [adoption-focused work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/communication-campaign/).
> The content below is an initial draft.

## Overview
Non-Veteran users need to be able to sign-in and access the products and services they need for their specific roles. Veterans need a shared access platform to support proxy access and give Veterans the ability to voluntarily grant full or partial access to their VA data and services to their loved ones and those who care for them. Veterans needs to be able to manage the level and duration of access.

## Problem Statement

Currently there is not a unified definition for each of the non-Veteran customer types at the VA. Each administration — VHA, VBA, and NCA — has their own unique definitions and nuances, which increases the complexity of implementing non-Veteran user roles on VA.gov. Delegates, beneficiaries, caregivers, and dependents are a few terms used interchangeably that encompass many different user types relying on many different products and services across VA. VA.gov will need to transition from exclusively serving Veterans to serving a wider audience, such as caregivers, spouses, partners, POAs, VSOs, etc.

## Desired User Outcomes

- For Non-Veteran users, they will be provided with access to Vets' shared account data via their own accounts, which will allow them to provide superior care and support.
- Veterans can login and manage varying access roles for trusted associates and knowledgable buddies.

## Undesired User Outcomes

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* TBD
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
