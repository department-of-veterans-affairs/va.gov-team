# Outline

> [!Warning]
> After initial discovery work ending in December 2022, MFA Security Keys pilot and Non-Veteran User Roles research were deprioritized in favor of  [adoption-focused work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/communication-campaign/).
> The content below is an initial draft.

## Overview
Users could potentially struggle with MFA if that's not something they are familiar with. Are there any changes we can make on VA.gov or Login.gov can make to assist in MFA setup?


## Problem Statement
Some users struggle with using Multi-Factor Authentication. Could MHV Coordinator provide these users with security keys as an alternative?

## Desired User Outcomes

- A Veteran user will receive a MFA security key and successfully setup account access.

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increase the speed of implementation of the CX EO, “the deprecation of outdated and duplicative credentials” represented by MHV and DS Logon. 
- Increased security of MFA and compliance with National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance for Identity
- Reduced fraud
- Increased user satisfaction

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* [Login Metrics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/dashboard/I6gZ1NVTT6ujnnu4hU1KLA/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.dateOption=last30days/)
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
