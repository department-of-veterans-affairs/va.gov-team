6510 and IPP Follow Up

Date: 8/24/2023

Notes:
- Clarifying 6510 Directive:
	- Originates from NIST
		- Sets requirements
		- Gets feedback
		- OMB through A11 (or 280) circular-> you have to do what NIST says
		- VA also writes their own directives and references OMB, more so to cover all the bases and is all inclusive
- “Black line” version
	- Process to update
	- We should feel empowered to change guidance
- Identity and external with CTO are experts
- External Identity documentation worth exploring
- See if we can be involved in revising
- NIST; can we use MPI as an authoritative source for Veteran data?
	- Mentions in guidance VHIC as an identification card 
	- Tom has questions about quality of data collection and storage
		- Attribute validation through DEERS (Which may also be VADIR) which is a source that MPI calls from
		- Quality of VHIC maintenance and issuance may not be reliable, consistent and secure enough given how cards may have been issued 10 years ago versus now. 
		- MPI service doc review to look at correlation score source as possible means to discern quality of data in MPI
		- Possibly exchange ICN for EDIPI for other attributes
			- Tom needs to verify these exist
- Need to do holistic audit of data and how it fits into process
- What else is needed, depending on Identity, to cover minimal requirements
	- Because of Login.gov, that is why SSN is needed
- Explore VA commitments on TMF side, not just for IPP but beyond
	- Review roadmap

Next steps:
@TomBlack
- Verify if there is a possibility to exchange ICN for EDIPI for other attributes
Share documents on external Identity with Porta and Sophia (if any outside of 6510/handbook)
@Porta and @SophiaPhilipMO:
- Schedule follow up with Tom to discuss VA roadmap relative to TMF commitments
- Review 6510 Blackline version handbook and direction

Next Steps:
- Assess policy criteria for 6510 relative to IPP
