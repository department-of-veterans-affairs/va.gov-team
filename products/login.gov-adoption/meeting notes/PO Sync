Feb 1, 2024

        * login has on their roadmap to implement these MDLs

    * Not necessarily a need for inter-agency agreement but instead have a project charter to talk through fundamental components, establish shared goals, define roles, distinguish which partner/agency owns what, NIST compliance navigation, define architect solutions that are mutually beneficial to avoid zero sum gain
    * End goal is to offer template for replicability across other federal agencies and position it as a shared service

            * 8 months if May ’24 is the DSL sunset 
                * Impact would be 2 months per phase

                * Need to get VA LT input on what is acceptable minimum conversion rate to remove login button; risk acceptance
                * Need to determine who "inherits" deferred identity proofing or possibly not feasible

* Question: Who approves which identification documents we can use for in-person proofing? NIST, VA.gov, who else?
    * Connected with Edward Horne on Friday, 9/29
    * Considerations for accepting VHIC:
        * Not all VHICs are consistent (versions prior to 2014)
        * Exclusion of homeless or older populations who may only have VHIC
        * Potential burden on proofing agent and available APIs to distinguish if VHIC is compliant enough given variation of VHIC identification documents
    * Plan to follow up
    * Notes:
        * Priority should be state issued drivers license
        * Clarify how VHIC ensures assurance
        * Demonstrate that our process achieves IAL2
            * Then Login.gov will accept it
            * Unclear who signs off but most likely to involve Identity Governance Council — this is a back up plan
            * Map to NIST v3 or where it’s going in v4
                * Creates an opp to trigger directive to specify this
            * Ask Edward what is current process to get VHIC versus history of process changes
* Login.gov has a UX Ops team
    * Nick Ng, product designer at Login.gov
    * Danielle Lee, content strategist, IIRC
    * Conducting research on Login.gov authentication (see here)
    * Reach out through Carrie or Sierra via DSVA Identity channel to learn more about research plan and possible alignment
* Question: For IPP, when should customer User Acceptance Testing occur? 
    * As of now, we are tentatively envisioning UAT and QA first with VA customers, such as you, Tom, then usability testing with Veterans and proofing agents
    * Who from VA can participate in UAT? 
    * What’s a good cadence for UAT?

Action Items:

Sep 21, 2023

* Strategy Roadmap Next Steps
    * Once we complete a draft and review it internally, who will circulate it and among which teams? Lauren (Health), Danielle (Sitewide), 
    * Will we establish a formal sign-off process with the relevant stakeholders? How long should we give for that? Anticipating PM/PO to drive in tandem
    * Whose sign-off will we need to move forward with the campaign?
        * Tom
        * Unified Comms
        * Anyone else? Chris?
    * Review objectives, OKRs, and metrics
        * Original strategy roadmap
* Blog Post Feedback
    * Who owns responding to comments? Is that a priority?
        * Note that the blogs are posted on news.va.gov (OCTO is not owner)
* ID.me Data
    * Currently, we’re unable to determine the difference between users who have ID.me accounts only and those who are only using ID.me MFA as part of DSL and MHV (data is showing that a single credential record in MPI is being used for ID.me direct and ID.me as MFA). Is there someone who can help with these data points? We’ll also need a POC to make sure they are kept abreast of impending changes related to login.gov adoption. Do you know names we should start with?
* VHA-MHV-VA.gov Communication Working Group
    * Is LGA content still in circulation to be reviewed or on hold until more clarity is provided via strategy roadmap?
* Updates:
    * VHIC stakeholder meeting on 9/25
        * Scheduling a meeting with Keith Ross, Edward Horne and Kimberly Bostic, VHA HEC VHIC working group

* Tom will lead and organize feedback for strategy roadmap
* Tom has ID.me account contact
    * Possible need for strategy and role discussion
    * Current exploration of ATO requirement for MHV login options, may impact how VA can push for more adoption
* When it’s time to connect with VHRC (Virtual Health Resource Center), Tom will initiate with Lauren (Health)

6510 and IPP Follow Up

Date: 8/24/2023

Attendees:

Porta, Head of Digital Solutions, porta@themostudio.com
Tom Black, Product Owner, Veteran digital identity, VA OCTO, Thomas.Black2@va.gov
Sophia Philip, Design Lead, sophia@themostudio.com

Notes:
- Clarifying 6510 Directive:
	- Originates from NIST
		- Sets requirements
		- Gets feedback
		- OMB through A11 (or 280) circular-> you have to do what NIST says
		- VA also writes their own directives and references OMB, more so to cover all the bases and is all inclusive
- “Black line” version
	- Process to update
	- We should feel empowered to change guidance
- Identity and external with CTO are experts
- External Identity documentation worth exploring
- See if we can be involved in revising
- NIST; can we use MPI as an authoritative source for Veteran data?
	- Mentions in guidance VHIC as an identification card 
	- Tom has questions about quality of data collection and storage
		- Attribute validation through DEERS (Which may also be VADIR) which is a source that MPI calls from
		- Quality of VHIC maintenance and issuance may not be reliable, consistent and secure enough given how cards may have been issued 10 years ago versus now. 
		- MPI service doc review to look at correlation score source as possible means to discern quality of data in MPI
		- Possibly exchange ICN for EDIPI for other attributes
			- Tom needs to verify these exist
- Need to do holistic audit of data and how it fits into process
- What else is needed, depending on Identity, to cover minimal requirements
	- Because of Login.gov, that is why SSN is needed
- Explore VA commitments on TMF side, not just for IPP but beyond
	- Review roadmap

Next steps:
@TomBlack
- Verify if there is a possibility to exchange ICN for EDIPI for other attributes
Share documents on external Identity with Porta and Sophia (if any outside of 6510/handbook)
@Porta and @SophiaPhilipMO:
- Schedule follow up with Tom to discuss VA roadmap relative to TMF commitments
- Review 6510 Blackline version handbook and direction

Next Steps:
- Assess policy criteria for 6510 relative to IPP
