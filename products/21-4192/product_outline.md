## Overview
This project's objective is to allow Veterans and their most recent employer to provide employment information as part of applying for Individual Unemployability disability benefits.

## Problem Statement
Veterans submit VA Form 21-4192 as part of a claim of Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU) benefits. The Veteran completes the first portion of the form providing their own information and then sends it to their most recent former employer to gather details about the Veteran's employment, such as the dates worked, reasons for leaving, and any difficulties encountered due to service-connected disabilities.

Challenges:  
- Entirely paper-based, slow, error-prone.  
- No direct employer-facing digital workflow. 

How might we provide a way for both Veterans and their most recent employer to submit information in support of an Individual Unemployability disability benefit claim?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans and employers can complete 21-4192 online. 

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans' most recent employer will prefer submitting the paper form. 


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Employees at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are able to process claims faster

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- There is an increased time in processing requests

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| % online vs paper submissions      |             |                    |                    |        |
| Employer submission time vs paper baseline      |             |                    |                    |        |
| Error/rejection rate      |             |                    |                    |        |
| Trust/satisfaction      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective: Decrease claim adjudication time  
  - KR: Online submissions = 0% rejection rate  
  - KR: Employers respond 15% faster vs paper 


---

## Assumptions

- Employers and adjudicators prefer online forms.  

## Solution Approach

- Simple MVP form with secure employer submission.  
- Notifications/status out of scope for MVP.  

### Supporting research

- No Veteran-facing research; plan post-MVP employer usability study.

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
