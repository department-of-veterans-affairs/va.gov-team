# Platform Security Questionnaire

From the kickoff meeting invitation:
> Platform and Platform Security are undertaking an effort to properly define our security boundary and VFS teams are included in our ATO (Authority to Operate).
> 
> We need to gather and maintain some specific information about your team and its work on and in support of VA.gov.


## Questionnaire

VFS team: Disability Benefits Crew (DBC)

### POC
- What is the name of your product(s)/system(s)? 
   - Form 526ez (shared with other teams; we focus on the core form and ancillary forms and pathways within the 526ez, such as Form 0781 and Form 4142)
   - Contention Classification API
   - products from the Employee Experience on DBC are generally under the platform footprint of the Form 526ez or Contention Classification API 
- Describe its purpose in a few sentences.
   - Form 526ez: improve the core digitized Form 526ez application and ancillary forms and pathways. We focus on end-to-end flow, error messages, filing an intent to file, overall navigation within the form, and managing stability and emergencies 
   - Contention Classification API: The API maps contention text and diagnostic codes from the Form 526ez submission to contention classification codes as defined in the [Benefits Reference Data API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/api/benefits-reference-data/docs).
   - Employee Experience: develop programmatic means to reduce burdensome manual actions that need to be taken by claims processors.
- If you represent multiple products, please describe the relationship between them, if there is any.
   - the Form 526ez submission flow invokes the Contention Classification API and Employee Experience features, to supplement the user-provided form data. The Contention Classification API and Employee Experience features are not relied on production systems other than the Form 526ez submission flow.
- What is the expected duration of your project? This information helps us understand how our processes need to adapt
  - Ongoing with regular enhancements. The contract runs through ~March 2028, with additional option periods. 

### AWS Resources

   - all of the services used to support the VA.gov website, as our Form 526ez and ancillarm forms are sections within the VA.gov website

   - AWS S3

   -  S3: dsva-vagov-[dev/staging/sandbox/prod]-contention-classification-api
- Which of your resources handle PII? List the types of PII
   - there is potential for PII in form submissions on the Form 526ez and ancillary forms; and potential for PII in the files uploaded to S3.
- Do you utilize any other cloud resources beyond VA.gov?

  - [vets-website](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/) (shared with other teams)
  - [vsp-infra-application-manifests](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vsp-infra-application-manifests) (shared with other teams)
  - we maintain additional repos that hold documentation and do not contribute artifacts for deployments. 
- List repos used by your team, provide links
  - repositories that `vets-website` is dependent on, noted in [DEPO docs]( https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/setting-up-your-local-frontend-environment#Settingupyourlocalfrontendenvironment-Step2:Getthesourcecode)
- Do you have a POC for each repo? Please list – Individuals are preferred, but groups are acceptable
  - for our work in `vets-api` and `vets-website`: GitHub team [disability-benefits](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/disability-benefits)
  - for our work in `contention-classification-api` and `vsp-infra-application-manifests`: [vfs-benefits-conditions-team](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/teams/vfs-benefits-conditions-team)
- List other groups you know use your repos
  - `vets-api`, `vets-website`, and `vsp-infra-application-manifests` is shared by several project teams

### Tools
- List CI/CD or Infrastructure as Code tools
  - GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Terraform, Helm charts 
- Describe where each tool is hosted and if they handle PII
  - We do not intend for PII to enter any of these CI/CD or Infrastructure as Code tools. Jenkins is hosted by VFS. For GitHub Actions, we use GitHub-hosted runners.
- List software included in deployment or generate SBOM
    - vets-website: [dependency graph](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/network/dependencies)

### Connections
- List the connections your team makes/maintains with systems outside the Platform AWS Environment
  - [topology](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/platform/engineering/Updated%20External%20Service%20Topology.png)
  - Lighthouse APIs
  - VANotify (?)
  - VBMS
- Are these connections Internal or External to the VA?
  - internal
- Do you have a POC? Please list
  - Core Form (Team 1): Kyle Soskin
  - Pathways (Team 2): Justin Linn
  - Conditions: Lisa Chung
  - Employee Experience: Mark Chae
- Describe the encryption used for the connection in transit (e.g., Not Encrypted, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, mTLS).
  - not certain, this is handled by the platform team, but we believe TLS 1.2/1.3 encryption over HTTPS, VA Certificate Authority signed. 
- Specify the certificate source if applicable (e.g., AWS ACM, Let's Encrypt, self-signed)
  - The va.gov cert is signed by  Sectigo Limited, and I know there are other self-signed VA certs on the backends between systems
  - This is all handled by platform, we do not have involvement in cert management 
- List the types of PII shared (in each direction) with this connection
  - We have PII that we store and pass from vets-api DB to Lighthouse for claim/evidence/ancillary form submissions
  - We have PII that we store and pass to AWS (filenames, medical records/evidence) S3
- Do you have an MOU, ISA, IAA, or other formal agreement that documents this connection? If so, please provide it
  - No, our team does not directly maintain MOUs, ISAs, or IAAs for these connections. These external system connections are facilitated through platform-provided APIs (Lighthouse) and shared services like the Identity VFS team.

### Provide a data flow diagram that shows your product’s relationship to Platform.
