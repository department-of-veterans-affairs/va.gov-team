## Current design

We are adding a toxic exposure section to the 526 ez disability benefits claim form, allowing Veterans to specify some aspects of their service history that might qualify them for additional disability benefits related to toxic exposure. This brings the digital form into parity with the paper 526 ez form on these exposure questions. 

For our initial release, we will include this toxic exposure section only for new conditions (not already-rated conditions or claims for increase), as an MVP.

See Sketch file: [526 toxic exposure](https://www.sketch.com/s/c353146f-eceb-4626-9918-7603c693417f) (will soon be migrated to Figma) and the annotations within it for details.

## Project background

Lydia Hooper led usability research in August 2023. See [research findings](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VLqXexB72C_fPjUyw1MwL2Pjznvsg_q_UYbg16xk-iM/edit#).  

## Outstanding questions and next steps

See ticket: [Create Toxic Exposure Evaluation Research Questions and Approach #73031](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/73031)

1. Accessibility-focused usability testing
   We have introduced some new variations on form components that we have accessibility questions about. For example, we are including a "not sure" checkbox that sets other fields to null when checked. We want to ensure this interaction between fields is apparent, consistent with user expectations, and does not cause confusion, particularly to screen reader users.
2. Measure usage in production:
   What might we learn from how people are using the form / where they are dropping off / error logs?
3. Seek feedback / user data from support teams
4. Seek feedback from VSRs on real-world usage
   How useful is the toxic exposure data received from the digital form? What might not be useful and could be worth eliminating or formatting differently?
5. Expand the toxic exposure section to other disability claims (extending beyond new conditions)

## Background on decisions

### Entry point to toxic exposure questions

#### Current approach 

The current approach is to keep the "How is your condition related to your service?" question unchanged.

<img width="306" alt="Screenshot of 'How is your condition related to your service?' question, showing 4 radio button options" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/151068099/b0ea39bc-5c35-49d5-ae24-d0e5872cd31c">


Later, we ask if any conditions are related to toxic exposure and list all newly entered conditions in checkboxes. The Veteran can check which, if any, of these conditions are related to toxic exposure.

<img width="280" alt="Screenshot of 'Are any of your conditions related to toxic exxposure?' question, showing a checkbox for each newly entered condition and a final checkbox of 'I am not claiming any conditions related to toxic exposure' " src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/151068099/abee8798-0a25-4627-8150-b76bcbd9142a">

#### Other approaches considered

We considered adding a radio button indicating toxic exposure to the "How is your condition related to your service?" question.

<img width="316" alt="Screenshot of 'How is your condition related to your service?' question - a variation with an additional radio button of 'My condition was caused by toxic exposure during my military service' " src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/151068099/1a72c2b8-c7c9-4cde-b0a2-b813fd8f48d0">


#### Rationale

Keeping these two questions ("How is your condition related to your service?" and "Are any of your conditions related to toxic exposure during your military service?") separate will eventually (when we add the toxic exposure section for all types of disability claims) allow the Veteran to indicate toxic exposure along with any other existing answer for "How is your condition related to your service?". 

If we used the "other approach considered", we would make toxic exposure mutually exclusive of any of the other service connection options. This would not reflect reality for many cases and would mean that the Veteran would only be able to provide information on follow-up questions related to one of these radio button options.

### None of these locations and I'm not sure checkboxes

#### Current approach 

The current approach is to keep "I’m not sure" mainly as a comfort choice for Veterans, "None of the locations" is also a helper for users, to ease discomfort with leaving it blank. 
They can select I’m not sure as well as locations. If a Veteran selects None of these locations and a location, that will trigger a validation error for them to uncheck either a location or None of these locations in order to move forward.

![Screen showing a checkbox group of service locations plus "None of these locations" and "I'm not sure". "Lebanon" and "None of these locations" are both checked. There's a displayed error message of "You selected a location, and 'None of these locations'. You'll need to uncheck one of these options to continue."](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/151068099/8105423c-bc09-4bcb-8f99-ab862f5c9923 "Gulf War Locations 3")

![Screen showing a checkbox group of conditions plus "I am not claiming any conditions related to toxic exposure". "Tinnitus" and "I am not claiming any conditions related to toxic exposure" are both checked. There's a displayed error message of "You selected a condition, and 'I am not claiming any conditions related to toxic exposure'. You'll need to uncheck one of these options to continue."](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/151068099/ea2344fb-7ea5-4b9e-bb17-493e60a7dad4 "Conditions")

#### Other approaches considered
 
<ul>
   <li>Track the order in which a user selects checkboxes and display a more tailored error message with the assumption that their intention is to select the option most recently selected, like "If you want to select 'None of these locations', you'll need to uncheck other locations in this list." <a href="https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01K37HRUAH/p1704404867063769?thread_ts=1704323164.991569&cid=C01K37HRUAH">per Slack</a> </li>
   <li>Having "I’m not sure" trigger the validation error that unchecks previously checked locations</li>
  <li>Replacing the "I’m not sure" checkbox with copy that instead communicates if they’re not sure, that’s okay.</li>
   <li>A change to the design system to make it more clear with only one question per screen, when a question is optional **(we might still pursue this)**</li>
</ul>

#### Rationale
<ul> 
   <li>We have a precedent for showing validation errors on screen click vs on clicking continue.</li>
   <li>Concerns around people reading the entirety vs calling it out as optional</li>
<li>If they said not sure plus a location, no real consequence for backend downstream impact
</li>
<li>   CAIA rec: We suggest leaving the "Not sure" option in the list, but recommend changing the "Not sure" to "I'm not sure" throughout and making this the very last option of the lists.
</li>
   <li> **Larger scope:** Whatever the not sure pattern ends up being, it should be repeated across the form. Otherwise this is going to confuse users with multiple patterns throughout</li>
<li> For not going with I’m not sure triggering an automatic uncheck of other boxes: 
The proposed pattern - unchecking "Not sure" results in the "From" and "To" fields going back to null - will be very hard to make accessible to users of assistive technology. The field changes will need to be announced. And the more conditional logic on a page, the harder it is to announce properly, and the more confusing it will be for AT users to keep track of. - per [CAIA accessibility review feedback](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/Deliverables/Benefits%20Disability%20Experience%20526EZ/202312-design-review.md#conditional-logic-not-sure-checkbox)</li>
</ul>





### Page titles

#### Current approach

The current approach is to have each page in the TE flow have its own unique page title. This will help many assistive tech users use headings to navigate, and indicate the content of the page to them. Additionally, we changed the title suggestion from "service location in" to "Service location:[country]". @Christine Cereca noted it’s good to use a sentence structure like this for consideration of page translation in other languages. 

<img width="1109" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/139385562/6cbaff6e-dc11-403d-a466-e9858d8f8256">

#### Previous versions

The [condition name] (for example, "Toxic exposure"), is repeated as a header (presumably an H3?) across the entire flow. That heading isn't indicative of what's actually contained in that section of the page. Flagged by CAIA

<img width="965" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/139385562/b17e4289-9f92-42b8-b749-9be8b6b620af">





### Dates on locations pages

#### Current approach

Have location pages follow the same pattern as hazards.
So, the user checks which locations apply to them, and we provide the opportunity to give a single time frame per location.

<img width="1108" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/139385562/4aa47a6b-ce4d-4ebb-9014-26a468b25bba">

**Note, we may need to revisit this decision, since it is difficult to implement technically**


#### Rationale

Our understanding is that 99% of time, the service records are discoverable by looking up the service history of the veteran. However, there is about 1% chance that the record does not come up and needs more investigation. This time period helps the VSR identify one of the many records they may have and help reduce the time it may take to verify the service connection. 

While we expect this solution to add many screens, we think they are likely to be the least confusing overall, and we do have test data that backs this up. We want to amp up the optional message to help people who have a complex service history get through these more easily. Metrics would give us a clear picture on whether we need to walk it back, which could help with discussions with all of our stakeholders.

#### Other Approaches considered

<img width="532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/139385562/afc742b0-9ffd-42da-8417-5e1d6c7c4e2b">

-Multiple locations selected, one screen for dates entry. We haven't tested any approximation of this screen design (two tasks, lots of content, ambiguity on providing date).



<img width="642" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/139385562/cef72767-6e42-409a-bd9c-ed71817131c2">

-Y/N question about whether they served in a list of locations, follow up screen shows no locations, just a date entry. In testing found this to be unhelpful/confusing to veterans who wanted to see the list they were referring to in front of them in order to think about the dates screen. 



<img width="166" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/139385562/b396436f-e8c5-471e-a047-12aabbda3417">

 -All locations and dates entered on one screen. It's a long list and appears cumbersome, especially on mobile

### Content updates from CAIA

Referred to [this feedback document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/Deliverables/Benefits%20Disability%20Experience%20526EZ/202312-design-review.md#conditional-logic-not-sure-checkbox) to implement copy changes for MVP 

#### Instructional text to check conditions 
**From**: "Are any of your new conditions related to toxic exposure during your military service? Check any that apply." <br>
**To**: "Are any of your conditions related to toxic exposure during your military service? Check any that are related."<br>
**Context**: 
CAIA wants to avoid using "apply" in this way across va.gov because we often talk about applying for benefits, so just want to limit using the word "apply" to that use case.
<br>

#### "Not sure" option in checkbox lists
**From**: "Not sure" 
**To**: "I'm not sure" throughout and making this the very last option of the lists.
<br>

### Summary Page
The design system doesn't currently have a pattern for showing a summary of information within a form flow apart from the summary of all the information a user has entered in the form, which shows right before form submission.

#### Current approach
![summary-of-toxic-exposure-list-approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/151068099/2beb90d9-35b7-4840-9ab1-6f01d8a9893c)

The HTML approach is to use headings for each location, like so:

`<h4>Service Dates on or after August 2, 1990</h4>` <br />
`<h5>Afghanistan</h5>` <br />
`<p>September 1992 - September 1993</p>` <br />
`<h5>Iraq</h5>` <br />
`<p>1994-> 1995</p>` <br />
`<h5>Saudi Arabia</h5>` <br />
`<p>I'm not sure of the dates.</p>` <br />


#### Other approaches considered
![summary-of-toxic-exposure-table-approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/151068099/e089b4aa-7a5b-488c-ae9a-069abaac3d9f)

With the HTML, we also considered using `<ul>` and `<li>` elements, potentially specifying "location:" and "dates served:" with text.
#### Rationale

Per [CAIA accessibility guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/CAIA/accessibility/Deliverables/Benefits%20Disability%20Experience%20526EZ/202312-design-review.md#toxic-exposure-summary-dont-use-the-table-pattern), we want to avoid tables since [The VADS's table component page](https://design.va.gov/components/table#when-to-consider-something-else) recommends that you "use tables sparingly" and that lists are "generally more accessible on mobile screens." Tables are trickly for assistive technology users to navigate, even if they're coded properly.  

For the HTML, [Sara Smith gave the recommendation in #accessibility-help](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C8E985R32/p1705154213264839?thread_ts=1704903482.413669&cid=C8E985R32). Headings give enough structure to separate locations from dates. The other approach of specifying "location:" and "dates served:" caused the text to wrap to additional lines on mobile, making it difficult to parse the summary and extending an already long page.

## Changes made Post-Midpoint (Fall 2023)
**Midpoint**
- Entry point was different
  - “Are you claiming any conditions relate to TE” Yes or No

#### Locations and Dates
- Locations and dates were on the same screen, locations were shown in an additional info component. 
- We had multiple tasks on one screen
   - Answering yes or no on locations AND entering dates
   - This solution would make the pages too long, plus it goes against the one task per screen guideline. 
- Having locations hidden in an additional info component makes that content not upfront for screen readers at first. 
   - **Feedback from CAIA:** We recommend showing this full list to the user, instead of nesting it in an additional info component as the prototype suggests. Every user will need to see this list in full in order to answer the question.
- **Recommendations from CAIA post-midpoint about locations:**
   - The original list is of 23 locations for burn pit exposures and Gulf War locations for undiagnosed illness presumptive conditions, for service periods post 1990 and post 2001. We recommend splitting the original list of 23 locations into shorter lists so that the locations are easier for the Veteran to scan. We’ve updated this question to ask only about presumptive locations for burn pit exposures on or after September 11, 2001. The prototype currently displays the list in an additional information component. We recommend displaying these shorter lists in full, without asking the Veteran to expand a list, instead. Every user will need to review the full list in order to answer the question (as in, the list is not targeted to a specific audience. It’s for everyone), so showing it in full will cut down on clicking
#### Hazards Screen (Checkbox logic) 
- Splitting out dates screen per hazards checked
   - This is where we split hazards screens into hazards list (to be checked) + additional screens for dates.
   - Recommendation from CAIA: If we need the Veteran to provide the dates of potential exposures, I propose asking it this way. I know we want to limit the number of screens. I think whether VBA needs Veterans to provide dates for specific hazard exposures. If VBA needs locations too, we can add that to this question.
