## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. Your feedback is helping us improve the language on these pages so its a better experience for veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will be compensated regardless of whether you complete the session or answer all of the questions.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- Are you currently a veteran or active duty? 
- Can you remind me where you are based? Montana. 
- Can you remind me of whether you have applied for any VA benefits before? (for determining which scenario to present) Right now I am in the middle of filing a claim. I have gone on the VA website and went through the progress of filing the claim. Since getting out of the military I have been in limbo collecting evidence.
- What is your experience with VA.gov, if any? It is tricky because I am the spouse of someone who is still active duty so all the places, I have gone to seek medical evidence are private medical facilities. 
Have you completed this on your own? I am going through VA Guardian who are doing all the heavy lifting. All I have to do is sign forms. It is a Veteran service. I found out about them through a monthly email from the VA. They help you organize the evidence part. 
Would you say that is the most helpful part they do? Yes, collecting the correct evidence this way you don’t waste anyone’s time. For me collecting all the evidence into one file.
Do you think they are asking for the right evidence? Yes, especially since you are going to be collecting compensation. 

## First Task: [intro & TE alert] - 5 minutes


###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand the intro and what language they find clear/confusing 

- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* 
- Take a moment to look over the page. What is the first thing you would do after arriving on this page? [emphasize more after first few interviews] I would notice this blue button to sign in to start application so I would do that first. 
- Read everything on this page up until the “Sign in” button at your own pace. You can read aloud or to yourself. Try to look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.  Let me know when you are finished, and then I will ask you a few questions.
- Do you think the information here could be clearer? how so? I have seen the toxic/ PACT Act message before, and I have looked into since I was deployed in a lot of areas that had burn pits. At first it seemed like a new bill because I didn’t know how to get the evidence for that. I can file the claim, but who do I go to to get the evidence. 
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all useful, and 10 being very useful, how useful or not was the information in this section of the page? I would say 8 because it goes over the timeframe of backdates of when you will be compensated. The only reason it is not a 10 out of 10 just applying for a new benefit I would it rather just list out the steps of what I would need. 
Is there anything that could be added or taken out that could improve this statement? Yes, somewhere in there you need to add that you need to go to your local VA you need to get a toxic screening to start that process. 
    - Why did you choose that number?
-  Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you’ve read here, what is your understanding of who qualifies for benefits under the PACT act?
       alt: if you had to explain the new PACT act to someone else, how would you put it ?      

## Second Task: [STEP 1] Is this the form for you - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- Same as before: Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario to participant*
- MOBILE: Without clicking on anything just yet, look at the steps listed here. What do they tell you about the process for claiming disability comp. if anything?
- From what you have seen so far, what are some actions you think you can take on this page? 

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 1?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section 1 of the form 

- Read Step 1 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. Let me know when you have finished. Feel free to read out loud or to yourself.  If questions come up for you as your e reading, feel free to say them out loud.
I like how they lay it out, is straight forward with what you need to have in order to file a claim.
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful or not was the information in this section? 10 out of 10, because it is black and white, simple. It is pretty well written.
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you?

- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you read, what is your understanding of who is eligible for disability benefits?
   - ALT: If you had to explain to someone else this information about who is eligible for disability benefits, what would you phrase it?
- From what you read here, what is your understanding of a supplemental claim form?
     - ALT: If you had to explain to someone what a supplemental claim is, how would you phrase it? I would say if you tried to submit a claim and they found it not service connected you would need to file a supplemental claim with additional evidence.

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE ALERT UI/ INFO

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why?
- Is this the information you expected to see here? why or why not? I am not sure what to see when you click on it. It has a link to file a supplemental claim, maybe that will take you to see your rating. I am not sure. *Expands section* This is starting to maybe get lost in translation. I like it when there are direct links. If it doesn’t have links, some people may be confused on where to sign in to find what they are looking for. There are too many ways to get confused. I feel as if there was a link to sign in and take you right to where you need to be. Some people may be lost, especially the older generations who may need guidance. I can see the difference between a supplemental claim and claim for increase. I just went through the claim for increase with the Veteran Guidant. 
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, IF ANY?
- What is your understanding of the information about veterans who have been granted benefits in the past?

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Third Task: [STEP 2] Decide how to apply - 3 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 2? 
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section two
- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* read step 2 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation. If questions come up for you as you're reading, feel free to ask them. 
Anything stand out to you here? Just the links, if I have not gone through this route this would be something I would be interested in. I just want to have everything  I need when I first start. That is what stands out the most.
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section? I would say a 7 or 8 because it just gives you a general guideline. It lets you know that you need some kind of evidence when submitting the claim. If you are going through a new process, it is nice to know who to contact if you need help. I did not contact my local VA and I was a Veteran in Texas. Around a lot of bases, they will have a bunch of VAs which is pretty helpful.
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know? I think this is pretty self-explanatory. I think it is good.
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer, if any?


### Things to watch for:

- How do vets/service members react to mentions of form completion time?
- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Fourth Task: [Step 3] Gather information - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- IF ON MOBILE: What do you expect to see when you expand section 3?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section three
- As before, read through this section at your own pace. Let me know once you’re finished. look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. 
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section? It is just saying what the VA needs for your claim and if you do get rating what they are looking at and how that affects your life. It is also going over where you can gather evidence to support your claim. 
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section? I would say definitely a 10 because it is telling where to go to get the evidence, what you can use as evidence, and I think it is very useful. It was the most useful for me. 
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you? Maybe the active duty because I don’t know how many would be going through this program. They usually don’t go through this until they are getting out. I don’t know why an active-duty member would be using this. I know I never knew this existed when I was active duty. 
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know? I think it is very inclusive. It is going over different documents you can use as evidence. 
- Was any of this information confusing or unclear?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about how disability compensation is determined?
    ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone else how disability compensation is determined? How would you explain it?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about what documents are needed to support a claim for disability benefits?
    - ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone this information about the types of documentation needed to support a claim for benefits. How would you explain it to them?
  
**CHECK TIME**

- Was anything confusing about the information pertaining to authorizing the VA to receive and review your medical records?
- Was anything confusing about the information concerning where to submit forms for claiming PTSD or unemployability?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE UI/INFO - BDD

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why not?
- Before you opened this section, was this the information you expected to see here? Why or why not?
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, if any?
- In your own words, what is your understanding of the benefits delivery at discharge program?
    - If you had to explain the Benefits Delivery at Discharge program to someone else, how 
        would you do that? 

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/langauge tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over/miss 
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section


## Fifth Task: [Step 4] Apply - 8 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see in this section?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section four
- Read through section at your own pace…
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section? It is just going over what happens once you submit a claim. Timeline of how long it can take, that you have a year to submit evidence for your claim or it resets.
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section? I’d say this is pretty useful, 10. You want to know you are limited in time because you don’t want to be blindsided that if you don’t get your evidence in within a year that your claim will be restarting. It tells you that it will take a couple of months before you get a rating. There is also a link you can click on for more information. That is a good link to have there. 
What would you be looking to see there? Just kind of where you need to go to get evidence, the process, toxic screening process, I would look for kind of like usually when you call a clinic or a healthcare provider you could get lost in translation of the process of getting that evidence. You have to talk to healthcare providers. I think what I said earlier, the toxic screening will be a separate appointment. 

How prepared do you feel to complete this form? I would say an 8ish because I don’t have my evidence. That would be the only issue that would make me feel as though I am not ready to file this claim. Walking through and starting the claim this is great. I would stay with a VSO because they have been helpful. It makes things a lot easier unless it is for the toxic screening because that one, I would need to interact with my provider on my own. 
So, if you do not have a record of a certain condition, it is harder to apply? If you don’t have a record of that condition having that professional to help you is so helpful to collect evidence. If you don’t know have to provide evidence and they can see that you have these issues with the exam they give you.
Any last thing you think a Veteran should know? I think this is a great way to get people the information they need it. I like steps. You are being guided slowly through the process which is great. Maybe have a link that redirects people back to this page. When you hit sign in you will see something that says if you need help there is a link to redirect to this page.

    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer?
- If you had to explain "intent to file" to someone else, how would you put it?
- What did you think when you read the text about the length of time the VA takes to make a decision?
   - Did you find that information useful or not useful?

**If not mentioned before and within the allotted time:**

- What is your understanding of the information regarding additional forms like those for dependents and aid?

SENTIMENT AND TRUST TESTING 

- In your opinion, is there a difference between the words “condition” and “disability”?
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all prepared and 10 being extremely prepared, how prepared or not do you feel to begin the 526 form after reading this page?
- How likely or unlikely would you be to reach out to a VSO for help  completing the form?
- Now that you have read through this page, is there any information missing from this page that you feel is needed to equip veterans to begin the form on their own?
- If we needed to shorten this page, is there any information you think we could take out? 
- From what you have seen here, how long do you think completing the form digitally would take you?


**ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DEPENDING ON TIME:**

- Personally, why do you think the VA asks for evidence when applying for disability benefits?
- Do you agree or disagree that the VA expects a reasonable amount of documentation to support a claim for benefits/compensation. Why so?
    - ALT: Do you believe it is necessary for the VA to collect "evidence” from you to support your claim for benefits/compensation? why or why not?
- How would you describe the overall tone of the text on this page? E.G. corporate, warm, cold, etc.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

If participant becomes nervous , anxious, or irritated -

how are you feeling? do you want to take a few minutes to yourself?

You have already helped us a lot and given us some good information, it’s ok to take a break or even end now if you need to

We’ve been talking a lot, do you want to take a break before we start aga
