# Research Plan for Disability Experience Team, 21-526EZ Landing/Intro pages, 5/5/23


## Background

The 21-526EZ form is one of the most used VA forms. However, it's confusing and stressful for veterans to apply for disability compensation as the  process is rather opaque to the veteran. The form UX often leaves them feeling anxious and forgotten. The lack of clarity can also lead to mis-ratings, or misunderstanding of ratings, and a snowball of Appeals. 

As a new team, we are prioritizing design/content on the landing pages of the form which include an introduction page (url /introduction) that is meant to set veteran's expectations for what to expect of the disability claim process **and** two follow-up pages meant to determine whether veterans can apply for benefits delivery at discharge (BDD) based on their discharge date. These two newer pages will follow the one-question-per-page style and replace a post-auth start page (url /start) which held a wizard asking the same BDD "screening" questions. Past research and heuristic review makes it clear that veterans need more context and insight into this opaque process, so we are hoping to iterate on content and design at the beginning of the form to set veterans up for successs, focusing on a few key personas : vets applying for BDD, presumptive claims under PACT, new claimants, and claimants asking for increase of compensation for a condition that has worsened. 

**User goals:**

- Successfully and easily find the right tool, and submit a claim online
- Successfully submit a claim independently without seeking outside help
- Know what the right kind of evidence is to include in a submission
- Feel supported and cared for, and confident that they’ve put their best case forward
- Have accurate expectations of what’ll happen next

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

**Priotities specific to VA.GOV generally:**
- Solidify the VA.gov platform
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims

**OCTO priorities specific to our product set by PO:**
- Increase engagement on the online platform
- Reduce errors and ambiguity in submitted claims (thus reducing processing time)
- Build trust with customers (Veterans)
- Reduce VA costs by automating / digitizing where possible

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

- Getting out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself 
- Aging - some PACT act applicants are older veterans of the Vietnam War

## Research Goals	
*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

- Improve form content clarity and comprehension
- Improve veteran preparedness and confidence before beginning form 
- Improve veteran trust and confidence in VA institution and online/offline services 
- Reduce cognitive overload caused by form length and information 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

The DBEx team will use these learning to create a baseline for the iterative design process; continue to refine the form landing/start pages for clarity, veteran confidence, and veteran preparedness; and to ultimately progress toward our northstar KPI: reducing the number of sessions needed to complete the form. 

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- Clarity and comprehension : Do veterans understand the process for filing claims, what is needed, who is elligile, what needs to be done online in the digital form vs offline? Do veterans understand specific terminology in its context e.g. conidition vs disability, evidence, etc. 
- Preparedness and confidence: Do vets feel prepared enough after going through the introductory pages of the form to continue to start the form? What other information do they need provided upfront? What information can be de-prioritized to aid in info digestion?
- Trust: Do veterans feel the VA is doing its due diligence in getting them the compensation they need?

Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
We expect that the redesigned landing pages will improve veteran's confidence and sense of preparedness when entering the form.

## Methodology	 

We will be conducting usability tests on desktop and mobile to evaluate design/content changes made to the form landing pages and discover any other painpoints in that area.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach

As the form entry points are used by veterans and active duty service members at varying stages, we would like to recruit for both. Additionally, the form entrance is applicable to a number of personas including but not limited to those claiming for increased perspective, those filing presumptive claims, those claiming and suffering from PTSD, and those filing before discharge, and those who may not yet be elligible to file yet. Consequently, we plan to recruit for veterans who cover at least two: filing before discharge and filing for presumptive claims as Medallia survey feedback shows that these scenraios represent the motives of many visitors to the 526 form entry pages.


Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

- diversity in cognitive ability - 40% identifying as having a cognitive disability 
- diversity in Race/ethnicity - 30% not identifiying as White 
- diversity gender - 20% not identifying as cis male 
- diversity in sexuality - 30% not identifying as straight
