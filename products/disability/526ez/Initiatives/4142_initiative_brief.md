# 526ez 4142 Paper Sync Initiative

## Overview

The current digital 526 form generates the VA Form 21-4242, which was released March 2018. The latest version of the 4142 was released August 2024. The shared data fields collecting Non-VA medical records from 4142 need to be integrated with the 526 and 0781 online forms.

## Outcome Summary
Veterans are able to see all the current content of the 4142 form including acknowledgements and penalties to properly give  consent for access to Non-VA medical records and know they are answering the questions that appear on the latest VA OMB provided paper form 
 


## Problem Statement
VA form 21-4142 is a form that Veterans can sign that provides authorization to disclose personal health information to the VA, like a private doctor or hospital. This form has been updated recently (August 2024) and all the respective new data fields and content of the form need to be available digitally when a Veteran is submitting an application for Disability Compensation via VA Form 21-526EZ. The current online 4142 that is available in the 526ez application workflow is outdated. 



 
## Desired User Outcomes
- **Improved User Experience**: A streamlined and user-friendly form can make it easier for Veterans to apply for benefits even with assistance of non-VA medical providers, reducing errors and frustration.

- **Improved information**: Users have the most current questions and content that the VA needs for them to see when providing consent. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- **Delays in Processing**: If the form is incomplete or contains errors, it may take longer for the VA to process a claim.

- **Denial of Claims**: If the updated information doesn't meet the VA's criteria, the claim could be denied.
  
## Desired Business Outcomes
- **Compliance and Accuracy**: Updating the form to meet current regulations and standards can reduce legal risks 

- **Reduced manual intervention**: VA employees will perform fewer manual actions on claims submitted via VA.gov, such as adding missing data.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- **Missing information**: If the form is incomplete or contains errors it may lead to inefficiencies in managing reviewing the forms and increase in time to process claims. 
- **Silent submission failure**: A Veteran believes an online 4142 form was successfully sent to VA, but it silently disappeared instead.
- **Full stoppage:** A Veteran cannot access or apply for a normally-available benefit online because of an obviously-broken and erroring feature.
