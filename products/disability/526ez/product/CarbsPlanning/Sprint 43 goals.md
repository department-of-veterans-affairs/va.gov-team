## Sumary
Happy Thanksgiving! Team capacity this sprint will be lower due to the holiday and PTO. 

The highest priority is to deliver the Lighthouse Migration for the Veteran evidence upload. While working on the integration of the new Lighthouse API for VEDU, the team found that we were missing some Datadog queries for finding failures. This required more datadog fine-tuning before the feature could be release. This sprint the team will wrap up the monitoring and test the integration and confirm there are no issues. If all goes well, we'll be pushing the feature to production by early next sprint.

The team has has started the work for he 0781 Paper Sync initiative. The FE will work will be to focus on controlling the canary rollout and supporting new claims only. While the work for the BE will be setting up the JSON file and producing the PDF. These will both be in flight work as changes are expected throughout the building of the features.
