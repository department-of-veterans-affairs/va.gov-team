## Research and Design
[Sprint 45 Goals](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F07N6EH4EUE?focus_section_id=temp:C:GJL2b42e00b71334bb7b32b8e468)

## Sumary
Sprint capacity has been adjusted this sprint to reflect team members with PTO and the holiday.

The team's main focus is to continue to deliver on 0781 Paper Sync initiative. We had to put the Additional Forms Start page work on hold to give HCD team time to review the challenges the engineers found in delivering the new list-and-loop functionality. For now the team is concentrating on delivering independent pages within the flow so that we can continue to deliver the 0781 paper sync. The pages selected reflect the "start" of a particular section within the new 0781 and/or 526 flow. 

Team Carbs has the benefits-disability-notifications alerts watch this sprint, so the team has put time aside to support that effort. If there are any DataDog monitoring improvements found we'll be making improvements or recommendations (depending on effort) as we go. 

An issue was found in the benefits-disability-notifications alerts that the team will be reviewing for a root cause. And we'll be researching the work needed to deliver the Notify callback mechanism into our ZSF emails. This work will be planned out in a future sprint.

## Notes
- No need to prioritize any remediation work for the 0781 overflow issue for the upcoming sprint. Still considering tradeoffs + discussing with relevant parties in VBA
- Disability apps compliant with the Front-end deployment pipeline changes for vets-website (due Feb 3, 2025) needs more discussion with Team TREX to plan this work together.
