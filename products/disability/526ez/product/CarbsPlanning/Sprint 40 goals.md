## Sumary
Zero silent failures emails to Veterans will be our highest priority along with making improvements to Datadog monitoring and alerts. We'll continue to work on delivering Lighhouse Migration. We'll also be releasing the conteant changes for the Missing Information alert, where the call center times were wrong. Research and Design will continue on the 0781 paper sync designs, as 
well as supporting the ZSF mailers.
