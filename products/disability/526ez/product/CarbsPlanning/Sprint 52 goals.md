## Summary
The team is still working on the destruction action experience as they continue to find compoenent issues that slow the work down. Most of the previous ticket modal and delete data pieces are done, it's the confirmation message that the team is trying to solution for next. They are going to do some more discovery and working with VFF leads to help solve the problem with the placement of the confirmation message. The team hopes that if they get unblocked on the confirmation message that they will be able to move on to the destructive action work on Review and Submit. That leaves one destuction action that still needs to be done that is unplanned at this time.
