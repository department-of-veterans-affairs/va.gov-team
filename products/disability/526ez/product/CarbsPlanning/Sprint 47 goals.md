## Research and Design
[Sprint 47 Goals](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F07N6EH4EUE?focus_section_id=temp:C:GJL2b42e00b71334bb7b32b8e468)

## Sumary
The team's main focus is to continue to deliver on 0781 Paper Sync initiative. We'll remove the additional forms scope changes and correct the progress chapter to match with the new changes. The sections of the 0781 the team will focus on are the following: 
  - 0781 upload
  - Traumatic events
  - Behavior changes
  - Evidence 

The team will also start adding work for the transition off period by looking at mural boards, Github, and Datadog. This aligns with OCTO's goal for reducing the risk of not having the proper documentation for any team hand-offs at the end of the contract.

In addition to the 0781, an issue in LightHouse is causing silent failures. The issue's root cause fix is still being reviewed, but the remediation of the claims that fell through this path will need support for remediation. Not certain yet if that will happen this sprint or next, waiting on LH and OCTO for more details on what to expect. 

Team is leaving some time for making improvements on how we work. This will help support the OCTO goal for documentation and testing.

## Notes
- No need to prioritize any remediation work for the 0781 overflow issue for the upcoming sprint. Still considering tradeoffs + discussing with relevant parties in VBA
- OCTO has not prioritized the Disability apps' compliance with the Front-end deployment pipeline changes for vets-website (Was due Feb 3, 2025)
