## Research and Design
[Sprint 46 Goals](https://dsva.slack.com/docs/T03FECE8V/F07N6EH4EUE?focus_section_id=temp:C:GJL2b42e00b71334bb7b32b8e468)

## Sumary
The team's main focus is to continue to deliver on 0781 Paper Sync initiative. We had to put the Additional Forms Start page work on hold to give HCD team time to review the challenges the engineers found in delivering the new list-and-loop functionality. For now we are focusing on four feature areas of the new form flow: 
  
  - Choice and 0781 upload
  - Traumatic events
  - Behavior changes
  - 0781 Conclusion

An issue was found in the benefits-disability-notifications alerts that the team will be reviewing for a root cause. And we'll be researching the work needed to deliver the Notify callback mechanism into our ZSF emails. This work will be planned out in a future sprint.

## Notes
- No need to prioritize any remediation work for the 0781 overflow issue for the upcoming sprint. Still considering tradeoffs + discussing with relevant parties in VBA
- Disability apps compliant with the Front-end deployment pipeline changes for vets-website (due Feb 3, 2025) needs more discussion with Team TREX to plan this work together.
