## Summary
The team is wrapping up as much work as possible to get to staging review. Review and Submit for the destruction actions are the highest priority. We still have one modal tht needs to be started, but it's not likely to be delivered to staging during this sprint since there is a code freeze. 

The team plans to do more testing this sprint, which should include end-to-end validations.
