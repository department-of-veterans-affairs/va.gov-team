## Sumary
Zero silent failures discovery will be our highest priority, but should require little of the teams's time. 
Lighthouse migration and 0781 Redirect will be the main engineering goals, while Research and Design will primarily be focused on continuing to prep the 0781 for development and gathering requirements for the primary form failure email.
This sprint team the team will be taking time to do walkthroughs of the 0781 paper sync redesigns to prepare for storymapping and solutioning.
