# 1. Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe and build alignment for what problems we aim to solve, why we’re solving them, and how we plan to improve the Veteran submission experience. It’s a living document which serves as the source of truth and a communication tool for keeping stakeholders informed about the initiative’s progress.

# 2. Problem or Opportunity
Through recent Veteran shadowing research and discovery In Q1 2024, we discovered that many Veterans do not have a positive experience when submitting a claim for disability compensation. After a Veteran clicks “submit” on a disability benefits application on va.gov they experience errors, confusion, a lack of clarity, missing information, and cognitive load that overburdens the Veteran during a time when they are asked to recall traumatic events.

# 3. Proposed Solution
We aim to give Veterans more clarity on the progress and outcome of their claim's submission status. We’ll provide timely & truthful information about their submission status after the Veteran clicks "Submit" and give the Veteran a record of their submission and a way to track it. In addition to being able to view submission status on MyVA and Claim Status Tool, we expect this will reduce duplicate submissions. In scenarios where a system failure causes the Veteran's claim not to be submitted, we'll inform the Veteran in plain language about what to expect and will make efforts to reduce the burden of resubmissions or eliminate it altogether.

# 4. Success
We’ll know we’re sucessfull when the following are true.
* Veteran has clear expectations of submission status
* Veterans have the information they need to get help and a copy of their claim
* Greater Veteran confidence in the submission process, leading to fewer duplicate submissions
* Veterans can find the status of their submission on VA.gov (MyVA and CST)
* Automatic resubmissions happen same day, as needed
* Veterans won’t have to recomplete forms from scratch during failure scenarios

# 5. Delivery
Each delivery phase consists of one Feature and is represented in Zenhub by one Epic. Each phase includes Research, Design, Testing, and Implementation. Features are prioritized using a balance of usability, feasibility, viability, and Veteran value. Details for each feature are listed below in section 6.

## 5.1 In Scope
This initiative focuses on all paths for the submission and post submission experience. 
- Evaluation of user-facing features such as the loading screen during submission and content on the confirmation page
- Post-submission notifications, including confirmation email and message on confirmation page, SMS, web and mobile app notifications, paper mail, etc.
- Outline of information and list of documents submitted (note [concern about filenames potentially containing PII](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04KW0B46N5/p1712088148463829?thread_ts=1711557666.821949&cid=C04KW0B46N5)) 
- Reevaluating how the 526 introduces the Claim Status Tool and connects Veterans to it
- Reducing duplicates (rethink when we clear the in-progress form)
  
## 5.2 Out of Scope
- Notification of core 526 submission failures and file upload failures
- Any of the touchpoints in the lifecycle of the claim beyond when the claim is established in VBMS and all initial documents are successfully uploaded
- PDF of complete claim generated as submission-- this may be later state of the outline/copy of claim information submitted
- Given that the Claim Status Tool is not managed by our team, any improvements across products will need to happen in collaboration CST
- Note that Team 2 is doing work on addressing small and important issues in the non-happy submission paths, and we will need coordinate with them on future-facing work.

## 5.3 Risks and Challenges
1. This work is dependent on the /submit endpoint migration from legacy EVSS services to Lighthouse and must be completed first
2. Some unknowns with email confirmations
   1. Content guidance and landscape of existing email confirmations on VA.gov
   2. Technical implementation
3. Uncertain what we can get back about submission status in all cases immediately after submission
4. User research will require planning around some challenges
   1. We prefer to have Veterans submit actual claims, which we know is difficult to recruit for and usually involves sensitive information
   2. Otherwise, how might we understand whether our attempts to mitigate duplicate submissions will work?  
5. Any changes to the Claims Status Tool (CST) that impact how the Veteran accesses their submission status or what they are able to track as related to submission may need copy/link changes
6. Will need careful collaboration with back-up path and document failures to identify all use cases for full submission flow to make sure there are no missing or inaccurate notifications
7. Access to quantitative data, used to supplement our qualitiatie research can be challenging to get, and in some cases not available.

# 6. Features
Brief descriptions of each feature are listed below, along with success criteria, scope, and known risks and challenges. As we learn about upcoming features, detail will be added and changed as needed to reflect the latest known information. Feature epics listed in section 5 are the best place to get detailed information about individual user stories for each feature.
## 6.1 Timely and Truthful Submission
Once a Veteran hits “submit,” the messaging they receive does not reflect the true submission status, setting false expectations for Veterans on the timeline for their claims processing. Similarly, after leaving the confirmation page, Veterans have nowhere on VA.gov to follow up on a submission until it appears in Claim Status Tool. This creates a communication gap— up to multiple days for some Veterans.

This work is prioritized because it addresses one of the most painful parts of the Veteran experience, where much about the problem is known and the implementation is less complex. Moreover, this phase spans the entire user journey leading to a high-value, low-effort feature.

## 6.1 Success
1. Ensure expectations of the submission timeline are set truthfully for the Veteran
2. Ensure that Veterans feel confident the VA is trying to submit their claim
3. Ensure the language we use is straightforward so that Veterans feel understanding submission status is trivial
4. Ensure an email confirmation is received in a timely manner and contains information the Veteran deems useful 

## 6.2 Out of Scope
- Changes to MyVA
- Changes to CST
- Changes with how 526 and ancillary forms are processed after a sucessfull submission

## 6.3 Risks and Challenges
- We don't have detailed knowledge of when a claim's submission status becomes available in CST and MyVA. Instead of timing any communication with the actual point at which a claim shows up in those tools, we are keeping with the current (in production) approach to messaging that it may take a certain number of days for submission status to show up there.
  - This is a known limitation that will be eliminated in the future epic "Submission status on VA.gov".


# 7. FAQ
### Where can I follow along with this work?
The [Submission Experience](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/78179) Epic in Zenhub is used to track this work.

The [User Story Map](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1711478063212/5b744d81f239e5ae30aaf28ff98414a9dc3c7e72?sender=ubd79255de28cd574d7575469) is used to map out the initiative's features and user stories.
### When does the submission experience “end”?
When the claim is established in VBMS and all initial doc uploads succeed or the submission process ultimately fails (clarified [in Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C053UDWMH7U/p1712083884346289?thread_ts=1711719139.052369&cid=C053UDWMH7U)).

# Appendix

## A. May 2024 Replanning
In early 2024, we took the approach of improving Veterans' submission experience across a broad range of Veteran touchpoints, such as pages, static content, email, and copy. Some of the changes we believed would improve the submission experience touched other apps, such as My VA, Claims Status Tool, and the mobile app. However, these apps are out of our control, and attempts to enact change in these Veteran touchpoints would create dependencies on external teams, widen the problem area, and complicate solutioning. This would lead to a slower delivery timeline that left Veterans with a suboptimal experience.

To more quickly meet the needs of the Veterans we serve and increase opportunities for learning, we decided to deliver in an iterative manner, focusing on small and simple interventions in areas of VA.gov that we control. To reduce dependencies and unknowns on external teams and systems, we'll design solutions based on the current state of VA.gov as opposed to unknown future states. Where possible, we'll work with external teams to propose changes that we believe will improve the Veteran's submission experience but won't rely on those teams to solve problems for us. To consider the Veteran's entire user journey and the technology systems that comprise their user experience, we separated the work into five smaller phases, each with separate delivery milestones that we will deliver iteratively. This planning resulted in pausing some in-progress design work to be continued at a later phase (see Appendix A).

## B. Working solution
The design is based on a couple of different project plans, documented below for the sake of being able to pick them up again when relevant.

### Designing to future state of other products (June 3, 2024) - on hold

#### Plan
In this project plan, we are designing to a future point when the Veteran Facing Forms team's [Show status of form submissions to users on My VA and confirmation page initiative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1170) is complete and other products including My VA, Claim Status Tool, and the mobile app, along with us (the 526 disability benefits application) have aligned on an agreed-upon Veteran-facing submission model and incorporated it into their products. This allows us to address particular known painpoints in a way that is centered on the Veteran journey regardless of team boundaries in the product. Those painpoints (extending the [Problem or Opportunity](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/product/feature-briefs/Submission%20Experience.md#problem-or-opportunity) statements with more detail) include:

1. Veterans have inaccurate expectations for what happens after they submit a claim.
   2. [The VA claim process after you file your claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/after-you-file-claim/) page shows the first step of "What happens after I file a VA disability claim" as "Claim received", but this does not reflect reality in some scenarios. If the claim includes a private medical records request (4142 / 4142a), if there are retries, or if the claim goes down the backup path, it can take a few days for the claim to be received.
2. Veterans expect a "receipt" (claim details) of what they submitted (available from multiple parts of the product)
3. "Veterans lack timely and truthful information about their claim" > Veterans are unclear on the status of a claim immediately after they click submit. Currently:
   3. A claim does not show up in My VA / Claim Status Tool for over a day after submission
   4. We send a link to the Claim Status Tool in a confirmation email before the claim is available there, creating a temporary dead end
  
### Design work - not yet complete
See [Figma: Submission Experience](https://www.figma.com/design/qyTtKDOTHZPGU59PAfqVhq/Submission-Experience?node-id=0-411&t=uzTuyZlBGx8mcw3q-1)

We have been through two cycles of diverging and converging on design work so far. Currently we have alternatives along two variables: 
1. Design approaches: "standalone confirmation page" or "process list")
2. Submission models: "option 5" or "option 6"

#### Design approaches
Visual language for how we convey submission status, mainly the 526 confirmation screen.

##### Standalone confirmation page
This is close to our current visual language, with a loading screen and confirmation screen. It adds emails at key points and modifies content of an existing email. 

##### Process list
This approach uses the Process List pattern that replaces the loading screen and confirmation screen. The goal is to have a clear indication of what is happening and what will happen next from the time of clicking "submit" until the step that would be the confirmation screen. 

#### Submission models
What we mean by key terms used to describe certain steps or statuses in the submission process. These terms include "submitting", "submitted", "initiated", "processing", "sending", "preparing", "in progress", "pending", "received"

##### Option 5
1. Adds a submitting claim step to the beginning of the CST / "[what happens after I file a VA disability claim?](https://www.va.gov/disability/after-you-file-claim/)" steps
2. "date initiated" is the date the claim CESTs

##### Option 6
1. does not add a step and uses that flag-icon (in progress) state on step 1 of 8: claim received
2. "date initiated" is the date the Veteran clicked "submit"

## Eliminating dependencies on other products
### Plan
In this project plan, we deliver iteratively while eliminating dependencies on the Veteran Facing Forms team's [Show status of form submissions to users on My VA and confirmation page initiative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1170) and design to the current (in production) states of other products like My VA, Claim Status Tool, and the moblie app. This focuses more narrowly on the [problem statement](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/product/feature-briefs/Submission%20Experience.md#problem-or-opportunity) of:

1. Veterans lack timely and truthful information about their claim
