# Background

This feature addresses the need for a sync between the paper and digital version of the 526ez on VA.gov. The 21-4142 is an ancillary form within the 526ez that authorizes VA to collect evidence on behalf of Veterans filing for disability. 

# Problem or Opportunity

1. Sync the content of digital 4142 with the paper form using the results of the audit (Found on Sharepoint here: https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/vaabdvro/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B3308EE26-A184-42ED-AFC0-44B1D20F12A6%7D&file=526%20paper%20sync%20audit%20.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
2. Make necessary front-end and data updates
3. When a user selects that they want VA to review private medical evidence, they are forced to select either that they want to upload evidence themselves, or they want VA to get records. If they want VA to collect the records on their behalf, they will complete a 4142 (within the flow) to provide the Authorization to Disclose Information to the Department of VA.

# Why

Ensure that Veterans who opt to file on digital vs. paper have equivalent experiences. We are contractually required to ensure the sync between the versions. 

# Proposed Solution

Earlier discovery highlighted three possible ways forward along with pros and cons evaluated by the product team in May 2023. 

1. Embed as created by the Form Digitization team: The standalone digitized version of 4142 is not better than how it's incorporated into the current 526 flow - it includes info already in 526 as well as info not applicable/needed for 526 so cannot be wholly incorporated.
   - Pro - Very little engineering lift
   - Con - Adds lots of new pages in the flow

3. Change up the flow
   - Pro - Adds some but not too many pages to the flow
   - Con - Higher engineering lift

5. Create new 4142/4142a in 526ez
   - Pro - Keeps the flow less complex
   - Con - High engineering lift Do not recommend
