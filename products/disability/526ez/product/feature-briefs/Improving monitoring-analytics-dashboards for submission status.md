# Improve Monitoring Analytics Dashboard for Submission Status

## Background

The VA needs visibility on the statuses of submissions as they progress through the form.
This includes everything from a Veterans initial intent to file until the submission has been accepted.

## Problem or Opportunity

Currently there are a few points of reference and dashboards that show a partial view of the
form and the progress of submissions.

## Why

There is a need for a wholistic view of the form to spot trends and possible issues.

## Proposed Solution

1. Metrics
   - Counts by status
   - Submissions by process (Primary vs Backup)
   - Counts of In Progress past X days
   - Success vs Failure
   - Average Time to Completion (Only consider submissions that have completed)
2. Trends
   - Form Visits
   - ITF Counts
   - Average Time to Completion
   - Submissions by process (Primary vs Backup)
   - Evidence Upload Success Rate
   - Ancillary forms
3. Alerts
   - When a submission fails both the Primary and Backup Paths
   - When Backup Path Submission exceed threshold

## In of Scope

## Out of Scope

## Success

1. A dashboard that communicates the metrics and trends identified as useful
2. Deprecation of other Dashboards
