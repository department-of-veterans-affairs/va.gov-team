# Background
This feature addresses the need for Veterans to keep track of their claims after successful submission.

# Problem or Opportunity
## Happy Path
1. Veterans who file disability claims on VA.gov expect to receive an immediate confirmation email after submission. In the current state, Veterans do not receive such a message, which sometimes leads to feels of uncertainty (“Did my claim go through?”)  
2. After submitting a disability claim, Veterans expect to receive an email confirmation, as is standard with most similar online transactions. Without this, Veterans lack confidence that their claim was received. This may also lead to duplicate submissions. Veterans may also want to use this email as evidence in case they need to contact VA to move their claim forward.
3. After submitting a claim, Veterans do not have access to an outline or copy of the information they submitted in their claim. 
4. Veterans want to track their claim and ensure it doesn't get stuck, but they don't know how to do this. There is the Claims Status Tool, but we suspect Veterans often don't know to go there. When they do arrive there, can we improve their experience for tracking a disability claim?
5. When Veterans submit partial claims that require further evidence collection, awareness of the Claims Status Tool could help many Veterans track missing documents and complete claims in a timely manner.  


# Why

This initiative is intended to create a way for Veterans to follow up on completed disability claims and feel greater confidence in VA.gov and its services. 

# Proposed Solution

## Happy Path

Under this initiative, all Veterans filing a 526 claim via va.gov will be able to:

- Confirm that their claim was accepted/acknowledged at the time of submission
- Receive a confirmation email with details on their claim 
- Track the progress of their claim and incoming documentation (Claim Status Tool)
- Have access to an outline or copy of the information submitted in the claim


# In Scope

## Happy Path

- Post-submission confirmation email
- Outline of information and list of documents submitted 
- Redesign of the confirmation page
- Evaluating connection to the Claim Status Tool from the confirmation page

# Out of Scope

- PDF of complete claim generated at submission - this may be later state of the outline/copy of claim information submitted

## Happy Path

This initiative focuses on the confirmation page and improving how Veterans record and track their claims. Other work that might be a part of the post-submission experience but is out of scope for this feature:
- Redesign of the post-submission pages
- UI changes 

# Success 

## Happy Path

- Confirmation/acknowledgement email of successful submission
- Veterans better understand how to track their claims (CST education)
- Veterans have access to an outline of copy of their information and list of documents submitted

  
# Risks

- Any changes to the Claims Status Tool that impact how the Veteran access their claim information or what they are able to track as related to submission may need a copy/link changes
- Will need careful collaboration with back-up path and document failures to identify all use cases for full submission flow to make sure there are no missing or inaccurate notifications
