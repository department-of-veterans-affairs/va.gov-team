# Background

This feature addresses the need for a sync between the paper and digital version of the 526ez on VA.gov.

# Problem or Opportunity
Sync the content of digital 526ez with the paper form using the results of the audit.

# Why

Ensure that Veterans who opt to file on digital vs. paper have equivalent experiences. We are contractually required to ensure the sync between the versions.

# Proposed Solution

- Consult OCTO and VBA stakeholders to determine which discrepancies (from audit, linked above) must be addressed in order to achieve the sync
- Execute content changes required to achieve sync

# In Scope

- Updates that bring the VA.gov form up to match the paper form
- MVP sync of the core 526 with the paper form
  
# Out of Scope

- Addressing fields on VA.gov that differ from the paper
- The sync of ancillary forms associated with the core 526ez
- Any redesign of impacted features within the core 526ez

# Success

The 526ez form on va.gov is synced with the paper version in content and intention.

# Risks

Making content corrections could lead us to identify new problems, which could result in scope creep. 

# Plan

# Guiding Principles
