# Update PTSD 0781 to be aligned with new form version

## Background

It is estimated that 23 out of every 100 Veterans have PTSD at some point in their lives (see [article from the National Center for PTSD](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_veterans.asp#:~:text=Not%20all%20Veterans%20use%20VA,use%20VA%20for%20health%20care.)). Forms 0781 and 0781a for claiming PTSD as a service-connected condition are embedded into the 526ez form flow. These forms are in the process of being updated and combined into one new form for claiming PTSD, MST, and other mental health conditions resulting from traumatic events. 

## Problem or Opportunity

The current experience for claiming PTSD/MST is long and retraumatizing. Our shadowing research revealed many usability issues with this section of the form, and observed that it can double the time it takes a Veteran to submit a claim. 

## Proposed Solution

We first want to update the online 526 experience to relfect the changes to the 0781 and 0781a forms. We anticipate that these updates address many of the usability issues we identified, and that future enhancements can be documented and added to the backlog to be prioritized according to OCTO's framework.

## In of Scope

Update the PTSD flow within the online 526 to reflect the upcoming form changes 
- Review existing research on these forms and Veteran PTSD/MST, identifying relevant findings to incorporate in our MVP
- Collaborate with OCTO and VBA stakeholders throughout the design process 
- Collaborate with the Contention Classifications team on linking mental health conditions to this form in the condition list 
- Review content changes with CAIA
- Review new designs with the Platform team through the Collaboration Cycle
- Implement updates

Conduct usability testing on the updated form
- TBD based on timeline and prioritization: Wait until form updates are in production to do user testing, or incorporate usability testing with earlier prototypes and/or in staging? 

  
## Out of Scope

- Creating an updated stand-alone 0781 online form
- Conducting foundational, generative research on Veteran PTSD/MST separate from usability testing of an MVP

## Success

- Online 526 reflects the updated 0781 form
  
## Risks

- The inclusion of other mental health conditions in the new form may have implications for the conditions list and the way we route Veterans to the embedded 0781 form. 

## Plan

Discovery (already started, see [ticket #77615](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-benefits-experience-team-carbs-6470c8bfffee9809b2634a52/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77615))
-    Create a document (Mural board) with all relevant research on the PTSD/MST flow to included Slack messages, Github and Sharepoint links, meeting notes, etc. Include stickie notes with known pain points, recommendations, and open questions.
-    Get re-familiarized with the PTSD flow, as well as the stand-alone paper forms (0781, 0781a). Compare 526 versions with newest versions, and note major changes in annotations.
-    Summarize scope and outline a project plan for updating the 0781 in the 526 flow.

## Guiding Principles

- Aim to make the process of claiming PTSD and related conditions faster and less retraumatizing
- Use a trauma-responsive approach informed by the VA Trauma Community of Practice
