# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* We are implementing the [side navigation component](https://design.va.gov/components/sidenav) into the 526ez form. The side navigation will contain the 6 main steps of the form: (1) Veteran details (2) Conditions (3) Mental health (4) Suppporting evidence (5) Additional information (6) Review and submit. By implementing the `side navigation` we intend on giving Veterans the ability to skip sections and navigate back to sections without having to hit the `back` or `continue` button multiple times. Providing a navigation feature will also provide Veterans with an overview of all form section and help them have a stronger sense of progress across sections. By implementing the `side navigation` we will reduce the number of clicks it takes for a Veteran to complete the form, consequently making the act of filling out the form quicker and more efficient.

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
### What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?**
* **The following issues have been surfaced during Shadow Research conducted on 11/2023 and Toxic Exposure Research conducted on 11/2024** 
* Veterans cannot currently move to any section of the form at any time, and have to click the back button and continue button excessively to get to different sections of the form.
* Veterans cannot review or edit previous answers easily without losing my place or progress, and cannot easily correct mistakes.
* Veterans cannot navigate between form pages to preview the form’s structure before engaging with the content.
* Veterans may not trust the form’s built-in such back button and may use the browser back button to get to another section of the form.
  
### Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* These problems occur because there is no way for a Veteran to navigate the form and skip pages or sections other than using the `back` or `continue` buttons.

### How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
