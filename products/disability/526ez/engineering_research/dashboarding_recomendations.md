# Dashboarding Recomendations

## Purpose

Document low hanging fruit in the 526 Work flow where we could add a dashboard,
metric, or alert to give better insight into abnormal behavior, i.e. outages.

## Resources

- An example of this sort of dashboard here that tracks number of times the last
  step of the 526 submission runs.  If we fall below a threshold of these
  actions, we know that 526 submissions aren't succeeding regularly.
