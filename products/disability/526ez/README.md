## Metrics & Analytics üìä
In February 2024, there was an effort to update our 526 Domo dashboard to capture updates to the form. Please note that Google Analytics is connected to Domo (Domo is pulling information from Google Analytics.) The second document in the table below entitled "Single Source of truth Domo/Google Analytics" gathers those findings.
