When a veteran is applying for disability benefits (form 21-526EZ on VA.gov), each time their data is saved a green box will be displayed below the Back & Continue buttons with an “application ID number”`*`.  A veteran’s data is saved each time they make a change and click Back or Continue.

This number is not considered PII and would be quite helpful in troubleshooting why a veteran can not progress in the form or sees an error message when they submit. 

`*` we may refer to the “application ID number” as the “In-progress form id” internally
