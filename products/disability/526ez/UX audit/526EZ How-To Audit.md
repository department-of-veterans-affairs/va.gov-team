# üîß 526EZ How-To Audit  

## üéØ Purpose
This document is a guide to support team members in: 
- Conducting bug-focused manual audits of the 526EZ form
- Conducting UX-focused manual audits of the 526EZ form
- Documenting findings on tickets
- Tracking which parts of the 526EZ have already been audited

#### Follow Up [TODO]
- Create ticket for defining triage process for ticks in backlog where we don't know who will own them or priority.
- _[TODO: Identify if there are existing tickets and create new ones other wise. This might be a two part process. Or a 2 person process. Someone has to facilitate the process]_
- _[TODO: Bug triage / Refinement as part of the process (consolidate duplicates]_
- [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/nava4113/m/nava4113/1748904136573/6cc118924290977700e9a4ecd1e7a1b0e7c2e6c9) - check this mural. Eventually someone should assign the bug tickets to the appropriate team.
- _[TODO: Bulk list of issues on Table - make in shared DBC google drive, can be excel- with observations first so that a group of testers can go in and document stuff en-mass and then someone can refine and transition to official tickets]_
- _[TODO: [Spreadsheet example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CstNDQMVic-IpJZEAr452UdLhUReAI3X/edit?gid=1348811676#gid=1348811676)]_
- _[TODO: Identify some users that have rated issues vs users that don't have rated issues.]_
- _[TODO: Figure out what is the source of truth for staging users, and identify users that could fall in different scenarios (rated issues) Reserve staging users for the DBC, provide emails of the staging users, but team 5 has to reach out to someone on the team for the password. Example user descriptions: https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C098Q0GRKSL/p1755183584714369?thread_ts=1755181784.007889&cid=C098Q0GRKSL]_ 

## üß≠ Context
The 526EZ is a long form with multiple pathways (e.g., ancillary forms) and nested, conditional responses. Our team needs to manually test the form for bugs and UX issues. We then need to document findings in a consistent, actionable ticket format as well as track which parts of the 526EZ have been audited. Auditing the 526 will help prioritize fixes and inform a clearer product and UX strategy for future enhancements. This How-To documentation will help ensure consistency in how we evaluate the UX of the form and support longitudinal understanding of what bugs and UX issues exist and where.

## üìö Helpful Resources
### Get familiar with the 526EZ Form
- [526 Active Form Mural Board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1686768383603/3f4415dd2ddb71bbd104ebefd92a2c7b553ad792): This is the most up-to-date documentation of the form in production. It provides screenshots of all of the main form steps, conditional pathways, and ancillary forms. You can use this to understand the form as a whole.
- [526 Product Guide](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Disability%20Benefits%20Experience/2%20-%20Delivery/Product%20Guide%20Drafts/526EZ.Disability.Benefits.Claims.Product.Guide.v4.7_SRT.04072025.docx?d=wf9b54a1c03e14c14a4cee86463e34e40&csf=1&web=1&e=bRrO5C): This provides a walkthrough of the form with explanations of what is happening as the user goes through each page.
- _[TODO: Do we have a link to all of the business requirements or feature requirements for each section/feature of the form? May be helpful to reference.]_

### Audit Trackers 
- _526 Active Form Audit Map_: Provides screenshots of all of the main form Steps and pathways or ancillary forms. Use this to track how much of the form has been tested and how much is left to go. _[TODO: this will be a copy of the 526 Active Form Mural Board once it is updated. Need to determine the process on how to indicate that X part of the form has been audited.]_
- [Audit Tracker](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/UX%20audit/Audit%20Tracker.md): Used to document who conducted a bug or UX audit on a specific section of the 526EZ form, when it was tested, how it was tested, and whether any issues or tickets were identified.

### Tester Considerations
- Staging may have a lag / different performance than the production environment.

 ## üó∫Ô∏è Overview of Steps
1. Access staging 
2. Determine if you will be conducting a bug or UX issue audit
3. Determine which form Step(s) and conditional pathways you will be auditing
4. Check for in-progress work and known issues
5. Conduct an audit using the Bug Audit or the UX Issue Checklist
6. ~Create or update bug / UX issue tickets~ Fill out spreadsheet with bug / UX issue findings.
7. ~Link bug / UX issue tickets to any related enhancement Super Epics~ PO/PMs will review spreadsheet for duplicate bugs and create tickets.
8. Fill out the _Audit Tracker_ and update the _526 Active Form Audit Map_.

## üîê 1. Access staging
In order to test, testers need to access the form in Staging.
1. Access the [Staging Environment](https://staging.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction)
2. Click "Sign in to start your application"
3. Click the green "ID.me" button
4. Login using a username and password from [the staging users list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/mvi-staging-users.csv). You may encounter errors with some users. Recommended users include 230, 234, 235. (If you are auditing the form during the same sprint as other team members, make sure to select different staging users so that you are not overriding each other's progress as you fill out the form.)
5.  On the "Receive a code by phone" screen, just click "Continue"
6. On the "Enter the 6-digit code" click "Continue" again. (The code should have automatically populated).

## üß≠ 2. Will you conduct a bug or UX issue audit?
Use the following table to understand the difference between bugs and UX issues. Next, determine whether you will be conducting a bug audit or a UX issue audit. While a combined audit can surface both, it is more effective for our tracking and for your mindset to decide beforehand which type of issues you are going to focus on as the tester. Checking for bugs requires the tester to verify whether the system functions as intended, whereas checking for UX issues requires assessing how easily a user can understand, navigate, and complete their tasks.
    
| **Aspect**      | **Bug**                                                         | **UX Issue**                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What it is**   | A technical error where something doesn‚Äôt function as intended   | A usability or design problem that makes a task harder, slower, or confusing |
| **System status**| System is broken or fails to behave as expected                  | System works but creates friction or confusion                               |
| **Resolution**   | Solved through code fixes or engineering changes                 | Solved through UX, content, or design improvements                          |
                        
## üß© 3. Which form steps and conditional pathways will you be auditing? 
Keep in mind that you must actually enter answers into the form in order to move to the next section. For a bug audit, you will have to interact with each conditional variable within that form step. This takes time to conduct thoroughly. In order to prevent burnout, we recommend conducting an audit on one section per person per sprint. In order to determine where auditing is needed, reference the _526 Active Form Audit Map_ and the _Audit Tracker_.

The following table provides a high-level overview of all steps, sections, and pathways.
| **Form Section / Step**      | **Pathways** | **Notes** |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Landing Page and Wizard** |‚òê Benefits Delivery at Discharge Claim (BDD) Process <br> ‚òê Claim for Increase (CFI)                 | BDD pathway has a different supporting evidence flow. CFI has three conditional responses that will take you down three different pathways.         |
| **Intro, Intent to File** |N/A                 |         |
| **Step 1: Veteran Details** |‚òê Homeless Process <br>‚òê Military Service History Process | 
| **Step 2: Conditions**      |‚òê Toxic Exposure <br> ‚òê Prisoner of War <br> ‚òê Additional Disability Benefits <br> ‚òê Individual Unemployability | Individual Unemployability pathway is only present in staging and not active in production. Do not audit.  |             
| **Step 3: Mental Health**             | N/A                |                 |          |
| **Step 4: Supporting Evidence**             | ‚òê BDD Process continues here <br> ‚òê 4142 Release of Private Medical Records                 |                 |          | 
| **Step 5: Additional Information**             |      N/A           |                 |          | 
| **Step 6: Review and Submit**  | N/A                |  ‚òê "Edit" Pathway               |          | 

## üì£ 4. Check for in-progress work and known issues
Multiple teams are involved in designing and developing the 526 form, and there may be in-progress updates to the section you plan to audit. These updates might address bugs or UX issues you would otherwise identify. To avoid duplicating work, you first check for existing efforts by contacting the right Slack channels or team members. Let them know you're auditing [X section] and ask if there are any in-progress changes, known issues, or prior findings you should review. 
- ["Bug Bash Super Epic"](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/110810): Check subtasks for previously logged bugs or UX issues.
- **#benefits-disability**: Full 526 team and OCTO enabling partners
- **#benefits-disability-conditions**: Conditions team - for audits related to ‚ÄúStep 2: Conditions."
- **#platform-design-system**: Platform design system team - for post-audit follow-up if issues are related to design patterns or components.

## üîç 5. Conduct an audit using the Bug Audit or the UX Issue Checklist
As you conduct your audit, take screenshots and notes of your observations and tests. The following checklists will help you be thorough in your considerations.
- üêû [Bug Audit Checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/UX%20audit/Bug%20Audit%20Checklist.md)
- ü§ù [UX Issue Checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/UX%20audit/UX%20Issue%20Checklist.md)

## üéüÔ∏è 6. Create or update bug / UX issue tickets 
1. Review previously created tickets under the ["Bug Bash Super Epic"](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/110810) to determine if you should create a new ticket or update an already existing one. Use the following ticket templates to write your tickets.
- **Bug Ticket Template** _[TODO: Update once template is approved and created. In the meantime, reference [this ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/116511) written with proposed template sections]_
- **UX Issue Ticket Template** _[TODO: Update once template is approved and created. In the meantime, reference [this ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/116513) written with proposed template sections]_
2. Link your ticket as a Sub Issue under the ["Bug Bash Super Epic"](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/110810).
_[TODO: How might we organize the bugs/sub issues under the Bug Bash Super Epic? Right now, there are many different bugs/issues/epics nested under here.]_

## üìã¬†7. Link bug / UX issue tickets to any related enhancement Super Epics
Super Epics may already exist that capture the broader work that needs to be completed to enhance a user flow. Review super epics to understand if your findings may be related to / help inform Super Epics in the backlog. If there is a relationship, comment on the Super Epic with your bug / UX issue ticket numbers.

*For example*, "Improve 526 start/ restart experience" #108100 epic captures that enhancements need to be made to this flow, but as of Aug. 11, 2025, specific tasks and bugs are not yet captured. If you conducted an audit on this flow and found specific issues, link the bug / UX issue tickets in the comments. 
_[TODO: Is the description of what we'd like testers to do to show relationships between found bugs/issues and the corresponding Enhancement Super Epic?]_

## üóÇÔ∏è 8. Fill out the Audit Tracker and 526 Map
The Audit Tracker will allow us to track which parts of the form, devices, and environments have been tested. The _526 Active Form Audit Map_ will visually show which parts of the form have already been tested.
