## 526 VA Disability Compensation
- [vba-21-526ez-are.pdf](vba-21-526ez-are.pdf) is the previous paper version of the 526 that we referenced in our initial work
- [vaf-21-526ez-may-2018.pdf](vaf-21-526ez-may-2018.pdf) is an update to the 526 that was released in May 2018. There are some significant changes to some sections of the form, notably:
  - Homelessness data collected
  - Claim type selection
  - Disability description
  - Service and training pay



## Tightly related forms

These forms are arguably part of the 526 process in that they are about providing supporting evidence for you claim.

### Documenting events that caused PTSD

Aside from deciding which form you should use, this is not terrible

- [vba-21-0781-are.pdf](vba-21-0781-are.pdf) A supporting evidence form you fill out to help VA find other documentation of the event that caused your PTSD **if that event was combat or something other than personal assault or Military Sexual Trauma**.
- [vba-21-0781a-are.pdf](vba-21-0781a-are.pdf) The "a" variant is used to claim PTSD based on personal assault or Military Sexual Trauma.

### Release of private medical records

- [vba-21-4142-are.pdf](vba-21-4142-are.pdf) A release form that tells your private doctor to share medical records with VA. You can exclude some records, though it may negatively affect response rate. *Need to determine the most efficient path to deliver this to the contractor who does record retrieval.*
- [vba-21-4142a-are.pdf](vba-21-4142a-are.pdf) This form seems to essentially be overflow, as all the fields on this form exist in the 4142, but we've gotten mixed signals about how they relate. If it turns out we need to submit both, the form flow should be able to simplify the experience for the Veteran.



## Other forms

These forms are used to increase your benefit (dependents) or unlock other benefits (adaptive), once you are rated 30% (or higher) disabled.



### Dependents

- [vba-21-686c-are.pdf](vba-21-686c-are.pdf) Adding dependents can increase the benefit if the overall rating is 30% disable or higher.
- [vba-21-674-are.pdf](vba-21-674-are.pdf) Dependents between 18-23 who are in school need this form too.



### Aid & Attendance

These forms provide benefits for those who are medically confined either to their house or a nursing home

#### Housebound benefit 

- [vba-21-2680-are.pdf](vba-21-2680-are.pdf) Support for a Veteran medically confined to their home.  **This complicates self-service claims because it requires third party input from a visiting doctor.**

#### Nursing home benefit

- [vba-21-0779-are.pdf](vba-21-0779-are.pdf) Support for a Veteran confined to a nursing home.  **This complicates self-service claims because it requires third party input from a nursing home admin.**

### Adaptive benefits

Benefits that will help a Veteran modify, or purchase an already modified, home or conveyance.

#### Buying or modifying a property to live in

This is complicated by the back and forth between VA and the Veteran. *Also note that these are not, strictly speaking, C&P forms.*

- [vba-26-4555-are.pdf](vba-26-4555-are.pdf) Part one of two step process: Establish basic eligibility.
- [vba-26-4555c-are.pdf](vba-26-4555c-are.pdf) Part two: Provide detailed information about type of property, financing, and match with Veteran circumstances

Adapting a vehicle (conveyance). This is another process with some back and forth.  

- [vba-21-4502-are.pdf](vba-21-4502-are.pdf) This form has a round trip that we may be able to shorten, but there is some third party involvement. The seller uses this form to be reimbursed.

- [vba-10-1394.pdf](vba-10-1394.pdf) A prosthetics focused form (not technically C&P) that also has some back and forth. The seller uses this form to get reimbursed.



### Individual Unemployability

- [vba-21-8940-are.pdf](vba-21-8940-are.pdf) This form describes why a Veteran is too disabled to work. This one can be filled out by the Veteran alone.

- [vba-21-4192-are.pdf](vba-21-4192-are.pdf) After filling out an 8940 a Veteran needs to get **each employer** from their last year of employment to fill one of these out. **This complicates self-service claims because it requires third party input.**
