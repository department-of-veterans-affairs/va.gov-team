# Research Kickoff Document

For 526 Claims for Increase MVP Live Data UAT

**Directions:** UX lead seeking research should fill out this template and schedule a meeting with the PM, researcher, and recruiter to discuss. All parties must assent to this information before recruitment can begin.

## Purpose
Find any major issues (bugs only - no design changes) with 526 Claims for Increase before we release it

## Type of Research ([examples](https://methods.18f.gov/))
* [Remote Moderated Usability Testing](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/usability-testing/)

## Recruitment criteria
* Number of participants: 5
* Participant Requirements (_All or Some participants must be..._):
1. Need to have a rated disability with VA (no minimum %, just something), since we are going to check the build with their actual disability claim data
4. (nice to have) Try to get someone using assistive computer devices
 
* _Indicate if you're looking for a particular age range, geographic reach, account type, or other demographics. In our recruitment, we strive to include a mix of participants that is representative of the demographics of the US Veteran population._ 

## Dates and Times You Would Like to Have Sessions
*When are your moderator and note-taker(s) available? Their schedules dictate these slots.*

* Sessions starting 5/14 pending build being completed 
* **We need to have a moderator and notetaker present for each session since we probably won't be able to record sessions** (this will involve participants' real data).
