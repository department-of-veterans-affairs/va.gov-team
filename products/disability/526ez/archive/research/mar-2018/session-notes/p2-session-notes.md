# Notes: 526 New Claims

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

M: Tell me about your history with military and VA

P: I enlisted partway thru college to pay for school. Was deployed in 2002 and was in Afghanistan in Fall of '02. Currently in Software Sales and ended up at VA 2 yrs ago.

M: Have you ever filed for a disability claim? 

  Yes, rated at 40% currently

M: Did you work with someone or do it on your own?

  I worked with a VSO, VA Dept of VA

M: Was it a paper process or online tool?

  Paper in person, VSO used online tool. I completed the docs and had to sched the appt. Then I got on eBEnefits to follow tracking. More recently, on vets.gov I was looking at the post 9/11 GI Bill

M:Curious how that went for you, checking your education benefits?

  I submitted it and I'm waiting. They said it takes 30 days.

## First Task: Getting to the form 


### Scenario
[Use staging server](http://staging.vets.gov)

You have an existing rating of 20% for amputation of the little finger on your left hand and tinnitus. 

You have recently come to realize that you are suffering from PTSD related to your service. Your doctor recommended that you make a claim for this new condition, as well as a cyst in your left wrist.

[Visits Manage your health and benefits] 
I would try to get my profile to see my info and try to initiate a new claim. If I couldn't find that I'd prob go back to the VSO; however I initially got into VA 
I would go back to that point.

M: Would you go anywhere else?

I would go to 'Disability Benefits', I would notice that above the fold. Then I would go to 'Application process', 'Ready to apply'

***Starts Claim***
[Use prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ)

Selects "I have new conditions to add" and then only "new conditions".

M: What are your thoughts as you scroll through the page [Intro page with 'Start Application' button]? Think outloud if you wouldn't mind.

I would be annoyed. I'm scrolling to think how am I going to do this? They should already have all my information. I'd probably go to a VSO and be fairly frustrated at this point.

M: After getting to this point, would you pretty much be out of here?

I would pretty much be out of here. I say that because what I've found in my previous experience . Only because I was logging in every week or so to check on status, did I know I needed to supply additional information. I'm a fan of Self-Service but the fact that I can't drag and drop, 'here's my DD-214' and drop it in. If self-service was as easy as drag and drop I might do it if it was that easy, but because of my experience I would go to my tried and true method.

M: Have you used drag and drop with eBenefits?

No, a good example might be online tax returns. Previous year's data is saved and it's a matter of me entering passwords and info gets pulled in and I don't have to do additional retrieval or work. So if my pdfs in eBen could be dragged and dropped into a new claim, that would be helpful.

[Alternate version of Apply Page: https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ#/screens/287920318 Sees blue box prompting log in, and noting that the application can prefill some of your information]
I was feeling hopeful, when I saw disclaimer (that some of my info will be pulled in). I was excited that some of my info would be able to be pulled in. [you have 60 days from the date you start or update your application to submit the form. after 60 days, the form won't be saved and you'll need to start over.] I would be alarmed that I'd only have 60 days, but I would sign in. Then I scrolled down and saw I was in the same situation (that I would need to have SSN, hospital records, DD214, etc on hand. So I felt hopeful and then my hope was dashed.


## Second Task: Submitting a claim 

[After Clicking 'Start Application']
This is incredibly handy. I'm glad all this info is in there. No changes. Nothing to note. It's making life a lot easier. Show me you know me. Feeling very positive. 

M: Does this allay any of your concerns earlier about having to go get records?

It's making me feel better, but I'm hoping the medical records is as easy as this. Feeling like this is on the level of cust svc and experience I've come to know in regular life situations that I know. I'm hoping the rest is as easy.


Alright I know I have new conditions. I would add new condition and click 'Next'. 
[Choosing Condition from drop downs]
I would go to my condition. There it is --
very intuitive. Super easy. Drop downs and pick list keep me focused. If I had a condition that's as an 'other' that didn't fit this, maybe that's area that'd be one of the options but otherwise this keeps me focused and on a defined path.

If you were going to move on to the other condition how would you do that?
Would click continue to make sure I was done with the addition of the first wrist condition.

M: Are you looking for 'Save' on that screen?

Exactly. I was going to go 'continue' want to make sure that I'm not undoing anything going forward. I see the 1st condition is saved. For 'PTSD' I would go with my head.

M: What would you expect that 'All' button to do?

Probably highlight the whole body or if it didn't it wouldn't matter, I would just think it is just a condition that affects the whole body.

M:What motivated you to click on 'All'?

PTSD is in the head but it can affect everything, wasn't sure what you were looking for so I figured 'All' would capture everything.

Chose "yes, it's service connected" on the wrist cyst (but it was actually related to another condition in the scenario)

[PTSD]
M: I know you said you have experience with PTSD, if you prefer not to talk about this topic we can skip this section.

No, I'm happy to do it. It's part of my therapy.

Think [is your PTSD a result of sexual trauma or...] is an interesting question to ask, I would have thought it was combat-related. So I was a little surprised that it wasn't an option, but then I realized it wasn't one of those two.
I'm on my phone so I'm not going to download a form. I'd prob want an email form. So could I initiate a link to send it out and complete or could I have an option to save and go complete the form.

M: Do you remember filling out your PTSD form?

Yea, there were documentation of statements and a form where I had to fill out situation, dates, people involved, etc. There was a longer form with statements and one with specific incidents and some of the issues that I'm dealing with.

M: Do you remem any expereiences with that form that stood out?

Handwriting was not ideal. I had to do a lot of research of incidents. I was able to look specifics up pretty easily because it was well-documented in the press. So I could get specifics on province and weird things like, I thought one incident 13 died, turned out it was only 11. Some of those things make it where you're not always super accurate and you don't always have the ability to go back and look it up.

What are your thoughts about the question [of service-connection]? (reminder of the scenario - cyst is related to his amputation) What is your interpretation of this screen and how you evaluate which one you're going to choose?

It was super fast. You told me a doctor said it was related, I prob would have done my own googling once I left the doctor's office to see if it was legit that cysts follow from wrist amputation. So by the time I saw the screen I would have thought it's a no-brainer and related to my amputation (so I would have chosen yes, it's service connected). 

M: Select 'No - it's related to another condition' , I'd like to see your perception of how we're presenting this.

Clicking no, I would have thought I'd be asked what condition it was tied to. When I saw amputation was one of the options there was really nowhere for me to go, the other two didn't match up I would have chosen amputation and clicked continue. It was the next best option.

M: Does the term secondary condition mean anything?

No. I know what it means but not in terms of how you're explaining it.

Frustrating can't download form. Can't email or download form so I'm going to write down the form number I have to get and click continue.


## Third Task: Additional Benefits
### Scenario: 

So you've specified new conditions and answered detailed questions, so for the cyst where should we get medical records that document your treatment for that condition.
Once you upload or point us toward records, you would move out of that section and on to this one.

[Additional Benefits screen]
When I'm on the phone and moving fast: If I saw 30% I would have been discouraged because I'm at 20%, I would just hit continue. On a desktop I would realize this isn't telling me that I can't go forward or I need 30%, it's just info for me to have, then I'd click 'Conitnue'.

M: You're also making new claims as a part of this process. How do you think that relates to that 30% floor?

I know that if I don't meet the minimum standard today, I have to go through an entire other process b/c I'm not at 30% or greater so I would have been turned off.

M: If you're documenting your condition, it sounds like it's not reassuring to see it (30% requirement) now?
Yes, when you see something you're not rated at it triggers 'this is a roadblock' for me. But if it's an in between screen or fun fact that's good to know as opposed to a precursor before I continue the process.

[Questionnaire next screen after 'Continue']
No, I'm good. I'm already an amputee but I'm driving with my one hand and my prosthetic.

if 'yes', I had problem with cyst I'm ok with house but I prob have a hard time driving.

[Are you unable to work]
I would be thinking about everything I deal with (including PTSD), not just the lens of the cyst so I would say I am unable to work.

M: How do you interpret being able or unable to work due to disability?

I think I was using does your ability affect it and lumping that in with unable. Unable is I can't work b/c of physical limitation, but it's hard to say with PTSD because I can do the work but I can't be around ppl. I can't commute b.c I'm afraid of devices on the road. So I can still do the work but my ability is
diminished so I would by default select 'I am unable to work'.

[Forms available for download]
I need to submit some more forms. I wish I could email some forms since I'm on my phone b/c I'm not going to download forms. So I would prob hit 'Continue' to see if I could keep going.

M: You mentioned email, is that your preferred way to get stuff like that?

Only reason I'm saying it is that I'm generally not accessing my printer from my phone. I generally find that maybe I don't have my printer accessible but I'll just email it so I know when I get home I can print it. It's like default bookmarking for me, until I got home and had access to my wi-fi.

[How are exams scheduled?]
Not that again. Totally nuts. No prompting. I get a weird 800 call "You have an appt next week", but I have a vacation scheduled. You have "this window at this time". I know I can't miss because who knows how long 
it'll be before I get another one. Luckily I was only 4 hrs away. That was a very tough process. So when I read that I think "Ugh, not that again". But I have no choice, I have to do it. It's hideous.

M: If you were going to redesign how that worked, how would it work?

I would love to schedule it myself like you do a hotel reservation. But I know there's an intermediary that does reservations. I would love a hotel accessibility-type scheduler that I can access.
But maybe give the options about what times and day are best, give me the option to suggest feedback about what times are best. More of a two-way street rather than an 800 number telling you here's the 
time and you have to go.


M: With the phone calls, was it like "hey what can work for you" or "this is your date"?

No, it was just a date. If someone would have told me what to look out for, because I'll think it's a telemarketer. I heard a message with an automated time and called someone to find out if I don't go then I go back in the queue. 

### Final Thoughts and Questions:
Do you have any final thoughts about what you've seen? Anything especially interesting?
Sure, I appreciate the thoughtfulness and all the hard work and getting feedback. Thanks for all you do I mean that in a major way.
I love the mobile steps you're taking. I've attempted and I've stopped, I only use eBenefits on desktop. One thing I learned, it seems like
if there's good VSOs that really alleviates the burden of the staff. Operations are so overwhelmed. Getting us access to approved VSOs -- If I could automatically pick my contact ppl from here would make it feel more streamlined and official.


I was surprised -- On eBenefits I asked about Education, I got kicked over to vets.gov and living in a different shell. Is there a way to bring it all under one roof. I'd like to stay in one place and do all my business.
M: Yea, that's the mission of vets.gov, to pull all those things together in one place. That's part of what this project is about.

Other than that I really appreciate what you guys do.

### Gift Card Preference:
M: Would you prefer amazon gift card or paypal?

Paypal is cool

M: Should we use the info Kristin has been emailing you at?

Yes
