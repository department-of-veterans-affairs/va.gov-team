# Notes: 526 New Claims

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me about your time in the service
  - **[…] Reserve. Did my best but didn't make it through the course, was removed. Moved back into civilian life **
- Tell me about your experience with disability claims through the VA. 
  - **Minor ailments, treatments, never ending.**
  - Have you ever filed for a disability claim? 
    - **Have not. Did think about it, but it got away. […] Asked around to other Veterans. Not anything enough for me to take next steps**
    - *If yes,* could you share your experience with filing a claim? 
    - *If no,* have you considered filing for a disability claim? Tell me about the process.
      - Is there anything stopping you from filing for a disability claim?

## First Task: Getting to the form 

### Scenario
[Use staging server](http://staging.vets.gov)

You have an existing rating of 20% for amputation of the little finger on your left hand and tinnitus. 

You have recently come to realize that you are suffering from PTSD related to your service. Your doctor recommended that you make a claim for this new condition, as well as a cyst in your left wrist.

- If you wanted to file a claim for a new condition related to your service, show me how you would proceed using this site.
  - **Explore and Apply > Health Care. Thought I would go there first. I guess my case is more severe, so I'd go to disability. I'd go to Application Process first.**
  - What would you be eligible for?
- Given this scenario, which options would you choose if you were going to apply?

***Starts Claim***
[Use prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ)

### Things to watch for:
- Was the participant able to successfully begin a new claim?
- How did the participant respond to / understand eligibility information?
- How did the participant respond to the choices before applying?

## Second Task: Submitting a claim 
*remind about scenario if needed*

- [Didn't get info on triage questions since the prototype had an error, we had to skip it]
- What would you do here first?
  - **Scroll down. Read through it, start checking off boxes. [checked I have never had a disability claim before] > would go to Apply for Disability compensation. I felt I had all the info I needed, clicked "Apply" button. [step 1 of 7 Veteran information] Scroll down, all looks correct. Hit continue to the next step. Hit continue again. Hit continue again. [_ new conditions]**
- What are your thoughts on the instructions?
- *Guide through the body diagram*
  - **Click on one of the hands. Tried to click on the right side first. Would expect to be able to use red or yellow highlights to circle. Try to find the condition. Tried to open the name of the condition again. **
    - What were you trying to select?
      - **The last one - bullet / shell fragment**
      - **Actually, musculoskeletal. **
      - What condition are you trying to report?
        - **just the physical**
      - [reminder about scenario]
        - **Oh, okay, cyst.**
    - What advice or perspective have you gotten from other Veterans?
      - **beat the system. If it gets denied, just keep going. I know one Veteran who tried to mask a wound in order to get back into active duty. Did not notice that he had been _ out because he was trying to get back into the service. It shot him in the foot later because he ended up unemployed and couldn't get disability compensations. […] Some documents he reported - VA referred. back to those. He injured his right knee really badly. During the out processing, didn't realize that when the doctor was checking him out, it would have enormous consequences. When he realized he couldn't get back in 3 years ago, his knee was really bad. Tried to apply for disability, and they said no - your doctor told us there was no injury.**
    - what would you do next?
      - **Hopefully be able to note PTSD through another [...]**
      - It's okay to skip the PTSD section
        - **Okay, I'm good with skipping**
      - **Continue. Yes, it's service connected. Additional forms - continue. Additional benefits - maybe (chose yes for adaptive benefits, yes for vehicle and home, but prototype is limited to choose both of those). Only question is - for those benefits, why would it only be vehicle and home? There's other range of motion issues that need to be addressed due to digits lost. That's kind of confusing. Continue. Nursing home question.**
    - Unemployability
      - **I'd think long and hard about it. Whatever happens to my writing hand. […] Knowing everything in the interview section, not having a finger, what happened to that. Would I be able to work in a factory? Typing might be difficult. I'd be trying to cover all my bases and choose yes (unable to work due to disability). I've kind of dealt with this. Survival mode, not wanting to leave anything uncovered, can make a stronger case.**
      - Additional forms
        - ​
  - How was it going through that process?
- What do you expect will happen next?
- How are you feeling about the process at this point?

### Things to watch for:
- How does the participant go about submitting claims for multiple conditions (submitting each condition in a separate claim vs combining conditions into a single claim)?
- How does the participant respond to the body diagram interface?


- Does the participant feel supported?


## Third Task: Additional Benefits
### Scenario: 

[direct back to additional benefit step if needed] Suppose you are looking for assistive equipment for both your home and your vehicle.

- What is this first page telling you? 
- [direct to go through the process]
- What are your thoughts at this point (download additional forms)?
  - **Would be a little impatient. More forms. Do I even have a printer? Might have to go to library. […] step 5. I'd hold command and click to download each of the forms. On a phone, I'd just hold onto control and download both forms. **
  - **Oh, okay, I'm mostly finished here.**
  - **Okay, I'm finally done with this mobile process**
- What would you do next?
- What would you expect next?
  - **Be emailed about an appointment, submit documents needed, go through VA, appointment checkup and review.**
  - Is email your preferred method to get communication?
    - **yes.**
    - **Reminders, _ entries, […]**
  - How did appointment scheduling go?
    - **pretty impressive, lots of people trying to do their best. […]in the news. Got both emails and phone calls. I feel like the online process was extremely difficult. I was in [redacted] a very Veteran focused state. Found the hospital, called them. got directed to a specialty. Calling in, they understand your situation.**
    - **Tried to make sure our primary hospital had all the right forms. Proper documentation first, then we'll talk to you.**
### Things to watch for: 
- How does the participant respond to having to download additional forms?
- Does the participant know it's possible to save and come back (especially when having to download additional forms)?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- How do you feel after completing these steps?
- What would you expect to happen next?
- Was there anything surprising about the process?
  - **the app is very trusting, doesn't ask you to submit dd214, gets it down to 7 steps, which is pretty impressive.**
- Things that were most confusing?
  - **Additional documents you had to download, print, and sign off on, but that was not a high level kind of concern.**
- Any questions for me? 
  - **You're all doing good work. Appreciate it.**

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

- Gift card preference?
- Willing to share recruiting blurb via email?
