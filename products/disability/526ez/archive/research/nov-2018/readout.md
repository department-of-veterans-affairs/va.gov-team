# 526 usability read-out

Nov 28-29, 2018



## What we wanted to find out

[From the research plan](research-plan-unicorns-526-late-nov.md)
 The current process for telling the VA about new conditions technically works, but is confusing and unpleasant.
 Can we ask questions in a way that will let us provide accurate mapping to contention claim IDs without overly burdening the Veteran?
 Are the pay waiver questions helping Veterans get to the correct choice?



## Who we talked to

We recruited 5 participants and spoke with all 5.

- 1 woman, 4 men
- Air Force, Marines
- 45-73 years old
- California, Colorado, Missouri, Tennessee

We ran through a few tasks using a form on Staging. We also ran through a few tasks in slightly different way using a clickable mobile prototype.




## What we learned

- Participants preferred to answer a few questions vs. typing a short description.
 - Overall, we received positive reactions to the questions we asked.
- Some people ended up taking the wrong path because of the way the content was formatted.
  - We plan to improve this flow to prevent that.
- People prefer a shorter, more structured process (less typing) over the potentially more difficult process of typing a description
- There was some tension around waiving pay
  - Participants wanted examples of separation pay with contextual help
  - One participant wanted explanation that repaying money means delaying benefits
    - Give clear examples of the differences between training pay & compensation, i.e. “In general, training pay is going to be more than your compensation pay”
    - Provide contextual help for additional guidance — examples with specific dollar amounts would be ideal
- Veterans had some confusion around disability ratings, especially those at 100%
  - Help the Veteran understand whether it’s productive for them to file for an increase
  - Some conditions max out below 100%; some can go above 100%
- We learned that talking about pay is high stakes and stress-inducing
  - By explaining what was happening and giving examples, we were able to get people over the hump of tension and confusion
  - People reacted positively to having real $ examples to look at
  - Provide context on the impact of giving up retirement pay





## Next steps

 - Simplify the waiving retirement pay table
   - Keep in mind that this pattern could also be useful in other places
 - Provide more realistic examples with dollar amounts when possible
 - Explore whether it's worth giving people a choice between answering questions or writing a description
