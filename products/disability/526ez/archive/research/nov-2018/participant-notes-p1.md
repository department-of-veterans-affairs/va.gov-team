##### What is your service background?
I did almost 25 yrs in the Marines. 

##### Have you used VA services?
Other than my original claim when I retired I have not really used them.

##### Was that disability compensation, education benefits or something else?
It was disability claim and I actually also used GI Bill, one of my dependents used part of my Post 9/11 GI Bill.

##### Healthcare, home loans, anything like that?
I probably used the home loans three times. Not the healthcare but it's probably something I need to do but I know it requires a lot of your time so it's just something I haven't done yet.

#### Disabilities Intro
I would hit Continue.

#### Rated Disabilities
Do you have any thoughts about what you see here?
So far I like it.

#### New Disabilities
Ok, continue. 

So far if I was using this for myself I'd probably input something there and then add another disability.

##### Where would you want to put data and what would you want to put?
Under Add a New Disability, I'd probably put some specific areas of pain.

##### If you were putting that [PTSD] in what would you type in the box?
I would put my ability to deal with co-workers and superiors seemed to decline. I noticed it after my first combat deployment. The short-temperedness, quick response, and lack of patience. It's affected me on several different jobs. My ability to deal with stress is affecting me physically more than it ever has.

I would add one. Developed allergies and they've increasingly gotten worse. 

I had one more disability and that would be Respiratory. The doctor has prescribed me some inhalers to use.

I like the dropdown, anytime you have a dropdown that can make it easier and quicker.

##### Has there been anything in the dropdown you'd interact with? 
The 'Respiratory Complaints' or 'Sign and symptoms involving respiratory system. If we could click one that's be great.

#### Service-Connection Details
ability to deal with co-workers declined: I would pick the first [bullet]. I would say my temperament and personality changed after I came back from my first deployment. Due to the amount of stress for an extended period. The exposure to pollution and taking lives and giving people orders to take lives. Seeing a mess of flesh. Being in a leadership position, I was not able to get very much sleep.

Developed Allergies: never really had allergies but skin got dry and red. I've had several sinus infections. 

Is there anything else you want to change or add?

Signs or Symptoms Involving Respiratory system: that's pretty much a duplicate so I'd pick the first [bullet]. [Details] Definitely susceptible to low air quality. Maybe allergy related? The air quality is so bad in a combat zone. We followed tank rounds, stuff was on fire continuously as result of a fire fight or bombing. We were constanly around burning garbage or debris and fires caused by explosions or bombing.

#### Retirement Pay
I think it looks pretty clear to me that I'd want to select the VA Compensation pay.

What were the things that pushed you in that direction?
The chart. When you start talking about what's taxable income and not it gets your attention. It made be read the second sentence twice [VA Compensation pay isn't taxable...]. I read it quickly and re-read then I read the chart and I would probably select receive VA comp pay due to the fact that it's not taxable.

I think it's a valuable sentence that you don't want to overlook [VA Comp Pay]. Maybe you can put it in italics, I don't know if bold is the answer but some way to make it distinguished. 

If we were going to re-write it would you assemble those words differently?
I don't really like the dollar for dollar wording. You could probably get rid of that. The rest says everything it needs to.

Are there any other things like that on this page that you would do differently?
I think the chart maybe can be simplified a little bit. I'm not sure you need to show compensation and retirement for take-home pay both ways. So instead of compensation and retirement across the top, make it a line item.

I like how you have the options worded, especially the second one. It's almost like saying are you sure you don't want a better benefit.

Before I advance I'd want to know are there any advantages to waiving your retirement pay. Is there anything negative that you would give up. So the other side of the argument if there is any.

#### Separation/Training Pay
I was taking aminute to think with my retirement/pension pay, I don't think it was separation or severance pay but I wanted to  take a moment and digest that.

What did inactive duty training pay make you think about?
I made a quick assumption that it was related to the reserves or something like that. Other than that, I didn't know anything about it. I did a tour with as an instructor/inspector with the reserve unit so I remember inactive duty as reserve related. Maybe distinguish it as applicable to those who are in the Reserve.

#### FDC
I was trying to understand exactly what that program is because I'm not familiar with it. I'd probably click on learn more and read through that.

#### v2 Add New Contentions
Can you select both options? I guess I'd go to answer some questions.

"How would you like to describe"...to me it seems like you'd want to type a brief description and then from there you'd answer some questions. That way I'm not going down a rabbit hole. I'd prob want to answer questions and let them ask the specific questions they want answered and I'd think that'd be better. 

[After entering condition] I'd probably hit save and would be  curious to see what happens. I like the ability to go back because I might just select ask me questions. It depends on where type a brief description led me.

[For PTSD path] I don't like the warning (Later we'll ask you more questions...). Because of what we're doing, you'd pretty much expect to be asked more details. I'm not sure what the purpose is. So you can be more prepared maybe so it's more of a warning. I'm not saying this is a better way, but another way to present is to say we're going to ask more details so if you need set aside extra time or make preparations.

If you clicked 'Muscle or bone' what would you expect to see? A list of which body part, toes, hands, feet, whatever.

[Hip or leg] Does it break it down again even more specific? Right now I have to assume hip or leg will include the foot. I would expect to ask me parts of the leg if I hit continue. A little more detail would be great. Anything to make it shorter and simpler to get to the point. The less layers you have to go through to get to what you're trying to accomplish, most people I think would prefer that. If I'm going to stop and read the question, more information will be  better.

I've experience on  few occasions that if you scroll it will change your options so if you could safeguard that, that would be helpful. I've experienced where I've had to go back and doublecheck my answers.

Anyway we can can de-clutter if I can answer 3 questions instead of 6. 

##### We have these two paths you've seen, one where you type info in the box another where you answer questions, which would you be more likely to use?
I guess it would depend on the ailment. If it was like PTSD I'd rather type where I can expand but I might miss certain things, I like where you can describe it and add your detail to it. I guess I like the questions because it's less typing I have to do and I can just click a button. I'd lean towards that.

##### Any final thoughts about what you've seen?
No, I think the timing is great because I've been feeling like I need to go and address some of this stuff. If you have something similar to this, it encourages me to do some of the things I've been putting off for a while. You're on the right track.

#### Key Takeaways for Consideration:
- entered a full story in the new disability field where we say "as much detail as possible" in the guidance, but this is intended to be brief
Retirement Pay
- simplify table, move retirement and compensation labels to the left 
- remove "dollar for dollar" text
- make the second sentence bold
- provide info on what the impact of giving up retirement pay would be
- define inactive training pay 
- re-write/remove notification for PTSD path for v2
