- Army 1989-1999
- Missouri
- Worked in the medical field
  - Felt like it was my right to file a claim
  - Hospital commander chewed my ass for requesting a VA physical
  - Had been a paratrooper with lots of back and knee problems
    - Turned out to be a life-saving even for me
      - Within a couple of months of being discharged I had an MS exacerbation
        - Had had those symptoms throughout my service. Had gotten an MRI that revealed a lot of lesions. That MRI later disappeared.
  - Applied at VA hospital, one of the first several soldiers to go through the doors at Ft Leonardwood
  - I have always used an advocate from the PVA.
- TBI sometimes easier to work on hard copy
- I think it's a game with the VA. They lowball you and people get disappointed and never file again.
  - Met a WW2 veteran who had been a POW and under artillery, but got an initial 30% rating and then reduced to 10% in the 70s
- Is that a thing to fluster people, having to go to eBenefits. I’d be pissed and either quit or go find someone to do the work for me.
- Sometimes the VA doctors are telling you something different than private doctors



- "I would go get an advocate" at login state due to lack of trust with MyHealtheVet
  - Cath story
  - Limp story
- I don't trust the VA to pull my records in a timely manner
