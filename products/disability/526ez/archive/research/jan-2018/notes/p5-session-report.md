# Participant Description

Describe the participant in a few sentences, including their role within the system, why we’ve chosen them for a feedback session and relevant demographic information.

# Key Findings

List summary Info here. 3 to 4 bullet points

## From Research Goals

1. **Are users able to successfully self-select onto the correct path (claim for increase)?**
   1. Yes
2. **Do users feel supported during the flow?**
   1. Suspicion about the VA being able to "get it right". Uploading medical records, some distrust about being able to get it right
   2. Had questions about how to document his application, what would happen next, concerned with printing the confirmation screen
      1. not sure if info below the "print this page" text would come through. Thought "print this page" was a link
3. **Do users feel confused during the flow?**
   1. Didn't know what his VA file number was, tried to enter his SSN there
   2. Didn't know what to do with the flashes page, just kept going since none of them applied to him. not a big impediment
   3. (a little thrown off by) Login prompt being in the middle
   4. Had been seen at multiple facilities. Didn't know which facility to enter first, talked through that a lot. Later saw the "add another facility"
   5. May have entered facilities for all of his treatment, not just those where he had been seen after his original claim. Not sure if he was clear on the scenario given in the conversation guide.
   6. Not sure how to classify a private doctor who is paid by the VA
      1. May need to address the text we put in
   7. **What would users do if they were moving to a new address in the future? (forwarding address)**
      1. Would edit the primary address
      2. Didn't get forwarding address
         1. he would use forwarding address for a snowbird scenario
4. **Are users able to get to the end of the flow and "submit" without feeling cheated by VA?**
   1. Basically yes. 
   2. Questions about VA's competency 
   3. Interested in emailing the confirmation screen to himself
5. **Do users easily understand whether to upload supplemental docs / what types of docs to upload?**
   1. **How important it is to veterans to upload additional documents?**
      1. Thought if he had been seen by VA providers, he shouldn't have to upload any of that
6. **What should we expect about how often a user would leave and come back in the process before submitting?**
   1. **Do they know their progress is saved if they leave and come back?**
      1. Understood progress would be saved with the "save your progress" link
7. **Expectations / reactions about length of form**
   1. ​

## Other Findings

1. Expected we would be comparing facility names against a table
2. Being able to do this on a phone is good, particularly for younger veterans
3. Wanted to expand the width of the prototype

## Discussion

A discussion covering the following points:

* Give possible explanations for the results, including explanations related to the program as well as external causes. 
* Discuss the implications of the results for the outcomes and impact of the program.
* Outline potential recommendations based on findings.
  * Do we need to:
    * Iterate?
    * Fix bugs in prototype?
    * Modify conversation guide?
    * Adjust number of future participants?
