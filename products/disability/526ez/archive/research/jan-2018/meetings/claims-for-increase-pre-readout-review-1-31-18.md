1. Background slide (Rachael & Melissa can put it together)
   1. Could go over painpoints we've heard already from prior research
   2. Scope of what we're doing
   3. Want to see if the new prototype allows people to feel confident and supported
2. Objective
   1. From earlier round: feelings of stress, reduce anxiety, increase comfort of making correct choices
      1. Find where people were feeling supported / not feeling supported
   2. Consider flipping hierarchy of the heading
3. Show prototype inside the phone?
   1. May not need to even link to the prototype / show the distinction between p1 and p2 and the rest
   2. Consider animated gif
4. Participants
   1. Don't need to show names
   2. Would be useful to show disability claim status
   3. Assisted / unassisted?
      1. All of our participants were assisted, could say that on the process slide
   4. Age / gender / ethnicity? - not sure about what's acceptable
      1. Sentence about "we spoke to people with a range"
   5. Map is useful
      1. doesn't have to carry all the info
5. Findings from initial claims "reconfirmed" - can shorten the barriers to initial claim slide
   1. Hadn't heard the bit about actively discouraged from physicals before - can move it to appendix
   2. "what we learned before is still true"
6. Self-selection
   1. Can visually simplify: choices & the stat next to it
      1. establish a visual language for the # / # findings or "needs work" versus "successful"
7. Feeling supported
   1. Emphasize the goal, overall, note that they did feel supported
   2. Key areas: highlight each on separate slides (esp. personal flashes - show the two sides to it: the feeling of support and the expectations about follow-up)
   3. "personal flash" - spell it out what it is
8. Lack of support
   1. Could break each out into its own finding
      1. screenshots for each
      2. Not sure what was going to happen next: can go into a lot of detail about that
   2. VA shouldn't have to ask for medical records: we have heard that before from the earlier round. Should we revisit the previous round's findings?
   3. wanting to complete a paper form or have someone help isn't necessarily a lack of support - context of the individual's background would also be helpful - could put it in the appendix to consider for a later effort
   4. Could alternate between pro-support and lack of support findings for pacing
9. How many participants for each finding?
10. Journey map from previous round in appendix?
11. Confusion around moving: should we separate findings into "big head scratchers" versus smaller changes like copy that would address them?
12. Confidence in VA for uploading records
    1. distinctions: having the records handy, not trusting the VA to do it quickly, not trusting the VA to do it accurately
    2. was it just 1 person who didn't trust back paying to the effective date? could take it out
       1. Could move it to the appendix
13. Supplemental documents?
    1. Solutions:
       1. List Examples? 
       2. Note that for claims for increase, not much will be helpful
    2. Background: we know VA has a problem with people over-submitting
    3. Will people know whether to upload the right amount of info? The answer is "sort of" 
14. Log in
    1. Add description of the landing page
       1. No mention of claims for increase - the page was targeted toward applying for a new claim
    2. Some of it is for other teams
       1. thinking the choice will give them different info
15. Length
    1. ~30 slides is not unreasonable
16. Next steps
    1. Adjusting Language
    2. Don't put in the yes / no questions a-la cal fresh
17. Alex can help with visuals
