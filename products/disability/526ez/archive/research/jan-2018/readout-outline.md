# Findings

## Background for filing disability claims

1. Barriers to applying initially
   1. Not knowing about benefits available
   2. Confusion about eligibility
   3. Superiors in active duty explicitly discouraged asking for VA physicals
   4. Cumbersome user experience in eBenefits
2. Most participants only applied after repeated encouragement by a friend or family member
3. Most had help with their initial applications

## From research objectives

1. **Are users able to successfully self-select onto the correct path (claim for increase)?**
   1. 5/6 participants initially chose the right path for submitting a claim for increase
   2. 1/6 participants chose incorrectly (at two different points) on a second pass through submitting a claim
2. **Do users feel supported during the flow? (what do we mean by supported?)**
   1. 4/6 participants indicated feeling supported at some point. 
      1. Both the ease of the process and the step of asking personal flash questions were noted as a way they felt that the VA was supporting them in this process.
   2. 6/6 participants indicated feeling a lack of support at some point. 
      1. After submitting a claim, several participants noted not knowing enough about what was going to happen next and not trusting the VA to follow up in a timely manner - they expressed a desire for more step-by-step updates about their claim along the way. Many participants immediately wanted to save the confirmation number and print the "claim received" screen, though they noted challenges with printing from a mobile device.
      2. Some thought the VA shouldn't have to ask for even the amount of medical information that they did (which VA facility to go to in order to retrieve records) because the VA should have that information already
      3. One participant in particular noted he would want to complete a paper form since it's easier for him to keep track of things on paper, and he would have abandoned the process at several points (login, the "triage" step of choosing what he wanted to apply for) and go get an advocate to help him complete it.
3. **Do users feel confused during the flow?**
   1. Key areas of confusion:
      1. 2 participants initially missed the "add another VAMC" button and tried to put multiple medical centers into the field for a single one. One participant found it later
      2. 1 participant thought the personal flash questions were the only ways to qualify
      3. 1 participant didn't know what a VA file number was and tried to enter a social security number there
      4. 1 participant didn't understand what "If my consent to access my records is limited, that limit is written here" was asking
   2. **What would users do if they were moving to a new address in the future? (forwarding address)**
      1. 4 / 6 participants misinterpreted the "forwarding address" or didn't think it applied to the scenario in which they would be permanently moving in the near future
         1. Some wanted to use "forwarding address" for a "snowbird" scenario
         2. Some would put their new address in the main address fields, omitting their current address
      2. 1 / 6 participants immediately understood to use the "forwarding address" for its intended scenario
4. **Are users able to get to the end of the flow and "submit" without feeling cheated by VA?**
   1. 3/6 participants expressed feelings of being cheated by the VA. All of these seem to be driven by prior experiences with the VA, and steps in the application sometimes triggered the sentiment.
      1. 1 had the expectation that veterans should appeal everything, no matter what, so that participant would be driven to use the appeal process more than we might expect
      2. 1 didn't trust MyHealtheVet to log in since he associated it with the VA health system and thought that there, one becomes "nothing more than a number that they push through"
      3. 2 expressed frustration at the stated length of time to process a claim (95 days)
   2. 3/6 participants got through the flow *without* showing any signs of feeling cheated by the VA
      1. 1 expected the VA would have all their VA medical records, and therefore thought most of this form was superfluous
      2. 3 were comfortable providing payment information
         1. 1 had some concern about providing payment information and would put in "another account", not their main bank account, in order to receive payments
   3. **cases where users had low confidence in the VA but didn't feel cheated _yet_**
      1. thought if none of the personal flash options applied, their application would be "dumbed down and pushed out of the system", but continued on, saying "let's see"
      2. 4/6 expressed not trusting the VA to follow up after submitting the claim (or lose the claim or not be true to the effective date), so there was a strong tendency to document everything at the "claim received" step.
      3. 3/6 indicated they would upload private medical records themselves because they thought it would be faster than the VA obtaining them
         1. 3/6 thought having the VA obtain records for them would be easier than manually uploading
         2. 1 was ambivalent about VA retrieving private records versus manually uploading them
5. ***Do users easily understand whether to upload supplemental docs / what types of docs to upload?***
   1. 3 / 6 participants felt supported enough to upload supplemental documents without wanting to upload absolutely everything
   2. 3 / 6 participants either didn't know what to upload, wanted to upload absolutely everything (which may bog down the claim), or wanted to upload a document type that we weren't sure would be supported (an MRI)
   3. 1 mentioned challenges around uploading the files from a phone and primarily used a phone rather than a computer at home (p4)
   4. _ Dropbox? (check notes)
   5. **How important it is to veterans to upload additional documents?**
      1. 3/6 wanted to upload supplemental documents
      2. 1/6 thought there wouldn't be any need to upload additional documents
6. **What should we expect about how often a user would leave and come back in the process before submitting?**
   1. (we didn't ask everyone this, but) 1 participant noted they would prefer to do this application all at once rather than saving and coming back 
   2. **Do they know their progress is saved if they leave and come back?**
      1. 3 / 6 thought their info would be saved if they left and came back
      2. (note that we changed the prototype midway) 2 / 6 participants thought their info would not be saved if they left and came back
7. **Expectations / reactions about length of form**
   1. 2 participants thought the length was acceptable or better than expected
   2. 1 participant thought that most of this process was unnecessary because the VA should already have these records

## Other

1. 4 / 6 wanted to log in before starting
2. Intro page
   1. 2/6 people thought they weren't in the right place / Some participants thought "apply" wasn't the right term on the button to begin the process because they were "updating" an existing claim
      1. prototype change (along with save language)
         1. Button text changed from "apply for compensation" to "start the application" and moved up the page
   2. 1/6 (p1) Trying to follow the breadcrumb "apply for compensation" initially
3. Offramps: sending to eBenefits
   1. 1/6 was extremely frustrated with being redirected to eBenefits
   2. 1/6 had high hopes and expected eBenefits to be as quick as the process on vets.gov (but those hopes were likely to be dashed)
4. 2/6 Selecting single condition and then continuing (rather than selecting both before continuing) (number is underrepresented because a prototype change mid-way through revealed this - earlier sessions did not have a chance to only select one and then continue)
   1. 2/6 intentionally selected both conditions and continued
5. reactions to 95 days processing time
6. 1 Wanted to immedaitely see feedback of what records VA already has (p3)

## Relevant outside of this effort

1. Login choices
   1. DS Logon - always asking for password resets?
   2. ID.me - unclear about it? or not sure what it was?
   3. MyHealtheVet
      1. "…MyHealtheVet: at this point, I wouldn’t trust it… To me that’s the VA health system and sometimes you become nothing more than a number that they push through"
   4. Thought the choice would have an effect on the claim or ability to get records

# Open Items

1. Determine what kinds of supporting documents / how many will be helpful or harmful to claims, under various conditions
   1. maybe not MVP?
      1. Understand what would be helpful and writing about it: we could do fairly easily
      2. Tying specific guidance to conditions: bigger lift. lots of complexity and DBQs
   2. mostly for claims for increase, you don't have to attach any
   3. **Talk to rating officials to find out what docs to ask for**
2. What can we do with the personal flash info?
   1. Have people follow up to responses?
3. CSRA questions
   1. 4142 / eBenefits
   2. Related conditions
4. "If my consent to access my records is limited, that limit is written here" - can we change it to a checkbox (can we legally diverge from the paper forms to that extent)?

# Next Steps

1. Enough info to build out the next version in staging and test, not necessarily enough to go live right away
   1. branching paths will be much easier to get feedback on in a live site
2. Language: Peggy
   1. Conditional / targeted help
      1. Explain the "why" behind it: why is VA asking for it?
3. Triage questions: might want to change order (place it before apply? content wizard?)
   1. Acknowledge that there's other stuff we are working on. Reduce the painpoint of offramps to eBen. Help build rapport
4. Consider series of Yes / No questions a-la Cal Fresh
   1. but consider fatigue with many questions
   2. can provide help resources at each step

## Findings With Supporting Quotes / Observations

# To Do

1. **Team - What do we mean by "supported during the flow"?**
2. **Mike - Distinguish feeling cheated by VA versus expecting things may go wrong in the future**
3. **Alex - share document templates for readouts to Mike & Elissa**
4. Put together the readout document, good example: [Laura Cochran - eBenefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/sep-2017/ebenefits-526-baseline-usability-testing.pdf) (note that it's only to be referenced for format, not for the takeaways without context)
   1. organized around insights and proof of where it came from
   2. Visuals are helpful, Alex offered to help with it
   3. Human centered, prominently featured quotes, 
      1. full bleed photos with quotes over them
   4. Set up an internal review of the example - **mike**
5. Next: 2 readouts
   1. Vets.gov team
      1. Team building the thing, why it's taking the direction
      2. DSVA people (like Marcy), help us position it correctly before presenting to stakeholders
   2. Stakeholders
