How have you interacted witht the VA?
Mostly going to VA for nedical appointments. I've gone onlie to refill emy medications.

What site do you use for the medication stuff?
MyHealtheVet

Yes, I've cancelled appointments using the online method and I've applied for intent to file (benefits application). I sent in and in less than a month they said it was denied so I didn't know what to do with that. There's nothing I can add to it. I was medically retired so all my disabilities were applied for and granted already.

Did you do a BDD claim?
It was done for me as a medical retirement. I had everything finished before I got out. I applied later for other things I didn't think about. Other people told me to do my intent to file before I was out so that's what I did. I don't have any records outside of what I told them. I didn't go to medical everyday for the things. For example, sleep apnea. I've been told for years that I should get checked out. I got checked out by the VA after I got denied because I had an appointment coming up already.

Did you work on your on or use a VSO?
I worked on my own. I did contact a VSO and I think he misunderstood my whole reasoning. He said I wouldn't get anymore and I wasn't looking for more, I was trying to get the determination that this was from service. I kind of got bad advice from the VSO. I received one back and the other one is being reviewed.

What is your background in the military?
I was an engineman in the Navy, 2005 to 2017. I was in the mine sweeps as an engineer for 5 or 6 years, I went to GITMO, was on landing craft for last few years of my career. Due to medications I was on, I had to get medically discharged.

When you applied did you use a paper form or eBenefits?
The first time, for medical retirement, it was on paper I believe but I was being helped. The second time, I did it myself on eBenefits.

## Intro Page
[Asked participant to think out loud about his observations.]
Pretty straightforward. From this page I would click the Application button. 

## Veteran Details
Retirement Waiver - I like that it spells it out here. I was in a unique situation, my retirement was more than my compensation. I understood it when it happened. I could only get the tax-free portion from the VA because I couldn't get both. Most people are going to get more from VA. I understood when they offset it and I got 2 checks. I think it was described better than the other one [eBen]

Is there anything we could add to that screen to make it better?
An example. Like specific dollar amounts. In ny instance your retirement amount is $2300 and VA dollar amount is 'X', show you'll be getting this much plus this much tax-free from VA and it'll equal out to the same amount. There's a lot of younger ppl retiring for medical and depending on their situation they don't get retirement and VA check at the same time. It's one or the other or an offset. A visual aid would be helpful because I don't think the words did it for me before until I saw what was happenening with my pay and then I understood. 

I've never heard the term training pay. Maybe an information box and a little more detail.

## Rated Disabilities
If I'm going to try to get an increase on one of these, I would click on it and then continue.

Is there anything we can do to make this screen more clear?
No. It's pretty laid out in my opinion.

## Add New Disability
Did you feel like you needed to match from the list?
Yes. Because a lot of these things for people not in a medical field, you might not know what it's called. There should be an area where if unsure you can type in what you think it is, like a free type, not listed sort of thing. 

I'm confused when I type in a new disability. I don't see a button. I don't know if that worked or not. Don't know if it took.
[Briefly describe the injury or event]
I don't remember this part. I like when you can freely enter what it is you're trying to say. It's good to be able to explain yourself. I know there's always character limits. I like to be pretty thorough. I would expect people are going to read this I don't know if they do or not. If I remember correct with ITF (eBenefits) it didn't give me this option. I had to delete and change it so it would fit in the character box.

What kind of detail do you think we're asking for?
I would try to add the injury, I would describe the condition in my words and when I believed it happened and go into now, what's making it worse. There's no proof of it other than before I left service I told both my medical providers and the VA appointment for them to give you your benefits and then it came back denied because there was no proof during service. So I would like to put all the info in there, dates, times, including since I'm compensating one more than the other, now it's both. Room to write, I'd rather have the word there than not.

If you were to give someone else advice on how to fill this out what would you say?
I've heard - make sure you use that are in the thing you can look at (procedural guide with the condition descriptions) so it can match. I would just say write what you feel, don't be limited.

When you see brief what does that mean to you?
A couple of sentences I would say. But I feel like if you're brief they're going to be brief with you.

[Date this injury began]
Some things happen over time. I might use a date range. I might put the first day of service. For tinnitus, I didn't hear it until I stopped working in the engine rooms. I feel dates are important but I feel you wouldn't know when it happened. All I know is I hear it now.

Do you have any sense for why VA is asking this question.
To make sure it happened during service. To deem that it's service connected.

## Supporting Evidence
Other than going to VA, I don't have any supporting evidence so I would say 'No' because they should have my medical records.
I don't like this [blue box] if you say no. It's kind of like a warning.

They threatened I would lose my retirement benefits if I didn't have my records. The warning worries me. For VA medical records, I don't see why I should have to provide that. It shouldn't be that hard for the VA to find it.

[Last day you received treatement]
Maybe a note here that says it can be last appointment day or ongoing. Last time, I had an appointment the next day. I see "treatment" and I think I wasn't "treated" there. They just ask questions.

## Exam Info
That's pretty much what they did when I went to my C&P -- someone called me.

Where was it most confusing?
Just the dates and being able to explain yourself in your own words. More often than not, people are told "you don't have that". I go to the VA and the doctor says oh, ok I'll mark it in your records. They don't help you with your VA claim. It's hard because they don't want to say something because it'll help you with your benefit it feels like. They should be helping you out just as much.


### Key Takeaways for Consideration:
- specific numeric example to explain retirment pay waiver
- define training pay so it is clear what that means
- wanted free text for adding new disabilities (what if my condition isn't listed)
- make it clear that a new disability was added
- hard to know what start date to put in newly added conditions that happened over time (only year required by EVSS)
- Answered No for supporting evidence because the VA had records (what if VA has my records)
- didn't like 'warning' for no evidence

# P2

Could you tell me about your military background?
The initail experience I had with VA is when I was wounded overseas in Vietnam. I was sent to VA for an evaluation for service-connected disability and I was awarded 10% for hearing loss due to a mine explosion. I continued with that determination until approx 1996 when after I went to test for hearing for a job with the Air Force, they sent me over to the VA because they determined it was bad. At that point my hearing went yo 60% and a couple of years later it went to 80%. Then in 2016 I believe, I was encouraged to reapply to determine whether it should go up again. They also recommended a PTSD screening because of what I went through overseas. They said I had PTSD and 70% of my disability was fron PTSD so that took me to 100%. They didn't check my hearing again because you can't get anymore. I've been on retirement from the Marine Corps for about a year and a half. So I come to the VA for issues that I have and also a connection to my family doctor.

I was medically discharged from the Marine Corps with 10% severance pay. I was wounded in 1968 and in 1969 I was discharged.

How do you apply for benefits?
I applied online, had to submit some things by paper but the majority was online. Using eBenefits.

## Intro page
I like the idea of the prefilling. It takes a lot of time to look for info so that helps a lot. Notifying the veteran that they have to be between 180 to 90 days from end of service is a good thing. I've found it difficult to order records from the National Archive. I believe there was a fire and a lot of records were destroyed and I think they're trying to reclaim but they're not doing well. I've not received my medical records, I've received my service medals and my Purple Heart.

I like "learn what information you would need before you start doing some claim". What kind of help would you get with your claim? I hope it's not some counselor. There are great ones but and there are not-so-great ones. A lot of times you get the wrong information. I've called different people and gotten different answers.

[Clicked 'Get Help Filing Your Claim' and tried to use the menu to navigate back.]

It might be helpful to put start after you read 'Prepare and Need Help' [put button further down the page]. People should read this before they start.

[VA Review]
I would put between 16 and 18 months. eBenefits allows you to go in and check your claim but some of that info is confusing. In my case, they asked me for info then said they made a decision already because they reached a conclusion that I was already at 100%.

I would probably take it [the Start button] off the top.

## Veteran Details
[Feel free to move through the form, don't feel obligated to follow any particular path.]
It saves it each time. I like that. That way you can't lose what you put in if your computer kicks you out.

I don't know what training pay is? What is that? Is there a place to define that? I like the idaea of explaining that so you don't have to guess.


## Rated Disabilities
[Intro]
Is it rated disabilities by the military or the VA?

What does rated disabilities mean to you?
It would mean you went through some sort of evaluation. The Physical Evaluation Board gives you a percentage of your pay, which is considered a rating then the VA rates you as well when you come back home. When I read that, I would wonder if you are saying did I have a rated disabilities in the military

## Add new disability
Unless someone has gone to a doctor. If you asked me the name of my disability, I would say hearing loss. You might mistkae this to mean the medical or clinical name. You might change this to say describe the condition in as much detail as possible. Some might say, "my knee don't work", perhaps you could give examples underneath that [text field]. Most would look at this and say, this is something I don't really want to do. If I said my back aches, is that going to be enough to get a rating?

When I was just coming out of the marine corps I was a 21 year old kid, I couldn't describe my disability because I didn't know what it was. Other people might be able to describe it better. A lot believe that all VA specialists are looking for a way not to give you compensation. They know the VA and the military is very stingy. So if you're looking to describe something you want to make it look as bad as you possibly can. Is the VA going to bring you in and do a complete examination on you to make sure you have a problem and it's service-connected. So perhaps this should be "describe the incident that caused the disability and the result". To me that starts the argument that this is a service-connected disability.

My disability was caused by VA mistreatment...what does that mean?
M: What would you think that means?
What happens if the VA screws up your operation. That sounds like an accident. This sounds almost intentional.

[Got kicked out of logged in session and had to log back in.]
["Please wait while we check your ITF"]
Would it hurt to spell it [ITF] out?

## Supporting Evidence
[no comments]
Was there anything in there that you wanted to comment on?
No.

## Exam Info
I like this. One thing I would put in there is telling the veteran if they've never been to the VA before that they'll be compensated for the trip. Some can't afford the cost of transportation and some are homeless.

## Additional Info
I like when the addresses are loaded so that would be good. It prevents you from making a lot of mistakes. Anything you can do to make it simpler. They're more likely to do something about it and file. A lot of people look at these things and think I'm not going to do that because I'll just be wasting my time. I had a friend that never went to VA because he felt it was more work than it was worth. I think if something's more user-friendly, it makes it a lot simpler. 

[Homeless POC]
That's going to be a problem. Some of these guys don't have anybody they can call. A suggestion - perhaps a shelter.I see some and they wouldn't be able to tell you a number on a good day.

Do you think it would be likely for a homeless veteran to know the shelter?
A lot are on Methodone or other drugs, there's ppl who will have their contact details because they need them. They're going to know that and might be able to give it to you.My daughter was an addict. She moved around so much it was hard to get in contact with her. I think she did have friends that knew where she was or maybe the number for a homeless shelter. We don't think about people who don't have phones or cell phones.

## Review
VAMC
If I had treatment, can the database go to the year and show me all the treatment I had.

How would you fill this out if you knew the year but not the month or day?
I would just put the year in but it says it's required. That would create a definite conundrum for me. Then you just get nothing that means anything anyway. I could just put [dates] and now I sent you on a wild goose chase. If I said hearing loss, there is no treatment for hearing loss. The only treatment that happened was 30 years later -- they provided me a hearing aid. I think it means when did you first seek attention. On that I would say when did you first go to the VA for those conditions. Sometimes we speak eloquently when simple does it. Some people don't speak the same way. It needs to be a simple form for them because most have the attitude they aren't going to get anything.


### Key Takeaways for Consideration:
- remove top Start button and just have one at the bottom
- define training pay so it is clear what that means
- "VA mistreatment" was unclear
- Homeless POC, maybe indicate a facility instead of a person
- Dates for VAMC treatment are difficult for month and day
- VAMC "when did you first receive treatment" suggest "when did you first go to the VA"

# P3

Have you used VA benefits? Can you tell me a little about your military background?

I was active duty for 24 years. I started out as medical lab tech for first 6 then transitioned and became a support officer and did personnel for the last 18.

As fara s VA, I'm 100% disabled. I used Vocational Rehab and Education. I'm on a lot of the apps frequently. I have a VA loan. I'm on My VA Health app. The VA medical center is my primary mode for medical care.

When you did your application did you use paper or eBenefits?
eBenefits -- I went to DC and it was a blended process but I've been using eBenefits since I got out.  

## Veteran Details
I like the fact that you have this "this is who you'll need to call [for changes to profile]. Specifically the issue for me has been my kids, because I get DEA. Because the VA doesn't talk to each other, it's difficult because you'll do some forms and have to complete it multiple times so the biggest thing is having a place where you do the form once and then it shoots out to everybody who needs it.

What kind of data for dependents caused the most trouble across the different departments?
Specifically, I got a divorce so filing that. When I retired, they told me to put all my kids on there but my 2 daughters went to school right away and got DEA so we pulled them off and I had to transition them from being on mine to the DEA. So I'm still paying a 5K date because even though I told them, they didn't process the paperwork right and kept paying me. It was convoluted so it's that sort of stuff. Dependents are prob the biggest thing since I've been out.

## Disabilities Intro
Do you have any suggestions for this?
What happens if you don't have rated disabilities? I think the screen for me made me think I was suppose to be looking for something.

## Add New Disability
What would you do if you were less comfortable with the terminology?
I don't know. I would probably google it, look it up, talk to my doctor.

I think it's very intuitive.

## Supporting Evidence Intro
How would you know what the VA already has? That's one of the issues. You think they have stuff then you find out it's not all there. So that screen might be another place to say if you have questions or need assistance, contact this number. Because I think what most people find when doing the compensation it's frustrating because you get into loops where you don't know who to talk to and you feel like you've done what you've been asked but then you find out a thing got held up because a piece of paper is missing. This puts the onus on the individual but the individual doesn't know what they don't know.

## Supporting Evidence
VAMC
[Autofill overrode VAMC entry]

## Exams
Does this info match your experience/what you've heard?
Makes sense to me. It's consistent with what I've heard.

## Homelessness
Did you have any thoughts about this?
This makes perfect sense.

Thinking back are there any frustrating parts that stand out?
No, I actually think this is really intuitive. The data you collect at the end is hopefully going to be very helpful. I would like to see the upload process to make sure its smooth. The one area about putting who to go to if you have questions. Even if you could just put a checklist re: what you need for a complete package so that you a have a reference point. What counts as supporting documentation? What am I suppose to be thinking about? So that there's less questions. It's the education piece that I'm hearing most when I talk to people. And what happens if I don't have a complete package. Who will notify me and how does that process work? Or is it just going into the ether. If you could hyperlink to this [apply/evidence] from the evidence page that would be really helpful.

### Key Takeaways
- ratedDisabilities versus service-connected disabilities, language is confusing for rated disabilities language on intro
- provide more education on evidence (what should I include, what happens if I don't include it)


# P4

Could you share some background on your military experience and how you've interacted with the VA?
I was in for 9 years, came back from Iraq in 2009. Back then you didn't have online and everything was done face-to-face with VSO. Over time I've used MyHealth to request appts and send messages to my healthcare team. I've used the online portal for disability compensation. I've participated in a couple of study tests.

Have you used the prescription refill as part of My Healthe Vet?
I think I have. One of my RXs is [] so they don't refill but you need to request a new prescription every so often. I don't really have a lot of prescriptions at this time.

You mentioned using paper for comp before, was that prior to separation or after you got out?
Well I had gone to Reserve/Guard status so I was still kind of in. It wasn't part of the separation process but it was more with the VA itself. 

Was that you doing an initial claim or were you modifying an existing?
The initial claim

Have you done anything else or was it just that one interaction?
This spring I did one for my knees and was turned down for it but went through the process and the information, uploading docs.

Was that through eBenefits?
Yes

Did you do it on your own or with help from VSO?
On my own.

## Intro
What other information would be helpful on this page?
The options seem to be there for most of the info I would be looking for.

Looks like an overview, standard hot links at the bottom. To me it's laid out with enough information and makes it very clear.

When you did this last time, did you feel like you knew what you needed to know before you started?
I felt comfortable pretty much knowing everything. The one thing that threw me is when I was filling out the specific clai m there were so many choices for knees. 9 years attached to the infantry with pounds of gear on your back. there was like "knee, bilateral right ...knee bilateral right". Which one should I pick? As far as the UI UX, I thought the pages flowed.

## Veteran Details
I think this will be pretty understood with younger veterans I don't know how this would be seen with the older genration. I could see older generations who aren't as comfortable with the computer, understanding "finish this application late". I think I've seen before "Finish and save".

Red (required fields) stands out. I see the update everytime I input some kind of data. It's refreshing the notification that the application has been autosaved

I think it's nice that it breaks the questions up on several different pages.

## Rated Disabilities
Expect that if I click 10% I can move forward but not if I click 100%. Should there be a message that says you've selected a rating that can't increase pass 100% to prevent inadvertent clicks.

## Add new disability
What would be a more helpful way to offer the disability choices? What do you wish you could do here?
In an ideal world, some of the selections in the database would be pretty targeted. Say hearing loss, tinnitus, deafness, you would have the ability to give a few words to explain what you mean by "knee condition". I don't know the difference between strain and sprain.

Do you feel like you have any options other than what's in the list right now?
No. It's just do I want to go with arthritis or do I want to go with knee condition.
Doesn't seem like there's a cap on the description so I could keep typing. It says please briefly describe and less words is typically better than more words.

[Date]
Some injuries you can't remember the exact date.You should have been given copies of treatment records and files. I think I might have picked my separation date from service. Throw a dart.

That [accessing FOIA Requests] will hopefully help some ex-service members be able to process their claims. Because the young boy that was run over, no one involved in those few vehicles just before or after were given any kind of paper work or a copy of their significant act. You write your sworn statement of the events but it's not like the unit xeroxes copies and gives it to you. I don't remember getting copies of any of the IEDs that went off on the convoys in my unit. 

You mentioned keeping records, what kind of records did you have?
Personnel file, DD-214, diplomas from schools, NG equivalent of active duty DD-214. I've go tone injury to my back that I do have a lot of paperwork for that happened during a guard drill weekend, but as fara as being given any documentation of events while you were on active duty I wasn't given that so I couldn't tell you the date of the first bomb that went off on usor the date of the last. I could give you ideas and stuff


## Supporting Evidence
The only thing the veteran needs to do is say here's what hurts, because the supporting evidence they're talking about, o5% of it's going to already be in the VA database I think. My specific claim was over 9 years so I didn't have supporting evidence . I told my provider that my knees hurt but since we didn't move forward with any treatments or anything the VA was like "well, you haven't done anything to have them looked at". 

I'm actively involved in the VA Healthcare system in Nashville. If you had gone forward with referrals or anything what would you do then?
I would assume VA has that info already

Did you go for C&P Exams?
For back and shoulder, yes. 

Do they give you a copy?
I don't remember. I remember getting copies of results -- here are the ultrasounds, result from tech or whoever looks at the scans. So there is the assumption and belief that what they've mailed you is a duplicate of what's been filed in the VA system.

I've never gone to see a private physician for anything. Let's say that I do - because the assumption is that whatever VA has given to me is a duplicate of what's on file.

VAMC
In my case I've been seen under two diff systems. 
[First date received treatment]
I really don't know. We'll just pick the date I came back.

I noticed I still have to fill out Nashville and Marion even though that's where the facilities are. Are facilities not named according to where they're located?
Does it automatically upload? 
If I have other documents I'm think an 'Upload' button to show it's 100% uploaded. It's a little fuzzy.

## Additional Info
Contact Info
Pretty self-explanatory.

Payment
I'm assuming that's what would be on record for my current disability. So I have no suspicion it would be wrong b/c I get my deposit every month.

Homeless
Anybody who uses the VA for services know they're always asking this. Whenever you go into see a doctor it's part of their standard battery of questions along with depression and alcohol use.

## Review
Just using this to review the previous pages and my answers.

Link to the privacy policy.

For the most part I think that the UI and the UX on the website is very easy to navigate. User-friendly. I didn't have a lot of problems with it and I don't. The biggest pain is how often you have to change passwords when you're using eBenefits. Seems like every 60 days you have to come up with a new password. I'd say it's built pretty well to be easily navigable and it really walks you through the process.
