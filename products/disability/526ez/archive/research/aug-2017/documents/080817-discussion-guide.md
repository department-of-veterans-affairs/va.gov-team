__Observer & Photographer__

- Ask permission to take a photo of the interviewee. 
- Ask permission to take photos of any other observations that'll help tell that person's story to the rest of the team. 

# Tips

- Make sure to write down exactly what the person says, not what you think they might mean. This process is all about hearing exactly what people are saying. You want direct quotes, not the gist of what the interviewee says.

- What the person says is only one data point. Be sure to observe your interviewee’s body language and the context in which you’re talking. Right down these details. Were there signs of tension at particular parts of the interview? Note them. 

- These interviews are one-on-one discussion about a user’s experience, goals, behavior and values. It is all about THEM. Our goal is to get the most complete picture of their reality and to clarify assumptions we’ve had. 

- Be non-judgmental by embracing an apprentice mindset.
- Be an active, respectful listener 
- Try to avoid leading the interviewee
- Instead, focus on being led by the interviewee. You can have all your questions answered without going through them by checking off boxes. Natural conversation is good, as long as you get where you're going eventually.
- Remember, their reality is their reality. Try not to question it. Example: someone might refer to a technology tool with a red logo that gives you reviews of restaurants. Do not complete the sentence. Let them tell you what it is. 
- Ask “why” a lot
- Use open-ended questions to extract information
- Use close-ended questions only to take control
- Listen for tension or mentions of challenging experiences. Explore these this and find out what the problem is.
