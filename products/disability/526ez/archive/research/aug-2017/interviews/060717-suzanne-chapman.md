## Introduce us to sprint

Goal: redo the 526EZ.

Team: Suzanne, Josh, Mel

Anything specific?

- Want to show how discovery and design helps streamline this 
- Want to show differences between online and paper process.

Ending up being just 526EZ. Suzanne wasn't ok with scoping back down. Why? Would be bad experience to do new form then go back to paper forms. 

Forms suggested:

- [Flow for forms -- if this, then that](/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/discovery/2016-discovery/design/flows/disability-application-flow-frog.pdf) *TODO: check if this link is right or if there is some other document*

- [Map of paper forms](/Products/Disability/Disability%20526EZ/discovery/2016-discovery/design/flows/526EZ_and_supplemental_forms.pdf)

- [Massive Form](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/vetsgov-benefits/p1469480960000122)
   - Documented every single screen
   - Info learned (mainly from Josh Q)

## What we know now, we didn't know then

- save in progress
- pre-population

## What didn't happen

- stakeholder convos
- dig into post-it note pain points on [massive form](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/vetsgov-benefits/p1469480960000122)
- one pain point is more information is seen as bad because veteran's can abuse loopholes
   - Example: Homeless and check homeless, paper is expedited. Online nothing happens. Heard this is because of abuse. 
   
## How much would you dig into how application ties to entire process?

- "Dig some."
- Next steps, overall for team, is to dig into process
- It is an area we want to go into, so need to dig a little to decide if this is something we want to do right now. 
- This is one of our next big projects. 
- Healthcare was first and we can talk strong game about it. 
- This is next big thing.
- Some 1:1 projects. This we should improve process but not fall down blackhole. 

## Advice

- have a real plan. what's the UX plan?
- what are the deliverables?
