# Alex Taylor on Big Forms

#### Attendees Sophia, Laura, Rach

## Questions

### Discovery

When you are in the early phases of discovery, what approaches or methods work best? 

What is current state of the form? 
- Paper-only
- Online

- Digital already -- screenshot each step and build flow of each step and conditionals. Understand how it all works currently. 

   - helpful for base point conversation with stakeholders
   - look for landmines in information that is around form that might be landmine

What rabbit holes should we avoid? 

- Don't lean into PRA and legal concerns at the beginning
- Be more adventurous early on
- Feel out stakeholders and see if they can get out of policy mindset.

What documentation is a must?

- Spreadsheet for eligibility engine (all forms). Inventory for all fields. 
   - You might be eligible for x,y,z
   
- Are you changing inputs or way a question is being asked?
   - Record in spreadsheet
   
- Inventory of inputs
   - Does the order make sense?
   - Move high-stakes questions towards the front. If an answer will disqualify we want applicant to find out earlier than later.
      - Documentation might be an exception. Currently putting that at the back, but mentioned at front of app.
   - See if organization of fields makes sense. 
      - Does is make sense to VA or to mental model of user?
     

### Communication 

How did you communicate design progression to team and stakeholders?

- Invited people and did things in the open
- Showed things early to stakeholders
- Presenting rough ideas to them through clickable prototypes
  - That said, real forms are better and they are easier to edit

Show them a form you've already created so they have a baseline. 
- Education 1990
  - Good example of some nested conditional questions and warnings in response to answers

- are you selling stakeholders or are they already bought in? 
- ask a lot of questions
  - pain points for applicants
  - pain points for backend
  
- With stakeholders walk through form from applicant deciding to apply
   - where do people have errors?
   - what can happen that will result in rejections?
   - where is current process broken?
      - what is going to happen after we make this better?
      - what bandaids exist that might work now, but will not work when we scale?
   - what is truly required -- what isn't acurately portrayed on the form. 
   - If this, than that...what fields become irrelevant?

How did you involve the team in the design phase?

- have whole team for walkthrough with stakeholders. 
   - think about database design
   - think about API design
   
- Have everyone involved in reordering

- Screenhero collaboration

- A lot of open audio convos. 

- Get to a prototype early. 

### Lessons learned 

Tell us one of the biggest surprises you encountered when working on your last big form.
> Got some bad news about how long it would take to get APIs set up to support cleaner back-end process. Accepted that as reality. Found out later that patient questions (maybe pressure?) from the right place accelerated the process. Keep asking questions and politely challenge orthodoxy.

Now, tell us what kept you up at night.

### Resources

What should we look at from vets.gov and elsewhere?

- Pensions extreme nesting (marriages -> spouse -> spouseâ€™s marriages)
   - Will we use some of these patterns?
- Education 1990

Is there existing user research that would help us as we think about our user research?

Who else should we talk to about this?

- Caitlin
- Rainbows Dev
   - what worked well about the process with Alex and Caitlin?
   - what are three things you wished Alex would of done sooner?
   - what could Alex of skipped?
   

### Questions

- Do we need new patterns and how do we keep nebula involved?
   - Design crits
