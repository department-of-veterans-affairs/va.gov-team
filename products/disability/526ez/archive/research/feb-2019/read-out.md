# Add New Condition Read Out

February 25-x, 2019

"All Claims" is live and is in beta mode (only shown to a limited number of users) on VA.gov. With this study, we wanted to test the clarity and usefulness of a tree of conditions to route Veterans through when they fill out a 526 claim for a new condition.

## The problem
The current process for telling the VA about new conditions technically works, but is confusing and unpleasant.
- The beta version of the Add New Condition tool lets Veterans type the name of their new condition while we autosuggest condition names.
- People prefer to choose from a few options rather than type (we learned this in previous research)
- The text field allows more human error (misspelling, confusing similarly named conditions, etc).

## The product
A tool within the 526 form that helps Veterans find the right condition when filing new disability claim

## What we wanted to find out

- Does this condition tree make sense to Veterans?
- Are the groupings clear and are Veterans able to get where they need to be?

## Who we talked to
We sent email outreach to a list of participants that Lauren shared through Ripple who have disability comp experience and expressed interest in participating in research. We had 21 total participants.

## Our research methodology
- We chose unmoderated research because we wanted a higher number of submissions to test the validity of this concept.
- Because the tree we needed to get people through is complex (and would take significant time to build), we preferred to prototype it.
- We used SurveyMonkey to prototype the workflow for our major groupings of conditions. It was legible, clear and easy to follow along with.
- We explored using something like Treejack from Optimal Sort, because the structure of this tree would work well as a tree test, but ultimately, it wasn’t the right fit–we found the functionality less intuitive and legible than what we wanted.

## What we learned
Most folks were able to follow and complete the tasks (76-83%) as we predicted.

### Finding 1: Some participants confused symptoms of one condition with another (ex: tinnitus ringing of the ears with PTSD).
Most Veterans will have diagnosis when filing a claim, so this is less of a concern—but something to keep in mind.
*Recommendation:* Explore the use of helper text. Examples of disabilities found within each grouping might help people make quicker, more accurate choices before diving deeper into the form.

### Finding 2: Sometimes the “wrong” path that participants took made sense when we reviewed their steps.
Some folks veered off course in an understandable way (for example, going down a vision & hearing track when claiming unwanted thoughts aka PTSD).
There might be more than one way to get to a particular disability or condition.
*Recommendation:*
The larger groupings make the process less overwhelming, but there’s still potential to get lost.
Explore ways to route people back if they go down the wrong path.


## Next steps
*Does this condition tree make sense to Veterans?*
- Mostly yes, but the “something else” grouping could use more attention.
- We tested the route to more common/less confusing conditions first to validate our concept but would like to see how tougher scenarios go.

*Are the groupings clear and are Veterans able to get where they need to be?*
- Yes. Overall, we gave Veterans three different tasks and saw a range of success—from 76% to 83%.

### Moving forward, we’d like to:
- Build out the tool with some of the most common conditions and test with more complicated tasks
- Explore adding helper text (like example disabilities)
