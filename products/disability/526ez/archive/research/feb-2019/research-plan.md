# Research Plan for Unicorns 526 â€“ Add New Contention
(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 

## Goals
#### 1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
Unicorns is looking for feedback on methods to collect new disabilities as part of a 526 application.
#### 2. Background:
We have an MVP out there that only deals with increase for rated disabilities.
Adding new disabilities (and still dealing with increase claims) is new more complicated territory. There are many different disabilities that can be claimed and the tree to get users through is complex.
#### 3. Research questions:
We have some new approaches that need validation.
   a. How does question structure work for adding a new condition?
   b. Are people able to get to the right place as quickly as they can?
   
## Method
#### 1.	What method of research are you planning?**
   **Sample Methodologies**: Survey (effectively testing the IA through the survey, similar to a tree test)
   **Also mention:** Remote unmoderated
#### 2.	Why this method?
The tree we have to get people through to add a new condition is complex and requires conditional logic. We first tried a tree test (using Treejack on Optimal Sort) but found the tool wasn't the most intuitive for the complexity we needed to test. We want to test this unmoderated so we can gather more participants and have more data to analyze.*
#### 3.	Where are you planning to do your research?
SurveyMonkey
#### 4.	What will you be testing?**
A SurveyMonkey prototype of a conditional logic flow.


## Participants and Recruitment
#### 1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
  Our participants are Veterans who may have an interest in comp. Minimum 20 participants, ideal would be closer to 100.
#### 2.	What is your recruitment strategy? TBD. Working with DSVA to develop.

## When? 
#### 1.	Timeline:
~~**End of January 2019**~~ End of January 2019 through end of February 2019 (we hit a few recruitment blockers which extended our timeline).
#### 2.	Prepare:
Prototype is ready and shareable link is created.
#### 3.	Availability:
Not applicable because we are using an unmoderated test.
#### 4.	Pilot:
Piloted test with 9 team members at the end of the week of January 21.
