## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Alex and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about disability compensation. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a web-based prototype** This is a demo version of an online tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some things will on the site will work as expected and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let's start with a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell us a few setences about your service in the military?
- Have you ever filed a disability claim? Would you feel comfortable talking about your experience? If not, we can continue with the tasks I have planned.
  - If you have never filed a disability claim, have you considered doing so? What, if anything, has prevented you from filing a claim?

## Let participant take over control of front-end prototype
Okay, I'm going to let you take over my screen and have you complete a few tasks.

## First Task: Add a condition - 10 minutes

Could you talk me through what you see on this page? What do you think you can do on this screen?
*If they understand, continue to next step. If they do not, explain a bit about how this screen works.*

On this screen, we are filing a new claim for disability compensation. We have confirmed our personal information and now we are going to add a new condition to our claim. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can write about a disability from your own experience. If you do not feel comfortable, that's totally okay. We can suggest a condition for you to claim. Remember that this is a demo tool â€” none of the information you enter will be saved and it will not impact your actual VA information or benefits.
*Suggested condition to claim:*

Now that we've chosen a disability to add to your claim, would you please submit it?

Can you talk about about what you see on the screen now? What would you expect to see after submitting a disability?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant understand how the tool works?
- Is the participant comfortable with the less interactive (black box) approach? Do they trust the tool?

## Second Task: Edit a disability description/remove a disability assignment - 10 minutes

- Now we've successfully added a disability to our claim. Could you take a moment to look at the automatically assigned disability name? Does it look correct? Please say what you're thinking out loud so we can understand your thought process.
- If it doesn't look correct, could you show me how you would change it?
- Did this work as you expected?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant want to edit the assigned disability or do they trust the accuracy of the tool?

## Third Task: Add another disability - 5 minutes

- Okay, now we'll add a second disability to our claim. How would you do that? Again, if you feel comfortable, you can try to add something from personal experience.

### Things to watch for:

- How comfortable does the participant seem adding an additional disability?
- Is the CTA standing out amongst all the options the participant has on this screen?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How do you feel about this process becoming automated?
- Were there any things that you thought worked well?
- Could you talk a bit about anything that confused you or didn't work like you expected it to?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $__ thank-you gift. *(clarify with Lauren what current process, amount, instructions are for user thank-you gifts)*

Great, is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address we used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? 
[If no] Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, I can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect folks to our team.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
