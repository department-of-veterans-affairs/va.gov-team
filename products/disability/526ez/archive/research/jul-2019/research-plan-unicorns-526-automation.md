# Research plan for Unicorns, 526 (automation), Jun 28–Jul 2


## Goals

1. *What product & team are you doing this research for?*
  **Product**: 526 Contention Automation
  **Team**: Unicorns (or successor)
2. *Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?* 
  - The 526 asks Veterans to tell VA about the conditions they would like to be compensated for. Currently we present them with a text box that uses fuzzy matching to try to match what the Veteran enters with a set taxonomy of conditions. These are presented as dropdown matches that a Veteran has to click on to choose. If they do not select an option, their entered text will be submitted on the form. If they select an option, that condition replaces the Veteran entered text. 
  - We are working with a group from the CTOs office to incorporate an plain language parsing API they have developed that can analyze free text and match it to a VA Contention ID with high confidence.
  - We are planning use this tool to replace our current system and want to explore the UX implications for the Veteran.
3. *Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?*
  - What feedback is necessary to make the Veteran comfortable that they are doing the right thing?
  - What guidance do we need to provide to make Veterans comfortable with the process.
4. *Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?* 
  - We think that we don't need to ask Veterans to make a choice. That we can take their language and assign a contention without further intervention.

## Method
1.	*What method of research are you planning?* 
  - Moderated, usability
2.	*Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?*

  - This is a tweak to existing code and can be done on a branch
