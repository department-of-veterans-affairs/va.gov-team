# Discussion Guide eBenefits Baseline Usability Test (September 2017)

- Remember to delete existing applications for test users before new test

## Intro

Thank you for agreeing to participate in this feedback session. We value your feedback and sessions like these help inform vets.gov, making it a great experience for you. There are no right or wrong answers today. What we care about most is that you are open and honest. It might feel like you are talking a lot at times. This is a good thing. Today is about you. 

Before we get started, I have a couple of housekeeping items and questions for you. 

First housekeeping: 

We would like to record the session today. Is that ok with you? (start recording)

Second, I am going to test the technology real quick. (pass control to user on eBenefits tab)

Now, see if you can take control and click around.

And, one more housekeeping item, did you get the email Kristin sent with the documents? We will use those during the session.

And, questions:

- Have you previously filed a disability compensation claim? And, did you get help filing your claim? 

- Do you currently help other Veterans apply for benefits? How?

- Have you recently used the eBenefits site? Why did you use it? Have you ever looked at the disability compensation application online?

And, lastly, how are you on time? Do you have a hard stop at 5? 

If you need to stop at anytime during this session, please let me know. You will not be penalized for this.

You previously filed claims for Anemia, low back strain, cervical strain, and for burns.
