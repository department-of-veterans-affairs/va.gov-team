Are you a Veteran who has considered filing a disability compensation claim or do you know a Veteran who has? We want to hear from you.

My team at the VA is working on online tools that help veterans manage their benefits. It's really important for us to hear your thoughts directly, so we can be sure what we're building works for you. 

For this particular project, we want to meet with Veterans who have considered filing a disability compensation claim. We will be conducting 60-minute virtual sessions. You'll receive $25 as a thank-you gift for your time spent with us. 

If you’re interested or know someone who might be, please email us at feedback@va.gov or sign up here: https://cohortsfeedback.com/signup/claims. 

Thanks!
