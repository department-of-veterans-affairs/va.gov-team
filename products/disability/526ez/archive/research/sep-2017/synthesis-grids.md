# Synthesis Grids

__Gabe__

Gabe is a US Marshall looking to file his first claim. 

- What three things should we not forget?
  - Free text fields can cause anxiety bc you might not know if what you're putting in there will be accepted, for example having to write 'unknown' if you don't know.
  - He stopped to read every blue box
  - Thought the workflow on left and across top was helpful, but couldn't figure out how to actually navigate through / start the application 
  
- What was most surprising to you?
  - Don't care how long it takes, most important thing is to have confidence that it's accurate

__Marvin__

Marvin is an accredited officer that helps Veterans file benefits. He did not disclose this before the session but it came out in the session. So, notes are thin and I was careful to not capture comments with an agenda below. 

- What three things should we not forget?
   - He helps Veterans with benefits for a living so his perspective is very different
   - expected to add evidence when he added the condition

- What was most surprising to you?
   - He knew about the DRC and said in the future the "Jon Caldwells" of the world would want to file two claims, one would be a DRC increase with an accredited officer, the other would be new claims self service

|Adding Evidence|---|expected to add evidence right after adding condition|---|---|

__Bill__

Bill separated 13 years ago. A friend's recent passing triggered him, and others in his unit, to begin disability applications because there were patterns in their condition.

- What three things should we not forget?
   - not having medical records was a dead end for Bill. He seemed completely overwhelmed and didn't know what to do when we didn't have existing VA medical records. 
   - even though some steps are just verifying information, we say you'll need this information in the "getting started" screens. This creates unnecessary anxiety for the applicant. 

- What was most surprising to you?
   - Bill did not know what FDC or DBQ meant. He spoke no acronyese.

__Matthew__

Matthew separated more than 10 years ago. He has attempted to get information from the VA and from VSO's about submitting a claim. Unfortunately, Matthew thought we were going to help him with his claim. He was low tech, highly motivated and did not use eBenefits. 

- What three things should we not forget?
   - Matthew thought we were going to help him file a claim
   - Matthew was low tech, highly motivated and in need
   - Matthew thought the process we went through was an information gathering phase before actually applying. He expected the VA to sort through the information Matthew shared and then make a recommendation to Matthew. The recommendation would include what Matthew should claim and evidence he needed to provide. 
   
- What was most surprising to you?
   - Matthew had a similar distrust in the VA as others we've interviewed. He said Veterans must cross their t's and dot their i's. Yet, he did not read any of the copy on the pages. He scanned (at best) most sections. Then, he said he didn't have any evidence to upload. He assumed the VA would reach out after this process and get what they needed versus him "assembling" a claim [Dave's words].

__Dave__

Dave is an entrepreneur and CEO of RallyPoint, a social network for Veterans. He tried to apply for disability compensation 3 or 4 years ago through a VSO, but the VSO disappeared. 

- What three things should we not forget?
   - Dave is pretty tech savvy so he flew through the interface outside of the text heavy pages. The text heavy pages were quite stressful and he was often confused by what they said.
   - Due to the unclear content, Dave was in a constant state of stress throughout the application because he was not getting feedback from the application that he was on the right track.
   - Dave would abandon at document upload because his files are in a separate physical location than his computer.

- What was most surprising to you?
   - Dave wasn't sure if he should fill out the PTSD section. He was concerned it might "harm him" later if he didn't. Today, he does not have PTSD but there is no way of predicting the future.
