# Clusters

## Primary

### 100% did not read first page
- "oh yea, accept and continue, even this fine print."
- "I am not going to read this, but will assume it's okay and trust the site."
- "we don't read."

### The Veteran wants to build a rapport, begin a relationship, so they can get the help they need. But, they feel they’re immediately thrown into a courtroom.

- Pull Bill's quote -- he thought we would "pump the brakes" kinda like open enrollment. Any life changes we should know about?
- When discussing treatment, Dave expected to add locations and type of treatment
- not "building a story" as person experienced it [pull IRAQ story during PTSD section]
- Matthew thought this was an information gathering form that would suggest conditions to apply for
- Talked about "assembling" claim info
- It can be easy to file, but that doesn't mean I'm building my case correctly [FDC reference]
- "At this point I think I would just have to get every piece of paper I have and bring it to my computer"
- "My job is to present a case."

### When you do talk to me, I cannot tell if we are friends. 

- Took option to skip errors when validation errors happened on address
- "That was an angry set of prompts for something that I can jsut say "next for."
- "it seems like the more significant the condition, the more likely I'm going to have to go in."
- Validations are not clear and you can skip past them at the end
- "Will this hurt me later?" [not entering PTSD as a condition]
- You do not know if your answer is "right" referencing free form text
- uploaded DD214 three times because there was a delay in feedback and Bill didn't know he had uploaded it
- "Can you tell me what is working as I go?"

## The longer this relationship continues, the more uncertain I become about where it is headed.
- Fear that I'll screw up what's already in process
- Dave "carefully" continues after hitting previous accidentally
- longer the page, the more risk because entering lots of information -- system could fail, validation might erase data
- "I feel the weight of the process even as Herman."
- "this process is so stressful."
- "...have to spoon feed it to a reviewer, so there can be no questions."
- No clear option for save and come back

## Tension between speed, trust and control climax at adding evidence
- "I want to make sure I'm uploading just what I need."
- "I dont know if I trust you [VA] to help me in any way."
- "As a Veteran, all the t's you can cross and i's you can dot on your own, the better."
- "I feel like I might just upload everything [with my phone] and let someone else sort it."

### 75% of participants would abandon at adding evidence or skip past it
- "Making copies sounds like a real chore." (Dave)
- "feel like this is a dead end"
- "I have no evidence to give to the VA, but I want the thing to go quickly." (Matthew)
- "I really don't care about speed, I want it to be accurate."
- assumed had a year to get shelf (check audio on shelf) together and file (Gabe)
- document upload completely skipped. Assumed VA had docs. (Matthew)
- "I trust myself more than the government" so I'd do FDC (Dave) "I am going to do all the work." However, Dave said he would have to abandon and come back at this stage.

### While effective, the “workflow” is overwhelming when shown all at once.
- [%] tried to click left nav -- getting started
- "Now I know if I'm going to advance, I have to scroll all the way to the bottom and click save and continue."
- once DBQ was downloaded and opened, struggled to get back to form
- can you layout the process: file intent to file, tell about conditions, medical exam
- I didn't know this was available [referencing top nav]. I was focused on left nav.
- "more steps than I care for" referencing top nav
- "this feels like it might take hours"
- first thing I saw was "workflow"
- Thought "apply" "manage" were application navigation

## Secondary

### TBD
- didn't read important dates (Matthew)
- phone number, no idea so would make it up (Matthew)
- briefly read FDC (Matthew)

### You make the rules, you tell me if I'm eligible
- "I don't know if I'm eligible for these." [special conditions]
- Unemployability should be an outcome or end state [after I share my information]

### Language
- Asking for "payment information" seems like I'm paying
- add secondary "I don't know" what that is (Matthew)
- confused by DBQ -- what it was, who filled it out (Matthew)

### Navigation -- [reference The Inmates Are Running the Asylum]
- ended up on IRIS to find help printing. IRIS page said he couldnt print. Then, he couldnt get back to eBenefits. (Matthew)
- worried if clicks links, he'll lose his work
- current address cannot be edited from medical address
- no inline editing of DBQ
-
