### R-VSR Notes (Sam & Brian)

**Actions that can be taken by the veteran after a claim is filed:**

**Reconsideration** - can call the 800 number within a year of a claim decision to have the decision reconsidered.
This does not need to be on a standardized form. Can use the same effective date as the original claim

**Reopen** - if a contention is denied, a 526-EZ can be submitted again to go back to a rater for another decision. This is advisable over an Appeal if you can submit evidence related to the reason it was denied. BUT if it was denied because it isn’t a service-related event then it MUST be proven.

Veterans must demonstrate that a condition is service-connected and corroborated by diagnosis. To establish service-connection it must be proven that the condition has persisted since separation by providing treatment records. If there are no treatment records, a veteran can indicate that the issue has existed since separation using a 4138 form to establish a connection.

**Appeal** - file Notice of Disagreement is for Appeal; lf you open a appeal you can’t get an increase on that condition if you submit one unless you cancel the appeal.

**SMC** - ancillary benefits (e.g. benefits granted off of 781)

VSR - gathers and collects evidence; uses VBMS-A
VSR Rater - makes the rating decisions; uses VBMS-R
VBMS Standard (or Core) is accessible by VSOs

### VSR Notes (Tami)

**What are the mistakes veterans make when submitting claims?**
Veterans do not respond to calls — check messages, call contact center back, haven’t updated contact info

Veterans that are already service-connected sometimes request they submit multiple claims for the same thing

They need to be more specific. So if they have a diagnosis that is the key to developing the claim. 
 Instead of right foot, numbness in right foot. If they don’t answer they need to send a letter which adds 30 days to the claim

If they have never been to a VAMC, don’t list it because it takes time away from the claim
Only send what’s pertinent to the claim
4142 tends to be incomplete

FDC should really be submitted with DBQs to expedite the process

**What can veterans do to assist thenselves with getting favorable claims decisions?**
If veteran can get a copy of medical records from the national personnel and records (from military) that would be helpful. We have to be able to see and prove that it was in service. Otherwise getting a NEXUS opinion (shows the link or correlation between condition is a direct result of injury in service) or buddy statement.

**What is the claims delivery process? How do claims land in your inbox?**
PDFs claims go to cloud —> organized Suspense date and station availability —>   Drop into station work queue  —> assigned to individual work queue for the individual VSR.

**How does a veteran's contact info get updated if it's wrong?**
Contact Center can update contact information so that when they generate letters it should go to the right address. We can do a CLEAR search of their records or call veteran.

**What happens if a veteran makes a mistake on their claim?**
If they mis-filed they can send something(4138) in or reach out to the contact center (they upload a 21-0820 and label it and put notes in the system)

**So if you get a duplicate 2 conditions then another 2 a month later** 
The second will still be evaluated, the second claim just won't be in the FDC program and will not get original ITF date but granting an effective date can be determined by many things including other regulations regarding service or specific conditions.
