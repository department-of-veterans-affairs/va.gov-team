# Where and Why Did Veterans Stop In the Form

Places people get stuck or abandon and how we can measure it:

Rake task: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/rakelib/in_progress_forms.rake

## They leave the in progress form 
either by choice, frustration, or need to gather evidence:
- Choice/exhaustion/need more info: `bundle exec rake form_progress:abandon_url[21-526EZ,2020-10-06,2020-11-06]`
-  Frustration/stuck with validation error -  `bundle exec rake form_progress:error_url[21-526EZ,2020-10-06,2020-11-06]`
## They can't successfully submit
- Error  on submit -[grafana]( http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/d/000000066/evss-526-submissions?viewPanel=18&orgId=1&from=now-7d&to=now) or [FE validation error in Sentry](http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/organizations/vsp/issues/241/events/?query=url%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.va.gov%2Fdisability%2Ffile-disability-claim-form-21-526ez%2Freview-and-submit&sort=freq&statsPeriod=14d)
