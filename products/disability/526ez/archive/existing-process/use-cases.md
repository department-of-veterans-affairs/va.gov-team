# Use Cases / Scenarios

## Different Conditions to Consider

### FDC vs. Standard
* FDC and Standard have the same basic requirements (separating the processes likely wouldn't make sense)... but there is opportunity for better logic and better contextual help depending on if the applicant is doing the FDC or standard. In current ebenefits process, there's no built-in logic to determine if a claim is FDC. There's just a page explaining it in section I but no option to select it.
* FDC = vet must supply ALL necessary documentation with the exception of things "in federal custody" like service records. A successful FDC application would result in the VA only needing to contact the applicant to schedule a dr. appointment (if needed) or with a final response about their claim.
* Standard = certain evidence is optional

### 526EZ vs. Supplemental claims
* Just submitting 526EZ
* Submitting 526EZ and 1 or more supplemental claims

### 4 Types of 526EZ Claims
* New Claim
* Secondary Claim
* Reopen Claim (claim that's been declined but vet has new evidence to resubmit with)
* Increase Claim

### Intent to file
* Need to submit intent to file first
* Won't need to submit separate intent to file and will just submit claim
* Intent already filed in ebenefits/paper
* Intent already filed in new system

### Separation status
* Post Separation
* Pre Separation 
      * BDD & QS: There are questions/pages that these users don’t need but there’s currently no logic to hide them. Eg. Unemployability and special circumstances like “aid & attendants” because if they were eligible for these prior to separation, they’d likely be doing a Medical Discharge process instead. Uses same disability claim forms, no intent to file, form automatically expires 1 year after separation. In ebenefits: if period of service provided includes end date as a future date, it will trigger differences in UI (Separation page will be different). So, there’s no UI question asking if they’re still active, it just knows based on the date.
         * Quick Start (QS): submitted within 60 days of discharge, processing will start but not done by time of discharge
         * Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD): submitted 60-180 days before discharge, will be processed before leaving service
      * >180 days before separation: Can start online form but can’t submit earlier than 180 days before discharge (ebenefits system won’t allow it) – this is based on the user’s entry of their date of separation.
      * Medical Discharge: condition is too bad for continued service; uses completely different form & process
