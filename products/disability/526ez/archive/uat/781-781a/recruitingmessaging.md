**Form 781 & 781a Initial Recruiting Messaging**

*Below is the initial recruiting message to be sent to veterans in an effort to recruit UAT testers to support testing of the 781 and 781/a on Production.*

**For general interest:**

Thank you for signing up to participate in a session to use the VA's new tool to support submission of your claim for benefits. We're launching a new tool that will allow veterans to submit their claim for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder using an online form.

To use this tool, all of these must be true:
- You've experienced PTSD in connection with your military service and want to file a claim for this disability. This could have been as a result of a combat or non-combat stressor event that occurred during service, military sexual trauma, or personal assault while serving.
- You've signed in to your premium My HealtheVet or DS Logon account. (If you don't have a verified account, you can create an ID.me account to complete the verification process.)

If you meet the above requirements and youâ€™re interested in utilizing this new tool, respond to this email with your phone number and your availability to participate in a 5-10 minute call to cover some basic questions so we can make sure your claim will allow you to use this new tool. We anticipate these sessions will begin in January 2019. 

Keep in mind, if you're in crisis, we can support you. Our Veterans Crisis Line is confidential (private), free, and available 24/7. To connect with a Veterans Crisis Line responder anytime, day or night:
- Call the Veterans Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255 and press 1, or
- Visit https://www.veteranscrisisline.net to start a confidential chat online, or
- Send a text message to 838255
- If you have hearing loss, please call TTY at 1-800-799-4889.

Please feel free to share this information with others you know who might be interested in participating. 

Thank you again,
