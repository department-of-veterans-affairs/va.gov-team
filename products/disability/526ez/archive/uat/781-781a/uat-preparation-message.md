## Participants with claims for combat or non-combat PTSD 

Hi __________, 

As mentioned on our call, there are some things we recommend gathering and preparing in preparation for our session to submit your claim for PTSD in January. To ensure that the VA has the information they need to research and corroborate your claim, we recommend gathering the following information in preparation. 

For claims of combat or non-combat stressor incident(s) that resulted in your PTSD the following information will help expedite your claim:
- Any Medals or citations received in relation to the incident. This helps us to research your claim.
- Event Date. If you don't remember the exact date, providing a date within 60 days of the event will help us better research your claim.
- Assignment. This can include your division, wing, battalion, cavalry, ship, etc.
- Assignment Date. This can be approximate. 
- Event Location. This could include an address, landmark, military installation, or other location.
- Name of Individual(s) Killed or Injured as well as their unit, rank, date they were killed or injured and what happened to them. If you don’t know the person’s name at all, please briefly provide details that would help us identify the person.
- Detailed description of the event with as much specifics as you're able to provide.
- Any additional supporting documentation.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I will be in touch around the first of the year to schedule your session.

Keep in mind, if you're in crisis, we can support you. Our Veterans Crisis Line is confidential (private), free, and available 24/7. To connect with a Veterans Crisis Line responder anytime, day or night:
