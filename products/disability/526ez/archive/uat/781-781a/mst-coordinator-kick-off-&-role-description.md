# MST Coordinators in UAT

## 781 Session with MST Coordinators 

### Agenda: 
#### Why?
1. We're building the self-service capability in VA.gov to create a better claim submission experience for the Veteran, while also ensuring that we capture the necessary information/evidence to allow adjudicators to decide claims more quickly and accurately. 
2. Veteran engagement in the development process
3. Examples of what we did specific to PTSD claim (i.e. identify the type of stressor event, allowing the type of stressor event to drive the proper form (0781 vs. 0781a), assigning the appropriate special issue to the contention, and including helpful resources for MST coordinators and other VA services).

#### How?
1. Once we've articulated the "why" we are building this tool, we can demo the product to show them "how" we delivered those improvements.

#### What?
1. Primary role of the MST Coordinators is to diffuse any situation where they sense a veteran is becoming triggered by something they are completing in the application. If a situation arises where a veteran is triggered, the MST Coordinator will be the primary participant who will be responsible for de-escalating the situation and ensuring that the veteran is appropriately supported. 
   1. Looking for their input about how they want to handle it. 
      1. How to communicate that they're taking over if a triggering event occurs
   1. 2 MST Coordinators will be scheduled to participate in each session. 
2. Assist veterans in describing an event to complete their claim. 
3. Comfort Level with assisting with claim specific questions and helping veterans describe and event to complete their claims
4. Do we want any additional engagement from the MST Coordinators? Driving at all? Talking about resources provided to vets with PTSD?

#### How
1. Sessions are expected to begin the week of January 14, 2018
2. We will need one MST Coordinator for each session and a MST alternate. This means we'd like everyone to particiapte in 2-3 sessions total, if that is possible. 
   1. Will send an email to the group when scheduling sessions to identify the two participants and first two to respond will be scheduled.
3. Sessions will be scheduled for 90 minutes. 
   1. If additional time is required to submit the application then a subsequent session will be scheduled to complete the form. 
4. The participants have been sent a list of the information they will need to collect in support of their application as part of the screening process, so hopefully they will have much of the content prepared prior to the session. 
5. Most participants are completing the 781 (6 781 participants; 1 781 & 781A participant; 0 781a participants) but the goal is to have the same number of 781a participants (6). 

#### Other
1. Reiterate our request for assistance with recruiting 781a participants.
