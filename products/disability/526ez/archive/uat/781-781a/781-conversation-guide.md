## Intro - 5 minutes
Thank you for joining us today! My name is _________, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing. Today we're going to have you navigate through a few new screens being added to the Va.gov site.  These new screens assist the Veteran during the claim entry process by allowing the veteran to enter their PTSD claim information directly into the web form.
Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:
- We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
- During this session, we’ll ask you to sign in to Vets.gov with your premium My HealtheVet, DS Logon or ID.me account. Then we'll ask you to share your screen with us so that we can go through the screens together.
- There are no right or wrong answers. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
Great! Any questions before we get started?

## Login
- To start, can you tell me what type of computer you are using today?
  -	If needed: I'm asking this question because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed.
- Today we are using WebEx which will allow us to observe you interacting with the new screens on your computer. Have you used WebEx before?
  - If no: Explain the screen sharing, & chat functions and how to find them.
- Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time?
(Pass presenter rights).
- I'd like you to open a new tab in your browser and go to https://www.va.gov.
- *Fill in details of navigating to the form*

## Step 1: TBD
Assume this will require that they complete the 526 or pick up with an in-progress 526 so we'll need to begin the conversation guide there

## Step 2: TBD
TBD

## Wrap-up
You are now finished!  We really appreciate you taking the time to step through these new screens with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up?
Thank you and enjoy your day!
