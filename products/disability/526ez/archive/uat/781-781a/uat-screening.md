# Form 781 & 781a UAT screening
This script will be used with potential UAT participants during the initial call with the veteran to determine whether or not they are eligible. 

## Script
Thank you for joining us today! My name is _________, [and my colleague _______ is also on the line] and I'm on a team that is preparing to launch the tool I described in my email to you. Today we want to find out if you are eligible to participate in beta testing of that new functionality that will allow veterans to submit their claim for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder using an online form.

Before we begin, I wanted to remind you that if you're in crisis, the VA can support you with the Veterans Crisis Line is confidential, free, and available 24/7. You can connect with a Veterans Crisis Line responder anytime, day or night via phone, online chat or text. 

**With that, I have a few questions for you:**

1. Is your PTSD a result of something you experienced during the time you were serving in the military?
2. Do you want to file a claim for disability compensation for your PTSD?

Because there are two different forms related to service-connected PTSD, I need to ask you some more specific questions about your PTSD. Is that okay?
1. Is your PTSD related to a stressor you experienced during combat?
2. Is your PTSD related to a non-combat stressor that occured during your military service?
3. Is your PTSD realted to military sexual trauma?
4. Is your PTSD related to personal assualt that occured during your military service?

Thank you for answering those questions about your PTSD. I have just a few more questions to ensure that you are prepared for this session: 
1. Do you have private medical records related to your claim that you would like the VA to retrieve on your behalf?
2. Have you signed in to your premium My HealtheVet or DS Logon account? If you don't have a verified account, you can create an ID.me account to complete the verification process.)
3. Are you comfortable with the VA observing you entering claim-related information into the tool while you file your claim to ensure that the form successfully submits your claim?


**If these conditions are not met:**

Thank you for taking a few minutes to talk to us today. Unfortunately you will not be able to utilize this new tool for your claim. After this call, I will share some resources with you with around PTSD from the VA's National PTSD Center (https://www.ptsd.va.gov/). 

We will also keep you on our recruitment list for future enhancements you might be eligible for. 

**If these conditions are met:**

We are in the process of completing our production-readiness testing on this new tool. When we know the tool will be ready for testing, which expect will occur during the month of January, we will reach out to schedule your session. In the meantime, we recommend preparing your statement to be submitted with this form. After our call today, I will send you the details of what information you may submit with your claim. 

Thank you for your time today and please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions you may have.

## Questions & Concerns about this script: 
1. What if the veteran doesn't know exactly what the original PTSD stressor was?
2. Do we want to have a MST on these calls?
3. If a veteran's PTSD is not service-related, what can we say/do to provide resources for them? 
  "Unfortunately, the VA only covers PTSD resulting from a stressor that occured during military service. With that though, the VA does have a number of resources to help you find treatment and support. The VA's National PTSD Center has a number of resources. I will follow up via email with that information."
