# Form 781 & 781A UAT Plan

## Assumptions:
1. UAT is scheduled after the service/tool/feature in staging has been fully tested and we are confident that it will work as intended in the production environment.
2. UAT sessions begin with the first screen of the form

## Environment
- This UAT Testing will occur in the Production Environment
- We would like to have these session in-person if possible to protect sensitive PII and PHI and to provide support of the veteran completing these forms.
- If in-person testing is not possible, UAT Testing will occur via Webex screensharing and will not be recorded due to the sensitive nature of the 781 and 781a form content. 

## Pre-Launch Prep
- Extensive testing will be completed on staging prior to UAT. 
- Extensive testing will be completed by the BAH-526 team and once that testing is complete, a VA representative will be asked to complete testing on staging and sign off on go-live to production will be captured. 
- Prior to going live on Porduction, coordination with DevOps must occur to establish limited-access to the forms on Production.

## Session Length
- Each UAT Test is exepected to take up to 90 minutes and subsequent sessions may be scheduled due to the sensitive nature of the 781 and 781a form content. 

## Session Support & Preparation
- Due to the sensitive nature of the content required to complete these forms, we highly encourage these sessions be supported by a VA representative, MST Coordinator, counselor, therapist, or other PTSD specialist should the participant be triggered by the content being requested of them.
- We will recommend to participants that they prepare their statements in advance of the session if possible so they do not feel rushed for time and are able to ensure that all of the critical details of the their statements are included. 

- Participants with claims for combat or non-combat PTSD will be encouraged to gather the following information for each stressor event:
  - Medals or Citations
  - Event Date 
  - Assignment & Assignment Date
  - Event Location
  - Name of Individual(s) Killed or Injured as well as their unit, rank, date they were killed or injured and what happened to them
  - Detailed description of the event with the level detail you're comfortable sharing.

- Participants with claims for PTSD related to Personal Assault or Military Sexual Trauma will be encouraged to gather the following information for each stressor event:
  - Event Date 
  - Assignment & Assignment Date
  - Event Location
  - Detailed description of the event with the level detail you're comfortable sharing.
  - Contact information for military and civilian authorities you'd like the VA to retrieve related statements from
  - Supporting documentation for your claim
  - Any changes in physical health, mental health or substance abuse, changes in behavior at work and changes in social behavior.
