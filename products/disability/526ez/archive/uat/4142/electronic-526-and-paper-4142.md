**Prep for indviduals seeking assistance with Electronic 526 and Paper 4142 & 4142a.**

Context: After recruiting efforts for 4142 & 4142a as part of the Claim for Increase were initiated the decision was made not to go live with the 4142 & 4142a as part of the claim for increase. With this, we decided to offer the individuals who volunteered to participate in our UAT the option of 
1. waiting until the 4142 & 4142a go live with the All Claims flow or
2. to have assistance from a VA representative while submitting an electronic 526 Claim for Increase and a Paper 4142/4142a

For the individuals who've chosen option 2, we want to prepare them for the session so that we have a high likelihood of completing the veterans' claim for increase and 4142/4142a in the hour time slot we plan to schedule. Below is draft messaging with that intent. 


*Body of Message*

Please let us know what your availability is like between November 26-29. We anticipate needing one hour to complete the process.
