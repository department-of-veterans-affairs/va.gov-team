**4142 UAT Eligibility Screening**

This script will be used with potential UAT participants during the initial call with the veteran to determine whether or not they are eligible. 

Thank you for joining us today! My name is _________, [and my colleague _______ is also on the line] and I'm on a team that is preparing to launch the tool I described in my email to you. Today we want to find out if you are eligible to participate in beta testing of that new functionality that allows veterans to request that the VA retrieve their Private Medical Records via the web form.


**With that, I have a few questions for you:**

1. Can you confirm that you've already filed a claim for disability benefits?
2. Can you confirm that you have a service-connected disability that's gotten worse?
3. Have you signed in to your premium My HealtheVet or DS Logon account? If you don't have a verified account, you can create an ID.me account to complete the verification process.)
* **Get instructions on how to do this that can be sent to the individuals after the call if needed**
4. Do you have private medical records associated with the worsening of your service-connected disability?
5. Can you confirm that you would like the VA to retrieve your Private Medical Records on your behalf in support of your claim?

**If these conditions are not met:**

Thank you for taking a few minutes to talk to us today. Unfortunately you will not be able to utilize this new tool for your claim. We will keep you on our recruitment list for future enhancements you might be eligible for. 

**If these conditions are met:**

You can utilize our new tool to submit your claim for increase.  We are in the process of completing our production-readiness testing on the new tool that weâ€™d like you to beta test. When the tool is ready, which expect will occur between November 5 and November 17. With this, we would like to observe via a web conference as you walk through the process of submitting your claim and requesting your Private Medical Records. Would you be open to that?

**If yes:**

Great! We will reach out as soon as our final testing is complete to schedule your session. Do you have any questions?

**If no:**

We understand that and appreciate you taking a few moments of your time to talk to us today. Thank you!
