**4142 UAT Ineligible Correspondence**

The following messaging is drafted to be shared with veterans we screened for UAT who were not eligible because they had a claim for increase but only had VA Medical records (no private medical records). Because VA.gov just went live with the 526 Claim for increase, we wanted to share that opportunity with these volunteers. 

This correspondence was shared with two UAT screening participants on 11/16/18.




*Subject: Option to Submit your Claim for Increase Electronically*

Hi _________, 

Thank you again for your willingness to support the VAâ€™s efforts to test new online capabilities on VA.gov. As discussed during our call a few weeks ago, our beta program is targeting individuals with private medical records that they want the VA to retrieve on their behalf but we recently launched functionality on VA.gov that allows individuals with VA medical records to complete their claim for increase electronically. 

If you are interested in doing so, below are step by step instructions on how to access the claim for increase process electronically. 

1. Navigate to https://www.va.gov/disability-benefits/apply/form-526-disability-claim/introduction
2. Log in to your My HealtheVet, DS Logon or ID.me account. 
3. Follow the flow answering questions that are presented in support of your claim. 

Thank you!
