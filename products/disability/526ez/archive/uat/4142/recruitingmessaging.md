## For DSVA/Ad Hoc Recruits: ##
"Thank you for signing up to participate in a session to use the VA's new tool to support submission of your claim for benefits! We're launching a new tool so you can request that the VA retrieve your Private Medical Records from your doctor while applying for increased disability compensation online.

To use this tool, all of these must be true:
- You've already filed a claim for disability benefits
- You have a service-connected disability that's gotten worse
- You're signed in to your premium My HealtheVet or DS Logon account. (If you don't have a verified account, you can create an ID.me account to complete the verification process.)
- You would like the VA to retrieve your Private Medical Records on your behalf in support of your claim.

If you meet the above requirements, and you’re interested in trying out our new tool, respond to this email with your phone number and let me know when you have 5 minutes to hop on a call to cover some basic questions so we can make sure your claim will allow you to use this new tool and if it does get a session scheduled. We'd like to have our beta participants identified by 11/2/2018.

Thank you again!

## For Usability Testing Recruits: ## 
“Thank you for signing up to participate in a VA website feedback session! We're launching a new tool so you can request that the VA retrieve your Private Medical Records from your doctor while applying for increased disability compensation online. I'd like to hop on the phone to ask you some basic questions, so we can make sure you are eligible to use this new tool and, if you are, get a session scheduled.  This initial call should just take 5 - 10 minutes.

Is it alright for me to give you a call? Do you have a preferred time? We'd like to have our beta participants identified by 11/2/2018.
Thank you again!
