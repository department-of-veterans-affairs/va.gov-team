| Review Identity Information	| view basic information that's pre-populated into my claim for increase for me, so I can verify it's correct or update it if necessary before I submit my application.	| Veterans are told where to go to update incorrect identity info *Update: Data retrieved to pre-fill identity is passed in headers. If we edit this, it does not get forwarded to EVSS based on the current schema. For MVP, we cannot allow this info to be edited (because it has nowhere to go). |	Review screen shows identifying info to the veteran --> sees guidance to go to  [Profile] to update any wrong info.
| Review Contact Information	| view the basic information that's pre-populated into my claim for increase for me, so I can verify it's correct or update it if necessary before I submit my application.	|The character limit (max length) for Address lines 1-3 cannot be more than 20 characters because the Correspondence Mail Letter envelope window cannot fit/display more than 20 characters. Consequently, VBMS has put the restriction on their web service.  |		Any addresses from lines 1-3 over 20 characters throws error (expected behavior)
| | | *Edits displayed as addendum to prompt adjudicator that there were changes|
| | | Provide basic veteran contact and identity info, consistent with 526EZ, service number not a required attribute	 |	API is down --> display edit state instead of review state
| | | Load the Veteran’s name and personal details from whatever sources prefill and Profile team are using. | Update to form schema fail --> use standard form pattern for error messaging."
| | | If user clicks Continue, save this data to the form schema as a part of the Save in Progress feature.	| Send all of the data in the form schema to the EVSS submit/validate endpoint"
| | | If user Edits + Updates, save the updates to the form schema as a part of the Save in Progress feature and display their updated info in the review state.	|	if user leaves form and returns, changes and additions up to that point have been saved
| Review Address	| review and update my primary address	| Load the address, phone, and email from sources prefill and Profile team are using (PCIU)		
| Review Military Service History |	review military service history (branch and period of service)		| *from 5/14 EVSS stand-up:  `servedInCombatZone` this field is only required for 526 Increase applications where the veteran served at some point after 9/11. |	-If user Adds Another Service Period or Edits + Updates an existing service period, save this data to the form schema as a part of the Save in Progress feature. (This specific pattern for “adding new” exists in 1990 flow for reference. For ServedinCombatZone: This question will not be relevant for claims for increase, as it’s considered in relation to the establishment of service connection. This is something that may be captured in the original claim, but is not always captured as data within the corporate database. The VBMS Rating system has a field available for selection by the end user (adjudicator) to identify a rated issue as resulting from combat, but the selection is dependent on user compliance. I believe that field writes back to the Corporate Database, but that may be something to confirm with VBMS and PA&I/CorpDB. Title 10: It sounds like you are referring to functionality within the CFI interview process where we are displaying military service information that is already verified and available in VA systems and is being displayed to the applicant through the self-service portal. Is that correct? If so, displaying information about alternative names that they’ve served under, unit name and telephone number, and confinement dates (if FPOW) would not be needed (and arguably are not data elements available in Corp DB). If the applicant previously filed a claim and has subsequently been activated under Title 10 in the guard or reserves, that is information that could be relevant to the current claim. The reason being is that VA cannot pay benefits to a Servicemember who is currently under active orders. Also, if they had a period of service that was not previously accounted for, VA is responsible for obtaining those service records to verify the service period and obtain service treatment records (that may show a worsening of the condition).
| Review Payment Details |	review payment information so that my benefits can be sent to the right account	*From 5/16 EVSS standup allowing veterans to change it introduces the potential for fraud b/c those inputs won't be validated | include bank account and routing number *from 5/14 EVSS stand-up: directDeposit information must be submitted in order to be included on the 526 Increase application. Since this data comes from a masked endpoint, the submitted account information will be useless as-is. EVSS is going to unmask 	|	- [void]If user Edits + Updates, save this data to the form schema as a part of the Save in Progress feature and display their updated info in the review state. Do not submit back through PPIU or any other VA DB Update endpoint.  Pre-fill user payment info (type, account, routing no), disallow edit
| Rated Disabilites |	need to be able to start a claim for increase for a previously rated claim, so I can attempt to get a higher evaluation for the selected condition.	| service-connected disabilities that have received a rating (0 or above) are presented to the veteran so that an increase can be requested	-The bold label, like “PTSD” in the screenshot below, should come from a reference table (hardcoded) mapping `diagnosticCode’ to the condition names.	| veteran with 0% rating can see and select disability, veteran with ratings between 1-100 can see and select rated disability
