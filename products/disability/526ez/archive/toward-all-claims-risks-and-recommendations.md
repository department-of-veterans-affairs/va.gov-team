# Toward 526 All Claims

## Where is 526 now?

The work on claims for increase has laid a strong foundation for supporting all claims. Veteran feedback has provided validation for the broad approach, and actionable feedback to further focus the experience. This work has also shown us where we need more work on APIs and the backing systems to best serve our constituency. We are closing on being able to launch an increase focused MVP product.


## How do we get the rest of the way there?

#### Strong SME support to work out critical details

We have identified patterns for all the core functionality (disability selection, evidence gathering, and a helping hand with exams), but executing these will require a very detailed and nuanced command of the ratings and evidence landscape. 

For Example, we know that Veterans need a way to sift through the large number of recognized disabilities to find the one that best matches their situation. We have identified a few mechanics for doing this. But they all require that we have a strong understanding of how these disabilities relate to each other and systems of the body that a layperson can understand. Further, we want to be able to cue Veterans to what conditions they need to meet in order to qualify for a rating, or increase. We need experts to help us get this right. We will also need strong coordination with the business side to make sure that buy-in on technique and substance extends all the way to the top.

#### Strong leadership coordination with external contractors

The introduction of the BAH team adds another wrinkle. Their scope includes some critical path ancillary forms: The PTSD, private medical records release (and maybe Individual Unemployability) are necessary to fully support the All Claims flow. The other ancillary forms are important but not as tightly coupled. Coordinating work on these critical forms will add more logistical complexity to the effort between now and December 2018. We will need strong leadership from DSVA to make this tenable.

#### More independent infrastructure

Finally, we are significantly limited by our reliance on using EVSS endpoints for everything. I believe we should use our tools to create the PDF within vets.gov infrastructure. This would give us more freedom to problem solve with the business side, and allow us to provide a more seamless experience for Veterans by hiding the need for repetitive form filling. For example, if we can find a path (business and technical) to submit more helpful information to exam schedulers, we would have the ability to actually do it.

I'd be happy to elaborate or attempt to clarify any of this if that would be helpful.

Cheers, Alex
