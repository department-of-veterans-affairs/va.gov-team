## Document information
### Title
VSO’s experience of the disability compensation claim process

### Description
This map illustrates the role a Veteran Service Officer (VSO) plays  in the disability claim process a Veteran may encounter, from researching and determining eligibility to receiving and reviewing the decision from VA. Each stage requires specific actions from the Veteran (blue), VSO (green) and/or the VA (gray), which guides the claim process along. Defining moments, represented by activities, throughout the process help illustrate the Veteran’s experience. Feelings connected to these moments, identified by sentiment, convey specific triumphs, problems, and concerns a VSO may experience.

Not all Veterans are the same and there is no “one” Veteran. This journey map represents a compilation of quotes, statements, actions, and issues described by VSOs who were asked about the disability compensation claim process. A user research and discovery sprint conducted in September and October 2017 is the foundation of this journey map. 10 VSOs were interviewed across four cities. The individuals who shared their experiences speak only for themselves. Names and organizations have been removed to protect individual’s identities.

This journey map is intended to be used as a guide to facilitate a better understand the experience from a VSO’s perspective when working with a Veteran to file a disability compensation claim. The stories, backgrounds, conditions, and situations contributing to an experience are unique. Together, the quotes and sentiments depicted in each stage of the process tell a story of the challenges and complexity faced by Veterans and their representatives throughout the disability compensation claim process. 

## Stage 

### Research
Veteran researches eligibility and paperwork requirements.

### Claim application
A life event pushes the Veteran to apply and start the daunting claim process with help from a VSO.

With help from the Veteran, the VSO strategically adds conditions, showing a trail of evidence to support the claim.

The VSO compiles and reviews the claim for completeness to determine if it should be a standard 526EZ, FDC or DRC.

The Veteran and VSO did a lot of legwork to submit the claim. They hope the effort will pay off.

### Establish
Once the VSO submits the claim, the VA collects and scans documents into VBMS.

### Claim development
A VSR begins work on a claim once it is established.

The Veteran receives requests to take actions throughout the development process.

The VSO helps the Veteran understand what’s asked of them and helps accomplish tasks to keep the claim on track.

The VA reviews evidence and records, requesting more information as needed.

### Rating
The rVSR determines if the diagnosis is service connected, then calculates a disability rating.

### Decision
The VSO reviews the rVSR’s decision before promulgation. A packet is mailed with a decision to the Veteran.

### Review
Decision received. Now what? With help from the VSO, the Veteran has to decide: Should I accept it, ask for a reconsideration, increase, or appeal it?

## Feelings
### Positives
* "VSOs have expertise based on years of experience."
* "For our members who are catastrophically injured, Veteran self-service is not an option. We try to do everything for the Veteran."

### Neutrals
* "Most Veterans today want to do this online."
* "The VA has great services, but finding out about them is hard."
* "The VA provides wonderful services, the problem is Veterans don't know about them, or can't access them."
* "The VA has great specialized programs for things like blindness and spinal cord injuries, but it's really hard finding out about them. Once you are in the program it's great."
* "Younger Veterans want to do things on their own."
* "We only take claims with merit. we don't take everything that walks in the door."
* "eBenefits is unreliable. When it works, it works great, but it feels like it's down 50% of the time."
* "DRC is basically FDC on steroids."
* "If DRC works the way it is supposed to, I think it will be faster."

### Pain points
* "Veterans need better information up front about what's needed for a rating."
* "I want one place that tells me where to get all the different things like military records, VA health records, etc."
* "It would be great to have a flowcharts or something with clear instructions about the entire process."
* "There are so many questions Veterans have about their benefits."
* "Veterans need better education during Servicemember transition period for them to file their disability claim prior to transition."
* "Younger Veterans don't file clams when they transition out of the military because they don't want to be considered a ‘disabled Veteran’."
* "VSOs have to understand law, policy, anatomy and physiology to do this job well."
* "We have to be like attorneys too and learn the US Code Title 38."
* "Veterans will ask me, 'are you a doctor?'"
* "SEP is not stable and is down a lot." 
* "We need better communication with the VA throughout the process."
* "The VA treats all of the VSOs the same, but we are not. Four of the big six are 'decentralized' but the VA treats us all like we are centralized, like DAV."
* "DRC isn't shortening the time it takes for a claim."
* "DRC takes the work from the VA and puts the duty to assist on the VSOs."
* "The VA is putting their work on us with DRC. Veteran Service Officers are already overloaded."
* "DRC is shifting the VA work to VSOs—who don't make as much money as the VA."
* "DRC isn't helping the Veteran; it's just changing when the VA starts the clock."
* “I'm reluctant to use DRC because faulty DBQs are entered into the Veterans' records."
* "It would be great when you file a blindness claim if it would trigger other benefits blind Veterans are eligible for."
* "The VA should treat all blind Veterans with blind flash, not just service-connected blindness."
* "Blind Veterans have unique needs that VA doesn't always consider."
* "Once we submit, it goes into the National Work Queue and we can't just go talk to someone in the regional office anymore.  That was a lot easier."
* "I understand why the VA moved to the National Work Queue, but it used to be easier when you could talk to someone."
* "We have concerns about the VA protecting Veterans' PII data."
* "VSOs can manipulate the system to benefit the Veteran."
* "Basically we have contacts and interactions all over the place, whether in Regional Office, or VA Hospital, we have connections and relationships with people that helps the claims process. We have ways to correct things and get things fixed." 
* "If it works for decentralized it will work for centralized, but the reverse isn't true."
* "Getting DBQs done takes time."
* "If you [a Veteran] make a mistake, the process then takes a very long time."
* "Why can't it be like the Domino's pizza tracker?"
* Unlike the Domino's Pizza app, "when eBenefits say they're putting on the sauce, they're just rolling out the dough."
* "VSOs have been asked to do more and more and the VA is communicating less."
* "Communication is a problem. Some kind of notifications would be good."
* "I had to create my own 'diary system' to track actions."
* "Bureaucracy doesn't always work. When it works, it works well, but when it doesn't, it's terrible."
* "We have contacts all over the place that a Veteran won't have."
* "Sometimes it's clear that the VA does not look at the evidence that's given."
* "The law says everything in the claim should be considered, but it's not."
* "The VA needs to have better, more experienced claims processors. They don't consider all the information."
* "We need to be able to 'stop the clock' during the 48-hour review if we need more time."
* "The problem with the 48-hour time to review is that sometimes the VA employee does not get back in touch within this time. It needs to be a two-way street."
* "I was getting so discouraged with decisions for elderly Veterans—a lot of them were dying before they got the decision. I do everything I possibly can to put together the best case so the VA has everything they need to make a decision—so they do NOT have to appeal."
* "We are very concerned about a technology system making a decision about a claim—and not a person. These are complex cases."
* "Our agenda is not the same as VBA Deputy’s."
* "The biggest challenge is explaining the options after the decision."
* "The biggest thing Veterans get stuck on—initiation is not usually a problem—is the decision and ‘why’ it was I denied, how do I appeal, what happens next?"
* "It would cut down a bunch of appeals by adding to the DBQ that a Veteran has service-connected conditions and these could lead to other issues."
* "A lot times Veterans appeal because they don't understand the decision."
