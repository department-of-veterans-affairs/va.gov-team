# VA Disability Claims Modernization Effort

## TL;DR

VA's deep dive into disability claims process reveals critical pain points and opportunities for tech-driven improvements.

## What We Did

The VA Digital Service team conducted a discovery sprint to identify and address challenges in the disability compensation claim process.

## Key Insights

### Difficulty in Record Retrieval

Veterans and VA employees struggle to find necessary records, leading to delays.

> "It’s difficult and tedious for Veterans and VA employees to find personnel, military, and medical records."

### Claims Non-Standardization

The lack of standardization in filed claims results in subjectivity and errors.

> "Non-standardization of filed claims leads to subjectivity in rating process, causing development errors and delays."

### Online Filing Overwhelms Veterans

The complexity of online claims filing often leads to abandonment and a preference for paper claims.

> "Filing a claim online is so overwhelming, Veterans often abandon, leading to more paper claims which VA employees manually establish, causing errors and costing time and resources."

### Potential for Self-Serve Solutions

A self-serve Direct Review Claim (DRC) solution could streamline the process and improve the experience for veterans.

> "VA Digital Service to leverage our design and technology resources to create a self-serve DRC solution for Veterans."

## Between the Lines

The insights suggest that while the VA has made progress, there's a significant opportunity to enhance the claims process through technology, particularly by simplifying access to records and standardizing claims filing.

## Yes, But

Despite the potential benefits of a self-serve DRC solution, there's a risk of increased appeals if veterans perceive errors in self-submission, and a possible initial decrease in average DRC processing time due to higher volumes without increased rating staff.

## Why It Matters

Improving the disability compensation claim process aligns with the VA's mission to serve veterans efficiently and with respect, potentially saving time and resources while increasing veteran satisfaction.

## What’s Next

The next steps include validating the solution, conducting design sprints, planning implementation, and launching with comprehensive usability testing and iteration.
