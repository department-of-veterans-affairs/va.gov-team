# Email
From VSO Comms meeting with VA 09/27/2017

WWII, Korean, Vietnam Veterans:
- No email / they refuse to use it. 
- Feel like they're in the dark. 
- Donâ€™t want to go to a new site (if they use the internet)
- VSO tries to tell them to get their kids and grandkids involved to help them
- Vietnam Veterans: a third have email addresses
- Paper still primary, even faxes.
