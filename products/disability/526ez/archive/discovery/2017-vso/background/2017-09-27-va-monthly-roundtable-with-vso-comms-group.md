## Notes VSO Comms 9/27/2017 

### DSVA

* Marcy gave a quick overview of USDS since some folks were unfamiliar with the Digital Service. High priority areas: technology and policy processes. Mentioned DS teams relevant to VA - DOD,  DHS, CMS.
* Question: Are we working with DOE on the big energy project? Answer: No, we're not involved with that project.
* Design and Technology - Agile method overview. Went through [slides](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/discovery/2017-vso/background/vso-communicatorsv2.pptx). Healthcare form example on Vets.gov Principles e.g. Modernization. Veteran facing AND impacting system. Mentioned VSO interaction e.g. veteran sitting in their office working through an application.
* Vets.gov started with 3 features, now we have 60. Next on list - 3rd party logon (e.g. VSOs) on behalf of a veteran
* Went through Profile: transfer info from DOD, also allow for 3rd party logon, allow for address updates, (VA spends $350 million per year on mail, 40% sent back due to bad addresses). Turbo Tax analogy, accountant still a factor if a user desires.
* Scheduling is a priority for Secretary. Issue: Findability, Usability, Design.
* Q: Where are we in identifying requirements for claims process. A: We are just getting started.
* Concern (Ryan Gallucci, Director of the VFW's National Veterans Services) - VA has a habit of going out to field and not corporate office. Quality Control standards are in place to ensure consistency and this habit does an end-run around this.
* Concern (WWII and Korean Veterans VSO) - no emails/refuse. Feel like they're in the dark. Don’t want to go to a new site. VSO tries to tell them to get their kids and grandkids involved. Understands problem will be solved with time, including Vietnam 
(a third have email addresses). Paper still primary, even faxes.
* Suggestion (VS)): get a blurb into newsletters asking people to get in their current address to their VA. **They are working on February newsletter in October. VA would need to get them a blurb soon.** Among veteran population there are a lot of late adopters - magazine wins out over email newsletter.

### NCA - National Cemetery Administration 

Working to digitize veterans legacy - stories and memories live on and are passed on. Partnering with Universities and letting them create whatever’s most appropriate for their community. E.g. San Francisco State is creating 12 short films. Creating a digital space where students, families, etc. can explore the cemetery online. Collect and share stories, etc. online. Partnering with Library of Congress Veteran’s History project. Goal: memories live on. Not forgetting about veterans once they pass. Trying to get the message out there that it’s 135 National Cemeteries, it’s not just Arlington.
* Q: Working with SVA. A: About to look into it.
* Q: What about veterans in private cemeteries. A: Hopefully when Digital Cemeteries in place, other resting places may be incorporated.
* Q: May want to allow for people to reach out to families. A: We’re doing that in certain ways. Finding first of kins is tough for older graves.
* Q: Tie-in into million veteran program. A: Working with them at Punch Bowl Cemetery.
* Q/Comment: Mobile compatibility is important.
* Will be providing same-day Presidential Memorial certificates. Also piloting Saturday burials.
* Q:What about status of pre-need burial benefit? **A: Mentioned vets.gov as a solution to 6 people that are hand-doing the pre-need burial benefits eligibility determination processing.**
Q: Did recent hurricanes impact cemeteries? A: Yes, and working on emergency contracts to clean up areas. Also looking to hear form employees. (edited)

### VBA - Decision Ready Claims, Appeals Reform

* [Appeals Modernization Communications Toolkit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/discovery/2017-vso/background/appeals-modernization-communications-toolkit.pdf) - authored by Dominique Joseph, VBA related to
[Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization of 2017](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2288)
* Decision Ready Claims presented by Mike LeDesma (sp) at last VSO Comms meeting. This is not going to fit for every veteran. It’s a simple form, not for Agent Orange: presumptive, for increases, service connection already established, no need to pull medical records. Off-board to FDC or regular claims process. Offering additional training to VSOs since everyone wasn’t able to attend. Having make-up courses in beginning of October.
* Comment (Ryan, VFW): Consultation in the beginning is important, beyond initial pilot. Should be collaborative in communication plan. Otherwise they’ll be behind the eight-ball and have to go into damage control mode. Military Times & Time and Purpose. This is what veterans read. **Ramp to DRC off-boarding is problematic because it doesn’t comply with Modernization Act.**
A bit of a warning framed as a joke (from Ryan's colleague) “You want it real bad, you’re going to get it real bad.”
