### Benefits Relevant to the Journey Map Quotes

The benefits below are relevant to benefits as a direct result of implementing Decision-Ready Claims (DRC) for Veteran Self-Service, and they address the yellow and red quotes on the claims journey map. They are grouped in topics and can be applied to multiple quotes.

#### Veterans Can't Find Information / Don't Understand Process / Too much information on eBenefits
- DRC instructions and process will be rewritten in plain language that is concise and easy to understand.
- Veterans can get accurate and complete informaiton directly from VA / Vets.gov DRC pages; won't be forced to go looking to peer groups and VSOs for information.
- DRC plain language will include clearly defined processes and steps in the process
- Vets.gov contact center staff will be trained to answer questions with complete and accurate information
- Vets.gov claims status already exists and provides improved status data to Veterans (per qualitative feedback we are receiving from Call Cetner data since launch)
- Only relevant information will be on DRC; currently VA.gov has 250,000 pages of content with less than 10% transactional; Veterans can't find information
- Eligibility requirements will be clearly described so Veterans who are eligible don't miss out on benefits they have earned
- Veterans will be able to be their own advocate and control the process (if they choose)
- Veterans won't have to read through hundreds of pages of dense "lawyer" text; process will be faster and more clearly defined

#### Access, Availability & Technical Performance Issues
- Mobile responsive
- 508 compliant
- Vets.gov Logon has higher availability (99.99%) than DS Logon (?) which is the primary driver of overall 76% eBenefits availability
- Self-service feature eliminates Veteran dependence on VSOs (for those Veterans who do not want to use a VSO); presently there is not a usable option (85% abandonment rate of Veterns on 526EZ).
- Veterans can complete the process online using any device
- Increased business rules will decrease errors and provide select data to be pre-populated
- NIST-compliant security for logon

#### Inability to Expedite / Fast Track Claims
- DRC will fast track select claims; speed process from average of 112 days to 30 days or fewer
- Veterans are in control of speeding the process since they will be part of gathering evidence and exam process


#### Poor User Experience / Inefficent Processing
- Veterans will not have to recount PTSD events
- Improved access to VA data will decrease the amount of data that Veterans have to re-submit to VA
- Increased business rules will decrease errors and provide select data to be pre-populated
Vets.gov contact center staff will be trained to answer questions with complete and accurate information
- Vets.gov claims status already exists and provides improved status data to Veterans (per qualitative feedback we are receiving from Contact Center data since launch)
