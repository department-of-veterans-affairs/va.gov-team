## Document information
### Title
Veteran’s experience of the disability compensation claim process

### Description
This map illustrates the stages in the disability claim process a Veteran may encounter, from researching and determining eligibility to receiving and reviewing the decision from VA. Each stage requires specific actions from the Veteran and/or the VA, which guides the claim process along. Defining moments, represented by activities, throughout the process help illustrate the Veteran’s experience. Feelings connected to these moments, identified by sentiment, convey specific triumphs, problems, and concerns a Veteran may experience.

Not all Veterans are the same and there is no “one” veteran. This journey map represents a compilation of quotes, statements, actions, and issues described by Veterans, VSOs, and VA staff who were asked about the disability compensation claim process. A series of four user research studies were conducted between 2016 to 2017. Thirty-nine Veterans, seven VA staff, and eight VSOs were interviewed across four cities. The individuals who shared their experiences speak only for themselves. (Names have been changed to protect individual’s identities.)

This journey map is intended to be used as a guide to facilitate a better understand the experience from a Veteran’s perspective when filing a disability compensation claim. The stories, backgrounds, conditions, and situations contributing to an experience are unique. Together, the quotes and sentiments depicted in each stage of the process tell a story of the challenges and complexity faced by Veterans seeking disability compensation. 

## Stage 

### Research
Veteran researches eligibility and paperwork requirements.

### Claim application
A life event pushes the Veteran to apply and start the daunting claim process.

The Veteran strategically adds conditions, showing a trail of evidence to support their claim.

Adding evidence is overwhelming because of the high stakes and difficulty getting access to their records.

The Veteran did a lot of legwork to submit their claim. They hope the time spent will pay off.

### Establish
Once the Veteran submits their claim, the VA collects and scans documents into VBMS.

### Claim development
A VSR begins work on a claim once it is established.

The Veteran receives requests to take actions throughout the development process.

The Veteran checks the claim progress online or calls VA.

The VA reviews evidence and records, requesting more information as needed.

### Rating
The rVSR determines if the diagnosis is service connected, then calculates a disability rating.

### Decision
Supporting documents are requested from the Veteran to determine compensation. A packet is mailed with a decision.

### Review
Decision received. Now what? The Veteran has to decide: Should I accept it, ask for a reconsideration, increase, or appeal it?

## Feelings
### Positives
* A VSO can help to recognize and understand what evidence is necessary to substantiate a claim.
“Cheryl was a one woman army. She asked me, do you have DD214? What is
your rating? Here are the forms. Here is what you need to do...She walked me through the process and answered questions so I didn't have to look at the VA monster and figure it out.” - Matthew, Veteran
* Claims submitted through eBenefits are instantly established.

* "I don't know what to do next or how to figure it out so I'll just go to DAV and they'll help me." – Joy, Veteran

* "I would like to know from the source—I want to learn from VA—I want clear language when getting ready to apply." – Jenn & Howie, Veterans

* "The VA should be able to get this information. Why do I have to provide it?" – Jason, Veteran 
* "Why aren't My HealtheVet and eBenefits connected?" – Meg, Veteran
