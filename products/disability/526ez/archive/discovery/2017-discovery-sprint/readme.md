## Discovery analysis and MVP approach definition:

Upon further analysis of the top user problem statements and current VA tooling, like our [research into existing eBenefits self service 526 tools](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/sep-2017/ebenefits-526-baseline-usability-testing.pdf), we realized that the better way to solve the most critical Veteran frustrations would be to iterate on existing self-service claims tools by mapping product flow to the Veteran mental model, incorporating more compassion into the experience, and hosting them on a flexible Platform that allows for frequent iteration. Instead of iterating on the DRC (decision-ready claims) pilot to extend it into a self-service flow, as that would have required robust VA C&P exam policy and backend technology changes for us to even able to build and test an MVP. Our hypothesis was that if we saw improvements in Veteran experience and processing ease by launching our updated tooling for one claim type (claims for increase), we could learn what worked in that approach and continue applying until all claim types are covered in the new tools.

So! With that adjustment in approach, we kicked off implementation with an updated [526 Disablity Claims MVP Kickoff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/discovery/2017-discovery-sprint/output/disability-claims-mvp-kickoff.pptx) and built a [Product Outline for 526 Disability Compensation Claims](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability) to flesh out the approach, goals, and success metrics as implementation got underway.
