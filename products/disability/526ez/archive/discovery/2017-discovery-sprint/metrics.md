## Draft Performance Metrics for Modernized 526 Intake and Claim Status Products

#### Metric 1: Speed Processing Time of Claims
Increase claims filed online vs. paper applications (with the assumption that an online claim is faster than a paper claim).

Basline Data:
- Average 80,000 claims recv'd / month by VA
    - ~31,000 submissions recv'd on average / month on eBenefits (filed online by Veterans - can be original or supplemental)^ **this number seems high given that everyone keeps saying self-submitted online claims are only a drop in the bucket. Is this number right? Am I not interpreting it correctly?**
    - ~6,700 submissions recv'd on average / month on SEP + D2D (filed online by VSOs - can be original or supplemental)^
    - 80,000 - (X+Y) = paper claims submitted / month to VA

- 112 days (average) to process a claim

^ Electronic submissions are counted differently by the purposes of "submission" as opposed to tracking items in the system with how paper claims are received. 


Target:
- Reduce paper claims by 15% in Year 1 (increase online 15%); 30% in Year 2
- Reduce 112 average days to process claims by at least 10% (less than 100 days) in Year 1
    - Demonstrate that vets.gov online claims take fewer than 112 days to process

#### Metric 2: Increase Accuracy of Claim Information Submitted
Online claims reduce errors as a result of manual data entry 

Baseline Data:
- 12 Month Claim-Based Accuracy is 86%
    - VBA's national claim-level accuracy rate is determined by dividing the total number of cases that are error-free by the total number of cases reviewed from the prior twelve months.

Target
- Show that vets.gov online applications have higher accuracy level than 86%
    - Using both improved design, plain language directions and guidance, and technical business rules to reduce errors.

#### Metric 3: Reduce Costs 
Decrease the number of calls to VA National Call Center as a result of 526 and claim status product design, functionality, and plain language content.

Baseline Data:
- NCC gets 4.2M calls / year regarding claims
    - Calls to NCC cost $9 / call
    - costs VA $38M / year

Target
- Decrease calls to NCC by 10% year 1 (cost savings of $4M) and 30% year 2 ($10M)
- Enable NCC to reduce hold times etc. as a result of fewer calls
