# Lists and their relationships

There are several confusingly names lists of conditions and contention codes. The Largest list has codes that will map it to the shorter lists of categories.

- The [7000ish list](list-of-7000ish-conditions-with-contention-codes.csv) – This list turns out to be a pull of contentions that came through the system over the last year and change. It is a representative sample, but is not exhaustive. The descriptions are as entered by raters interpreting the DBQ writeups that docs provide after exams. There is a lot of duplication.
- The [800ish list](list-of-800ish-contentions.csv) – This list is what is exposed today in eBenfits. It's the old contention claim list that has been boiled down to the shorter list below.
- The [125ish list](list-of-125ish-contentions.csv) – This list is used back-of-house and is not exposed to the Veterans today. This is what we are currently using to develop a wizard approach to new contentions.

The `-edit` files are WIP and an attempt to make the lists more friendly.
