# CSRA DRC Discovery sync

 * 10/2/2017
 * CSRA devs and PMs
 * vets.gov: Robbie, Kerry, Raquel
 * VBA: Paul Shute
 
 * Context: Marcy asked the CSRA team to do some preliminary discovery on the DRC process and report on what level of effort would be required to make enhancements to SEP to support DRC
 * Paul Shute outlined the DRC process to the CSRA team
 * Neil Desai did some initial discovery and produced a visual output of the business process
 * [Neil's visual](DRC%20Business%20Process%20v4%20CSRA.pdf)
   * red 'A' boxes indicate where automation may be possible
 * Neil walked through this visual and discussed open questions with Paul Shute
   * (details of discussion not available)
 * Neil to produce a document outlining
   * what pieces of the process would be good candidates for automation
   * whether these improvements apply to SEP or to vets.gov self-serve, or to both
   * what pieces are high-risk (e.g., rely on VA process changes or partner service changes)
 * no additional SEP work is scheduled at this time
