Notes:

Not currently integrated with VHA, but VBMS to Contract Examiners - generates the request for the appointment; routing when ready to be rated

For a new claim, need to be able to tie to service records and a service connected issue - this is hard to do
Starting with claim for increase because it's already a rated issue and can be automated

New contingent - hasn't been approved and you don't know what people really need so it's difficult to automate

How do we match what the veteran puts in on claim for increase? Knee - > then provide knee-related options for exams

Exams are ordered only for contingents

No direct data correlation between a previously rated contingent and a rating, which came about through an exam that was ordered - this is being built by OI&T right now - rated issue came from which contingent

For a contingent to be automated, it must meet a set of criteria

Can’t complete this until the mapping and rules checks are completed
Data elements and data mapping is the long pole in the tent -OI&T leadership and OBPI will determine how this will fall out; Supplemental EP's might be taking priority now (6 resources) - Sherry-Lynn Smith and Ken Wimsatt

BGS services being built in 15.1

Probably can get done in 2 releases, but they may not be consecutive
Kim thinks that automated exams will be helpful but only for a limited populations of claims.


Look out for: claims establishment will need to be updated 
Vsr will have to manually go back to what is rated to trigger the automation if we can't get this right

Pohlman, Michael <Michael.Pohlman@va.gov> thought I was trying to ask his contractor to commit to scope/delivery, which I wasn't - merely looking for timeframes and guidance
