(Andrea's notes) - Paul Shute, Marvo Dolor, Andrea Schneider

14 different types of presumptive claims

Lets focus on direct service connection and secondary service connection first

ILER – get a direct database connection to determine presumptive claims

Align with other projects – original claims deployment – can this align with the OBPI scanning of docs for the eFolder

Aggravation of a condition that existed prior to service

NVLSP- national veterans legal service program – an app – benefit identifier – decision tree for disability claims and not claims for increase – conditional logic and helps determine what conditions to apply for
Opportunity to reverse engineer this or compare it to see what the claim types are

Buckets:
Original claim
Returning for another claim (subsequent)
Still in service

Less than 90 days of separation from service – conditions identified and exam held; evaluate disabilities called out and any other disabilities they weren’t aware of
180 days till discharge: IDES (maybe 40K cases per year) and BDD (focus more here) and Decision Ready Claims (90 days or less) – separation health assessment (BDD) or general medical exam (pre discharge DRC)– decided by VA; automated exam would be easiest here


PA&I – how many claims fall under this servicemember population? How many are self service related?

•         Higher level review
•         Supplemental evidence
---Keep these on the roadmap and coordinate with caseflow – allow the veteran to choose one of the three appeals paths, of which these might be 2. Nina Tan – talk about automating this – incentivize  the veteran for using a digital option

Paul to grab the full list of ancillary forms and what claim types they go with (and which can stand on their own and which need to be a part of the 526EZ)


When will OBPI be ready for all scanned docs? This will impact original claim timing
HAIMS (Health Artifact and Image Management Solution) – January 2014 separation or later; pre-discharge group

Presumptive claims – special issue claims



|   | Subsequent Claim  |Original Claim|
|---------|---------|---------|
|Servicemember|•	Claim for Increase MVP   | Use HAIMS data for service connection  |
|   |•	Claim for New Direct Service Connection/condition|   | 
|   |•	Claim for New Secondary Condition |   |
|  Veteran |•	Claim for Increase MVP   | Depending on OBPI scanning timeline, align Original Claims development with delivery of scanning  |
|   |•	Claim for New Direct Service Connection/condition|
|   |•	Claim for New Secondary Condition|   |


Nick Bastien – new director for PA&I 
Mark Seastrom (SES over PA&I) – get his support and prioritize the requests; have Marcy reach out exec to exec – undersecretary priority and want their support for short turnaournd time where we need our requests turned around; priority for the agency where we are producing efficiencies 
 

Diagnostic Tool in VBMS – talk to Chelsey and Rich – can we leverage this? Is it complete and useful? Can we integrate in to the front end? Enhance it and build on it?

Build out the overall process flow for the best way to identify the triage of claim types

Marvo's notes:
# Meeting with Paul Shute 07/09/2017

- presumptive claims have 12 types, including Chronic, Tropical, Agent Orange, Asbestos, etc.
- We'd have to work with PA&I to determine what percentage each of these are.
- High Priority:
  - Direct Service Connection
  - Secondary Service Connection
- Next Priority:
  - Special Issue Cases
- Idea for JSRC (Joint Service Record Coordinator) is to replicate a process like DPRIS (where VSRs log into a system to check on military service history)
- OBPI is going into systems to get Veteran info into eFolder by scanning Service Treatment Records
- Direct and Secondary could be (in some cases) filed together; so they only have to do one medical exam
- NVSLP: National Veterans Legal Service Program (http://app.nvlsp.org/index.php/648933) - a benefit identifier; related to disability compensation
  - question: what are the claim types they've identified
- VA people with data, PA&I
- Original Claim - special category
 - have to verify Military Service history
 - have to get all Service Treatment Records
- 180 > BDD > 90
- < 90 Pre-discharge DRC
  - working on changing regs so that when a Veteran goes back into service, VA gets that feed directly from DoD instead of the individual being responsible for informing the VA.

#### Argument for focusing on Direct Service Connection before tools for Service Members specifically:
- **Need foundational infrastructure, including Special Issue Cases as a prerequisite to Transitioning Service Members e.g SW Asia i.e. Afghanistan**
- IDES: no need to focus on this
- BDD: better to focus on this first
- Pre-discharge DRC because it's simple to gather all STR before discharge
- Automated Exam Ordering is easier for Service Members e.g. General Medical Exam (Predischarge DRC) or Separation Health Exam (BDD)
- integrate with VBMS exam management
- reconsiderations will be going away
- _Future effort_: Veteran-facing portion of AMA
- try to incentivize behavior we want from customer
- [ ] **Andrea** to follow up on this: Paul can get ancillary forms and group them by Claim types; Paul to share DRC 2.0 Decision Tree and would like to see what we're using.
- Order of development/delivery:
1. Direct
2. Secondary
3. Original:
  1. already scanned by OBPI scanning project
  2. newer Veterans HAMES (discharged after Jan 1. 2014)

______ | Subsequent | Original
--- | --- | ---
**Service Member** |1. Increase; 2. Direct; 3. Secondary Service | 4. Original - HAIMS
**Veteran** | 1. Increase; 2. Direct; 3. Secondary Service | 4. Original - scanning
- PA&I
  - what are the different uses of each type of form/numbers of applications per claim type
  - Leila: new Assistant Director
  - Nick Bostien: new Acting Chief, who's been pretty responsive to Paul
  - Mark Seestrom (both of their boss)

- [ ] **Andrea** to ask Lacey to set up a meeting between Marcy and Mark Seestrom;
- [ ] Related: Andrea to ask Marcy to ask Margarita to indicate to her people that this work is a priority and they should help us in a timely manner please

- **Note**: there are a number of folks to keep informed e.g. PA&I who can also be helpful to us as we move forward. Have to balance with all the people who could throw up roadblocks but not have a dog in the fight, i.e. a RASCI chart will be important.
- [ ] **Marvo/Andrea**: ask Marcy status of room at 1800G
- [ ] **Andrea**: Talk to Chelsea and Rich about VBMS Diagnostic Tool
