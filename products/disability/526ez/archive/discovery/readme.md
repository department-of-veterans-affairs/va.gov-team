# Guide to discovery artifacts

There have been several discovery efforts centered on Disability Compensation. This doc will give some background and point to especially helpful artifacts that were created over the course of our work.

## Discovery history

### 2016 Discovery

Our initial swing at this was a deep dive by @suzchap and @melwoodard. They mapped out the existing online flow through eBenefits, and determined that it was a big bite to take (smaller team, fewer forms under our belt) at the time.

### 2017 Discovery – Increase

This was a full two-week discovery sprint that involved a large number of folks. We did many many stakeholder interviews. We spoke with VA staff at every level of the Comp process, and did in-home interviews with Veterans with a variety of experiences with making Comp claims. We started looking at Decision Ready Claims (DRC), which are a special VSO assisted process for making _claims for Increase only_. That is, only for already service-connected and rated disabilities that have gotten worse. 

We determined to start with self service _claims for increase_ and then evaluate whether DRC was feasible as a next step.

There is a lot of stuff in this folder, but a few places that are good to start:

#### Journey map

This describes the overall Veteran experience. It shows the steps and responsibility (Veteran or VA) at each step. We called out highlights and pain-points at these steps.

#### Increase process diagrams

These diagrams show how systems interact in the creation of a claim and begin to explore application flows.

#### Form outlines

These outlines are show how we are planning to build v2.

### 2017 Discovery – VSO

## MVP – Claims for Increase

### Design

We have pivoted from doing high-fidelity comps to describing the forms in outline form and relying on our design system to guide developers in how the components should look.

#### UX design explorations

These screens are part of the initial high fidelity work, and show how we began to walk Veterans through the process. They are not up to date. The MVP form of this work is now live in production behind a password.
