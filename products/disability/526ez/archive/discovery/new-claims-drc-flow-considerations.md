Notes from meeting with Paul Shute and Rich Mounce (7/19/2018)
And BAH team - Meeting purpose was to discuss the existing Exam Management Process and how DRC claims will fit in to the existing process

During the meeting, we discovered that the flow of the application will determine if a claim is DRC eligible or not and Paul identified what he thought will need to happen for DRC

-----
For vets.gov to determine if a claim is DRC eligible without asking a veteran if that’s the path to go down, we’ll have to do the following:
-	Have the veteran identify all the new conditions
-	Follow Step 4 in the DRC Flow document from Paul
-	If all conditions identified fit the criteria and all the required documentation is uploaded, prompt the veteran about wheter or not the veteran would like to “be in control of when the exam will happen” and have the VA decide on the claim promptly
-	If yes, the claim follows the DRC submission path (see below)
-	If no, inform the veteran that the VA will decide when an exam will be needed and the claim follows a traditional submission path, where vets.gov submits the application and autoestablishes the ~endpoint~ claim upon submission

For DRC, we will trigger exam by extracting the conditions that the veteran is claiming – take those conditions and put them in the DRC form and send to VBMS just like 526, but establish an EP400 and hold the 526 until the exam returns come in. Once the results are in the eFolder, vets.gov would submit the full 526 and autoestablish a rating endpoint

Once exam is back, we’ll need to receive a notice from Exam Management system – can we use event services from Exam Mgmt?; claim status changes to Ready for Decision (does this display in our Claim Status tool?)

Need to figure out how to provide notification to the veteran that the application has been submitted
