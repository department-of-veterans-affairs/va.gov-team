| Address Input | Proposed Validation | EVSS Requires | EVSS Supports | Validation Details | Questions / Notes |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mailing / Forwarding | PCIU Address | - addressLine1 - country | All PCIU fields, incl. military info | - Can be type MILITARY (city = [APO, DPO, FPO], state = [AA, AE, AP] - Or domestic (country = 'USA') - Or international (country != 'USA') - Same validation that's used in Letters app | - Should country be required given that it's not used for 'MILITARY' address types? |
| VA / DoD Typeahead | PCIU Address | - country | - city - state - country | - VA is all domestic - DoD is domestic and international - Should be able to pass PCIU validations because of the above - Will be prefilled based on known data | - Do we need to add 'USA' for VA addresses? This info is not in the facilities data (because they're all USA) |
| VA / DoD Manual Entry | PCIU Address | - country | - city - state - country | EVSS does not distinguish between manual & prefilled facilities | - Should we allow users to input address of military type? These don't exist in the VA / DoD list. - Would be easier to allow because we can then reuse the PCIU validations |
| Private Facility | PCIU Address | N/A | N/A | Does not touch EVSS, goes to PDF generator -> central mail | - What fields are required on the paper form? - Paper form will dictate if PCIU is a good fit - Don't need any backend validations |
