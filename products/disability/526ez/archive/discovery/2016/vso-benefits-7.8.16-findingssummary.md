# Benefits Application Research with VSOs
 
## Goal and Research Questions

- Goal 
  - Get a baseline understanding of the current application experience from "expert users"
  - Start to learn what could be improved in the upcoming updates
- Key research questions 
  - What are the most confusing or difficult portions of the current process that we can focus on?
  - In particular, what portions cause the most problems with getting their applications approved (e.g., common errors they make because it's confusing)
  - What are the easiest parts of the process that we should keep?
 
 
### Methods:
- Interviews with 5 VSOs
  - VSOs were from different organizations with different focuses & needs, from Vets with serious health issues to Officers
- Show current systems

## What we learned
### What worked well
- Portions that auto-fill information from other sources
- "Print incomplete form" useful so VSOs can highlight to-do's for Vets

### Challenges we saw
- Technical issues
  - Frequent system downtime prevents VSOs from completing applications
  - Aggressive auto-logout for security causes issue: may need to delete cookies etc to log back in
- Usability challenges
  - Slow wizard-style form is bad for super-user VSOs; save & continue, info pages, have to go through every step slows them
  - Can’t apply for dependency until have been classified at 30%+, so have to go back in and add this later
  - Vets don’t understand ratings & meaning
  - Pre-separation issues in ebenefits
  - Redundant fills: POW status, last place of service - only changes for reserves or active, not Vets
- Workarounds are common
  - Workarounds to upload forms: PTSD etc, have to say “not applying” to avoid re-filling a form
  - Can’t label uploaded forms: PTSD, DBQ, etc appear as “general communication" so may be missed
  - Some VSOs may discourage vets use of ebenefits, either due to confusing site or so they know exactly what's been done with applications
- Information quality & connection issues
  - Incorrect and confusing form letters to Veterans might ask for info they already have
  - Corporate DB info issues cause blocks: for example, no gender entered = can’t finish bc error = not match, need to get it fixed in central DB
  - Sometimes special categories get lost: homeless, etc
  - Can't update address in this system; incorrect info can cause problems for Vets
- Lack of information
  - VSOs not notified when vet requests them as Power of Attorney
  - Have to manually check on clients’ statuses
  
### Next steps for the team
- Continue work documenting and suggesting changes to form fields
  - Focus on language used in forms and instructions
- When team has an early prototype, next round of feedback from Vets, and return to VSOs in a later round
