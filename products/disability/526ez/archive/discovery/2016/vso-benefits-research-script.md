### Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)###
*[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]*
 
Thank you for joining us today. My name is [NAME] and we also have [NAME OF OTHERS OBSERVING] observing and taking notes for this session. We are doing this website feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs working to build a new website that will help veterans get easier access to the benefits they deserve. 
 
The team wants to learn about the current disability benefits application today. We want to see what works well, and what doesn’t work well. 
 
In this session, I’ll ask you to tell me about your experiences with the application process, and give you the option to show me how you use the sites or any other tools. This will help us better understand how to make the site as easy to use and helpful as possible.
 
Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work. 
 
  * We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you. 
  * We aren’t testing your ability. We’re just trying to figure out what works well on the website, and what doesn’t work well. So there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions and what you think so that we can make the site better. I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. 
  * This entire feedback session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question or task. 
  * We’ll be recording the screen activities as we look at the site. Recording our discussion today will help us capture everything you say accurately. 
  * If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
 


### Main questions ###

- Can you tell me a little about your role and work with Veterans?
- How long have you been helping Veterans with benefits applications? Have you done a lot? How many?
- What does that process look like for you? Could you walk me through the steps?
  - [Follow-ups as needed about the steps of the process]
- Are there certain things in the application you feel like you have to explain a lot of the time?
- What are the most common challenges Veterans run into with the application? How do you handle those situations?
- Are the most difficult challenges the same as the common ones? If no, what are they? 
- What are the most common reasons that applications need to be modified or revisited after you submit them?
- If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?
- What are the easiest parts of the process that should be kept as-is?
