For the second step of your Individual Unemployability claim, we need to verify your past employment.  

To help speed up this process, you can send a Request for Employment Information (VA Form 21-4192) to each of your employers from the last 12 months you worked. You’ll need to fill out some of the form with your details before sending it to your employer.

VA will send the form on your behalf, but you may be able to get it completed more quickly.

What is a VA file number? { help-link } 

{ help-text } 

A VA file number helps us identify you when you file a claim.  For most Veterans, your VA file number is your Social Security number without dashes. If you filed your first claim a long time ago, the number may be different than your Social Security number.
