**Form Content for 8940**

Form Title: File a Claim for Individual Unemployability

Form #: Form 21-8940

Chapter Title: 5 of 8 Additional Benefits 

Heading: Individual Unemployability

**8940-5.1**

Equal to VA Form 21-8940 (Veteran’s Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability).

Filing a claim for Individual Unemployability is a two-part process: 
1. Answer questions about your disability and work history
2. Request employment verification from past employers 

**Answer questions** 
First, we’ll ask you questions about your situation and how your service-connected disability prevents you from holding down a steady job. You can either answer the questions online and provide supporting documents. Or if you've already completed a Veteran's Application for Increased Compensation Based on Unemployability (VA Form 21-8940), you can upload the form. If you choose to answer questions online, you don't need to fill out and upload the form.

**Submit employer form**

Then, we'll ask you to send each of your former employers a Request for Employment Information (VA Form 21-4192) to fill out. You'll be able to download this form later in the application. If you don't want to do this step, we can request this information for you, but it may delay the processing of your claim.

Please tell us what you would like to do. { radio }

* I want to continue online with questions about my unemployability.
* I've already filled out a paper form (21-8940) and want to upload it.

How do I know if I'm eligible? { help-link }

{ help-text }

You may qualify for Individual Unemployability if you can’t work because of a disability related to your service in the military (a service-connected disability). 

To qualify, both of these must be true:

* You have at least 1 service-connected disability rated at 60% or more disabling, or 2 or more service-connected disabilities—with at least 1 rated at 40% or more disabling and a combined rating of 70% or more

**and**

* You can’t hold down a steady job that supports you financially (known as substantially gainful employment) because of your service-connected disability. Odd jobs (marginal employment), aren't disqualifying.
 
**Note:** In certain cases -- for example, if you need to be in the hospital often -- you may qualify at a lower disability rating.
