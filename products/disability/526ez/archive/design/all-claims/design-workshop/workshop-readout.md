# 526 Claiming Disabilities Design Workshop

## What we wanted to learn

How can we improve on the way Veterans communicate their disabilities to VA? 

It is difficult for Veterans to tell VA what their disabilities are.

Today it is paper free-text, or an overwhelming list.



## What we did

We held a design workshop to get context and suggestions from participants. About 10 people took about 4 hours out of their days to come talk to us about Disability Comp.



#### Participants

We had a relatively wide variety participants:

- Veterans
- VBA Stakeholders
- Appeals VSRs
- VSOs



#### Workshop agenda

1. Document pain-points
2. Collect context and detail
3. Generate categories
4. Test categories
5. Prototype solutions



## What we learned

### What are the biggest pain points today for Veterans claiming disabilities? 

1. Service connection unclear
2. Claims too general, or too specific
3. “Pyramiding” problem is hard to understand
4. Needs more plain language



### Getting more context from our participating experts 

1. How is the condition claim used, is it just about getting the right exam, or more?

   1. “Don’t burden Veterans with exams stuff”
   2. (But yes) it is about the exam

2. How much detail is useful?

   1. Start broad and then narrow to avoid confusion

   2. Denials come from specificity that is wrong

   3. “You should have our info”

   4. Subsequent digging found that specificity is pretty important. 

      *For example, right vs. left limb matters even if the exam is the same.*

3. How much experience and knowledge do the Veterans bring to the process?

   1. Extremely varied
   2. Sometimes they are wrong
   3. “If you give us choices, make them understandable”

4. Do DBQ categories make sense to expose to Veterans?

   1. Category names are a little technical
   2. Some categories are large and don’t narrow the list as much as they might.

5. What are these oddball conditions in there for?

   1. These are added during development and do not need to be Veteran facing



### Trying to understand disability categories with a giant card sort 

We had three lists to work from:

1. ~125 contentions used backstage as part of exam ordering.
2. ~800 contentions that were replaced by the shorter list
3. ~7000 contentions sampled from recent submissions to Compensation

Both groups were presented with ~800 cards which they sorted into categories of their own creation. 

1. Each group came up with about 25 categories
2. About 2/3 of those categories had substantial overlap with the other group.
3. There were significant collections of "we don’t know?"
4. Some of the categories had very tall stacks



### Testing that understanding of disability categories 

Each group was given 10 conditions to find in the other group’s taxonomy.  

- Gall bladder
- Hearing loss
- Peripheral Neuropathy
- Anemia
- Diabetes
- Pinta
- Plague
- Pellogra
- Yaws
- Cushings



#### How’d it go?

1. Most were found
2. Some required a lot of searching in a stack
3. Some required looking in multiple stacks

*It is worth remembering that these were  pretty expert participants.* 



### Exploring Veteran driven solutions 

Participants were first prompted to just write down ideas quickly, without editing, or second guessing.

Participants then had an opportunity to prototype one (or more) of their ideas with paper templates.

#### Popular concepts in the prototypes:

- Smart text parsing
- Point and click (scope varied)
- Drilling down
- Free text





## What‘s next?

December release: 

- Reducing risk with minimalist fuzzy matching+
- “Stretch goal” with parallel work on interview style interface
