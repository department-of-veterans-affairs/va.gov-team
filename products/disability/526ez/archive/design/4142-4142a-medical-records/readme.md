# 4142/a Informed Consent UI Update

Partway through the development of the 4142, it was necessary to modify the UI on the provider page to allow users to limit their consent. 

A checkbox was added that users may check if they want to limit their consent. When they select the checkbox, a free-text field populates below where they may describe the limitation. 

Within this folder, you may find accompanying UI screens, as well as the original Sketch file.
