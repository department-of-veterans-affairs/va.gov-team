#### PTSD:  $Combat (&) $Non-combat
#### Event Date

When did the event happen? Please note, this date doesn’t have to be exact, but it’ll help with our research if you can provide a date within a 2-month range of the event. If you can’t remember the exact date, we suggest you try to recall the time of year or a holiday that happened around the time of the event. 

More suggestions {help-link}

{ help-text]

Identifying the date of the incident within a 60-day window helps us better research your claim.  Some other ways to place the date range are to recall what the weather was like when the event happened – warm or cold – to identify the season, or to identify whether it was early or later in your deployment or perhaps think of a landmark or place you were during a particular time.
