#### Event Date

Now we’ll ask about the event or events that caused your $PTSDclassification PTSD. If there is more than one event or situation you want to tell us about, we’ll ask questions about each one separately.  { conditional content: display paragraph only on first past through this loop }

When did the first event happen? Please note, this date doesn’t have to be exact, but it’ll help with our research if you provide a date within a 2-month range. { conditional content: display word “first” only on first pass through this loop } 

If you can’t remember the exact date, we suggest you try to recall the time of year or a holiday that happened around the time of the event. { radio }

More suggestions {help-link}

{ help-text]

Identifying the date of the incident within a 60-day window helps us better research your claim.  Some other ways to place the date range are to recall what the weather was like when the event happened – warm or cold – to identify the season, or to identify whether it was early or later in your deployment or perhaps think of a landmark or place you were during a particular time.
