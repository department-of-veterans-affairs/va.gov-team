**Types of stressful events**

**Combat:** This means you participated in a fight or encounter with a military enemy or hostile unit or weapon.  It also could mean you were present during these events either as a combatant or a Servicemember supporting combatants -- for example, providing medical care to the wounded.

**Sexual trauma:** This means you experienced sexual harassment, sexual assault, or rape, by a Servicemember or civilian, while on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training.  

**Personal assault:** This means you were a victim of an assault, battery, robbery, mugging, stalking, or harassment by a person who wasn't part of an enemy force.

**Non-combat other than sexual trauma or personal assault:** This means you experienced an event such as a car accident, hurricane, or plane crash, or witnessed the death, injury, or threat to another person or to yourself, that was caused by something other than a hostile military or terrorist activity.
