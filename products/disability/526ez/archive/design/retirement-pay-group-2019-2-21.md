# Pay waivers and offsets

![526-pay-waivers-diagram](../assets/526-pay-waivers-diagram.png)

## Retirement pay

Retirement pay is ambiguous terminology and seems to encompass both 

1. What we'd think of as retirement pay. 
   *I served ~20 years and get a monthly check at some percentage of my base pay*
2. Medically retired pay.
   *My injuries caused me to cut my career short and I am getting something that kind of sounds like disability comp*

In scenario **1** the 50%+ threshold matters. I can get both retirement and comp if I clear that threshold.

In scenario **2** the threshold doesn't matter. The medical retirement pay will be reduced to offset comp pay.



## Severance or separation pay

We outlined four types of pay that we consider separation or severance

1. Unused vacation payout
2. Voluntary Separation Incentive Program (VSI)
3. Bonuses
4. Medical separation pay

Apparently VA does not care about **1**, we can remove this.

VA does not care about **2**. *But apparently DFAS does* and will reduce the VSI payments by the amount of comp you are receiving.

Bonuses do get offset 

Medical separation pay gets offset. I think this may be the same thing that they were talking about in retirement?



## New stuff

Lump sum retired pay is coming. Reservists "today," and regular active duty in 2026.

VA will be offsetting this, I'm not sure if the 50% threshold will apply.



### New acronyms

- CRDP (Concurrent Retired and Disability Pay)
- CRSC (Combat Related Special Compensation)



### USC codes

A bunch of USC codes got cited, but I haven't read them yet.

- 10 USC 1174
- 10 USC 1174a
- 10 USC 1175a
- 10 USC 1212
- 10 USC 1415 is the lump sum payment statute.
