# Retirement pay and comp

If your rating is below 50% you must choose between getting comp and getting military retirement pay. If you are rated 50% or higher, you get both.

Could we be confident enough about a Veteranâ€™s situation to not ask them some questions? 

For example

- if they have less than 20 years service, should we skip the retirement Y/N question? **Seems like no**
- If they are already at 50% or higher, can we skip the question/waiver? **We skip this in increase flow now, do we need to walk that back?**



Background on what we **need** to submit with *from a process standpoint*

**Substantially complete application is:**

1. Who am I? (data integration)
2. Enough service info to validate (data integration)
3. Identified benefit sought (implicit in form)
4. Disabilities (interview)
