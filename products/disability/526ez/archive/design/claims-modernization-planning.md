# Disability Claims
We hear a lot about Turbo-Tax. A recurring refrain from Veterans is that applying for disability comp is complicated and high-stakes. We've seen first hand the mechanical difficulties that the eBenefits flow puts in front of people, but ultimately, it’s navigable. The main frustration people have is around understanding what is being asked of them and providing the right amount, not too little or to much, of supporting evidence. Veterans want to understanding what's required, and how to do it.

## Scope
This project will pursue improvements to self-service increase claims for disability compensation.

We will be mindful of opportunities to improve original and supplemental claims but they will not be directly addressed in this effort.

**Goal:** To find an approach to self-service claims for increase on Vets.gov that walks Veterans through an intimidating process with clear and timely advice.

## Proposed schedule
Two phases over approximately four weeks: Information gathering and design push

### Information gathering
1. **Week 1:** Synthesize all the relevant research we have and identify any holes that we can plug, either by piggy-back on VSO research or with an independent effort.
   - **Actions:**
      - Collect and organize existing information about claims for increase
      - Survey existing well-regarded wizard approaches (like Turbo-Tax) to collect patterns and lessons
      - Determine the main questions and concerns that stakeholders have about this effort
      - Weekly whole team check-in
      - eBenefits baseline research readout
   - **Outputs:**
      - Organized assets in project folder
      - Plan for any further information gathering required
2. **Week 2:** Gather info to fill any gaps and begin work on design direction if ready.
   - How can we make sure that this is the right application for a specific Veteran. Are there cases where they might think that a claim for increase is their best path but it isn’t?
   - What kind of rubric for helping Veterans do VSOs use to determine increase claim and evidence advice? What is the magic of the DRC path?
   - Is there anything we are missing about the benefits that VSOs provide when applying for increase?
   - **Actions:**
      - Begin scaffolding well understood sections of prototype
      - Tie in parallel VSO research effort
      - Tie in technical discovery effort
      - Weekly whole team check-in
   - **Outputs:**
      - Coherent plan for specific approach to design direction
      - Summary deck for communicating out to stakeholders and teammates
         - Comp stakeholders
         - DSVA leadership
         - CSRA partners
      - Scaffold non-controvercial parts of prototype (code or clickable comps, TBD)
      - Plan for feedback sessions to come

### Design push
- **Week 3:** Take lessons learned and prototype possible solutions
   - Using the pattern library to test ideas will make it easier to segue from live code scaffold or screenshots to clickable prototypes when testing the concepts.
   - Working within our styles will provide a good check on information density, etc.
   - **Actions:**
      - First pass at solving novel UX problems
      - Plan for feedback sessions
      - Weekly whole team check-in
   - **Outputs:**
      - Prototype we can use to get feedback on direction
      - Heads-up to CSRA about things we will probably need from them

- **Week 4:** Validate prototypes and respond to feedback
   - What do we need CSRA to do to make this work?
   - What kind of PRA type bureaucracy do we need to navigate?
   - **Actions:**
     - Produce a prototype with risks and requests attached
   - **Outputs:**
     - Prototype and supporting docs to enable development to begin
     - Summary deck for communicating out to stakeholders and teammates
       - Comp stakeholders
       - DSVA leadership
       - CSRA partners

## Roles
UX team will drive most of the work in this sprint effort but will welcome input and support from development and product. Especially when doing any additional interview or feedback sessions.

## Risks
1. There may be too much complexity or “it depends” in the VSO advice to translate into a good (simple) experience for applicants.





## Questions garage

We have an idea about most of these, but it's worth verifying that we have the nuance correct. We want to avoid surprises down the road as much as possible.

1. How do Veterans file claims for increases?
   1. Literal methods (paper, online, in-person, etc.)
      1. Are their any hidden details here that may be significant?
   2. Pain points specific to increase claims
      1. Finding applications
      2. Supporting evidence
         1. Scheduling exams
      3. Actual submission
2. How do VSOs help Veterans file claims for increases?
   1. What are the main things Veterans struggle with?
   2. What help can they offer with retrieving records?
   3. How do they offer guidance on supporting evidence?
      1. For example, explaining when a claim might reduce your overall compensation, and other things that are not intuitively obvious
3. What systems can we realistically interact with to support this process?
4. How much can we lean on prior work (especially Pensions) to let us concentrate on the unique stuff?
