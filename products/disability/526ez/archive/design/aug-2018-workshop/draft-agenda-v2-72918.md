# Collaborative Design Sprint: All Claims Disability Selection Tool

## Background

In order to apply for benefits related to a specific disability, Veterans must complete an online form. An important part of that form is asking Veterans to identify their disability from a list of approximately choices. 

Our challenge: **How might we create a user-friendly way for Veterans to identify their disability(ies) during this application process?**

Problem statement: **Veterans need a way to easily select their disability(ies) as part of the claims application for benefits.** 

The purpose of this design workshop is to bring together Veterans, raters, representatives from Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), employees who work on claims through the Veterans Benefit Administration, human-centered designers, and agile sprint teams to ideate solutions to this design problem. 

By the end of this workshop all participants will:
- Identify painpoints, concerns, and experiences with the disability claim form and understand the perspectives of other stakeholders
- Complete a card sort of the disability options, clustering them into groups that make sense for Veterans and raters alike
- Ideate user interface solutions to present disabilities to Veterans

Indicators of success for this meeting include:
- Obtaining answers to questions about disability lists, the best source of truth, and how much info Veterans come to the table with
- Organizing disability lists in a way that makes sense to Veterans
- Generating new ideas with participants
- Coming away with approaches that the team can try building out further 
  - OR: Coming away with the decision that the best thing is an iteration on what exists now. 
  
## Facilitation Agenda

### Setup: 2+ Teams including: 
- A Veteran
- A rater from Appeals
- A Veteran Service Organization Representative (if in attendance)
- A VBA representative 
- At least one member of the agile sprint team working on this product
- (Maybe: A second UX designer)
- A USDS designer serving as table facilitator. 

### Focus Truth Finding, Card Sorting, Ideation

### Goals:
1. Get answers to questions about lists.
2. Organize the 800 cards in a logical way
3. Ideate some solutions

### Table Facilitation
The table facilitator has the following responsibilities: 
- Create momentum: keep the group moving forward 
- Reinforce Norms (no bad ideas! no devices!)
- Ensure all stakeholders have an opportunity to be heard throughout the day (e.g. Everyone has a chance to talk, No one perspective is overshadowing the others)
- Ensure the Veteran perspective is heavily represented in final card sort and solutions 

#### 20 Minutes: **Welcome to the Challenge**

### Norm setting (3 min)
- All ideas are good. We practice, "Yes, and..." 
- NO DEVICES. 
- Design WITH Veterans, not for them. 
- You're going to feel rushed today. It's going to feel like we are not giving you enough time to solve problems. That is intentional. It'll feel uncomfortable. Lean into it. 

#### Group formation + introductory design exercise (15 minutes)
**Materials Needed**: Object, prizes
- Step 1: If group is big enough and we have at least 2 Veterans and 2 raters, have the Veterans, VSO representatives, VBA teams, table facilitators, sprint team, and other designers cluster. Count off and make groups so that there is one representative for each group. (Minimally groups must have a Veteran, a rater, and a table facilitator.) 

- Step 2: 1000 Uses Challenge (4 minutes) - 
**Instructions**: Each group's table facilitator has a simple object (e.g. a paper clip). As a group, you are challenged to come up with 1,000 uses for the object in the next 3 minutes. No repeats! In each group, each participant will take turns in a circle coming up with a new idea. Table facilitator should serve as notetaker to capture how many ideas their group comes up with. When time is up, have each group share how many ideas they generated. The group with the most ideas wins! 

*Table Facilitators: You will start the process. We will have small prizes, s/a candy, for this group.*

#### Blue Card Questions / Expert Interview (45 minutes)
**Materials Needed:** Copies of the different lists, copies of the questions, post-it notes, sharpies, butcher paper 

##### Part 1: Your Concerns (~5 minutes)
**Instructions:** Each of you is here today because you represent an important perspective in the claims process. If you are a Veteran, perhaps you applied for a claim. Perhaps you've helped someone complete a claim. Perhaps you've evaluated a claim or an appeal. Think about your own experience, and note your concerns and painpoints on post-it notes. What is hard about this process? You may also include things you have heard from other Veterans, colleagues, etc. Write one idea per sticky. You have 2 minutes. 

##### Part 2: What Exists Now (~5 minutes)
**Instructions** Today, our mission is to focus on a very specific part of the application: The part where a Veteran must select a disability. Your table facilitator has some printouts to show you what exists now and some iterations on the interface that have been tested. Take a look at these. What concerns do you have? What painpoints do you notice? What makes this hard? Again, write one idea per sticky. You have 5 minutes.  

##### Part 3: Expert Interviews (~20 minutes)
**Instructions:** There are a number of different lists that include some representation of the disabilities that a Veteran may select in their claim OR that a rater may use to process that claim. To start, we need to come to consensus about these lists. We'd like to ask you to conduct expert interviews in your group(s). As we mentioned before, you are all here for a reason; you represent an important part of this process. Your goal is to have a discussion as a group, and come up with your answers to these questions. Identify at least one person in the group to capture your ideas, again 1 idea per sticky. We will report out after this discussion. 

*Table Facilitators: Keep the group on task; make sure they stay on topic and focus on the questions. We will check in after 15 minutes and can allot 5 more minutes as needed. The group(s) will then report out*

1. What is the purpose of having a Veteran select a disability as part of the claim form? Is it about ordering the right exam?
How is this data used?

2. How much detail is needed from the Veteran, so that the person processing this form can make the correct next step (e.g. ordering the right exam)?

3. How much experience and knowledge do Veterans bring to the process when they begin an application? Do they know the name of their conditions? General descriptions? Symptoms? 

4. Do the DBQ categories make sense as an organizing tool for the conditions? Which DBQ categories map to which conditions? Are any shared between conditions? 

5. What are the oddball conditions about (e.g. pensions?) 

##### Part 4: Synthesis and Report Out (~ 15 minutes)
Instructions: Spend some time as a group gathering the post-its into common themes. What common painpoints and concerns do you notice? What is your understanding of the answers to the questions? (5 mins max per team)

Come together and share what you learned! What were the painpoints and concerns? What were the answers to the questions?

#### Card Sorting (1 hour, 45 mins)
** Materials Needed** Cards to sort, lists, challenges, post-its, sharpies

##### Part I: Most Common Conditions (~5 minutes)
**Instructions** What are the most common conditions that you have seen / applied for? What are some of the strangest ones you've seen? Write these on post-its. 

*Table Facilitators: We will use these items to test the categorization later*

##### Part II: Form Categories (~20 minutes)
In front of you, you have ~ 800 cards with the different disabilities written on them from the master list that Veterans must sort from when they apply for a disability. If it seems like a lot, it is! Your task as a group is to organize the cards into categories that make sense to the Veterans at your table. You make create new cards with category names. You may create new cards that combine items. You may adjust the names of conditions as needed to make them clearer. If you need a card to be in two categories, you may make another, or you can mark on the card which categories it belongs in. You do not need to include all of the cards. You may remove duplicates. 

*Table Facilitators: You may find it easiest to break the 800 up into individual clusters to start, but do a consensus check with your group. We will check in once or twice in this process to make sure everyone is moving along. Ask your table to talk through how they are going to approach this problem. What categories are they thinking of? Are they planning to group first, and name later?**

##### Part II: Gallery Walk & Stretch & Bathroom Break (~15 minutes)
On your break, take a moment to stretch, walk to other tables, and look at their groupings. Take a pad and sharpie with you in case you want to make notes! 

##### Part III: Revise and Continue (~20 minutes)
Now that you have seen other groupings, are there changes you want to make? Are there still cards you need to sort? You have ~ 20 minutes to keep working on this and make adjustments. 

##### Part IV: Test Your Assumptions (~20 minutes)
Instructions: Now it's time for you to test your categories. Half of the group should stay, and half of the group should visit another group. Veterans and raters, we'd like to ask you to visit another group. Just as you did, the other group identified some common and more obscure conditions that they have experienced or seen. The table facilitators also have some additional challenges for you to find. The table facilitator will read out the challenge, and you will be asked to find the item in the categories. Give feedback to the group about what you find easy and hard about their categorization. 

*Table Facilitators: Use a mix of what your group came up with and some of the ones below. Make sure one person in the group is assigned to take notes and capture feedback. 
1. Imagine you are a Veteran making a claim for tinnitus, where would you look? 
2. Imagine you are a Veteran looking to make a claim for a shrapnel related injury. 
3. Imagine you are a Veteran looking to make a claim related to Agent Orange exposure. 
4. Imagine you are a Veteran looking to make a claim for PTSD.*

##### Part V: Return to Your Group and Adjust (as much time as needed, approx 15 mins)
Go back to your group and recap: Do you need to make any changes based on the feedback? 

##### Part VI: Group Read Out
Groups will report out what they learned from that exercise: Groups, what was hard about that? What was easy about that? what categories did you come up with? What did you notice that other groups did differently or similarly? What happened in the challenges? 

#### Ideating (~30-45 Mins, depending on how much time is left)
**Materials: Ideation worksheet, post-its, sharpies, stickers, templates**

*Moderator: Introduce each part one at a time. Time each part. If individuals are wrapping up early, move them on to the next phase.*  

**Instructions:** You thought about your concerns and painpoints with the current process. You had a discussion about some key questions and interviewed each other. You've spent some time grouping disabilities into categories and tested your assumptions. You've seen some ways that this information is presented to Veterans that doesn't really work. Now, we'd like you to think through ways that you could present this information to Veterans that would make it easier to understand, but also would make sure that the applications are easier to process. In this stage, you will first work individually, and then as a group. 

##### Part I: Solo Ideation
Instructions: Working alone for 8 minutes, generate as many ideas as you possibly can (target: 8 per person), keeping in mind the items the concerns you identified, the discussion you had about those questions, categories, user tests. You can draw these ideas, you can write words on post-its: do whatever you need to do to get your point across! Think outside the box. Just because you don't think it's feasible, doesn't mean it isn't. Sometimes the craziest ideas contain valuable threads that lead us to our solution. 

##### Part II: Group Discussion
**Instructions:** Time to regroup. Each team member should share their ideas with the rest of the group. This IS an opportunity to for the group to ask clarifying questions and to provide "I like"/"I wish" feedback. This IS NOT an opportunity to pooh-pooh any ideas for feasibility or disagreement. By the end of this section, put all of your ideas together. You can combine similar ideas. You can improve upon ideas. 

##### Part III: Rapid Prototyping
Instructions: As a group select up to 3 different ideas to represent that have the most support from the Veterans and raters in your group. You have post-its, butcher paper, sharpies, and user interface templates. Work together to show how you might present the categorization you came up with. 

##### Part IV: Report Out
Instructions: Share your final ideas with the bigger group. 

#### Wrap-Up and Next Steps 
Thank you all for your energy and your time today. We will take the categorization and ideas that you came up with and will get them in front of even more Veterans and raters for their feedback in the next few weeks. As we work toward a solution, we will continue to share with you for your feedback, and will be user testing it as we go.
