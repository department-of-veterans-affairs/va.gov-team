# Collaborative Design Sprint: All Claims Disability Selection Tool

## Background

In order to apply for benefits related to a specific disability, Veterans must complete an online form. An important part of that form is asking Veterans to identify their disability from a list of about 800 choices. 

Our challenge: **How might we create a user-friendly way for Veterans to identify their disability(ies) during this application process?**

Problem statement: **Veterans need a way to easily select their disability as part of the claims application for benefits.** 

The purpose of this design workshop is to bring together Veterans, representatives from Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), employees who work on claims through the Veterans Benefit Administration, human-centered designers, and agile sprint teams to ideate, rapidly prototype, and test radical solutions to this design problem. 

By the end of this workshop all participants will

- Identify goals, needs, painpoints, and wishlist items for Veterans, VSOs, and VBA teams in the disability selection process for the claims form
- Ideate solutions that meet all users' needs
- Get immediate feedback on those solutions from Veterans, VSOs, and stakeholders and iterate. 
- Generate a rapid prototype of their final design solution, and present it to the group. 

Indicators of success for this meeting include:

- A solid draft IA for the disabilities we will present to Veterans
- Generating new ideas WITH Veterans and getting feedback on the spot
- Coming away with an approach or two that the team can try building out further 
  - OR: Coming away with the decision that the best thing is an iteration on what exists now. 

## Facilitation Agenda

**Setup**: n# Teams including: 

- A Veteran (probably VA employee)
- A Veteran Service Organization Representative
- A VBA representative
- At least one member of the agile sprint team working on this product
- (Maybe: A second UX designer)
- A USDS designer serving as table facilitator. 

**Focus:** Concept Development, Rapid Prototyping, Testing 

**Goal: ** Ideate, test, prototype, and test ways for Veterans to easily select their disability(ies) as part of the claims application process. 

**Table Facilitation:** The table facilitator has the following responsibilities: 

- Create momentum: keep the group moving forward 
- Reinforce Norms (no bad ideas! no devices!)
- Ensure all stakeholders have an opportunity to be heard throughout the day (e.g. Everyone has a chance to talk, No one perspective is overshadowing the others)
- Ensure the Veteran perspective is heavily represented in final solutions

### 4-Hour Approach

#### 30 Minutes: **Welcome to the Challenge**

##### Norm setting (3 min)
- All ideas are good. We practice, "Yes, and..." 
- NO DEVICES. 
- Design WITH Veterans, not for them. 

##### Group formation + introductory design exercise (10-15 min)
- Step 1: Have the Veterans, VSO representatives, VBA teams, table facilitators, sprint team, and other designers cluster. Count off and make groups so that there is one representative for each group. (Minimally groups must have a table facilitator and a Veteran.) 

- Step 2: 1000 Uses Challenge (4 minutes) - Each group's table facilitator will have a simple object (e.g. a paper clip). Each group is challenged to come up with 1,000 uses for the object. No repeats! In each group, each participant will take turns in a circle coming up with a new idea. Table facilitator should serve as notetaker to capture how many ideas their group comes up with. When time is up, have each group share how many ideas they generated. The group with the most ideas wins! (We will have small prizes, s/a candy, for this group.) 

##### Overview of the workshop (3 min)

##### Overview of the problem: Present the current state (5 min)

#### 45 Minutes: **Empathize & Define**

Instructions: Groups will spend 30 minutes (10 min per stakeholder) interviewing group stakeholders to learn the answers to the following questions. Table facilitator will serve as the interviewer. All group members write ideas on post-its (One idea, quotation, etc. per post-it).

> Question: Do we want to give more time to Veterans than to VSOs? 

- **Veteran** (10 minutes)
  - Look at the solutions that exist: What works for you? What makes sense? What is confusing? What is overly complicated? 
  - How might you organize this list of disabilities in a way that makes sense to you? 
  - What do you need this tool to do for it to work for you? 
  - What do you wish this tool could do to make it easier for you? 
  - Are there other phrases or terms you would use that would make more sense to you? 
- **VSO** (10 minutes)
  - Based on your experience supporting Veterans through this process, what are your biggest pain points? 
  - What do you *need* this tool to do to make it work for you?
  - What do *wish* this tool would do to make it work for you? 
- **VBA** (10 minutes)
  - What do you *need* this tool to do for it to work for you? 
  - How could this tool be improved to make your job easier?
  - Are there categorizations or other ways that YOU organize these disabilities when you are processing the applications that we could use on the front end? 
  - What other business requirements/rules do we need to consider as we're generating solutions? 
- **Synthesize** (10 minutes)
  - As a group, talk through the notes you took on your post-its. Organize your post-its into groups, such as pain points, wishes, must-dos, etc. 
  - Your goal is to generate your minimum viable product requirements: 
   - What *must* the tool do to meet Veterans' needs? To meet everyone's needs?
   - What *should* the tool do to make the Veteran experience even better?
   - What *shouldn't* the tool do to avoid painpoints identified during the empathize session?
  - Note: these are not feature requirements (e.g. "The tool must have a dropdown list." Rather "Veterans need a way to sort the list of 800 items by some logical categorization." )

#### 30 Minutes: Ideating

> Moderator: Introduce each part one at a time. Time each part. If individuals are wrapping up early, move them on to the next phase.  

In this stage, you will first work individually, and then as a group. 

##### Part I
Working alone for 5 minutes, generate as many ideas as you possibly can (target: 8 per person), keeping in mind the items you identified as requirements, wish list items, and pain points. You can draw these ideas, you can write words on post-its: do whatever you need to do to get your point across! Think outside the box. Just because you don't think it's feasible, doesn't mean it isn't. Sometimes the craziest ideas contain valuable threads that lead us to our solution. 

##### Part II
Time to regroup. Each team member should share their ideas with the rest of the group. This IS an opportunity to for the group to ask clarifying questions and to provide "I like"/"I wish" feedback. This IS NOT an opportunity to pooh-pooh any ideas for feasibility or disagreement. By the end of this session, put all of your ideas on the wall. You can combine similar ideas. You can improve upon ideas. 

##### Part III
Each person on the team should vote by placing a sticker on the post-its for their favorite solutions (max of 3 votes per person). A favorite solution can also be one that you want to explore more fully as a group.

The team should select the 2-3 ideas with the most votes for the prototyping stage. 

(Table facilitators, make sure that all 3 ideas do not come from one person, and at least 1 of the ideas is a Veteran or VSO generated idea.) 

#### 30 Minutes: Prototyping

For each of these ideas, complete the MVP / Prototype worksheet:

- Reiterate your problem statement from before 
- Reiterate your requirements (minimally, what must the tool do?)
- Determine how each idea addresses that problem statement and meets those requirements 
- Define the simplest thing you can create that will allow you to test your hypothesis for each of your ideas with the others in the room

In this process, you may modify your ideas further, rule out ideas, or draw in components of ideas that may have been discarded. Your goal is to whittle down to 1 core idea to test. 

Using prototyping supplies, sharpies and paper, or other tools you want, create a low-fidelity prototype to represent each idea, so that you can test it with the other users in the room. 

> We need to decide if we're going to let them use tech here. 

#### 45 minutes: User Testing

Each group will have the opportunity to user test their solutions with both of the other groups. 

> Depending on how many groups we have, we'll structure this in different ways:
- 2 groups: Group A tests with Group B's Veteran/VSO/VBA. Swap. 
- 3 groups: Group A's table facilitator tests with Group B's Veteran/VSO/VBA; Group B's table facilitator tests with Group C's Veteran/VSO/VBA; Group C's table facilitator tests with Group A's Veteran/VSO/VBA. Rotate at the end.
- 4 groups: Group A test with Group B; Group C with Group D. 
 
Designer from Group A presents their solution. The Veteran from Group B "tries it" (whatever that looks like for the prototype), and gives feedback. Feedback should minimally cover:

- What do you like about this solution?

- What do you find helpful about this solution?

- What do you find confusing about this solution?

- What would you need to know to use this solution? What additional (content, features, help text, context, etc.) would you need to be able to use this solution? 

- Could you see yourself using this solution? 

- What do you wish this solution would do that it doesn't/doesn't do that it does?

  Other members of Group A should write on post-its the feedback they hear. After the Veteran has had an opportunity to provide feedback, the other members of the group may weigh in with their feedback. 

As time allows, groups should rotate so that they minimally get feedback from as many participants as possible. 

#### 30 Minutes: Idea Refinement

Groups gather back together and spend 30 minutes reviewing the feedback and discussing what adjustments and improvements need to be made to their solution to incorporate the feedback. If adjustments can be made to the prototype, make adjustments, or else write down what changes would need to be made. 

#### 30 Minutes: Presentations

Each group has X minutes to present their final solution. Ideally, the Veteran or VSO should present. Presentations should cover: the MVP worksheet components, their solution, key feedback themes, and how they would recommend addressing those. 




Workshop Notes 7/24 .  

- Can we take the existing plan, scope and modify to target the priorities around IA for contentions; we’ll take a stab at organizing the list of contentions (800) & maintain a workshop to do card-sorting, tree testing, and some usability testing
- Who needs to be there: Andrea, Dawn, Alex, Paul, VSOs (will follow up), Veteran (Ian)
- Should we push the date, no we’d like to keep the date 
- What do we need from Lauren (usability testing recruitment starting in 2 weeks)
- We should modify our PI9 planning outcomes -- initially we thought we might get Disabilities in prod but we can identify a different outcome (swapped priorities, will aim to have Intro in staging and some iteration of Disabilities feature)

* Andrea will check with Paul re: former VSRs who may be available to participate in the workshop as well as the status of the VSOs he reached out to.
* Dawn will ask Alex to check with Ian to see if he's available
* Andrea will ping USDS to see if their are veterans that can participate, Dawn will ask on the Ad Hoc.
* Andrea will follow up with Lauren to share updates.
