have information to decide what action I want to take regarding my disability compensation (file increase/add secondary/file new claim/file appeal/etc).,Tbd,Need to understand what info ppl need access in order to answer the questions that will help us guide them to the right flow,"Claims status (www.vets.gov/track-claims/your-claims) already displays in-progress and closed claims.
For closed claims, the claims detail page shows 1) claim type (e.g., compensation), 2) What you've claimed (e.g., chest pain, abnormal mitral valve), 3) Date received (?), 4) Representative/VSO if any
Note: your rating is not currently exposed in vets.gov claims status (and likely not available from the EVSS claims service), so there is EVSS and vets-api work needed to fetch the ratings (this currently falls into the PICU efforts). We should tee up this work with CSRA as soon as possible (not currently on their roadmap for 2017)

Open question: need comprehensive understanding of EVSS services backing vets.gov claims status (swagger files or other product documentation)

1) Fetch all prefillable data directly from endpoints like PCIU, eMIS, BGS
or
2) Have EVSS build a 526 ""load"" service (probably based on the eBenefits ""load application"" functionality), to pull any information they currently pull to fill a new 526.
If EVSS does a significant amount of orchestration across multiple backend services, we may want to take advantage of it. If they are just passing through data with very little massaging, we may want vets-api to call these backend services directly.",,High,

Each such service takes a significant amount of resources, so we need to enumerate which data should be updatable as soon as possible so if its to make it into either this fall's CSRA roadmap.","Find out if this is a business requirement.

"have the option to upload documents that support my claim for increase, so VA can see them when they assess my claim.",,,"Note that this is different from uploading documents to a ""staging"" or ""in-flight storage"" area, where VA staff are not authorized to view them. This story is about uploading documents to my VBMS eFolder at the same moment that the 526 form is submitted.

Currently, documents may be uploaded from the vets.gov claim detail page of the claims status tool (user chooses the ""Files"" tab, and if the claim is still in the evidence-gathering stage, is given the option of uploading a new file for either 1)  a specific purpose (e.g. proof of radiation exposure, service information from a reserve guard or unit, or  2) a generic ""additional evidence"" category

Open question: team should do a thorough product walkthrough of claims status / document upload and discuss how document upload during a claims increase will play nicely with that product.

See the other story about a temporary staging area for other technical notes. For VBMS efolder upload, the vets-api endpoint exists, so minimal work, except that either vets-website or vets-api will have to trigger taking all of the files in the staging area and uploading them to the VBMS eFolder.",,High,
"specify what the document is that I'm uploading, so VA can find and process it more quickly.",,"Right now that metadata isn't trustworhty so VA doesn't use it that much, could we impact this enough though by providing good metadata that it would become highly useful? It only has the chance to become useful, if we start capturing it day one.","For an example of this, see claims status document upload. In some cases, there is a specific ""file request"" which presumably gets uploaded with specific VBMS eFolder tags. We can likely follow suit here, but need to know the universe of tag names that a user might want to attach to the file.

Product discovery needed around what the possible tags are, which ones would be exposed to an end-user, how to translate between tags and plain-language descriptions of them. ",,Medium,TBD

"have the option to coordinate what date/time might be good for an exam, so it gets scheduled on a day that works for me.",High,Need usability testing to determine whether users find this feature useful.,"CSRA noted this was the least feasible of all parts of automating a DRC claim for increase (so presumably the same applies to a vanilla increase).

We discussed a low-tech solution of simply uploading this information to a file somewhere and trying to effect some process change where the VA staff ordering the exam might use that information.

Unclear how to go about doing additional technical discovery without using too much of CSRA's time","Multiple vendors who might not be amenable to receiving Veteran preference info, since they right now go off of algorithms for blind scheduling.

Also, pensions applications already built much of the front-end questions for this, so low-effor ton front end. , plus FE work is done in pensions.

Another possible solution that doesn't require much engineering: ask additional questions, but ultimately redirect people to eBenefits to finish filling out the form. Not clear this will work with eBenefits given the turbo-tax nature of 526 + ancillary forms. (There may not be a single destination to just do a single ancillary form--need to find this out)

Also, if by ""retrieved"" we mean ""pulled from some system and added to the Veterans' eFodler"" then there is the issue that the claims developer is required to look at *all* of the Veteran's eFolder (undoable as that sounds) when making a decision.
