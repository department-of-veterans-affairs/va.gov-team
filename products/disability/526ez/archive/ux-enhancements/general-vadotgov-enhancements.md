Enhancements based on UX research August - December 2018 

* As a Veteran completing the 526, or any of the ancillary forms on va.gov, I want the language around file upload clarified so that it's clear that the max file size for a *single file* is 25MB. Knowing that the limit relates to a single file will enable me to understand that 25 MB is not the combined limit of all uploaded files. Ultimately, I can upload and unlimited number of files. (Need to balance communicating this fact with not accidently encourage people to test this fact and bringing down the system.)

* As a Veteran completing the 526, or any of the ancillary forms on va.gov, I want to be able to upload multiple documents simultaneously so that I do not need to load files one at a time, over and over. 

* As a Veteran completing any of the ancillary forms on va.gov, I want to see a more granular indication of progress via the progress bar, so that I understand my progress on both the 526 form and my progress on the current ancillary form.

* LONG TERM: As a Veteran completing the 526, or any of the ancillary forms on va.gov, I want the documents I upload to be tagged as supporting a particular event or claim so that claims processing is simplified.
