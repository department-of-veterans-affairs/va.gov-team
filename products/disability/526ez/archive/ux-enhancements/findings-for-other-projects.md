**Findings for other projects**

* When the paper-based VA Form 21-4192 is updated in 2020:
  * Redesign the layout to more clearly indicate which sections are for the Veteran to complete and which are for employers or unit command
  * Consider adding the default VA Claims Intake Center address to the form, either on the form itself or at the time of download.
  * Increase the size of the address blocks on the form
  * Make the line between the distinction 


* When the paper-based VA Form 21-8940 is updated in 2020:
  * Consider removing “Highest Gross Income” from VA Form 21-8940, as it seems to appear out of the blue and VSOs are not certain that it is used during the determination process.
