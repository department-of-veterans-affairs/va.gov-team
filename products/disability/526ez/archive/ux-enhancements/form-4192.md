## VA Form 21-4192 ##

* As a Veteran reviewing the last step of form 4192 instructions on va.gov, I want to see collapsible helper text "What more can I do?"  so that my chances of having my 4192 employment verification forms returned increases.  Suggestions for that content may include providing my past employers with a self-addressed stamped envelope and speaking points on how to prep my employer.

* As a Veteran submitting a claim for Individual Unemployability on va.gov, I want to know whether or not I'll receive a letter if the VA feels a 4192 is missing so I'll know whether or not I need to follow up with past employers.

* LONG-TERM: As a Veteran submitting a claim for Individual Unemployability on the va.gov platform, I want to be able to view returned 4192s in my eFolder so that I know if I need to follow up with any past employers.  This is contingent upon the eFolder being exposed to Veterans.
