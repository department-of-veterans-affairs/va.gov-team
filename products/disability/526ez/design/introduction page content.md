Follow the steps below to file a claim for a new or secondary condition or for increased disability compensation.

1. Determine if this form is for you 

This form is for you if you’ve served, you have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your mind or body, and:
- You got sick or injured while serving (this is called a service-connected disability), or
- You had an illness or injury before you served and serving made it worse, or
- A service-connected illness or injury you already have has caused a new injury or illness
This form is for filing a new claim or a claim for increased disability compensation for a claim decided more than one year ago. Get more information about eligibility for disability compensation.

If you are filing a new claim after an initial claim for the same or similar benefit was previously decided AND you have new and relevant evidence, you can file a supplemental claim. 

If you disagree with a VA decision, you can request a decision review. Learn more about those options.

In addition to this form, there are other forms you may wish or need to complete related to disability benefits. If you apply here online, you will have the option to include in your application the necessary forms for if you are:
- Claiming Individual Unemployability 
- Claiming posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including based on a personal assault
- Authorizing the release of your medical records to VA

You may consider submitting other forms if you wish to claim:
- Specially Adapted Housing or a Special Home Adaptation
- Auto allowance
- Auto adaptive-equipment grant
- Aid and Attendance because you’re in a nursing home
- Additional benefits because you or your spouse needs Aid and Attendance
- Dependents
Learn more about these forms and how to complete them.

   Are you a current service member?

   Service members who have an illness or injury that was caused or made worse by their active duty service, can use this form to file for disability benefits 90 to 180 days before they leave the military through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. 

   Note: You’ll need to submit service treatment records for the current period of service as well as a Separation Health Assessment – Part A Self-Assessment as part of your claim so we can request your VA exam. (We estimate that it will take you at least 30 minutes to complete this form, and we recommend you download and fill out this form on a desktop computer or laptop then return to this form to upload.)

   After you file your claim, you’ll need to be available to complete an exam for 45 days after your claim is submitted. Learn more about Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD).



2. Decide how you want to apply 

This digital form was designed to help you complete the form efficiently. You will be able to answer the questions relevant to you, upload digital documents, save your progress, and track the status of your claim after submission. The time it takes to complete this will depend on the number of conditions you are claiming and the number of documents that you upload. You can save and come back to the application at any time.

   [Featured content component or background color only alert with icon component] 

   If you are granted benefits, your benefits will be effective as of either the date we received your claim or the date that documentation shows a change in your condition that supports the level of compensation.

   If your condition was present when you separated from the military, and we receive your claim before or within one year of that separation, the effective date will be from the day following the date of your separation.

   When you start your application here and now, you’ll declare your intent to file. This will reserve a potential effective date for when you could start getting benefits. You have 1 year from the day you submit your intent to file to complete your application.



3. Decide what you’ll claim and gather information

Your disability compensation will be determined based on the nature and symptoms of the condition, severity and duration of the symptoms, and the impact of the condition and symptoms on your employment. 

Each service-connected condition will be assigned a rating from 0% to 100% based on documentation. If you have already been granted benefits, and are filing a claim because your condition has worsened (this is called a claim for increase), you might want to check to see if you’re already receiving the maximum disability rating for your condition. You can do this by viewing your claim letters.

While processing your claim we will review relevant medical records that you identify and authorize us to (you can give us this permission when you file here). These may include records from Federal facilities such as VA medical centers, State or local government facilities, and/or private doctors or hospitals. In some cases if we need additional documentation we may also ask you to have an exam to help us rate your disability.

We strongly encourage you to submit documentation as soon as you can to help us understand how your injury or illness is connected to your service, and how the condition impacts you and your ability to work. If we previously granted you benefits, and your condition has worsened, we need documentation that shows that increase in severity and the effect that worsening has had on you and your ability to work.

   PACT Act and presumptive conditions

   To get a disability rating, we need to see that your condition connects to your military service. For many conditions we need documentation to see this, but for some conditions we can automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. If you have what we call a presumptive condition, we don’t need documents showing service caused the condition. 
    
   The PACT Act is a new law that expands benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances by adding to the list of presumptive conditions. If this applies to you, we encourage you to file for benefits now. If you do so before August 10, 2023, and we grant your application, we’ll likely backdate your benefits to the date of the bill signing. This means we’ll pay you the amount you would have received from August 10, 2022 to the date we grant your application.
    
   To support a claim for presumptive service connection, you only need to submit documentation showing you served in a location and/or you have a current condition that qualifies you for the presumption. Learn more about the PACT Act and what is now presumptive
   
   

To support your claim, you can upload documentation such as:
- VA medical records and hospital records that relate to your claimed condition or that show your disability has gotten worse
- Private medical records and hospital reports that relate to your claimed condition or that show your disability has gotten worse
- Supporting statements from family, friends, employers, coworkers, clergy, or law enforcement personnel with knowledge about how and when your conditions occurred or got worse and how it affects you and your ability to work
If your claim involves a condition that was made worse by service, please provide any information or documentation regarding the condition before your entry into service. 



4. Complete application

To start your application here, you’ll need to set up an account and profile. You’ll need to provide an email address, set up an authentication method, and verify your identity.

Once you start your application, you’ll declare your intent to file. This will reserve a potential effective date for when you could start getting benefits. You have 1 year from the day you submit your intent to file to complete your application.

The time it takes to complete this will depend on the number of conditions you are claiming and the number of documents that you upload. You can save and come back to the application at any time.

After you submit your claim here you will see a confirmation page. You will not get another notification (by email or mail, for example).

In some cases, you may need to turn in one or more additional forms to support your claim. If additional information is needed, you will receive a letter from us. 

If you want to submit additional documentation after you submit your claim, you have up to one year to do so. However, we may decide your claim before the end of that one year period, in which case we may request you submit a new application.
