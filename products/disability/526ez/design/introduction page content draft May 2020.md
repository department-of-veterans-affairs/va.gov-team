## Intro content

File for disability compensation with VA Form 21-526EZ 

Equal to VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits).

Use this form to file a new claim or a claim for increased disability compensation.


> **Toxic exposure and PACT Act**
> 
> The PACT Act is a new law that expands benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances by adding to the list of conditions we can automatically assume (or “presume”) was caused by your service. **If this applies to you, we encourage you to file for benefits now.** If you do so before August 10, 2023, and we grant your application, we’ll likely backdate your benefits to the date of the bill signing. This means we’ll pay you the amount you would have received from August 10, 2022 to the date we grant your application. If you filed a claim in the past for a condition that is now presumptive, and were denied, then file a Supplemental Claim.

Follow these steps to get started.

1. Determine if this form is for you 

Use this form if you’re filing a new claim or a claim for increased disability compensation.

Make sure you meet our eligibility requirements before you apply. You may be eligible for VA disability benefits or compensation if you meet these requirements.

**Both of these must be true:**
- You have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your mind or body, **and**
- You served on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training

**And at least one of these must be true:**
- You got sick or injured while serving in the military, **or**
- You had an illness or injury before you joined the military—and serving made it worse, **or**
- You have a disability related to your active-duty service that didn’t appear until after you ended your service, **or**
- A service-connected illness or injury you already had caused a new injury or illness

[Learn more about eligibility for VA disability benefits](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/)

You’ll need to [file a Supplemental Claim](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/supplemental-claim/) **instead** of this form if either of these is true:
- We decided your claim in the past and you have documentation you didn’t submit to us in the past (or identify for us to gather) that proves or disproves something in your claim
- You’re requesting a review of your claim based on a change in law (such as the PACT Act)

>Have you been granted benefits already? 
>If you have already been granted benefits, and are filing a claim because your condition has worsened (this is called a claim for increase), you might want to first check to see if you’re already receiving the maximum disability rating for your condition. You can do this by signing in and [viewing your claim letters](https://staging.va.gov/track-claims/your-claim-letters).

2. Decide how you want to apply 

We’ll take you through each step of the process online. You will be able to answer the questions relevant to you, upload digital documents, and save your work in progress. The time it takes you to complete your application depends on how many conditions you’re claiming and how many documents you need to upload.

You may choose to [contact an accredited veterans service officer (VSO)](https://www.va.gov/ogc/recognizedvsos.asp) to assist you with your application. If you need further assistance with the application process, you may also [contact your state office of veterans affairs](https://www.va.gov/statedva.htm).

3. Gather information

We'll determine your disability compensation based on:
- the nature and symptoms of the condition(s) you claim, 
- severity and duration of the symptoms, **and**
- the impact of the condition and symptoms on your employment

We'll review relevant medical records from VA medical centers and from private doctors or hospitals that you identify and authorize us to. We might also ask you to complete an exam.

We strongly encourage you to submit documentation to help us understand 
- how your injury or illness is connected to your service, **and** 
- how the condition impacts you and your ability to work. 

If we previously granted you benefits and your condition has worsened, we need documentation that shows
- the increase in severity **and** 
- the effect that has had on you and your ability to work.

To support your claim, you can upload documentation such as:
- **VA medical records and hospital records.** These could relate to your claimed illnesses or injuries or they could show that your rated disability has gotten worse.
- **Private medical records and hospital reports.** These could relate to your claimed illnesses or injuries or they could show that your disability has gotten worse.
- **Supporting statements.** These could be from family members, friends, clergy members, law enforcement personnel, or people you served with. These statements could tell us more about your claimed condition and how and when it happened or how it got worse.

> **Are you currently on active duty as a service member?**
> 
> If you’re a service member on active duty, you can use this form to file a claim for disability benefits through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program if both of these are true:
> - You have an illness or injury that was caused or made worse by your active-duty service, **and** 
> - Your separation date is in the next 90 to 180 days
> You can use this form to file a claim for disability benefits through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program.
> 
> **Note:** You’ll need to submit service treatment records for the current period of service as well as a [Separation Health Assessment – Part A Self-Assessment](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_publicdbqs.asp) as part of your claim so we can request your VA exam. Your claim will be delayed until we receive this self-assessment form. We estimate that it will take you at least 30 minutes to complete it. We recommend you download and fill it out on a computer or laptop then return to this 526 form to upload.
> 
> After you file your claim, you’ll need to be available for 45 days after your claim is submitted to complete an exam. [Learn more about Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file/pre-discharge-claim/).

If you apply here online, we'll also include in your application the additional forms we'll need if:
- You're claiming posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
- You're authorizing us to request private medical records
- You can't work because of a disability related to your service (this is called Individual Unemployability)
