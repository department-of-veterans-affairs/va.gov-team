## Supporting evidence

On the next few screens, we’ll ask you about supporting documents like medical records related to your disabilities or conditions.

**We strongly encourage you to submit documentation with your claim to help us understand:**
- how your condition is related to your service (unless we already consider your condition to be connected to burn pits or other toxic exposure)
- the nature and symptoms of the condition, including severity and duration of the symptoms
- how the condition impacts you and your ability to work.

If we previously granted you benefits and your disability has worsened, we need documentation that shows the increase in severity and the effect that has had on you and your ability to work.

**You only need to submit new documentation that VA doesn’t already have.** 

We’ll already have documents from all claims you’ve filed in the past, for example service treatment records and DD214. If your service is or was in National Guard or Reserves, we may not have your service treatment records.

We'll always review relevant medical records from VA medical centers. You can provide information about where you’ve been treated to help us locate these records and make decisions on your claim.

We’ll also review records from other non-VA doctors or hospitals that you identify and authorize us to. We can try to obtain these records for you, or you can obtain and upload these records yourself.

You can also upload supporting statements from family or friends that could tell us more about how your disability impacts your day-to-day life and your ability to work.

**Note:** We may ask you to complete an exam if you don’t submit evidence or if we need more information to decide your claim.
