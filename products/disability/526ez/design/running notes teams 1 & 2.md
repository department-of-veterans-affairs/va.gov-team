# Running Notes for Design & Research Teams 1 & 2 (T-Rex and Carbs)
## 6/8/23
Attendees: Lydia, Nyantee, Nichole, Julie

- Julie will create page in the design folder for notes

- All changes throughout the form will impact exit rates
  - What do we want to do when overlap happens?
  - Are there other parameters beyond exit rates that could inform our roadmap?
  - We don’t know yet! We’ll start with updating the site map as we’re resolving analytics questions and clarifying metrics

- Form Flow / Sitemap Mural versioning
  - Will check Mural permissions and consider downloading PDFs for versioning
  - IA team created the sitemap, Team 1 hasn’t had changes to make to the sitemap yet
  - For design work, Lydia shares Sketch files with Collab Cycle or front end engineers
      - All sketch files are open and available once we get access
      - Some teams might only share what’s part of the collab cycle
      - There is no single Sketch file with all parts of the flow
- Black stickies are changes underway AND on the roadmap
- How do we know when things go live?
    - Depends on if they’re going through Collab Cycle
    - How long do changes usually take? It’s complicated! There is no “normal” way
    - Pinned Collab Cycle criteria to the design channel, might change if the roadmap changes
    - Might be helpful for us to shadow the Collab Cycle with Lydia
    - First steps we’ve seen: create designs, get feedback from OCTO at sprint review…


- Who made this 526 design review Mural and what’s its status? https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1676487520026/4af83a6b8196cf61ff93abc7cf17b8260fa80240?sender=udbd39c1bbebb4ec4d7d08829 
  - This was created while working on Team 1 roadmap, Lydia still references it, but might just be noise for Team 2
  - Pink stickies in the sitemap haven’t been updated, could walk through this together (these might be design comments from the IA team)

- Analytics questions
    - “Optional” steps
      - Team 1 inherited it, they don’t know why
      - There’s an open ticket requesting an update to the funnel
