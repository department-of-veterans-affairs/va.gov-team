### Page by page questions

I'm thinking we could do a talk aloud session with the expert. As we go along we can remind them to answer the following questions on each page if relevant:

-   What advice would you give to a Veteran for this question?

-   Would this be clear or confusing to a Veteran?

-   Is this question a potential trigger? How might you reword it?

-   What forms of evidence are most helpful? What is unnecessary?
