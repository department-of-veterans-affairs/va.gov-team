## Intro - 5 minutes
Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. My name is [NAME] and I work on VA.gov. I am part of a team that is trying to improve it so Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible.

What I hope to do today is get your feedback on the materials presented to you after you fill out the online VA form (21-686c) to add dependents to your VA benefits.

**Have you filled out this form before?**

Ok, great. I want you to know that today, I don’t want to add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits. As a heads up, we may take a look at claims experiences that may have caused frustration for you in the past, and I want you to know upfront that I don't have any contact with claims reviewers and I don't have any access to your records. However, I do want to gather your feedback in case there are things we can improve in the future.

**Do you have any questions so far?**

_Now we'll talk a little about your participation:_
* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you over that time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
* [To the notetaker and observers] I'd like us to do a round of intros for [Participant] first. Let's start with [notetaker]
    * [Ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov]
* [To the participant] Would you mind telling us a bit about yourself?

`Tip: If it hasn't been done, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.`

_Now, I’ll talk a little bit about what you’ll be testing: We are working to improve the online VA form (21-686c) that allows Veterans to add and change dependents to their VA benefits, specifically the final "Confirmation" page. We are looking to incorporate your feedback on our work in progress. To do so, we will be asking you to interact with a demo version of this page, and solicit your reactions and opinions as you accomplish various tasks from the page._

Just a heads up that you will be seeing some prefilled data as you interact with our demo. None of the data you see is real Veteran data. Also, none of your actions during the demo will affect your VA information or benefits. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

Before we start, I was wondering if I could have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

* **Knowing that, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  [Record answer here]

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that I have your permission to record this session once more.

➡️ **Start recording.**

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today?
  [Record answer here]



## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a couple of background questions.

* What type of device are you using to access our research session today?
* What types of VA benefits have you applied for before?
* When you applied for VA benefits, did you keep a copy of the information you submitted in your application(s)?
    - [IF YES] What was your reason behind this decision?
        - How did you go about saving a copy of your information?
        - Where did you save a copy to?
    - [IF NO] Was there a time later when you wished you had saved a copy?

Thank you for sharing your experience.

## Setting up screenshare
We are now going to transition into testing a demo version of the "Add or remove a dependent on VA benefits" online form, specifically the materials presented to you immediately after you submit.

I’m going to send you a link in the chat.

**Prototypes**
- [Desktop](https://www.figma.com/proto/EoYnokGp9aSgy5JrDVqp5L/686c---Form-data-viewer---Fully-Digital-Forms?node-id=3770-29642&t=wjPq2fgrbIiKrNQS-1)
- [Mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/EoYnokGp9aSgy5JrDVqp5L/686c---Form-data-viewer---Fully-Digital-Forms?node-id=3770-29959&t=wjPq2fgrbIiKrNQS-1)

Feel free to take a minute to hide anything, like your personal email or anything you don’t want us to see. Let me know if you need help. I am more than happy to walk you through the steps you can take to share your screen:

* For “mobile“ participants:  
  * Do you have an iPhone or an Android phone?  
    * iPhone:  
      * [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)  
    * Android:  
      * [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)  
  * If they are a “mobile” participant but joined on their desktop (and if asking them to rejoin on their phone is too time-consuming):  
    * Please feel free to access the link on your computer.  
* For “desktop” participants:  
  * On the bottom of your Zoom screen, there should be a “Share” button in the middle (it should be in green). Please click on that.  
  * Please make sure “Desktop” is selected/highlighted.  
  * Please click “Share” again at the bottom.  
* For “tablet” participants:  
  * Instructions should be similar to “mobile”  
  * If you are on an iPad or Tablet, the button is hidden in the bottom of your screen. Tap anywhere on your screen, a “tool bar” will show up at the bottom of the screen, and the share button should be within the tool bar (you may need to drag the tool bar to the left to see it). should show up until you hover over them\!

Once you open the link, please share your screen. Please do not click on anything at the moment!
Awesome! Now that I can see your screen.

## Setting up context
```
The participant will encounter the prototypes in the following order:
- Scenario 1: BID Maximal 
- Scenario 2: VADS Minimal
- Scenario 3: VADS Minimal + "a la carte" features
```
For the remainder of the session, I'd like you to imagine that you are a Veteran named Jamie Smith Brooks. (Just to clarify, Jamie isn't a real person, we are using a demo account.) Earlier this week, you spent time on VA.gov filling out the VA form 21-686c to add dependents to your VA benefits. However, you got interrupted so you were logged out right before hitting the submit button. Now you are interested in actually submitting your form.

* **Please click on Scenario 1**

Imagine that you just signed back into VA.gov and have navigated to the manage dependents page where you have filled out the online form to add or remove dependents. 

* **Go ahead and click "Continue your application"**

Since you have filled out all of the questions on the form before you got interrupted (including information about you, your spouse, past spouses, your children, and supporting documentation as evidence), you are automatically taken to this Review Application page. This is the page you get to before submitting the form.

_This page is typically your last chance to review and edit the answers you provided to the form's questions. After submitting the form, you would not be able to edit._

Let's imagine that you have interacted with all of the accordions on this page (i.e., the gray boxes, with the plus sign on the side) and you were able to double-check all of your answers for the different sections in the form:

* **Go ahead and press "Continue"**

You have just submitted the online form, which then brings you to the confirmation page.

## Entry points, workflow (comparing current to ideal future)
We'll be mostly focusing on the content that follows. Before we proceed, do you have any questions?

[Answer any questions to help clarify the context and set the scene.]

Before we dive into this page, I have a few questions for you:

* In this scenario, what type of device would you be using?
    * [Probe mobile, desktop, laptop, tablet]
    * In what orientation? (landscape vs. vertical)

Thanks for that! Go ahead and do a quick scan of the page, but please do not click on anything - 

* If you were in Jamie's situation, someone who just submitted their application to add dependents to their VA benefits, what would you do first on this page? 
* Without doing so yet, what do you think will happen if you click the link that says "Information you submitted on this form"?
    * What will you see?
    * [Gauge if they predict new tab or new page/ window or navigate page behavior]
* If you were to actually be in this scenario, would you click the link? Why (not)?

Let's go ahead and click the link. Please skim through the sections, questions, and answers until you get to the bottom of the page. We don't expect you to read everything, but we want you to get a feel for the type of the information and how it's being displayed. Please think aloud as you review the page.

* What are your first impressions? [5 mins max]
    * Does this meet your expectations of what would be shown?
* How do you normally navigate through a page like this? 
    * [Probe] Scrolling, keyboard tabbing, etc.?
* As someone who just submitted an application to add dependents to their VA benefits, what would you be looking for on this page?
* What would you do next, after you review this page?
* After leaving this page, are there scenarios in which you would want to retrieve what you see here?
    * When and how would you use this information?
    * How do you expect to retrieve this information?
        * [Probe for MyVA, email, etc.]

## Scenario 1 (BID Maximal): Form viewer content and layout
Now, we'd like your feedback on how the information is displayed on this page. 
* Is the general layout understandable?
    * [Probe] What do you think about the:
        * sections and subsections
        * headings
        * two column layout
* Is there information that's missing that you'd like to see?
    * Is there information that should be emphasized?
    * Is there too much information? What would you like to remove or de-emphasize?

### TASK: Could you show us how many children are being added as dependents? And what are their names?  [5 min]
[Answer: 2, Andrew and Anna]
* Can you easily distinguish repeating sections (such as multiple children)? How?
    * Is there anything you'd change to improve it?
* On a scale from 1-5, 1 being not legible and 5 being very legible... How legible is this page?
    * Why?
    * [If low score] What would make it more legible?

### TASK: Can you find the filenames of the supporting documents that were uploaded with the claim? [2 min]
[Answer: "other_evidence", "disability_evidence", "adoption_papers"]

* Please explain how you found the filenames? 
    * What was your thought process?
    * How easy was that on a scale from 1-5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy. Why?

### Numbering
* How do you feel about the section numbering?
    * Is there anything you'd change to improve it?
    * Is it useful for you? How would you use it?
* How do you feel about the question numbering?
    * Is there anything you'd change to improve it?
    * Is it useful for you? How would you use it?

### Typography and hierarchy of information [2 min]
* Can you easily distinguish one section from another? How?
    * [Probe about visual elements like divider, typography, spacing]

### Optional/skipped questions [7 min]
Thank you for answering our questions so far. I'd like us to look at a specific section on this page. Could you scroll to **Section 4: Remove a divorced spouse?** 

* What do you think is going on here?

Thanks for that answer!  This section is optional and not required to be filled out so our demo person, Jamie didn't fill it out in their application.

* As someone who has just submitted their application, and is reviewing this page, how do you feel about having your skipped questions displayed like this? 
* How about for sections or questions you did not encounter when you were filling out the form? 
    * How do you feel about seeing these sections displayed like this on this page if you never encountered them in the form while you were filling it out?

## Scenario 2 (VADS Minimal): Form viewer content and layout
[Instruct participant to click on the VA.gov page header, which will bring them to the variations screen]

Now we're going to show you a variation of what you've seen so far. Please click on Scenario 2. Please go ahead and take a moment to review the page. 

* What are your initial impressions?

### TASK: Can you show us what the birthplaces are for the 2 children that are being added to Jamie's VA benefits?  [5 min]
[Answer: San Mateo CA and San Francisco CA]

* Can you easily distinguish repeating sections (such as multiple children)? How?
    * Is there anything you'd change to improve it?
* On a scale from 1-5, 1 being not legible and 5 being very legible... How legible is this page?
    * Why?
    * [If low score] What would make it more legible?

### TASK: Where does it show that Jamie has certified the accuracy of their information on the form they just submitted?
* How easy was that on a scale from 1-5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy. Why?

### Exploring the differences between Scenario 1 and Scenario 2

* Now that you had a chance to interact with this version of the page, what are the major differences between what you see here and the demo page you looked at earlier?
    * Which text styling do you prefer? Why?
        * Does this styling make it easier to differentiate sections?

[If participant doesn't articulate any differences:]
* How do you feel about the lack of section numbering?
    * Is there anything you'd change to improve it?
    * Is it useful for you? How would you use it?
* How do you feel about the question numbering?
    * Is there anything you'd change to improve it?
    * Is it useful for you? How would you use it?
* Can you easily distinguish one section from another? How?
    * [Probe about visual elements like divider, typography, spacing]
* How do you feel about the sections not being numbered? Why?

## Scenario 1 vs. Scenario 2 comparison conclusion
* Out of the two concept variations we showed you so far, which do you prefer? Why?
* What factor is most important to help you accomplish your intended purpose for page like this? [Reference previously-mentioned goals]

## Scenario 3 (VADS Minimal + a la carte): Gathering feedback on interactive features of form viewer
Now I'd like us to shift gears again, and I'd like your opinion on an interactive version of what you've seen so far with us today. Please click on Scenario 3. 

The form output content remains the same as what we've just reviewed, but now there are a bit more features that are on the page. Let's go through each of the additional features one-by-one:

### Print button
* What do you think happens when you click the button?
* Is this useful to you? 
    * How would you use it? 
    * How often and in what scenarios?
    * [Probe] If there was no print button, would you save or print this document using other means?

### Summary box

If you may go to the top of the page please. Now I want you to look at the blue box that says "Application details".

* Is having the "Application details" box useful for you? Why?
    * What would you use it for?
* Is the information within this box useful to you?
    * [Probe about supporting docs] The documents that the Veteran uploaded at the time of submission are also included in the later sections at the bottom of the page. Acknowledging that, would it be helpful to include a list of supporting documents in this "Application details" box? Why (not)?
    * [Probe about submission date and whether position inside or outside or none at all is useful to them]
    * What would you add or remove from this box so that it's useful to you?
    * What information would you like to see?
    * Is the language used here appropriate?
        * [Probe confirmation, claim, file number]
* What do you think about the position of this box being at the top of the page?

### VADS "On this page" and "back to top" component

If you may scroll to the top of the page please. Now I want you to look at the blue text below "On this page".

* What would you expect happens when you click on one of these links?

**TASK: Please navigate to the information that states Anna Celeste Brooks' date of birth.**  
[Answer: 7/29/2015]

* [If they used the link] How was the experience using the link?
    * [Probe on speed, ease of use, acts as expected]
* [If they didn't use the link]
    * Why didn't you use the link under "On this page"?
    * Have them do the task again but using the link. Ask questions above.
* Is this useful to you? 
    * How would you use it? 
    * How often and in what scenarios?

[Ask the following from the middle of the page so that the "back to top" button is present.]
Now, if you look at the bottom right hand corner of the page, you'll see "back to top".

* What do you think this does?

**TASK: Go ahead and click on "back to top".**

* How was the experience using the button?
    * [Probe on speed, ease of use, acts as expected]
* Is this useful to you? 
    * How would you use it? 
    * How often and in what scenarios?
* What are your thoughts on the placement of the section links at the top of the page?
    * Do you have the need to quickly jump from one section to another? How would you do that?
        * [Compare current methods vs with the presented navigation feature.]

### Search

* Is there a scenario when you would search for specific information on this page?
    * What are you searching for? Why?
    * How often?
    * How would you go about doing that?
    * [Probe] Would you rather have a search bar on the page or use the keyboard to ctrl + F? Why?

## Comparison to current
* How do these concepts compare to how you would normally access a copy of your answers to a form you have submitted?
    * Are there any features or qualities that are missing?
* Is there anything you'd wish to have?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Thank you! These are all the questions that we have for you today.

**Before we end, I'd like to ask if we can have your permission to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

* **Knowing this, do I have your permission if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
[Record answer here]

Great! Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Just a heads up, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!




# Emergency Exit 🚨
* Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
* Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the demo we wanted to test with you today is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
