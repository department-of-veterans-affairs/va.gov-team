# Intro - 5 minutes
Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. My name is [NAME] and I work on VA.gov. I am part of a team that is trying to improve it so Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible.
I'm going to start by sharing what we hope to do today and providing an overview of how you'll participate. Then we'll do some introductions and then get started with taking a look at the form that we'd like to get your feedback on. **Does that sound good?**

What I hope to do today is get your feedback on the materials presented to you immediately after you submit the "Add or remove a dependent on VA benefits" online form (VA Form 21-686C) so we can make the process better.

**Have you filled out this form before?**

Ok, great. I want you to know that today, I don’t want to add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits. As a heads up, we may take a look at claims experiences that may have caused frustration for you in the past, and I want you to know upfront that I don't have any contact with claims reviewers and I don't have any access to your records. However, I do want to gather your feedback in case there are things we can improve in the future.

**Do you have any questions so far?**
_Now we'll talk a little about your participation:_
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you over that time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- [To the notetaker and observers] I'd like us to do a round of intros for [Participant] first. Let's start with [notetaker]
    - [Ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov]
- [To the participant] Would you mind telling us a bit about yourself?

`Tip: If it hasn't been done, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.`

_Now, I’ll talk a little bit about what you’ll be testing: We are working to improve the "Add or remove a dependent on VA benefits" online form,  specifically the final "Confirmation" page. We are looking to incorporate your feedback on our work in progress. To do so, we will be asking you to interact with a demo version of this page, and solicit your reactions and opinions as you accomplish various tasks from the page._

Just a heads up that you will be seeing some prefilled data as you interact with our demo. None of the data you see is real Veteran data. Also, none of your actions during the demo will affect your VA information or benefits. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

Before we start, I was wondering if I could have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

- **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  [Record answer here]

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

➡️ **Start recording.**

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today?

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a couple of background questions.

- What type of device are you using to access our research session today?
- What types of VA benefits have you applied for before?
- When you applied for VA benefits, did you keep a copy of the information you submitted in your application(s)?
    - [IF YES] What was your reason behind this decision?
        - How did you go about saving a copy of your information?
        - Where did you save a copy to?
    - [IF NO] Was there a time later when you wished you had saved a copy?

Thank you for sharing your experience.

   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
