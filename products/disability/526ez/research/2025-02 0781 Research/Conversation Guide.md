# **Conversation Guide Benefits and Claims Disability Experience Team, New VA Form 0781 Usability Testing, February 2025**

## **Moderator logistics**

### 2-3 days before the session

* Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions)

* Review [VA Trauma Practice Guidelines (0781 team copy)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tvDgQT5M3N7Yyamf9ZKL8GYoIH22Y9hpXjnYbHyyU7g/edit)

* Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)

* Assign and confirm notetaker(s)

* This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review [guidance on taking notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/notetaker-guidelines). If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. [Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-prepare-for-perigean-to-take-notes).

  * Invite observers

  * Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. [Limit your observers](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#creating-a-safe-space-for-participants) to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed.

* Prepare as moderator

* Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review [tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recording-User-Research-Sessions.2050949305.html), and guidance on [participant and researcher safety and exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html).

* Confirm Zoom is recording to the cloud with transcripts on.

* Assign a timekeeper	


### Day of the session

* Use [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

* Mute your Slack notifications.

* Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

  Starting the session

* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked

* Check your \[screen sharing setup\] and share permissions for participants.

* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro\*

## **Introduction (10-15 min)**

* **Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today.** My name is \[NAME\], and \[NOTETAKER NAME\] will be here to assist by taking notes. We’re here to listen and learn from your experiences. Would you like to briefly introduce yourself?

* **Today, we’ll discuss a new section of the disability claim form on VA.gov** designed to support Veterans in claiming PTSD and related mental health conditions resulting from traumatic experiences during their time in the military, including sexual assault or harassment. This entire session should take about 90 minutes. We may not use the entire time. We’ll also have a scheduled break part way through the session.

* **We want to ensure this process is as supportive and user-friendly as possible.** We’ll be showing you some in-progress designs for this form, which we like to call a prototype. Our questions will focus on your experience filling out this VA form, which could involve sharing some limited details about your own mental health or traumatic experiences. 

  * The details you share about your personal experiences with your filing experience or the claim submission itself are up to you. If you wish to keep your feedback focused on the online form itself, you’re also welcome to do that, too.

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You have control over the pace and any content we discuss. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits with the VA. You will be paid for the whole session, even if we end early. 

* **Your honest feedback will help us improve this tool.** We truly value your opinions. There are no right or wrong answers here—this is about understanding your experience and how we can make this process better for everyone.

* **If at any point you need a break**, want to skip a question, stop, or reschedule the session, please let us know. Your well-being is our priority. We can also check in to see how we feel as we go.

  \[Pause\]

* **Do you have any more questions for me before I continue?** 

* **Are you comfortable participating in today’s session?** 

  * \[If yes\] Sounds good. We’ll check in throughout the session in case you change your mind. Your perspective is helpful regardless of how much of the session we complete. 

  * \[If no\] Sounds good, thanks for your time today. If you decide you’d like to reschedule the session please reach out to Perigean.

**A couple final logistics…** 

* **I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview** — we have a couple folks who’d like to join, they include researchers and designers. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

  * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  * If yes: Admit observers.

Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

\[Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth\]

* We want to make sure you're comfortable with how we document today’s session. We have two options:

  * **We can record the audio and video.** This would help us double-check that we’ve captured your thoughts accurately. The recordings will be deleted after the study is completed, and none of your responses will be linked directly to you.

  * **Alternatively, we can choose not to record.** In that case, we’ll take notes to reflect what we learn from you, but there will be no recordings.

* Please let us know which option feels best for you today. Your comfort and privacy are our priority

  *  If yes: If you end up deciding you’d prefer we not use the recordings, we’ll stop recording and delete what we’ve captured.

\[Start recording.\]

* Just to confirm on the recording: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a couple of warm-up questions.

* To help us get started, could you share a bit about your experience with completing a disability claim, whether online or with a paper form?

* Based on what you shared with Perigean, I see you claimed \[relevant condition\]. Is this correct?

## **Technology Set-Up \+ Prototype Overview**

Now it’s time to send you the prototype we’d like to have you review. I am going to send you a link in the Zoom chat–please open the page when you receive it.

* [Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/r3Aj9FtLFS989mlVeBsgJg/0781-Redesign?page-id=14990%3A2&node-id=15722-103002&viewport=18767%2C20102%2C0.84&t=XN3Ge3QyJ6ViISJl-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=15722%3A103002&show-proto-sidebar=1)

Now, I’d like you to share your screen for the remainder of the session. Please let me know if I walk you through how to screen share.

* [Troubleshooting guide for mobile](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions)

* [General troubleshooting](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr)

* **Next, we’ll explore a prototype with the new design.** The prototype will look like VA.gov, but certain elements like links and certain buttons don’t work like you would expect them to. For example, this prototype does not allow for typing. Wherever you encounter a text field, give us a sense of what you would expect to write.

* **As I mentioned, some parts of this form may ask about sensitive topics,** like your condition or a brief description of a traumatic event. You can share as much or as little as you’re comfortable with, and it’s okay to pause or skip any questions.

  * As we go through, you can use your own personal experience to complete the form.

  * Or, if you’re not comfortable sharing your personal experience, you can silently imagine how you might answer questions, and speak generally about how someone might respond.

* **Whenever you can, talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.

## **Conditions- Step 2 (5-10 min)**

For today’s session, we are going to imagine you’re filing for disability benefits for the first time. Assume that you’ve already logged into [VA.gov](http://va.gov) and completed the first step of the form– focused on questions about your contact information and military service. You are currently working on the second part of the form– adding the conditions you are filing for.

For the purpose of this study, we have already added 2 conditions to the prototype– tinnitus and asthma. We know this won’t exactly match your experience, so you can imagine that it reflects whatever conditions you would enter, personally.

#### **Task 1:  Add Mental Heath Condition**

First, we would like to see how you would approach adding a condition to your claim. It would take us about 5-10 minutes. Is that ok with you? 

##### \[Add condition flow\]

*Look out for:*

* *Learning here will contribute to Goal 1 (Understanding of Form Structure)*

* *How does repetition of service connection questions impact Veteran perception of the flow overall*

##### \[Toxic Exposure opt-in screen\] 

* Next, we are going to move quickly through a handful of screens that are not relevant to our study.

  * Select “I am not claiming any conditions related to toxic exposure” and press continue.

##### \[POW screen\] 

* On this screen, you would typically add information about any time spent as a POW. Select “No” and press continue.

##### \[Additional Benefits opt-in\] 

* Select “No” and press continue.

**\[Researcher to pause– take an  informal wellness check before continuing\]**

## **Wrap-up Questions  (10 min)**

Thank you so much for walking us through the designs. Before we reach the end of the session, we have 10 minutes of wrap-up questions. 

- Were there any aspects of the process we just went through that stood out as positive or negative?

* Were there any points where the transition between pages of the form felt abrupt or disconnected? If so, where?

* Did you feel prepared for what to expect as you moved through the pages of the form?

  * \[If yes\] What helped you feel prepared?

  * \[If no\] What were the moments that were unexpected or confusing?

* When you were filling out the form, did you know which questions were optional and which ones were required?

  * Would you have felt comfortable skipping sections? Why or why not?

* How did you find the process of removing or changing information within the form?

* If you had a magic wand and could change anything about the process we just went through, what would it be?

Do you have any questions for me before we end the session?

**\[If recorded\]** Before we finish, I’d like to reconfirm that you’re okay with us having recorded today’s conversation. We’ll use these recordings solely to ensure we accurately capture your feedback, and they will be securely deleted after our analysis.

## **Thank-You and Closing  (5 min)**

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.** Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

**Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note** with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

**Thank you once again for sharing your time and experiences with us.** Your feedback is invaluable, and we appreciate your contribution. Please take care, and have a wonderful rest of your day.

## **\[For moderators only\] Emergency Exit**

### Exit Strategies

If we need to exit for any reason on our side consider the following exit strategies. Please do not share personal information as it may create additional stress for all. 

**If you need to end the session**

- No more question**:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

- Blame technology**:** I am so sorry, but I just learned that the \[website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today\] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

### **If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

### **If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### **If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### **If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### Back-up Moderator Plan

In the event the moderator needs to stop moderating, we’ll have determined a backup moderator for each session from one of the other possible moderators in the session

* The initial moderator will communicate with the backup moderator via the Feedback-backchannel on Slack that they need to swap roles.

* The initial moderator will communicate with the participant that they’re going to switch with a note-taker and introduce the new moderator.

* “I’m going to switch out with my note taker, Ruben Sun, who will be moderating the remainder of this session. I’ll still be on the call, but Ruben will be leading. Did you have any questions before we switch out?”

* The initial moderator will assume note-taking responsibilities.
