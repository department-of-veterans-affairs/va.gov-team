# Research Plan for Benefits and Claims Disability Experience Team, New VA Form 0781 Usability Testing, February 2025

### **Background**  
The Benefits and Claims Disability Experience Team is building the digital version of the new VA Form 21-0781  
*Statement in Support of Claimed Mental Health Disorder(s) Due to an In-Service Traumatic Event (s)*. The digital 0781 is an optional ancillary form that is embedded in the 526ez form on VA.gov. Overall, we aim to make the process of claiming PTSD and related conditions faster and less retraumatizing.

In June 2024, the team conducted concept-testing with the new digital 0781 design. This second round of testing will validate design changes made after research, especially changes in form flow, which brought together questions about traumatic events and behavioral changes in one section and consolidated medical record and supporting document gathering across the 526, 4142, and the 0781 . We also introduced the new multi-response pattern, handling of destructive actions and opt-outs, and embed form patterns (form within a form) which we would like to evaluate in the context of the 0781\.

We will draw on the trauma-informed principles that guided earlier research, and lean into the expertise of the VA Trauma Community of Practice when planning and conducting our research.

Almost a quarter of Veterans have PTSD at some point in their lives.

* About 1 in 3 women and 1 in 50 men report having experienced sexual harassment or sexual assault while in the military.  
* Stats are limited for nonbinary and transgender Veterans, but one study reports 15.2% of transgender women and 30% of transgender men experienced military sexual assault.

### **OCTO Priorities**

* VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.  
  * Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.  
  * Key Result 2: Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%.

### **Veteran Journey**

* Getting out: Engaging VA to access benefits and services  
* Taking care of myself: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs  
* Putting down roots: Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health  
* Putting down roots: Engaging VA to access benefits and services  
* Retiring: Finding additional sources of income  
* Retiring: Taking care of my health

## **Research Goals**

**Goal 1: Form Structure:** Validate that the new form flow **is clear and intuitive to Veterans.**  
**Goal 2: Informed Choices, Optionality, and Destructive Actions:** Evaluate the clarity and flexibility of decision points to determine if Veterans can make and change their minds with ease.  
**Goal 3: Multi-response Pattern:** Evaluate the usability of the multi-response pattern.

## **Outcome**

Research findings from the usability testing will help us to validate design updates and prioritize enhancements post-launch. We will be able to determine if restructuring of the form flow reduces emotional burden while streamlining the evidence upload experience, and to what extent Veterans make informed and flexible decisions.

In addition, learnings on the multi-response pattern and destructive actions (among other patterns) will support the Simple Forms team as they develop and standardize new patterns.

## **Research questions**

**Goal 1: Form Structure: Validate that the new form flow is clear and intuitive to Veterans.**

* To what extent do intro and review pages help Veterans understand what's behind them and what to expect next?  
* How do Veterans feel about the transition into the 0781 from the conditions step?  
* Where do in the flow do Veterans still express confusion about how the form is organized or expressed?  
* How do Veterans perceive the grouping of emotionally burdensome sections together in the form?  
* How do Veterans feel about the location of the supporting evidence in relation to the 0781?

**Goal 2: Informed Choices, Optionality, and Destructive Actions:** Evaluate the clarity and flexibility of decision points to determine if Veterans can make and change their minds with ease.

* To what extent do Veterans understand that the form is optional? How does their perception of optionality impact what they do or don’t complete?  
* How do Veterans approach removing, editing, or skipping data entry?  
* How clear are the consequences of different destructive actions?  
  * How would Veterans expect to delete their 0781 if they changed their mind?

**Goal 3: Multi-response Pattern:** Evaluate the usability of the multi-response pattern.

* How do Veterans navigate through the multi-response pattern?  
* What issues, if any, do Veterans have with the differences between the add and edit behavior?
* What do Veterans expect the save state to be when stopping adding or editing a multi-response mid-action?
* How do Veterans know (or feel confident) that their answers are what they intended when reviewing their answers in a multi-response pattern mid-form and on the final review page? 

## **Hypothesis**

**Goal 1: Form Structure:** Validate that the updated form flow better matches Veterans’ mental model.

* Consolidating traumatic events and behaviors first and creating a single evidence section will better match Veteran expectations, reduce emotional burden, and streamline usability.

**Goal 2: Informed Choices, Optionality, and Destructive Actions:** Evaluate the clarity and flexibility of decision points to determine if Veterans can make and change their minds with ease.

* Veterans understand that they can change their mind/answers at key points throughout the flow.  
* A majority of Veterans will comprehend whether or not they qualify for the initial opt-in.  
* Veterans will not perceive unlabeled optional fields as optional; regardless of label, a majority of Veterans feel pressure to provide as much information as possible.

**Goal 3: Multi-response Pattern:** Evaluate the usability of the multi-response pattern.

* The card visual will ease the burden of keeping track of responses.  
* The inconsistency between the add and edit behavior will slow or confuse Veterans.

## **Methodology**

We will be conducting remote, moderated usability testing on Zoom with a prototype. The high-fidelity clickable Figma prototype of the 0781 our team is currently building.  
The prototype will include:

* Include a part of Conditions (Step 2\) to orient participants and contextualize the 0781 flow \[explore use of Conditions team future-state, not current-state, in our prototype\]  
* 0781 (Step 3\) to evaluate the mental health form (see research goals and conversation guide).  
* Evidence section (Step 4\) to evaluate consolidation of evidence sections and further use of the multi-response pattern.

### **Location**

* Location: Remotely on Zoom  
* Point of contact: Evelyn Hilbrich Davis  
* Equipment used for research: Zoom and Mural (note taking, no PII)

### **Recruitment approach**

Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who have previously filed for related conditions (ie. PTSD, and other mental health conditions). This audience will be able to provide us with an informal comparison of the old and new flows and validate challenges based on their first-hand experience.  
Because of the sensitive nature of this study, we are taking a trauma-informed approach and proposing extra steps to prepare participants. Veterans will be sent an introductory email about our study upon signing up and asked if they are still interested in participating in the study. The introductory email will include a brief description of the study along with FAQs. We’ll also emphasize the option to not record the research session if they don’t feel comfortable.  
We will be using Perigian to help us recruit participants for this study.

### **Recruitment criteria**

### **Primary criteria (must-haves): Our target audience for this research is Veterans who:**

1. Have filed a claim for disability benefits  
2. Have claimed PTSD or a related mental health condition (see screener question)  
3. Have participated in studies with OCTO in the past– but did **not** participate in our last round of 0781 research  
4. Are willing and able to participate and screenshare during Zoom sessions from their mobile or desktop device (recruit n=3 of each)  
5. Have cognitive disabilities (n=3)

\*Note that we are adding this criteria in an effort to be trauma-informed; because of the sensitive nature of the study, we believe that Veterans who are familiar with OCTO’s process and have participated in studies in the past will be best prepared for what’s involved and less likely to be retraumatized.  
We are looking to complete 7-9 sessions. Because of the sensitive nature of the study, we anticipate it might be more difficult than usual to recruit and we could see higher than usual no-show rates or need to end sessions early. So we’d like to suggest recruiting 50% more than needed: 16 participants.

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves): Within our target audience, we would like include Veterans who are:**

1. 55+ years old (n=2)  
2. Hispanic, Biracial, Asian, or Native (At least n=4)  
3. Identify as gender other than male (At least n=4)  
4. LGBTQ+ (At least n=1)
