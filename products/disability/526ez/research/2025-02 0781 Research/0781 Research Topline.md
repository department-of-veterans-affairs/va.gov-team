This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**

- To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings  
- To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data  
- To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes  
    
**Research Goals:**  
    
- **Goal 1:** Form Structure– Validate that the new form flow is clear and intuitive to Veterans.

- **Goal 2:** Informed Choices, Optionality, and Destructive Actions– Evaluate the clarity and flexibility of decision points to determine if Veterans can make and change their minds with ease.

- **Goal 3:** Multi-response Pattern– Evaluate the usability of the multi-response pattern.

# Early Findings

## Goal 1- Form Structure

**Finding: A majority of Veterans said the form prepared them for what to expect, some citing intro and summary pages as helpful in setting expectations.** 

- If I was starting from scratch today, I could do that by myself today. Without having to use the DAV or a friend or have somebody sit down with me I felt confident I could work through that no problem.” \-P2

**Finding in progress: Participants didn’t make an immediate connection between mental health and supporting documents.** 

- When asked the purpose of supporting documents, Veteran mentioned medical or behavioral evidence, an opportunity to upload files, etc.   
- P1 and P12 saw the mental health supporting documents page as redundant with the evidence pages before (Add treatment provider) and after (Additional Information).  
- As a result, Veterans shared a mental model that supporting documents were another form of evidence and made sense in the evidence section. We aren’t satisfied with this and are digging into it deeper in further synthesis work.

**Finding in progress:** Earlier notice of upcoming evidence requirements could support Veterans– especially MST filers.

**Finding: The checklist format of the behavioral changes choice page clarified the concept for most Veterans unsure about what to expect next.** 

* When asked what they would expect next from the behavioral changes intro page, purpose of behavioral changes and their relationship to events.  
* The list of changes brought clarity to the section and gave Veterans clear guidance on how to interact with the section. A couple of Veterans said it might jog their memory about what might apply to them.  
* A majority of participants understood the relationship between the list and detail pages in add mode.   
  * Those who didn't may have had more of an issue with the facilitation of the scenario in early sessions.   
  * 2 Veterans skipped the detail pages without realizing it.

## Goal 2- Informed Choices, Optionality, Destructive Actions 

**Finding: A majority of Veterans understood the purpose of the 0781 choice page– all opted into the form.**

* 6 participants expected to file online; 2 mentioned using the pdf, especially if they weren't ready. 1 participant thought the choice page was related to the C+P exam rather than an optional form.  
* All participants had filed for a mental health condition in the past and did not seem to consider skipping it (whether for personal reasons or by set up of the study).  
* Facilitator note: In our conversation guide, we decided to flag upcoming content for our participants to allow them to make the informed choice to continue. We knew this could potentially prime participants, but decided to take the risk in the name of a more trauma-informed approach. 

**Finding: When it comes to filing a claim with VA, information rarely feels truly optional.** 

- Based on past filing experience, participants have learned that providing more information to VA is always better.  
- Most said they wouldn't leave fields blank if they had something to share, but seeing the word "optional" might make those without answers feel more comfortable leaving them blank.

**Finding: The opt out from the Review & Submit pages (0781 and 526\) was not straightforward for Veterans.** 

- From Step 3, 5 out of 9 Veterans ultimately clicked on “Edit” within the accordion and opted out with ease. Others were looking for a clearer call to action, like “Delete.”    
- Those who did not find the opt out said they would delete each response from the accordion in order to remove the statement. 

**Finding: A majority of the destructive action modals were clear to participants– and appreciated by those who liked the double confirmation.**

- “This is a nice touch. Just to have the pop-up box so you don't remove something and not realize you actually did it.” \-P2  
- However, the 0781 opt out modal faced more mixed comprehension. None mentioned that the details about supporting documents listed at the end of the modal would be deleted and 2 expected for traumatic events to stay in their claim.   
- **Jargony:** A few Veterans pointed to the VA form name in the destructive action modal and asked for plain language. 

**Finding: The "Edit behavioral changes" link unexpectedly directed participants back to the checkbox page instead of the detail pages– making it hard for users to change their mind.**

- After some discovery, a majority were able to navigate forward to a detail page from the checklist.   
- 2 participants fail to edit and indicate that they would uncheck boxes in order to try to edit one behavior at a time. However, we think facilitation in the first few sessions did not set Veterans up to understand sample copy, which would’ve confused their mental model.   
- One participant suggested having a link for each behavioral change that would take you back to the detail page, rather than one for the whole summary page. Another suggested the evidence summary should have matching functionality, noticing the shared pattern. 

## Goal 3- Multi-response pattern

**Participants added traumatic events with relative ease and found the examples gave them a better understanding of their options while filing.** 

- One Veteran missed the "Add an event" button and pressed continue, skipping the section. Concerns were content-related.   
- Consider clarifying "township" and "agency."   
- Veterans understand that they could add more events, which would be represented as cards. 20 events seemed like a reasonable cap to all but an MST filer who imagined having more. 


**When asked to make edits to traumatic events, participants struggled to understand the interaction model.**

- All were able to make simple edits from the first page in the flow, but a majority struggled to modify later pages-- like from the police report from the official report page.   
- When asked to remove the police report, users scrolled up and down the event detail page when the pattern required them to continue to the next page.  
- Features from the summary card view (edit and delete card) and “cancel while editing” from the detail pages were simple for participants.
