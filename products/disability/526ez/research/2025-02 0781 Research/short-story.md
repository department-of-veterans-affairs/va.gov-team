# Form 0781 Redesign Enhances Veteran Experience

## TL;DR

Veterans find the revised disability claim form more intuitive, but still face challenges with evidence submission and form optionality.

## What We Did

The OCTO-DE team conducted semi-structured interviews to validate the clarity and usability of the new disability benefits form for Veterans.

## Key Insights

### Veterans appreciate the new form structure.

> "Veterans did not experience the same confirmation fatigue... suggesting that the new design improved upon previous flow."

### The form's optionality is understood, but Veterans feel pressured to provide complete information.

> "Veterans perceived optional fields as required in order to get a good rating on their claim."

### Summary cards in the multi-response pattern are helpful, but editing remains confusing.

> "Veterans appreciated the summary card format for confirming data entry and as an opportunity to return later and add detail."

### Evidence submission needs clearer instructions and better integration.

> "Multiple participants wanted clearer instruction and expectation setting about where to add evidence in the flow."

### The form's destructiveness and opt-out actions are mostly clear but can be cumbersome.

> "Most destructive action modals were clear and reinforced the informed choice Veterans were making."

## Between the Lines

The study indicates that while the form's flow and structure have improved, Veterans' understanding of the form's optionality and evidence requirements could be further clarified to reduce pressure and confusion.

## Yes, But

Although the form has been designed to be trauma-informed and less burdensome, some Veterans still find parts of the process, like opting out, to be challenging.

## Why It Matters

This research is crucial as it aligns with the VA's broader goals of making disability claims more accessible and less stressful for Veterans, thereby improving their overall experience with the VA.

## Whatâ€™s Next

The team will prioritize opportunities for improvement, refine enhancements, and plan further research with diverse Veteran groups, including those who have not previously claimed a mental health condition.
