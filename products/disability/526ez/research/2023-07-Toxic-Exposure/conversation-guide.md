## Intro - 5 minutes
 
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
 
Our team is working to develop a new section of the online form used to file a disability compensation claim, also called the 526EZ form. We have mocked up a design for some new questions, and are asking Veterans like yourself for feedback so that we can make sure that it is understandable and easy to use.
 
We’ll spend most of our time looking at those mockups, but we also have some more general questions to ask in the beginning and at the end of our session today.
 
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
 
- **This entire session should take about an hour to an hour and 15 mins.** I want to be sure to ask you all of our questions, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your knowledge or ability. Your feedback is helping us improve the language on these pages so it’s a better experience for veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback either about what you read or see.
 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will be compensated regardless of whether you complete the session or answer all of the questions.
 
- I have [a few] additional colleagues who would like to listen in to our conversation. **Is that OK with you?**
 
	- *If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.*
 
	- *If yes: Admit observers.*
 
	- *Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and their role.*
 
	- *Once complete, ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.*
 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
 
*Start recording. Make sure recording to the account cloud.*
 
- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
 
## Warm-up Questions – 5 minutes
 
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.
 
First, can you briefly describe your military service? We’re interested in hearing about when you served, what branch, etc. if you are comfortable sharing those details. *Moderator will have to keep in mind the participant’s service history to know where to prompt participant during task 2.*
 
Second, we’re interested in hearing if you have ever filed a claim for disability compensation before…
 
*If yes,*
- How many claims have you filed?
- Have you been service-connected for any conditions, or in other words have you been granted compensation for any conditions?
- How did you file the claims? (online, by mail, with VSO, etc.)
- Are you considering filing any new claims in the near future?
 
*If no,*
- Have you ever considered filing? Why or why not?
 
## Transition to prototype – 5 mins
 
Thank you for providing that background. Now we are going to go ahead and look at a mockup for a new section being added to the form that people use to claim disability compensation.
 
Keep in mind this is a mockup and doesn’t really work the way a website typically would, but it has enough details to allow us to get feedback before we build it into the system. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. Since this is a demo, none of your actions here will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
 
I’m going to ask you to think of your own situation as you move through and answer the questions. If you don’t want to do that, then I will supply a hypothetical situation instead that you can use to answer.
 
I’m also going to ask you to “think aloud” while you go through the screens, which means tell us what you are thinking and what you are doing while you use the screens. This isn’t natural, so I’ll prompt you if you go quiet for too long.
 
That was a lot of instruction – do you have any questions so far? 

Let’s go ahead and open the mockup and share your screen.
 
I’ve put a link into the Zoom chat, are you able to open the chat and the link? Now, you’ll share your screen so I can see what you are doing as we continue our conversation.  
 
## Task 1: Determining relation to toxic exposure – 5 mins.
 
To save time, we are skipping the beginning of the form, including the introduction and the screens in section 1 where you enter your personal information and information about your military service. We’ll start you on the first screen of the second section.

Out of curiosity, can you guess what this step might be about? What other kinds of questions might you expect to be asked in this step?

### Related to claim type screen

What would you do on this screen? 
 
*If they only select “One or more that has gotten worse”:* Okay, now for demo purposes, I’m going to ask you to go back and indicate that you are claiming a condition that has not been rated yet. *After they do that and see the next screen:* Would you have expected to see questions related to toxic exposure if you were filing a claim because a condition has worsened?
 
### Related to toxic exposure screen

*If Veteran has mentioned claims or considering claims for a condition, use their own situation:* 

Think about a condition that you have claimed in the past or are thinking about claiming and walk us through what you would do with this screen.
 
*If Veteran needs or prefers a hypothetical situation:*

Imagine that you started this application to ask for disability compensation for asthma and you served in a Gulf War location. If that was the case, what would you do on this screen?
 
*Allow participant to first answer the question, then ask these follow up questions before they select "Continue"*

- Are you familiar with the phrase “toxic exposure”? What do you know about it? Where did you learn about it?
- Is this text about toxic exposure helpful to you?

For the sake of getting feedback, we’d like you to select "I don't know" before proceeding.
  
### No follow-up screen (only displays if user clicked "No" or "I don't know")
 
*Allow participant to look at and answer the question on the screen.*
 
*Follow-up:*

- Is there anything confusing about the message here? If so, please explain.
- Does this screen change your mind about your answer? Why or why not?
- Did you notice the link to "Learn more about toxic exposure"? What would you expect if you clicked that?
 
What would you do next?
 
 
## Task 2: Filling in toxic exposure locations and dates - 15 mins 

*Note: We want to have the participant exercise multiple dates on one of these screens, either for more than one location or for more than one time period. Moderator will have to keep in mind the participant’s service history to know where to prompt (GW or AO). If we do not get this type of entry, after participant fills it out to their own service history then suggest/ask what they would do in hypothetical scenario (served in Gulf War location after 9/11 and filing new claim for asthma.)*

### GW screen #1

What would you do on this screen? Please use your own military service to answer the questions. M*oderator should note if they served none or more than one of these places.*
 
What would you do next?
 
### Dates screen

What would you do on this screen?
 
If you served in more than one time period, what would you do?

## Task 3: Filling out additional exposures and dates - 10 mins
 

### Exposure list screen
 
- What would you do on this screen…
 
- *If any apply,* what would you do next?
 
- *If none apply,* what would you do next?
 
For the sake of getting feedback, we’d like you to imagine that you were exposed to asbestos and radiation.
 
- What would you do if that was the case?
  
 
### Asbestos screen
 
- What would you do on this screen? *If Veteran asks about what dates to put in, ask them to use a time frame from their own service.*
 
- What would you do if you had been exposed more than once? *Looking for verbal, as we will have covered this pattern already.*
 
What would you do next?
 
 
### Radiation screen
 
- What would you do on this screen? *If Veteran asks about what dates to put in, ask them to use a time frame from their own service.*
 
- What would you do if you had been exposed more than once? *Looking for verbal, as we will have covered this pattern already.*
 
What would you do next?
 
 
## Task 4: Summary screen – 5 mins
 
- What do you think is the purpose of this screen?

- Is this summary helpful to you? Why or why not?
  
- When do you like to see summaries like this, if at all? For example here, when you are done, or after the step is complete, or after the whole application is complete….

- If you noticed a mistake here, what would you do?
 
What would you do next?
 
 
## Task 5: Overall impressions – 5-10 mins
 
- What was that experience like?
 
- Was anything confusing?
 
- What do you think is the purpose of adding this section to the application?
 
- On a scale of 1 to 10, how burdensome was this to fill out? 1 being not at all burdensome and 10 being extremely burdensome…
 
- Why did you choose that number?
 
- Are there any ways you can think of improving this section?
 
- Any last thoughts you want to share before we end?
 
 
## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
 
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
 
We want to ask you again if it’s OK for us to use the video from our session, or if there’s anything you have shared that you would not want us to save.
 
Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
 
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
 
 
 
## Emergency Exit
 
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it’s easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
 
*If participant becomes nervous, anxious, or irritated -*
 
How are you feeling? do you want to take a few minutes to yourself?
 
You have already helped us a lot and given us some good information, it’s ok to take a break or even end now if you need to.
 
We’ve been talking a lot, do you want to take a break before we start again?
