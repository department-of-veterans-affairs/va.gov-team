# Research Plan for Form 526 Toxic Exposure Subsection/New Questions 

## Background on the product

The 21-526EZ form is one of the most used VA forms and one of the largest. It is also often the first VA "service" that veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their other experiecnes on VA.gov. However, it's confusing and stressful for veterans to apply for disability compensation as the process is rather opaque to the veteran. The form UX often leaves them feeling anxious and forgotten. The lack of clarity can also lead to mis-ratings, or misunderstanding of ratings, and a snowball of Appeals. 

As a new team, one of our objectives is to make sure the digital form is inline with the paper form so there is little discrepency between the two. Questions regarding toxic exposure were added to the paper 21-526EZ form following the PACT act, and those questions now need to be added to the online form. This research will test the implementation of those questions within the online form.

### OCTO Priorities 

This feature addresses these OCTO priorities:
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims
- Reduce errors and ambiguity in submitted claims (thus reducing processing time)
- Build trust with Veterans

### Veteran Journey

Moments that matter:
- Taking care of myself

## Goals

### User goals
This feature addresses needs for both Veterans and employees. User goals include:
- Veterans can successfully report toxic exposure so that their conditions can be considered for presumptive and other types of service connection
- Claims processors can more readily identify relevant evidence in the Veteran’s file pertaining to toxic exposures because they have accurate dates and exposures to search for.

### Research Goals	

Research goals include:
- Validate form content clarity and comprehension
- Understand potential for screen fatigue within the sub-section (currently, we are unable to fully test whether the increase in number of pages is offset by reduced cognitive load on individual screens)

### Research questions
The research should answer these questions:
- Do users understand the concept of toxic exposure? Does the hint content provide them with enough information when the term is unfamiliar?
- Can users understand the questions and accurately provide answers to those questions?
- Do users have trouble connecting location questions with date data input on the following screens?
- Is summarizing the data collected in this subsection useful?

### Hypotheses

Key hypotheses include:
- Plain language content and reduced cognitive load will make it easy for Veterans to accurately fill out the toxic exposure questions.
- Reducing the cognitive load on individual screens is a good trade-off for making the form longer.
- Users may lose the thread between the locations they served and multiple dates needing to be entered when they are on separate screens.

## Methodology	 

- Moderated usability testing using mobile or desktop devices.
- Remote over Zoom
