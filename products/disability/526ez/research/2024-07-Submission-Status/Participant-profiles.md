# 526 Submission Status Participant Profiles

## Overview

The 526 Submission Status Evaluative Research Study is assessing the clarity of changes to the 526 submission process to see if Veterans have accurate expectations for the status and timeline in the days following submission. The study, including 8 research sessions, took place between July 8-15, 2024. 

Sessions ran 60 minutes and asked participants for feedback on 2-3 possible submission scenarios. VA practitioners who were unable to attend a session at the time are encouraged to review recordings. Note: These video recordings will only be available for duration of the study until August 31, 2024. 

Please direct any questions about recordings, participants, or the study to Evelyn Hilbrich Davis at evelyn@cityfriends.tech.

## Participant Profiles
Use the descriptions below to choose which session you would like to review. All participant profiles include a high level description of the participant and key feedback throughout the session. 

|   |   |  |  |
|--|--|--|--|
|**Participant session number**| **Cognitive disability (Y/N)** | **Theme of session**| **Description**
|**P1** |No| **Notify Me!** | Helps other Veterans file online, expresses greatest familiarity with the form. Confused by the two timelines (3 and 7-10 days); appreciates the emails and expects to receive more in the future for steps in the claims processing. |
|P2 |No| **New VA.gov Filer** | Has never filed 526 online-- used a rep to file BDD (appreciated the ease). Struggled to follow without the context of filing, personally (which could be valuable insight for VSOs), but liked aspects of the visual design for CST. Thought evidence failure = system insecurity. Expected a digital resubmission option.
|**P3** |Yes|**Trusting Skeptic**  | Despite identifying as highly distrusting of VA, participant took the messaging as truthful across scenarios. When filing in 2018, his claim was redecided before he had to appeal; likes to think that decisions are being double-checked. Would like less "generic" lang for next steps in claims processing (liked CST steps). 
|**P4** |No| **Claim ID Matters**|Did not scroll much and based impressions on content above the fold. Participant doesn't keep a paper record of claims; relies on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) for information. In the backup path, P4 mentioned that the missing claim ID as contributing to lack of clarity of the submission status (4 out of 5). He said he would wait 20-30 days before calling and use his VA file number or SSN to ask for help once realizing his claim ID was missing from the scenario.  |
|**P5** |No| **Disappointed by Tech**| Participant was frustrated by perceived slowness/insecurity of [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) systems. Surprised by 3 days to transmit and evidence failure (and no digital resubmit)-- mental model for tech is related to experiences with online banking.|
| **P8** |Yes|  **"Up a creek"** |Scenarios and tech made comprehension and usability especially difficult for participant. Frustrated by the evidence failure scenario (personally did not resubmit material in a past claim). For the timeline, added together 3 and 7-10 days to get expected next communication.|
|**P10**|Yes| **Daily Tracker** | Based on other [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) filing, expected to see a PDF on confirmation page. Would check daily to see the status of her submission and to determine if action was required.  *Note:* Tech mixup led to skipping happy path (full backup path w/ confirmation page review) 
|**P11**|Yes| **Government Employee** | Medically retired with 100% disability (supported by rep through BDD). Has started a new 526 for Pact Act, but never submitted one on their own. Mental model comes from experience as a federal employee working on communications, which gave this participant some expert knowledge but also some incorrect expectations. Provided feedback on adding "business days," allowing for digital resubmit, clarifying "date intitiated," etc.
