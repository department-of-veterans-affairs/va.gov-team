## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Evelyn and [NOTETAKER] is taking notes. I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services.

Before we start, I’d like to give you an overview of what to expect from our time together.

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. We will focus on the experience of submitting a disability claim on VA.gov. The session will begin with some context-setting questions. Then, we’ll look at three submission possibilities and conclude with reflection questions. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is for you to use a digital experience we have created in order for us to improve it. ​​In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

We may look at things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation. However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the website in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.

That was a lot of information. Are you comfortable proceeding with the agenda I’ve proposed for today’s session?

Feel free to ask any questions you may have throughout the session. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

  

Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
    

  

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s talk a bit about your experience filing for benefits w/ the VA.

-   When did you last file a claim on VA.gov?
    

	-   Do you have any claims that are still open?
    

  

-   Do you keep a record of the claims you’ve filed in the past? If so, how?
    

	-   Is there somewhere you go online that you trust has the most up-to-date information about your claim?
    

  

-   If a Veteran friend asked you to explain the submission process based on what you’ve experienced in the past, what would you tell them?
    

	-   Do you remember how you got information about your submission status in the days after filing?
	-   Have you ever had to resubmit a claim or any other information on VA.gov? What was that process like for you?
    

  

## Technology screenshare set-up - 5 minutes

Thanks for sharing your experience with me. We’re going to shift gears and move into looking at the submission designs.

You’ll be interacting with a , which is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the  will be clickable, and some will not. Since it’s a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

I am going to drop a link to the  in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

## First Task: [Happy Path scenario] - 15 minutes

For our first scenario today, you will be submitting a disability claim for tinnitus as a Veteran named Hector. Imagine you’ve made it all the way to the end of the application on VA.gov. As a note, this imaginary event is going to take place over a number of days, so be prepared for a couple of jumps in time!

**[Review and submit page]**

For our purposes, imagine that you have already reviewed your information. Please go ahead and submit the application when you are ready.

**[Animated loading indicator – 10 second animation then freezes]**

-   What do you think is happening to your submission right now?
    
	-   What do you expect will happen next?
    

  

**[Confirmation page]**

Take a moment to review this page before we discuss it. Do your best to think aloud as you go.

-   Based on this page, what do you think is happening to the claim you just submitted?
    

	-   What do you suppose “date initiated” means?
	-   What do you expect will happen next?
    

  

-   Inside the blue box is something called a claim ID. What do you suppose a claim ID might be?
    

	-   Would you expect to use the number for something? If so, how would you use it?
    

  

-   Would you want to save this page? If so, why?
    

	-   Is there any claim information that is missing from this page that you would like to save?    
	-   Would you be interested in downloading a full copy of your claim from VA.gov at a later date?
-   Did any information on this page stand out to you as especially helpful or confusing?
    

  

-   Are there any actions left for you to take?
    

  

Thanks so much! Later I’m going to refer to this page as the “confirmation page.” There’s no pressure to keep it in your mind– just know we’ll refer back to it.

  

**[ Claim initiated email]**

Now, imagine ten minutes later you check your email and this message is waiting for you in your inbox.

-   What do you think is the purpose of this email?
    
	-   What do you suppose will happen next?
    

-   Are there any actions left for you to take?
    

  
**[Claim received email]**

Now, imagine three days have passed. You check your email and find the following message in your inbox.

-   What do you think is the purpose of this email?
    -   What do you suppose is happening with your submission?
    -   What do you think will happen next?
    

  

-   Would you want to check the status of your claim? If so, how would you do it?
    -   What information would you expect to find if you were to check?
    -   [After clicking on link] How does the information on this page compare to what you have already learned about your submission?
    -   Is there anywhere else online that you would expect to find up-to-date information about your claim?
    

  

-   Are there any actions left for you to take on your claim submission?
    

### Reflection

On a scale of 1 to 5, how clear to you was the status of your submission throughout the scenario?
    
On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you that your claim was submitted and ready for initial review?
    

  
## Second Task: [Evidence Failure scenario] - 10 minutes

[Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/qyTtKDOTHZPGU59PAfqVhq/Submission-Experience?node-id=5966-58868&t=pNM9YNKaPaTs2lbo-1&show-proto-sidebar=1&starting-point-node-id=5966%3A58868)

Thanks for your feedback with the last scenario. Now, we are going to start the submission process over from the very beginning. Just like before, you submitted a new disability claim. You received a confirmation email, which you are currently looking at in your inbox. Please click on it and review. 

Imagine two days have passed and a new message just arrived in your inbox, let’s take a look.

**[Evidence failure email]**

Take a moment to review this page before we discuss it. Do your best to think aloud as you go.

-   What do you think is the purpose of this email?
	-   What do you suppose is happening with your submission?
    
-   What are you most likely to do next?
    -   Do you have all the information you need to complete this task? 
	-   Are there any barriers that would make it difficult to complete the task?
	-   Is there anywhere on VA.gov that you would expect to find information about your submissions status?
  
-   What do you think will happen next with your claim submission?
    -   Would you expect to hear from VA?
    -   What will you do if you don't receive an update from VA?
    
-   Are there any actions left for you to take?
    

### Reflection on scenario

- On a scale of 1 to 5, how clear to you was the status of your submission throughout the scenario?

## Third Task: [Backup Path scenario] - 10 minutes

  

[Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/qyTtKDOTHZPGU59PAfqVhq/Submission-Experience?node-id=5626-129875&t=pNM9YNKaPaTs2lbo-1&show-proto-sidebar=1&starting-point-node-id=5626%3A129875)

  
Thanks for your feedback. For this scenario, let’s again imagine again that you are about to submit a new disability claim as Hector, but this time for asthma. Go ahead and submit the application, just like before. 

Take a moment to review the confirmation page!

-   What do you think is happening with your submission right now?
	-   What do you expect to happen next?
 	-   Assume you received an email version of the confirmation page, just like before. 

Great. Now we're going to travel forward in time. Imagine 7 days have passed since you submitted your claim and you haven't received a new email from VA.

-   What do you think is happening with your submission right now?
    
	-   [If delay is mentioned] How does that make you feel?
    
-   Are there any actions left for you to take?

    
**[Claim received email]**

Ten minutes later, you check your email and find the following message in your inbox.

-   According to this email, what’s the status of your submission?
    

	-   What do you expect will happen next to your submission?
    

  -   Are there any actions left for you to take on your claim submission?

## Wrap-up Questions

-   If a Veteran friend asked you to explain the submission process based on what you experienced today, what would you tell them?
    

  

-   If you had a magic wand, what is one thing you’d make better about the submission process?
    

  

-   We looked at several messages today. Beyond email, is there any other way you would prefer to receive these messages? (Text, app, etc)
    

  

-   [ Ask if appropriate and time allows] We'd like to learn about ways that VA.gov grows or loses trust of Veterans. Could you tell us about a time when VA earned or lost some of your trust specifically through our website or app?
    

	-   Did the submission process we looked at today earn or lose your trust?
    

  

-   Any questions from me?
    

  

## Consent to use video clips

-   Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?
    

-   We would remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.
    

-   If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
    

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
