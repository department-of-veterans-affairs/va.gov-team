# From research project goals:

##Getting to the form

- Can Veterans get to the form easily?

  - **Mostly, yes. (p1, p2, p3, p4) 4/5 were successful.**
  - **One had confusion about terms and was looking for "compensation". Also was looking for something that looked clickable on the homepage like "start your VA benefits here".**
    - *there's nothing in here to say to apply for those benefits. Maybe it's disability. Oh, here it is. I thought they'd call it "VA compensation". I know everybody addresses it as a disability, but I thought it was VA compensation. Okay, so this is it. Maybe they can put it in there - "VA compensation and disability". I know the majority of people understand it. But me, I just go off of United States Code or Code of Federal Relation or public law, whatever they consider it, that's how I understand it.*

- Do they understand what type of claim to make? (new, secondary, most would work)

- Veteran Information

  - **(p2) 1/5 wanted to see info VA knows about them and was distressed that they would have to supply all their information from the beginning.**

    - *(p2) I would be annoyed. I'm scrolling to think how am I going to do this (in response to [all the documents needed under "prepare"](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ#/screens/287920318))? They should already have all my information. I'd probably go to a VSO and be fairly frustrated at this point. I would pretty much be out of here. I say that because what I've found in my previous experience . Only because I was logging in every week or so to check on status, did I know I needed to supply additional information. I'm a fan of Self-Service but the fact that I can't drag and drop, 'here's my DD-214' and drop it in. If self-service was as easy as drag and drop I might do it if it was that easy, but because of my experience I would go to my tried and true method (working with a VSO).*

    - *(p2) I was feeling hopeful, when I saw [the disclaimer](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ#/screens/287920318) (that some of my info will be pulled in after I sign in). I was excited that some of my info would be able to be pulled in. Then I scrolled down and saw I was in the same situation (that I would need to have SSN, hospital records, DD214, etc on hand). So I felt hopeful and then my hope was dashed.*

    - *(p2) a good example might be online tax returns. Previous year's data is saved and it's a matter of me entering passwords and info gets pulled in and I don't have to do additional retrieval or work. So if my pdfs in eBen could be dragged and dropped into a new claim, that would be helpful.*

    - *(p2) [Visits Manage your health and benefits]*

      *I would try to get my profile to see my info and try to initiate a new claim. If I couldn't find that I'd prob go back to the VSO*

- Do they understand what happens next?

##Adding new conditions

- **(p1, p2) 2/5 missed that the triage questions went to a second step after clicking next**

  - *(p1) clicked on "next", but nothing happened (actually went to next step, but he didn't notice)*

- **(p1) 1/5 thought it was confusing to list 10% or higher as well as 0% on "List Conditions"**

  - *(on "[list conditions](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ#/screens/287920331)") There are people that get rated 0%. I got tinnitus at 10% which is fine, but I got to a point where I needed a hearing aid, and I got rated 0 for hearing loss. That would cause me to say "wait a minute. I'm feeling my hearing is getting worse", but you're saying that I can't make a claim to raise it to 10% for instance. (Suggestion: ) Any condition if you've got 0% or higher and it's gotten worse...*

- Is the New conditions distinction clear (new conditions versus one of my rated conditions has gotten worse)?

  - **(p2, p3) 2/5 chose only "new conditions" even when they were clear on the scenario (cyst that developed from a rated amputation and new PTSD)**

- Does the `body system` mechanic make sense?

  - **(p5, p3, p2, p1) 4/5 had significant problems getting through it. Some of the challenges:**

    - **(p5, p3) 2/5 participants don't know how to begin or thought it would be easier to interact with dropdowns only**

      - *(p5) [tries to click on select a condition dropdown] This doesn't give meâ€¦ [tries to click "add another condition" first, doesn't advance]*
      - *(p5) where you have the body. I don't know if it's going to have all the impairments on there. Will it give you the option where you can drop down and type it in rather than just the options that they're giving you? that would be it*
      - *(p3) The clicking on the body part was fine, but if you wanted to go straight for the dropdown menu, does it list all possible things and have them categorized by mental health or the head - if you didn't want to click on the body and scroll through to see anything, is that an option?*

    - **Confusion about where to click for PTSD, not associating PTSD with the head**

      - *(p3) I don't like clicking on the head for PTSD for some reason. So when I look at the body, the way I'm thinking about it is not mental health. So like scarring on the face, lost eye, something with teeth. maybe if you added an option like where you say "all", something like "mental health".*
      - *(p2) PTSD is in the head but it can affect everything, wasn't sure what you were looking for so I figured 'All' would capture everything.*

    - **1 Expected to see "PTSD" in the name of the condition**

      1. *(p1) After the word on Post-traumatic stress disorder, I'd put (PTSD) there. It's just a lot of long words. That abberviation is everywhere in the public eye.*

    - **Confusion about whether the first condition was saved / adding a new condition**

      - (p2)
        If you were going to move on to the other condition how would you do that?

        *Would click continue to make sure I was done with the addition of the first wrist condition.*

        Are you looking for 'Save' on that screen?

        *Exactly. I was going to go 'continue' want to make sure that I'm not undoing anything going forward. I see the 1st condition is saved*

- Does having new conditions and worsened conditions make things too confusing (going through them in different steps)?

  - **Not a problem: participants didn't seem to notice the distinction between new and worsened when stepping through evidence for each condition**

- **(p4, p2, p1) 3/5 had confusion about "yes, it's service connected" and "no, it's related to another condition" - some participants chose "yes, it's service connected" for the cyst even though it followed from the amputation and should have been "related to another condition"**

  - (p2)
    Chose "yes, it's service connected" on the cyst (but it was actually related to another condition in the scenario)

    *It was super fast. You told me a doctor said it was related; I probably would have done my own Googling once I left the doctor's office to see if it was legit that cysts follow from amputation. So by the time I saw the screen I would have thought it's a no-brainer and related to my amputation (so I would have chosen yes, it's service connected).*

## Additional forms

- Is it clear which additional forms should be submitted?
- Is it clear what is involved?
- **(p4, p3, p2) 3/5 found it difficult to manage additional forms when on a phone or when you don't have access to a printer. Some mentioned an "email the form" option would be nice**
  - *(p3) Downloading a form and filling it out on an iPhone, I don't know how that would work. It's kind of pointless to download the form onto your phone. Is there a way to email the form? It sends a link - instead of the actual form, it sends a link to the account on file, and when you're onto a computer, you can get it and print it out. I don't think I would do this on my phone, but yeah, that would be what I'd prefer (having it sent to me by email) so I don't have to hunt with it - send me a link, and it prompts me to download.*
  - *(p2) Frustrating can't download form. Can't email or download form so I'm going to write down the form number I have to get and click continue.*
- **(p3) 1/5 had a concern about losing progress**
  - *(p3) A pop-up to download or something to keep it on this page would be nice*
  - Note: But the build has a flash that shows autosave status - might be out of the viewport on mobile

## Supporting evidence

- Does this flow still work when dealing with both new conditions and increase?
  - **Yes. No major problems found other than those listed**

# Other Themes

1. **(p1,p2, p4) 3/5 were unsure about how to answer the question on whether they were unable to work** [#unemployability](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/unemployability) 

   1. *(p2) Unable is I can't work b/c of physical limitation, but it's hard to say with PTSD because I can do the work but I can't be around people. I can't commute because I'm afraid of devices on the road. I would by default select "I am unable to work".*
   2. *(p1) I'm 70 years old, and I don't work anymore. How do I answer that when I'm 70? That's a legitimate question, but I don't know how to handle it when I'm retired.*
   3. Comment from team meeting: Maybe all the questions are too spare

2. Additional benefits

   1. **(p1, p2) 2/5 didn't think they would qualify for Additional benefits based on the 30% threshold - actually they would if their rating was upgraded based on the claim for increase they were making** 

      1. *What is this first page telling you? What do you think will happen next given that you're currently at 20%?*

         ***(p1) I'm thinking additional claims will increase my rating. This box would not be of value to me since I'm at 20%. It's kind of nice to have it on there for others who are 30% or more. Should be at the end of the application form though, not in the middle / body of it.***

      2. *M: You're also making new claims as a part of this process. How do you think that relates to that 30% floor?*

         ***(p2) I know that if I don't meet the minimum standard today, I have to go through an entire other process b/c I'm not at 30% or greater so I would have been turned off.***

   2. **3/5 were easily able to successfully answer whether they would qualify for additional benefits**

      1. **(p1) 1/5 felt good that VA is being proactive in asking about whether the applicant needs other adaptive benefits**
         1. *(p1) Well, they're trying to be proactive in saying "do i need other adaptive benefits due to my condition?" This is a very good question. I feel good about that.*

3. Exam Scheduling

   1. **(p2, p3) 2/5 remembered bad experiences from exam scheduling earlier in their experience**
      1. *(p2) Not that again. Totally nuts. No prompting. I get a weird 800 call "You have an appt next week", but I have a vacation scheduled. You have "this window at this time". I know I can't miss because who knows how long it'll be before I get another one. Luckily I was only 4 hrs away. That was a very tough process. So when I read that I think "Ugh, not that again". But I have no choice, I have to do it. It's hideous.*	
      2. Recommendation: Someone (from a previous round) was told what the number is and then knew it was VA. Can we include the phone number on this page to give Veterans a heads up about who will call?

   2. **(p1) 1/5 was looking for the term "C&P" when reading about "the appropriate exams"**

      1. ***(p1) When it says the appropriate exams, is that referring to C&P? It has to be C&P, right?***

         *Is that C&P terminology helpful?*

         ***Yes***

   3. **(p2) 1/5 suggested having a system where he could pick a time or indicate his availability for exams rather than being given a time**

      1. *M: If you were going to redesign how exam scheduling worked, how would it work?*

         ***I would love to schedule it myself like you do a hotel reservation. But I know there's an intermediary that does reservations. I would love a hotel accessibility-type scheduler that I can access.***

         ***But maybe give the options about what times and day are best, give me the option to suggest feedback about what times are best. More of a two-way street rather than an 800 number telling you here's the time and you have to go.***

4. **(p2, p5) 2/5 Expected to be able to list secondary conditions and associate them with the primary condition**

   1. (p2)
       Select 'No - it's related to another condition' , I'd like to see your perception of how we're presenting this.

      *Clicking no, I would have thought I'd be asked what condition it was tied to. When I saw amputation was one of the options there was really nowhere for me to go, the other two didn't match up. I would have chosen amputation and clicked continue. It was the next best option.*

   2. *(p5) You may have a couple of major impairments. You may have a secondary underneath it. Under PTSD, sleeping difficulties, breathing difficulties, may gain weight. If it's TBI, you might get tinnitus, vertigo, memory, whatever.*

      *Should be an option to choose a secondary condition under PTSD. That's how they have it in eBenefits, and that's how you can claim it legally*

      *You know, people have sleeping problems or breathing problems because of it. could be a whole bunch of secondary. the first condition could be causing order of effects. that's a military term.*
