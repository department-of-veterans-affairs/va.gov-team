# Conversation Guide: 526 New Claims

## Goals
- Is the interface directing Veterans to make the right call to action to begin a disability claim?
- Are Veterans able to find out if they are eligible for disability benefits?
- Where do Veterans get confused in submitting a disability claim?
- How does the Veteran feel after completing the steps of the application?
- Is our terminology relatable to Veterans?

## We will know we have been successful if:

- If the Veteran can complete the application
- If the Veteran has an idea of what to expect after completing the application

## Who are our participants?

- Veterans who are disabled but have not filed a disability claim
- Veteran who have experience with disability claims

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today. My name is (Alex/Mike), and I also have some colleagues who are observing the session and helping me take notes. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn how to make one section of our website more useful to you.

Before we begin, I’d like to go over a few things and explain how the session will work.

We'll look at an **in-progress prototype for submitting disability claims online. Some parts will be clickable, but not everything will work**, and the actions you take here won't affect any of your actual information or benefits. Also, **this is only a part of the actual process**. When it is live, there will be additional steps after where we end today.

We aren’t testing your ability. In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions**. There are no right or wrong answers; we want to hear whether this section of the site makes sense to you. I'm hoping this can be an honest conversation between you and me, and I promise I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

**Please think aloud**. While you are going through the site, please try as much as possible to vocalize your reactions, thoughts, and decisions as you see each page. That helps us to better share your thoughts with other members of our team.

This entire session should take about **45 minutes**. I want to be respectful of your time, so I may move us along a little faster at various points.

**If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know**. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop, and you will still receive your $25 thank you.

**Are you comfortable if I record this session**? I'd like to record our conversation and what you do on the screen so we can make sure to capture your thoughts accurately.

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me about your time in the service
- Tell me about your experience with disability claims through the VA. 
  - Have you ever filed for a disability claim? 
    - *If yes,* could you share your experience with filing a claim? 
    - *If no,* have you considered filing for a disability claim? Tell me about the process.
      - Is there anything stopping you from filing for a disability claim?

## First Task: Getting to the form 

### Scenario
[Use staging server](http://staging.vets.gov)

You have an existing rating of 20% for amputation of the little finger on your left hand and tinnitus. 

You have recently come to realize that you are suffering from PTSD related to your service. Your doctor recommended that you make a claim for this new condition, as well as a cyst in your left wrist. This cyst is a common side effect of ambutations in the hand.

- If you wanted to file a claim for a new condition related to your service, show me how you would proceed using this site.
  - What would you be eligible for?
- Given this scenario, which options would you choose if you were going to apply?

***Starts Claim***
[Use prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ#/screens/287920309)

### Things to watch for:
- Was the participant able to successfully begin a new claim?
- How did the participant respond to / understand eligibility information?
- How did the participant respond to the choices before applying?

## Second Task: Submitting a claim 
*remind about scenario if needed*

- What would you do here first?
- What are your thoughts on the instructions?
- *Guide through the body diagram*
  - How was it going through that process?
- What do you expect will happen next?
- How are you feeling about the process at this point?

### Things to watch for:
- How does the participant go about submitting claims for multiple conditions (submitting each condition in a separate claim vs combining conditions into a single claim)?
- How does the participant respond to the body diagram interface?


- Does the participant feel supported?


## Third Task: Additional Benefits
### Scenario: 

[direct back to additional benefit step if needed] Suppose you are looking for assistive equipment for both your home and your vehicle.

- What is this first page telling you? 
- [direct to go through the process]
- What are your thoughts at this point (download additional forms)?
- What would you do next?
### Things to watch for: 
- How does the participant respond to having to download additional forms?
- Does the participant know it's possible to save and come back (especially when having to download additional forms)?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- How do you feel after completing these steps?
- What would you expect to happen next?
- Was there anything surprising about the process?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
