# Introduction (5 mins)

Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. My name is (NAME) and I’m a researcher, I am part of a team at the VA that is trying to improve the disability benefits application so Veterans can submit claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. 

Today we're going to talk about a VA Form that will be used by Veterans claiming PTSD and related mental health conditions. We’ll be showing you some in-progress designs for this form, which we like to call a prototype. And we’ll ask you questions along the way.

*   We’ll ask you questions about your experience filling out a VA form, which could involve sharing some limited details about your own mental health or traumatic experiences. You can decide how much detail you’re comfortable sharing.
    

\[PAUSE\] Do you have any questions so far?

Now we'll talk a little about your participation:

*   This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. If you need a break at any moment, please feel free to let us know and we can pause. 
    
*   Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
    
*   I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    

*   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
*   If yes: Admit observers:
    

*   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
    
*   Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    

Now, I’ll talk a little bit about what you’ll be testing. We are looking to incorporate your feedback in work we’re doing to improve the online disability benefits form. You’ll be interacting with a prototype version of the form, and we want to hear your reactions and opinions as you go through it. In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. Just a heads up that you will be seeing some prefilled data as you interact with our demo. None of the data you see is real veteran data. Also, none of your actions during the session will affect your VA information or benefits.

\[PAUSE\] Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

➡️ Start recording.

Tip: After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

*   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

# Warm-up questions (10 min)

Before we look at the form, I have a few questions about your experience with VA disability benefits.

  

Has applied

*   According to the information I got from Perigean, you have applied for VA disability compensation before. Is that correct?
    
*   Did you apply for your disability benefits online or on paper?
    
*   Could you share a bit about your experience completing the Disability compensation application form?
    
*   What can you share about the experience providing documentation as part of that process?
    

*   How did you know what documents to provide?
    

*   What type of support or resources did you use to complete your claim — or what support do you wish you had?
    

  

Has not applied.

*   According to the information I got from Perigean, you have not applied for VA disability benefits before. Is that correct?
    
*   Can you share what you know about applying for disability compensation benefits?
    
*   Has anything in particular kept you from applying?
    

Thank you for sharing your experience.

We are now going to transition into testing a demo version of the form.

# Prototype: Screensharing (3 min)

I’m going to send you a link to the prototype in the chat and then have you share your screen. Before we do that, please take a minute to close anything you don’t want to share with us, like your personal email.

*   [Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/9idAmDRkCyDwJ7hTemJgAV/0781---Evidence-Upload?node-id=832-42129&t=QRBZPOdTinwvw0vi-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=803%3A39449&starting-point-node-id=832%3A42129)
    

Once you open the link, please share your screen. Let me know if you need help. I am more than happy to walk you through the steps you can take to share your screen:

### Screenshare instructions/troubleshooting

*   For “mobile“ participants:
    

*   Do you have an iPhone or an Android phone?
    

*   iPhone:
    

*   Go back to Zoom and then hit share
    
*   [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)
    

*   Android:
    

*   [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)
    

*   If they are a “mobile” participant but joined on their desktop (and if asking them to rejoin on their phone is too time-consuming):
    

*   Please feel free to access the link on your computer.
    

*   For “desktop” participants:
    

*   On the bottom of your Zoom screen, there should be a “Share” button in the middle (it should be in green). Please click on that.
    
*   Please make sure “Desktop” is selected/highlighted.
    
*   Please click “Share” again at the bottom.
    

*   For “tablet” participants:
    

*   Instructions should be similar to “mobile”
    
*   If you are on an iPad or Tablet, the button is hidden in the bottom of your screen. Tap anywhere on your screen, a “tool bar” will show up at the bottom of the screen, and the share button should be within the tool bar (you may need to drag the tool bar to the left to see it). should show up until you hover over them!
    

### Context setting

Now that I can see your screen, I see you have entered our prototype. It looks like the VA.gov website that you may be familiar with. We’re going to show you a few parts of the application just so you know what happens before we get to the part that we want your thoughts on. So let’s imagine you’ve logged onto [va.gov](http://va.gov) to file a claim online and you’re ready to start the application. Go ahead and click “File a disability claim online”

*   Veteran details page: You enter in some details about yourself. Normally there’s a lot more information to fill out, but for the purposes of this session, let’s fast forward to the next section. Please click continue.
    
*   Conditions: And because this is a disability compensation application, you’re going to enter conditions you’re looking to claim. Let’s say for the sake of this session, you’ve entered that you have anxiety and arthritis. Please click continue.  
    

And now, from here we’d like to go slower and get your feedback on these next pages.

# Prototype: Questions (30 min)

  

Things to watch for:

*   Time spent on content
    
*   Parts that get re-read / places where participants get tripped up
    
*   Demonstrated confusion
    

  
  

Overall Evidence Orientation

  

Okay first, we would like to ask you to read through this page and share your thoughts aloud with us as you do. This might look like, “I am seeing this box here and it is making me think X,” or "I read this paragraph and it's telling me to do Y." This might feel funny, but it is a great way for us to gather your feedback and know if this page is working as we intended.

I just want to reiterate: In this session we are testing this design, not you. We want to hear exactly what you think so please don’t worry that you are going to hurt our feelings.

# Wrap-up (10 mins)

We’re going to wrap up at this step in the process. Thanks for walking through those pages with us! We just have a few final reflection questions.

*   Did the summary screens help you reflect and confirm your choices?
    
*   Imagine a Veteran who wanted to file a claim for a mental health condition asked you about the process. If you had to describe the steps of submitting evidence to them, what would you say?
    

*   (if confused/wrong, then clarify the steps) What would have made that clearer?
    

*   Do you have any questions for me before we end the session?
    

  

# Thank you (2 mins)

(If recorded) I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable that we recorded today’s conversation. Just to remind you, we use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your feedback accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
