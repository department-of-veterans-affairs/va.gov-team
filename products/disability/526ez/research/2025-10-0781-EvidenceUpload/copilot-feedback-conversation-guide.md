I reviewed the conversation guide you pasted and compared it to what I would expect a research plan for an evidence‑upload usability study to include (goals such as assessing comprehension of instructions, success choosing/uploading documents, emotional safety for participants with PTSD, and hypotheses about users’ mental models and error patterns). I don’t have the actual Research Plan file you referenced (the message shows “[Link to Research Plan]” but no content or URL), so I’m giving two things here:

- A targeted, evidence‑based assessment of how well this conversation guide is likely to meet typical research plan goals and test common hypotheses for this flow.  
- Concrete, actionable changes and new probes/tasks you can add so the guide will reliably surface the signals you need — including accessibility, emotional/cognitive load, and mental‑model alignment checks.

If you share the exact Research Plan (or paste its goals and hypotheses), I’ll map each hypothesis directly to specific tasks/questions in the guide and produce an explicit test matrix. For now, below is a practical, prioritized review and a set of recommended edits.

Quick verdict
- Overall: The guide is a solid baseline for a 60‑minute moderated usability session of an evidence upload flow for PTSD/mental‑health claims. It covers warmups, task walkthroughs, think‑aloud prompts, and a wrapup.  
- Strengths: Clear task walkthroughs for multiple upload flows (main evidence and “other supporting docs”); emphasis on reading orientation screens; explicit prompts to explore accordions/additional info; deletion and summary checks; warmup that differentiates experienced vs. new applicants.  
- Gaps / risks: The guide does not explicitly map tasks and probes to measurable hypotheses or success criteria; it lacks trauma‑informed wording in places and explicit safety options; accessibility testing (screen readers, keyboard navigation, color/contrast) is missing; it misses many probes that uncover participants’ mental models and decision rules about what to upload; it doesn’t include post‑task objective measures (time, success/failure, error counts) or fine‑grained probes to differentiate confusion vs. preference; observer handling could be more explicit and trauma‑sensitive.

What the guide does well (specifics)
- Tests orientation content: multiple prompts ask users to read orientation and determine what they notice and expect next, which helps evaluate clarity and hierarchy of content.
- Covers upload flow interactions (add file, summary, delete) — good for interaction testing and basic error handling assessment.
- Asks about whether content helps users choose documents — a direct probe of usefulness.
- Has warmups tailored to prior experience — useful to get context and surface support needs.

High‑priority gaps and recommended adjustments (actionable)

1) Map tasks & probes to explicit hypotheses and success criteria (must do)
- Problem: No explicit mapping between tasks and the research plan’s goals/hypotheses or objective metrics (e.g., success rate, time-on-task, errors).
- Action:
  - Add a short test‑matrix in the facilitator notes: for each hypothesis, list the task(s) and the primary probe/metric.
  - Example hypotheses to include:
    - H1: Users will be able to identify the three types of evidence required for a PTSD claim without external help. Metric: % of participants who list the three types correctly within 2 minutes.
    - H2: Users will prefer in‑page guidance (accordions/tooltips) to a separate help page. Metric: preference expressed and time to first helpful click.
    - H3: Users will be confident choosing documents when examples are provided. Metric: self‑reported confidence pre/post task (+ qualitative reasons).
  - For each hypothesis add one task and one post‑task question in the script.

2) Add trauma‑informed safety language and choices (must do)
- Problem: Participants may disclose traumatic material; current script has basic consent but lacks several trauma‑informed best practices.
- Action:
  - At the top of the guide add explicit options: “You can skip any question, stop the session at any time, or take a break. If we ask about experiences that feel upsetting, please say so and we’ll pause.”
  - Add a short optional “emotional check” after the upload tasks: “This activity involved thinking about personal/traumatic experiences. How are you doing right now? Would you like to pause or stop?”
  - Clarify that the participant may turn off their camera and/or mute themselves, and remind them they can decline to answer sensitive probes.

3) Add accessibility testing probes (must do)
- Problem: No routine checks for screen reader, keyboard navigation, or mobile accessibility.
- Action (add these as optional test variants or a small 5‑minute subset):
  - Ask some participants to attempt the upload using keyboard only (for desktop) or use VoiceOver/ TalkBack if possible. Prompt: “If you use a screen reader or keyboard-only navigation, please try the upload step and tell me any issues you encounter.”
  - Ask about color, text size, and spacing: “Is there anything that would be hard to read? Would you want larger text or different contrast?”
  - For mobile: include a specific mobile‑upload task (camera vs. selecting a file) and ask about how easy it is to find and attach photos.

4) Probe for mental‑model alignment and decision rules (must do)
- Problem: The guide asks “what would you upload?” but does not dig into participants’ internal decision rules (e.g., what counts as proof, trust, source of confusion).
- Action: Add specific probes in upload pages:
  - “How do you decide whether a file is ‘evidence’ or not? Tell me the last time you’d pick document X — why?”
  - “If you had records from a private therapist, where would you expect to upload them? Which label or page would you choose?”
  - “Would you expect the system to accept scanned handwritten notes? Why/why not?”
  - Add a card‑sort style quick exercise: show 4–6 document names (treatment note, journal entry, buddy statement, police report) and ask: “Which of these belong in this evidence section vs somewhere else?”

5) Add error / edge‑case tasks (should do)
- Problem: No systematic testing of failure modes (file too large, wrong file type, upload errors, session timeouts).
- Action: Add 2 short scenarios:
  - “Try to upload a file that’s intentionally large/unsupported” (or simulate with moderator noting expectation). Probe: “What would you expect the error message to say? How would you fix this?”
  - “Simulate losing connection during upload” — ask what they expect to happen on the summary page and how to recover.

6) Add objective and post‑task metrics (should do)
- Problem: Only qualitative probes. You should capture basic usability metrics.
- Action: For each task capture: success/failure, time-on-task, number of errors, number of clarifying clicks, and subjective confidence (1–5). Add brief post‑task question: “How confident are you that you uploaded the right documents?” (Likert)

7) Refine think‑aloud & non‑leading probes (should do)
- Problem: Some probes may lead participants or ask them to predict outcomes overly specifically.
- Action:
  - Use neutral prompts: “Tell me what you’re thinking” rather than “What do you think will happen if you click yes?” → rephrase: “What do you think will happen if you click yes? Tell me why.” (keeps it exploratory).
  - Where the facilitator asks the participant to “select no” or “select yes” to move forward, note that we should randomize or counterbalance for different participants to avoid demand characteristics.

8) Strengthen wrap‑up and behavioral prediction tasks (should do)
- Problem: The wrap‑up asks “If you had to describe the steps…” which is good, but you can get richer insight with a behavioral prediction task.
- Action:
  - Add: “If a friend asked you for help uploading evidence right now, what step would you show them first?” — then ask them to walk through screen‑sharing copy of the first two steps out loud.
  - Add a final net‑promoter style question: “How likely would you be to complete this form without help?” (1–10) and “Why?”

9) Observers and consent handling (should do)
- Problem: Instructions about admitting observers are present but a bit procedural and could be reworded for participant comfort.
- Action:
  - Explicitly offer the participant the choice of observers on/off, and ensure observers remain off‑camera by default. If observers will listen, say who they are and why they’re there (briefly).
  - If participant says “no” to observers, have a script that says “I will message the observers now to leave the call” and add a short privacy reassurance.

10) Add post‑session resource and debrief script (must do)
- Problem: Working on PTSD topics, you must include supportive resources and immediate followup steps.
- Action:
  - Add a short list of support resources to read or share at the end (VA mental health contact, suicide prevention lifeline, local vet center).
  - Immediately after tasks, ask participant whether they’d like to pause or see resources.

Lower‑priority but useful items
- Include a short optional questionnaire at the end about technology comfort and prior experience with uploads (how often they use online forms), and device used today (desktop/phone/tablet + OS + browser). This helps identify device‑specific problems.
- Add a brief cognitive‑load probe: “How mentally taxing was that flow? (not at all — extremely) and where did that load come from?”
- Clarify how you’ll treat participant data: explicit mention of anonymization and whether recordings will be stored, how long, who has access.

Accessibility specifics to add to script
- Ask whether participant uses assistive tech; if yes, run a 3–5 minute accessibility check (screen reader & keyboard).
- Mention color and size: “Are the buttons large enough? Is the link contrast sufficient?”
- For instructions and scan guidance, verify plain‑language: test whether terms like “supporting documents,” “treatment records,” and “evidence” are clear — if not, propose alternative wording to test.

Emotional and cognitive load considerations
- Avoid multiple consecutive probing questions that demand recall of traumatic details. Instead, intersperse breaks and include brief “how are you doing?” checks.
- Reduce on‑screen cognitive load: test if participants get overwhelmed by repeated identical content (the guide notes the same content appears multiple places — probe whether redundancy helps or confuses).
- For participants with anxiety, add a simplified “cheat sheet” or checklist as a test condition and ask whether that would help.

Mental model alignment checks (concrete)
- Add card‑sort or ranking tasks to see how participants group document types.
- Ask “Where would you expect the site to store/view uploaded documents later?” to understand expectations of persistence, editing, and sharing with representatives.
- Probe expectations about confirmation: “After you upload, what confirmation do you expect? Email? Dashboard? Paper mail?”

Script edits (concrete suggested wording and placements)
- Before recording: add “[FACILITATOR] If at any time you feel uncomfortable, say ‘pause’ and we’ll stop. Would you like a quick reminder of resources available before we start?”  
- After upload tasks: add post‑task confidence rating: “On a scale of 1–5, how confident are you that the documents you uploaded will be accepted?”  
- After error scenarios: “What would make that error message helpful? What would you need to know to fix this?”

Test plan and analysis suggestions
- Use mixed metrics: success rate, time on task, error types, and Likert confidence/preference. Combine with qualitative themes: confusion points, unmet expectations, emotional friction.
- Code transcripts for: comprehension errors (misinterpretation of guidance), mental‑model mismatches (expectation vs reality), access issues (assistive tech or mobile), and emotional distress signals (pause requests, content avoidance).
- Pre‑register primary usability metric(s) aligned with top hypotheses (e.g., “Participants successfully upload correct evidence in ≤1 attempt in 80% of sessions”).

Example additional questions to insert (copy‑paste ready)
- Warmup, after “What type of support or resources did you use?” add: “When you were choosing which documents to upload, how did you decide what would prove your condition? Where did that idea come from?”  
- On 0781 Doc Upload orientation, add: “If you had to explain to someone what ‘treatment records’ are in one sentence, what would you say?”  
- On upload page, add: “If you only had photos of a handwritten journal, would you upload them here? Why or why not?”  
- After summary: “If you wanted to change an uploaded file later, where would you expect to do that in the site?”

Next steps I can take for you
- If you share the Research Plan (or paste the goals and hypotheses), I will:
  - Produce a one‑to‑one mapping between each hypothesis and the exact task(s) and probe(s) that should be in the guide.
  - Create an updated conversation guide snippet with the new wording integrated (I can paste the revised guide sections back into the file format you used).
  - Produce a short analysis template (spreadsheet or rubric) for coding sessions and capturing metrics.

Would you like me to:
- (A) Map the guide to your actual Research Plan (please paste or link it), or
- (B) Generate an updated conversation guide with the specific additions above integrated as an edited version of the file you provided?

Either option I’ll do next as soon as you confirm and (if option A) provide the Research Plan link or copy of the plan.
