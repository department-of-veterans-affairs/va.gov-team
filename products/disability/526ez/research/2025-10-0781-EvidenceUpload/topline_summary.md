This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. The goal of this document is:

* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings  
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data  
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## **Note to reader**

* After reaching the minimum of 7 research sessions, we added a design element to the prototype to emphasize for what conditions people would be uploading documents at each step. The initial 7 participants struggled with understanding this architecture, so we wanted to see if making it more obvious would make the workflow more or less clear and give us more nuanced insights.

* Not all participants made it through the entire prototype. In the research report, we will be counting the number of people who have certain opinions, but they will be caveated with a “out of X number of people who saw this screen”. 

## **Research goals**

* Goal 1: Gather feedback on the instructional content on each page.

* Goal 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the formatting and visual hierarchy of the information presented.

* Goal 3: Evaluate whether users are able navigate through the document upload sections.

* Goal 4: Understand how users think through uploading evidence in support of their condition(s).
 

## **Initial Findings**

### **Finding \#1**: When prompted to predict what would happen after the mental health docs overview page, most people articulated a process that accurately reflected how to upload documents (read instructions, upload docs, review docs). 
Of the 4 people who were prompted to delete a document, 3 were able to easily imagine and successfully complete the task.

* *In response to what they would expect after the mental health documents overview:* “It would give me an area where I could submit those additional documents” –P1

* *In response to how they would imagine deleting a file from the summary screen:* “Go back, hit the back button, and then delete \[the file\].” –P4

### **Finding \#2**: Most people did not understand the three overall steps of tasks (treatment record access, upload mental health docs, upload other conditions docs) that they had to complete in order to upload all of their documents in the correct places. 
A few people thought that the third step was asking them to upload "other documents" that weren't uploaded before. When we explained the differences between the sections, people wondered where they would put documents that didn't fit neatly into either of the two conditions they were tasked with having. When prompted with the idea of having just one place to upload their documents, many people preferred the simpler solution and didn’t find the separate steps particularly helpful. 

* “So you have clinical records request from the VA…then you have a second supporting documents request, and now you have another documents request. Why is… so it's like a main, an other, and an other other?” –P8

* “I was hoping that the point of this was to make things easier. And it kept asking me the same thing over and over again, which was not… helpful, I guess. I was hoping that it would be better in the streamlined process.” –P10

### **Finding \#3**: Many people found the bulleted list of document types to be helpful content. 
A few commented that it made them consider submitting document types that they hadn’t thought to submit. Still, many of them are looking for even more specific examples than the ones currently listed. 

* “I think that this is giving me the tools and the information, like, knowing specifically what to get. It's a very empowering page…I definitely could have provided some more letters that I didn't think would be necessary to send \[back when I applied\], but now I'm like, oh, wow, that would have been helpful back then. I had a lot of military notes and documentation…I didn't realize how specific I could get. I didn't know that.” –P2

* “It sums it all up, you know. All right. And it brings to mind other documents that you could \[submit\]. You're like, oh yeah, I remember….I never thought about getting my police record to document how this has affected me.” –P4

### **Finding \#4**: Many people misunderstood the “Treatment Records” page to be about uploading copies of your records, rather than giving the VA access to your medical records.

* “That's the treatment records that you just submitted. If you click yes, you're submitting those claim records. And you would submit them on \[that\] page…the next page would be to support those documents. So you would find them, and then you would click yes to continue…it would say, these are the records that you're submitting.” –P8

* “Are there any treatment records you'd like us to review to support your claim? Yes, there has to be… I think it would be more beneficial if \[the page said\] here is where \[you upload them\].” –P10

### **Finding \#5**: Many people were confused by the Other Supporting Documents upload page. At first, a few people thought they were being asked to upload the same documents again. 

* “And now it's asking me again, do you have other documents? That's crazy. So are these documents I don't categorize into the other two?” –P3

* “This is not what I was expecting for the next page, because once you've uploaded \[documents\]…you really don't want to see that again. It's like, alright, did it not work, so should I load everything else up?” –P5

## **Hypotheses (pre-synthesis conclusions)**

* Most participants will understand there are three steps: Likely not true  
* Find specific guidance for mental health helpful: Likely maybe true  
* Find summary screens helpful: Likely true  
* Understand the document descriptions, and find the external links supportive: Likely maybe true
