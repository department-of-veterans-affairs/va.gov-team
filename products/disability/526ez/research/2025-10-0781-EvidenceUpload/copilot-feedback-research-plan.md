1) Background analysis
- Problem summary
  - The product is designed to move evidence/document uploads out of the single final-step upload in the 21-526EZ flow and into a dedicated, single evidence section that prioritizes mental-health evidence first (0781 statements) and then other supporting documents.
  - The goal is to make it easier for Veterans to provide the right evidence in the right place so claims are processed correctly and to reduce user confusion and mistakes.
- Assumptions and gaps that need exploration
  - Assumes Veterans understand what counts as “mental health evidence” and can reliably identify & categorize their documents. This deserves explicit testing.
  - Assumes existing upload patterns / design patterns are adequate for the new context; the plan claims designs reuse existing patterns, but it’s not clear whether those patterns have been validated with users who have mental-health-related evidence (sensitivity, privacy, file types).
  - Assumes upload order (mental-health docs first) will be followed — needs research into whether that ordering is meaningful from the user’s perspective and if it affects completeness or accuracy.
  - Gaps: acceptance of file types/size, steps for users who only have paper or third-party records, accessibility for assistive tech, and mental-health-specific privacy concerns are not described in detail.
- Product placement on VA.gov and suitability
  - Placement: authenticated (inside 526 form flow). This is appropriate because claim filing requires sign-in and personal data. Uploading evidence as part of the form keeps the experience in-context and reduces cross-system confusion.
  - Potential concerns: authenticated placement means users who start on mobile or public machines must authenticate and may need assistance scanning/uploading; consider explicit handling and messaging for multi-device workflows (e.g., “save and continue later” or “email link to upload” patterns if allowed).
- Veteran familiarity and adoption challenges
  - The plan notes Veterans currently upload at the end of 526 — this is an iteration rather than a brand-new tool. That helps adoption, but:
    - Changing upload timing and requiring ordering (mental-health content first) may confuse repeat users who expect the old flow.
    - Veterans who filed paper claims may not know how to digitize or categorize evidence.
    - Cognitive disabilities and older users (55+) in the target recruit list suggest accessibility and cognitive-load concerns — these must be tested explicitly.
- Product brief: summarizing key takeaways from the plan
  - The plan references a superepic/product brief as “this superepic serves as our brief…”, but that link in the draft text is not a master-branch path I can verify. Based on the plan content, key takeaways are:
    - Centralize evidence uploads in a single section of the 526.
    - Prioritize mental-health evidence for 0781 opt-ins.
    - Reuse existing upload UI patterns but validate language, hierarchy, navigation, and categorization with users.
  - Action: confirm and link the superepic/product-brief file within this repo (if present) so researchers can read upstream requirements and acceptance criteria.

2) OCTO-DE priorities alignment
- Alignment
  - The research plan ties to the OCTO-DE Objective 1: improving digital experience and transaction quality — this is a direct fit. Usability of uploads impacts both satisfaction and correctness of submissions.
- Relevance of key results
  - Key Result 1 (Improve satisfaction by 5 points): the plan should include a concrete baseline or metric for “satisfaction” to measure change (e.g., SUS or a single-item satisfaction rating). Current plan lacks measurable success criteria.
  - Key Result 3 (100% transactions processed correctly or user notified): the plan can inform this by testing whether users understand required evidence and upload correctly; however the plan should include downstream measurement (e.g., error rates in processing after releases, or measuring whether uploaded docs match VA evidence expectations).
- Missed opportunities & strengthening alignment
  - Add measurable outcomes tied to these key results: collect a pre/post satisfaction metric, define success criteria for “correct uploading” (e.g., % of test participants who place key documents in the correct category).
  - Plan to instrument analytics events in the prototype/production to measure drop-off, upload failures, and error-message clarity so OCTO-DE can track the Key Result 3 in the live environment.
  - Consider adding a quantitative follow-up (e.g., moderated unmoderated test or pilot cohort + analytics) to validate processing correctness at scale.

3) Research goals and outcomes
- Clarity and focus of goals
  - Goals are well aligned to content, visual hierarchy, navigation, and user mental models for evidence. They are sensible.
  - They are largely qualitative (good for early discovery). To be stronger, make them specific and measurable where possible (example: “Goal 3: 90% of participants complete the upload flow without help” or “Goal 1: reduce comprehension questions to < X per participant”).
- Outcome evaluation
  - The stated outcome (better understanding of claimant experience and identification of usability/language issues) is appropriate.
  - Additional outcomes to consider:
    - Concrete success metrics for iterating designs (time on task, task success rate, error types).
    - Accessibility compliance checklist and needed UI fixes.
    - A prioritization memo with recommended content edits, UI tweaks, analytics events, and follow-up quantitative tests.

4) Research questions
- Alignment with goals
  - Existing questions map well to goals — they are actionable for moderated sessions and should yield qualitative insights.
  - Most questions are design/UX-focused and appropriate for a semi-structured moderated study.
- Additional questions to close gaps
  - Document- and privacy-specific:
    - Do participants have concerns about privacy when uploading mental-health documents? Are they comfortable uploading these from personal devices?
    - Where do participants store their supporting documents (phone photos, scanned PDFs, mailed records), and does that affect file format and size?
  - Accessibility & assistive-tech questions:
    - How does the upload UI behave with screen readers / keyboard-only navigation?
  - Edge cases and fallback:
    - If required document is not available, do participants know next steps? Would they prefer to note intent to provide later or upload later?
  - Upstream vs downstream:
    - Would uploading earlier vs at the end change the completeness of submissions? (test participants who are repeat filers vs new filers)

5) Hypotheses
- Clarity & relevance
  - Hypotheses are straightforward and tied to plan goals (users will understand steps, find guidance helpful, etc.). They are appropriate for qualitative validation.
- Biases and mitigation
  - Bias: hypotheses assume “most participants” will succeed — confirmation bias risk. To mitigate:
    - Use neutral, non-leading tasks and probes.
    - Recruit participants with a range of experience, including those who previously failed to complete uploads.
    - Include observers and independent note-takers to surface disconfirming evidence.
  - Bias re: “external links being supportive”: some users may not follow external links — measure actual link-click behavior and comprehension rather than assume usefulness.

6) Methodology
- Appropriateness
  - Moderated remote sessions (Zoom, screen share) with semi-structured interviews are appropriate given the design is high-fidelity but discovery-leaning. This supports deep qualitative insights about content and categorization decisions.
- Suggestions / complementary methods
  - Add an unmoderated quantitative task (or remote usability test) after changes are made to measure success rates at scale (time on task, success rates).
  - Card sorting (open or closed) to understand how participants categorize their documents; this directly informs the “How do users categorize their documents?” question.
  - Accessibility testing sessions with screen reader users and keyboard-only testers (and ideally assistive-technology specialists).
  - A short moderated session to validate privacy wording and willingness-to-upload for mental health documents.
  - Consider adding a small longitudinal component: give participants a checklist and see if they can complete and upload documents between sessions (to simulate real-world document gathering).

7) Recruitment criteria
- Review vs plan
  - The plan aims to recruit 10 Veterans, 0 caregivers/dependents, target completed sessions 7.
  - Requirement in your checklist: total requested participants must be 1.5x the ideal completed sessions. For ideal completed sessions = 7, 1.5x = 10.5. The plan requests 10 participants — this is short of 1.5x. You should request at least 11 participants (round up) to meet 1.5x.
- Calculation and fix
  - Current plan: requested total = 10; ideal completed sessions = 7 => 10 vs 10.5 required by 1.5x rule. Recommendation: increase requested participants to 11 (or 12 to be safer).
- Inclusivity and balance
  - Primary criteria are targeted (return claimants with 526 + 0781 and people who have never filed). This is good for comparing experienced vs novice mental models.
  - Potential issues:
    - Strict “no more than 3 men” gender criterion may make scheduling harder and reduce inclusivity. If the intent is to oversample women, consider phrasing as “aim for at least X women or diverse gender representation” rather than a “no more than” hard cap.
    - The plan includes many intersecting quotas (education, cognitive disability, age 55+, mental health conditions). That complexity may slow recruitment and increase screen-outs.
  - Simplify by using prioritized quotas (e.g., must-haves then “nice-to-have” buckets) and by allowing multiple criteria per participant (one person can satisfy multiple quotas).
- Recommendation
  - Increase recruitment target to 11–12.
  - Re-cast secondary quotas to be “aims” rather than hard constraints and allow flexibility. Make cognitive-disability and age quotas mandatory if accessibility is a major goal, otherwise optional.

8) Timeline feasibility
- Session scheduling math (using plan values)
  - Session length: 1 hour + 30-minute buffer = 1.5 hours per session.
  - Daily availability: 12:00–5:00 PM = 5 hours/day. With 1.5-hour blocks you can schedule up to floor(5 / 1.5) = 3 sessions/day per moderator.
  - Planned research dates: Mon–Fri (5 days) => capacity per moderator = 3 sessions/day * 5 days = 15 sessions.
- Time-slot requirement check
  - Requirement: number of available time slots must be at least 2x the total number of requested participants.
  - If you keep requested = 10 (current plan): need at least 20 slots. With current availability you only have 15 slots (per the above calculation) — that’s short.
  - If you update requested to 11 (to meet the recruitment 1.5x rule), you’d need 22 slots — even further short.
- Mitigations
  - Increase daily availability (open earlier/later) or add more days.
  - Run parallel sessions (requires additional moderators/facilitators) to multiply capacity.
  - Reduce buffer time (e.g., 20 minutes instead of 30) to fit an extra session per day, but only if moderators agree and wellbeing is preserved.
  - Allow weekend sessions or early morning slots to increase slot count.
- Risks
  - Recruiter availability, participant no-shows, and sensitive topic burdens can reduce completed sessions. Mitigate with over-recruiting, confirmation reminders, and clear mental-health supports instructions for participants.

  - Related areas worth checking (may contain relevant eFolder/evidence migration research):
    - products/eFolders_Migration (directory)
      https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/eFolders_Migration
- Notes and how they can inform the plan
  - README.md in the disability folder often contains context, prior decisions, links to prior research and product notes — useful for aligning study goals and avoiding duplicated work.
  - platform_security_questionnaire.md may surface security and data-handling constraints that affect what you can prototype and what you must disclose to participants (for example, whether PII or sensitive docs should be uploaded during a research prototype).
  - eFolders_Migration folder is worth reviewing for operational constraints and prior learnings about document ingestion, file formats, and backend handling of evidence — these findings could inform instructions you give participants and error states you test.
- Caveat
  - The products listing results can be incomplete. If you want a thorough list of prior research artifacts, do a repo search for terms like “evidence”, “eFolder”, “upload”, “0781”, “526”, and “research” inside products/ and disability/ folders. Also check Confluence or design-research trackers linked from the README if present.

General synthesis: strengths, risks, and recommendations
- Strengths
  - Strong, focused set of usability goals that map to OCTO-DE objectives.
  - Good participant targeting for high-impact user groups (repeat claimants with 0781 and new claimants).
  - Appropriate choice of moderated sessions for discovery on a sensitive topic with high context-dependence.
- Major risks
  - Recruitment math mismatch (requested participants vs 1.5x rule); and current scheduling windows don’t provide enough slots to meet the “2x slots” requirement.
  - Insufficient explicit measurement plan: goals and hypotheses are qualitative; the plan lacks measurable success criteria and baseline metrics to evaluate impact against OCTO-DE key results.
  - Potentially under-specified accessibility and privacy testing — important given mental-health content and inclusion of cognitive-disability participants.
  - Potential confirmation bias (hypotheses phrased as positive expectations).
- Actionable recommendations (prioritized)
  1. Fix recruitment numbers: increase requested participants to at least 11 (preferably 12) to meet 1.5x for 7 completed sessions. Rephrase secondary quotas as “aims”.
  2. Recalculate scheduling capacity and expand slots to ensure at least 2x the (new) requested participants. Options: add days, extend hours, reduce buffers responsibly, or add a second moderator to run parallel sessions.
  3. Add clear, measurable success criteria: e.g., task completion rate target, satisfaction baseline measure (SUS or single-item satisfaction), comprehension score, % of correct categorization.
  4. Add card sorting (or closed card-sort) to the protocol to directly test document categorization language and section names.
  5. Add dedicated accessibility sessions (screen reader and keyboard-only) and test with cognitive-disability participants against simplified instructions.
  6. Add privacy/provenance probes to measure willingness to upload mental-health documents and where users obtain those documents; adjust content/privacy messaging accordingly.
  7. Instrument analytics events (prototype or prod) for upload failures, drop-offs, back-navigation, and category-changes so post-launch you can validate Key Result 3.
  8. Mitigate bias: craft neutral tasks, use counterbalanced wording, and seek disconfirming observations during analysis.
  9. Confirm and link upstream product brief / superepic documents in the repo so research can be mapped to acceptance criteria and implementation constraints.
  10. Safety: ensure the moderator guide contains mental-health safety wording, local support referrals, and an escalation path for participants who become distressed.

If you'd like, I can:
- Draft suggested measurable success criteria and example analytics events to add to the research plan.
- Produce a short, revised recruitment table (numbers and quotas) that meets the 1.5x rule and simplifies secondary criteria.
- Draft the card-sort and an updated conversation guide items for privacy and accessibility probes.

Which of those would you like me to create next?
