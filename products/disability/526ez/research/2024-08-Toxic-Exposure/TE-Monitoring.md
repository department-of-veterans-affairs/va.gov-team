# Monitoring Toxic Exposure Release

**Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTO-DE), 526EZ, DBEX 1**

**Dates:** August-September 2024

**Product/UX:** Jared Pace [Jared.pace@agile6.com] & Evelyn Hilbrich Davis [evelyn@cityfriends.tech] 

## Background
We are monitoring the 1.0 and 1.1 release of the new Toxic Exposure feature for the 526ez, starting at 5% in late August 2024. By tracking interactions and gathering feedback, we will identify any issues with TE early so we can make data-driven improvements. 
- This report will document GA4, Data Dog, Contact Center, and Medallia survey data over the course of the release.
- We are considering adding Contact Center as a data source to capture the feedback of Veterans calling for help on TE.
- Relevant tickets: [(#90466)](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-benefits-experience-team-1-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/90466) and [(#88714)](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-benefits-experience-team-1-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/88714)

### Goals & Impact
1. Monitoring the release will help us determine if and when we need to pause the incremental release of TE. We will be looking for major technical blockers or patterns of very negative open response feedback in the data to inform our decision-making.
2. Reviewing Medallia data will help us focus our upcoming usability research on the new feature. We will leverage early findings in monitoring to shape the research plan and hypotheses. 

**Note:** We will be responsive to the release, updating our monitoring approach as we learn more/better!

## Scope of this report
This reporting will seek to keep all stakeholders informed of the rollout's progress. Beyond this documentation, DBEX Team 1 will monitor the TE release daily to identify bugs/challenges and make informed decisions about pacing the rollout. Any resulting concerns will be immediately escalated to OCTO/VBA via slack.  

## Schedule of reporting
- Success metrics from GA4 will be updated in this document at the end of each increment of the rollout, starting with 5%. 
- Medallia data will reviewed at the midpoint (around 50%) and end (100%) of the 1.0 and 1.1 rollouts. Requesting and reviewing Medallia data takes 1-3 days; delay is noted in the table below.

**As of 9/3**, we are reworking this funnel and will update it once we have more confidence in the numbers we see. 

**Alternative approaches we're considering:** Removing all steps that are not seen by all Veterans (such as claim type) or exploring other non-funnel models for understanding the data.

## Summary of Medallia survey and Contact Center data 
Before launch, we reviewed Medallia survey data **from July 1-August 9** to help set a baseline for the 526ez user experience. This 6 week period of data will appear in charts as "Pre-launch." [[See full report here.]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-08-Toxic-Exposure/2024-08-Medallia-Review.md)
  
### Guiding Questions for UX Monitoring
1. What portion of Veterans are choosing to answer the TE questions? [opt-in %]
2. When are Veterans abandoning the TE flow? Are we seeing more drop-offs than baseline at later points in the form?
3. What challenges (usability issues, bugs, general pain points) are Veterans encountering with the feature? 
4. How satisfied are Veterans with the overall performance of the feature?[Intercept and Feedback customer satisfaction]
5. What impact does the new feature have on Veteran trust in VA?
   
### Overall 526ez
All Medalia survey data is reported as a % of 4+5 answers.

## Top 5 Takeaways 
Top takeaways will come from the combined review of GA4 and Medallia each week. These insights will work to explain trends we see across qualitative and quantitative data points as they pertain to Toxic Exposure.
