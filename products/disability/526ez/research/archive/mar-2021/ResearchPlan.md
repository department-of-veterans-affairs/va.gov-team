Research Plan for a Usability test of Form 526 
=========================================================

VSA Claims & Appeals Team, Form 526, Christian Valla, March 2021.

[]()Background
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a usability test of Form 526. 

Several changes have recently been made to Form 526. A comprehensive usability test with actual veterans is therefore needed. 

Veterans with a disability and who are planning to apply for a benefit for their condition(s), can use the online version of Form 526 to apply: <https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction>. 

A part of this form is specifically about applying for disability benefits for PTSD as condition(s).

[]()Goals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   To understand the current user experience, what usability issues exist, including confusing or unclear content/copy. 

-   Is the flow easy to understand and do participants have all the info they need?

-   Do participants feel that an adequate amount of information is presented?

-   Can participants go through the flow by themselves, without blockers or problems? 

[]()Research questions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall:

-   What usability issues exist within the flow? 

-   Are participants able to successfully navigate to and through the form? What deviations exist from the anticipated happy path of the form and why?  

-   What kinds of frustrations and usability issues do participants experience throughout the flow? Do patterns exist? Why? 

-   Can participants successfully complete the flow without assistance from the moderator? 

-   Is the content and copy across Form 526 clear and concise? 

-   Is there ambiguity or confusion experienced by the participants within any of the pages within the 526 Form? 

-   Do the participants feel that they have all the information they need to complete the flow?

-   What is most helpful for the participants?

-   What is most confusing or unclear for the participants?

-   What part of the form is most frustrating or difficult for the participants to complete?

-   Are the participants uncomfortable with any questions? 

-   If you could change one thing within this experience, what would it be?

-   Why? / Tell me more?

-   Do participants feel that they are being asked about the appropriate level of detail?



Details:

-   526 intro page: Is anything here confusing or unclear for the participants? 

-   New condition page: Are users confused by anything on this page? 

-   Are they confused by the terms "disabilities" and "conditions" used throughout the form? 

-   What do users think about the link: "What if I don't see my conditions?" Is it self-explanatory? Is any info here unclear or missing?

-   Do users value the text input box? 

-   Additional benefits page: Is there any confusion around choosing the correct checkbox on this page?

-   Do the participants understand what info is required and optional to enter on these pages? 

-   Supporting evidence page: do the participants find this information easy to understand and self-explanatory? 

-   Does it make sense for participants that Contact info and bank info comes after the Summary of benefits page? 

-   Fully developed claim page: is the content on this page clear and easy to understand for participants, or is something unclear?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   We will be conducting a remote, moderated usability study with approximately 8 Veterans (separated from active duty).

-   Allowing users to interact with and walk through the 526 Form online, on their own, in their own environment, can help us detect usability issues they encounter within the form, in a test situation that is as close as possible to a real user experience.

-   We will test the online version of the 526 Form in staging: <https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction>. 

-   We will provide veterans with a fake user ID in staging.

-   We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.

-   The sessions will include a short interview (3-5 min.) about their experience with VA.gov and any other disability benefits they have applied for, or have planned to apply for. 

-   We will ask Veterans to navigate to VA.gov (a link provided in the Zoom chat) and have participants share their screen with us via Zoom.

-   We will ask the participants to go through the 526 Form from its beginning to its end. 

-   We will ask participants to speak out loud as they move through the form, and probe for usability issues and relevant feedback. 

-   Pre-test interview questions will probe past experiences to unveil contextual details absent in a test including setting (location, time, tech), key frustrations, and goals/purpose behind accessing the form historically. [Write into conversation guide]

[]()Participants and Recruitment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We would like to interview 8 participants.

-   At least 1 participant with a disability rating with a disability rating of 70% or greater and identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. 

Secondary criteria / Would like to have:
