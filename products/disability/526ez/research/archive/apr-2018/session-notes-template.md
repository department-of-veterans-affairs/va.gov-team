  - Are these the places you typically go to for information about VA benefits and services?

## First Task: Triage - 6 minutes (until :19 in)

### Scenario

Imagine you’ve been feeling like the condition you’re rated for has become more severe, and you think it’s time to update your rating at VA to account for the worsening. Show me what steps you would take on this prototype. 

### Steps

* [Homepage]? or [Apply for increase](http://e5dc56c3c6e50404e36a2e4744bc5f6b.review.vetsgov-internal/disability-benefits/526/apply-for-increase/) ?
  * What would you do first?
  * What info do you think you would need?


### Things to watch for:

- How much attention are participants paying to the subway map / other info on the page before signing in?

## Second Task: Sign In and Review Prior Claim - 8 minutes (until :27 in)

### Steps

- [Sign In] - [test users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/mvi-staging-users.csv)
  - Why do you think you're being propmted to sign in?
  - Do you have any concerns at this stage?
- [Apply page / subway map]
  - [pause] What are your thoughts here?
  - What do you think will happen next?
- [Identifying details]
  - Is this what you expected to see?
- [Special circumstances (flashes)] 
  - ​
- [Contact Details]
  - What would you do if you were moving soon?
- [Service History]
  - *can skip over it since we covered this in [VR&E January 2018 research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/education-careers/vocational-rehab/research/jan-2018)*
- [Payment method]
  - *can skip over it since we found it to be mostly successful [last round](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability/526ez/research/jan-2018)*

### Things to watch for:

- What info do participants absorb on the [apply page / subway map]? Do people apply right away or read some of the info?
- Does the participant expect that s/he can only apply for an increase if one of the special circumstances is met?
- Do participants understand how to indicate that they are moving soon?

## Third Task: Your Disabilities - 16 minutes (until :43 in)

### Scenario

Suppose that you had these conditions and in your recent doctor's visit, your doctor noted that your PTSD and your Intervertebral Disc Syndrome have both worsened.

### Steps

- [Your Disabilities] 
  - What would you do next?
    - (prompt to select both PTSD and Intervertebral Disc Syndrome if needed)

      - If it took a few weeks before you were able to complete the application, and then you completed it later, as of what date would you be able to get paid for your benefit increase?
        - *may want to revisit [Apply page / subway map]*
- [Lay Statements]
  - *can skip over it quickly since not much has changed since last round*
- [Treatment Records] (Intervertebral Disc Syndrome)
  - *additional scenario: suppose you were treated for Intervertebral Disc Syndrome by a non-VA doctor*

- [Fully Developed Claim]
  - What are your thoughts on this?
  - Any concerns about it?
  - How would you answer?
- [Review Application] - add /confirmation to the URL to get past it
  - can skip over it since we found it to be mostly successful [last round](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability/526ez/research/jan-2018)
- [Claim Received]
  - What are your thoughts on the process?
    - How did it match up with your expectations? 
    - Any concerns?
  - What would happen next?
    - What would you expect to see if you clicked "learn more about what happens after you apply"?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant only select one condition before hitting "continue"?
- Did people absorb the info about intent to file on the [apply page / subway map]?
- [Supporting Evidence - what supporting evidence do you have] - do people know they can choose more than one option?
- [Supporting Evidence - what supporting evidence do you have] - do people use the help content under "which should I choose"? Does it answer their questions?
- [About VA Medical Records] - do participants understand the implications of the options to upload or have VA get records for them?
- Do participants understand that if they leave and come back, their application would be saved? Do they understand their intent to file would be set as the date they started and they would receive pay back to it if approved?
- [Fully developed claim] - How to participants respond to the value proposition?
- [Fully developed claim] - are participants clear on what documents to submit?
- Are participants clear on what happens next after they submit? Are they satisfied with the info?
