# Notes: 526 New Claims

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me about your time in the service [1:25]
  - **served in marine corps 2001 - 2009.**
- Tell me about your experience with disability claims through the VA. 
  - **Education - post 9/11 benefits**
  - **Voc Rehab**
  - Have you ever filed for a disability claim? 
    - *If yes,* could you share your experience with filing a claim? 
      - **Yes. Disability claim and appeal**
        - **Interned at the court of Appeals for Veterans' Claims, familiar with the process**
    - *If no,* have you considered filing for a disability claim? Tell me about the process.
      - Is there anything stopping you from filing for a disability claim?

## First Task: Getting to the form 

### Scenario
[Use staging server](http://staging.vets.gov)

You have an existing rating of 20% for amputation of the little finger on your left hand and tinnitus. 

You have recently come to realize that you are suffering from PTSD related to your service. Your doctor recommended that you make a claim for this new condition, as well as a cyst in your left wrist. [4:20]

​	**Is the recommendation coming from a VA doctor? Sometimes it's easier when the records come from VA, seeing the doctor who diagnosed it and the treatment records. May help with the Fully Developed Claim options.**

​	Let's say it's from a VA doctor.

- If you wanted to file a claim for a new condition related to your service, show me how you would proceed using this site.
  - **Sign in first. Assuming I already have an account. Eventually I'll have to do it. Might as well get it over with. If I was planning on submitting a new disability benefits claim, I figure I'd have to sign in.**
  - **I'm not sure what the homepage looks like on the new thing. Would go first to Disability claims (below the heading). (scrolls down). I guess I'd go to Eligibility (reading text under eligibility), Well if I knew what I was going to do, I'd go to Start the Application Process.**
  - What would you be eligible for?
- Given this scenario, which options would you choose if you were going to apply?

***Starts Claim***
[Use prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ)

### Things to watch for:
- Was the participant able to successfully begin a new claim?
- How did the participant respond to / understand eligibility information?
- How did the participant respond to the choices before applying?

## Second Task: Submitting a claim 
*remind about scenario if needed*

- What would you do here first?
  - **(Scrolls slowly through all the text, down to "ready to apply"), Okay, there we go. Choose "I have a new or worsening condition to add to my rated disability claims", click "next". (pause) chooses both "new conditions" and "one or more of my rated disabilities have gotten worse". Yeah, because it would be a secondary claim. Is that how you guys were thinking about it? That this would be a claim secondary to the one - the amputation?**
  - Using the term secondary condition, I'm curious how common that understanding is. Sounds as though you understand the relationships pretty well.
    - **That may not be common. That's the VA's role - to determine whether it's a secondary disability when they're making a decision. I guess for most people, it would be just "new conditions"**
  - Anything this could be worded better to make it easier to understand?
    - **No. I think that it works.**
    - **Just curious if it discusses the difference between a rated disability… ones that are just service connected and doesn't have a rating and ones that do**
      - You mean one that has a rating of 0?
      - **Let me look at my thing right here. Yes, I guess it would still be rated if it's 0 %. I've got some listed that they determined were not service connected, but that's outside the scenario we're working in. I think it would be easiest to say that "I have new conditions to add to my rated disabilities"**
      - **The wording is a little funny. It sounds a bit weird for some reason.**
- **Scroll through (subway map) - (things you will need)**
- What are your thoughts on the instructions?
  - **Looking at this paragraph for additional forms for a dependent or seriously disabled child. Made me stop and think. In some cases you need additional forms. Does that link (see the list of required forms) work? Even though it says for example a dependent or disabled child, but are there other circumstances where you would need a form? I don't know what other forms I would need to submit. Seems a bit ambiguous. Something aside from the Veteran, not something directly pertaining to the Veteran based on the two examples. **
  - **Another question - that link when it would be active, would it open a new window, or would it change this entire page - would it go directly to this page? Opening a new window would be better. I really hate to go back through the process, hitting back and not knowing if everything is correct in the form. Makes me a bit nervous about knowing if everything is accurate. Having to re-type stuff is one of the things that makes me crazy.**
  - **Can't remember if VA has a list of accredited VSOs. I'd assume that's where that link (get help filing your claim) would take you. **
  - **[Scrolls through apply, va review, va decision]. Okay. [clicks start]**
  - Veteran info
    - **Would click continue**
    - If it didn't look right, what would you do?
      - **hit edit and continue**
    - You paused on military service history. anything troubling?
      - **Just thought it was weird that there was a 1 year break in service, but that's aside from everything**
    - Payment
      - **This one, I'd click to see and verify that the whole number is right. But if you've been receiving the compensation, then that should be fine.**
    - List conditions > establishing your disabilities
      - **"We're going to list any disabilities…" So is there a pre-populated list of stuff? We'll find out**
      - **New conditions, continue. **
- *Guide through the body diagram*
  - **It's like a Web MD version. Okay. [(think flashing hotspot first gave him the hint), clicked the arm, chooses the name of condition and wrist under the dropdowns], [continue]**
  - **I forgot about the PTSD for a minute, which was why I tried to continue.**
  - **I don't like clicking on the head for PTSD for some reason. So when I look at the body, the way I'm thinking about it is not mental health. So like scarring on the face, lost eye, something with teeth. maybe if you added an option like where you say "all", something like "mental health". Because when you look at the list, going through some of them, hearing loss might be something I'd think about for clicking on the head, but mental disorders, I don't know.**
  - More detail for each of the new conditions
  - Cyst or benign growth - service connected?
    - **[Chooses no - related to an amputation]**
  - PTSD > military sexual trauma
    - **Okay, additional form required. If it pops up a new window, I wouldn't be concerned. If I hit back in the browser instead of the back button on the webpage. Downloading a form and filling it out on an iPhone, I don't know how that would work. It's kind of pointless to download the form onto your phone. Is there a way to email the form? It sends a link - instead of the actual form, it sends a link to the account on file, and when you're onto a computer, you can get it and print it out. I don't think I would do this on my phone, but yeah, that would be what I'd prefer (having it sent to me by email) so I don't have to hunt with it - send me a link, and it prompts me to download.**
    - **I just find it easier - my iPhone's fine, but the browsers are… I just feel better about doing it on my computer, but I do know people who only use tablets or phones for most everything, so it makes sense to make this an option or user friendly because I could imagine the nightmare for people trying to use the normal version on a phone - it's not necessarily user friendly**
    - How do you determine what to do on a phone versus desktop?
      - **Any time I'm filling out forms like this, (I'll do it occasionally on a phone if I'm in a rush)… I use a password manager, and I don't know how well it's integrated into my phone, actually it's not - I deliberately didn't install it on my phone in case it gets stolen - don't want to have someone have access to my passwords. I have a stupid long password for the VA (for security). Whenever something has a long password, I don't do it on my phone. There was a point in time I thought one of my email accounts had been compromised. I guess out of paranoia or whatever. I studied abroad in Beijing. I got nervous about the PRC government surveilling me watching Netflix or something. **
        - Do you feel a lot of your peers think about stuff like that?
        - **People my age do. I'm in law school right now, so everyone's 10 years younger than me. They are maybe naieve about cybersecurity. **
      - **Are you working on a mobile app as well? This looks like a web browser version. I'd feel safer using an app instead of a browser. I'd only have to enter the crazy long password once, and then I could enable biometrics - the touch button thing - the thumbprint. I don't know what it's called. That would make me more likely to use it on my phone.**
      - **If you went with the app version. I have my Dropbox linked to my... just to make it so that if I have to stop, you can access things. I think through an app, you could get to Dropbox or Google Drive. **
    - Adaptive benefits - is this familiar?
      - **Yeah. I don't remember the program's name, but yeah.**
      - Do you have a sense of why we're asking if you applied for a vehicle allowance before?
        - **Yeah, if you click yes, it should prompt for - the regional office so they know to look to see why it was denied. That's what I was thinking. You'd probably need to provide a date of the decision or something along those lines. **
    - Unemployability
      - **All right**
  - How was it going through that process?
    - ​
- What do you expect will happen next?
- How are you feeling about the process at this point?

### Things to watch for:
- How does the participant go about submitting claims for multiple conditions (submitting each condition in a separate claim vs combining conditions into a single claim)?
- How does the participant respond to the body diagram interface?


- Does the participant feel supported?


## Third Task: Additional Benefits
### Scenario: 

[direct back to additional benefit step if needed] Suppose you are looking for assistive equipment for both your home and your vehicle.

- What is this first page telling you? 
- [direct to go through the process]
- What are your thoughts at this point (download additional forms)?
  - - **[Pause. reading] A pop-up to download or something to keep it on this page would be nice**
  - Exam scheduling
    - **Being a Veteran and knowing Veterans, I'd say maybe two should stand out (be bold). It says XX days (in bold). To encourage you to answer the phone.**
    - **For me, in 2010, there was a massive backlog, and they weren't making any progress on it. I submitted the thing on app. Then I got a denial letter. In the denial letter, it said they had tried to contact me several times. I never turn my phone off. Looked through my phone records. I looked through my _ on my provider. No calls on the date they said they called. I mailed in an appeal. They lost it twice. I had to get a senator involved. Stuff happens, I get it. The second time got me pretty mad. My one year window was about to close. My VSO was not doing anything. I made contact with a senator. Her staff called the VA, and a few days later. All of a sudden, my appeal that I had just sent was received, and they were calling to schedule. I felt bad because I had jumped the line, but I had to get in before I could no longer appeal. It's just what happens, I suppose. I don't think it's what happens anymore.**
- What would you expect to happen next?
  - **I think I would like a summary of everything you're submitting - review - the bio data and the claims, and if you've uploaded anything through this, show that it was uploaded. Obviously they're going to be scheduled. You had an exam for PTSD, it was? Note that they're going to be calling you. **
### Things to watch for: 
- How does the participant respond to having to download additional forms?
- Does the participant know it's possible to save and come back (especially when having to download additional forms)?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- How do you feel after completing these steps?
  - **pretty painless. The new conditions thing. The clicking on the body part was fine, but if you wanted to go straight for the dropdown menu, does it list all possible things and have them categorized by mental health or the head - if you didn't want to click on the body and scroll through to see anything, is that an option?**
  - How would you organize that?
    - **Like when you clicked on the body part - same thing, list "head", then "eye cancer, scars". Then "chest and abdomen", "arms, body", "reproductive stuff" as well. If you categorized it like that, maybe it might help.**
  - **I think some people are more… It looks like a web MD type thing, so let's see what it does, but for me, dropdown menus would be easier for me. **
- What would you expect to happen next?
- Was there anything surprising about the process?
  - **Not that I can think of. Seemed pretty straightforward. Seems a lot easier to use than the _app thing. Click something and it would take forever, might have been a server bandwidth thing**
  - **Seems like consistent usage with the VA website**
    - Do you think that consistency is valuable?
    - **I really hate when - the Marine Corps used to be really bad at this. They used to allow battalions to have different styles for their website, always hunting for different info for the unit. Someone decided this insanity has to stop, so it was less like myspace and more like facebook. Then you could find contact info wherever you needed it. **
    - **In this age of - all the hackers.. or scam artists, for me it makes me feel better when I see up in the url - just to make sure you're in the same webpage and you're not giving out personal information... from a security standpoint or just my OCD need for everything to be the same**
    - **Other than that, it looks modern and clean.**
- Any questions for me? 
  - **My initial thought was to go to ebenefits. I assume it all feeds in since this is the general VA website. The new site, the ID.gov or me, there's all this stuff that lets you do the same thing. But ebenefits is so hard to log into, so myhealthevet, you can't get a lot of the same stuff there. I can't remember. So is this tied into ebenefits?**
  - **My Ds Logon thing is a nightmare. I can never remember my password, have to reset it every time. That's where you get all your forms, employment, history.**

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes
