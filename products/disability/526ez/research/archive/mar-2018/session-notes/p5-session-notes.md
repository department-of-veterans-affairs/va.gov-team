# Notes: 526 New Claims

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me about your time in the service
  - **Medically retired from Army. Did IDES and I was medically retired, but they also processed my VA compensation at the time. didn't understand the difference or the process until right at the end. I was on a lot of medication, a lot of narcotics. I'm okay with my VA side, but there's a lot of stuff that wasn't put on my claim. I just forgot, wasn't paying attention.**
- Tell me about your experience with disability claims through the VA. 
  - Have you ever filed for a disability claim? 
    - *If yes,* could you share your experience with filing a claim? 
      - **A lady at the VA helped me. She wrote down everything she thought I needed. I told here there were a few things I don't have (dental records, didn't get time to review medical records, just went off what I could remember at the time). My records were at [Fort _ (PII) ]. I was at [Fort _ (PII)]. The records were supposed to be sent here, then they were sent back to [Fort _ (PII)]. People in the process make it difficult. They sent my stuff back, and I needed it. **
      - **Whatever I knew about VA compensation was pretty much what a lawyer was telling me and what the lady at the VA wrote down. I found out later there's a lot of stuff I could have claimed, I just never did go back. They're in my medical records (military)**
      - Have you thought about filing a supplemental claim?
        - **Yeah, I got a lot of advice from Wounded Warrior Project, Purple Heart, _ commission, a lot of them advised me not to because the VA has a tendency of (inaudible). They advised me not to, so I didn't. I got 100%, but still there's a lot of stuff that's not on there. Skin cancer, arthritis in both ankles. Some other medical issues I had, but I couldn't remember. I wasn't thinking, I was just not well.**
      - **The reason I wanted to volunter is a lot of people don't understand what VA compensation is. The military rating is different. It's different from being labeld as disabled for social security or SSI, one or the other. Very difficult learning process. You could be dealing with up to 2 or 3 different agencies. Gets confusing - which one are you dealing with? and then the records. People have a difficult time trying to get the records from DOD for the VA to recognize. They have different systems. Think they passed a law for DOD and VA to start sharing information.**
      - You're giving advice to other people?
        - **Well, I give an opinion. I don't try to tell them what to do. the lawyers, they always gave me a frame of reference. On the military side, she told me I got hurt before I got deployed to Afghanistan, and it was combat training related. It did help me on the military side to make sure it was designated that way. Helped me have part of my disability compensation be tax-free, not all of it. Lawyer helped with that. Medivac information, people I deployed with - can you write a statement on my behalf of what happened to me? that's pretty much it.**
        - **There are some people that don't want to help out, or they don't have access to resources, how to access info, proving their impairment was caused during active duty. Mine was well documented, didn't have that issue.**
    - *If no,* have you considered filing for a disability claim? Tell me about the process.
      - Is there anything stopping you from filing for a disability claim?
    - You said you went to Vets.gov recently. what were you here for?
      - **I just saw it on Facebook, and I clicked on it. I registered for it. You don't have to have a DOD login, but you do have to get authenticated. That was easier. What I liked about it is once you're authenticated, they send a code to your phone, and you use that code every time you log in.**
    - Which login option did you choose?
      - **I want to say maybe my Facebook. Oh, no, initially it was MyHealtheVet. I like MHV because you can talk to your provider or the team you're assigned to. I go there to check my medical records, not my medical records, if I have an appointment, or to refill my prescriptions, or if I need to talk to my provider. a lot of times trying to get someone at the VA on the phone is rare. I wouldn't say I get 0, I get maybe 20% response rate over the phone. If I send a secure message I get a response. Some departments are better than others. My CPAP machine broke, and I need it to breathe at night. I sent a message, and someone got back to me quickly, it works fantastic. If I need my refills redone, I can send them a message. It may take a couple of days, and they can mail it to you. That's how my primary care does it, or the VA here in [city - PII], they're pretty good. Communication. Not only that, but you can have an electronic receipt for when you contact folks, and they don't respond you have something documenting it. I get a receipt when I send a secure message. Send a message, and they send it to my primary care. 90% of the time they respond. Not the dental, for whatever reason, they never really responded. Don't think they ever responded. Every other (department), they did (respond).**
    - If you wanted to file a supplemental claim through this site, do you know how you would proceed?
      - **Not sure through this site. I started using this site a couple of months ago, so I'm kind of new. I did have an appeal because my son is intellectually disabled. When I got out, I put him down as being disabled and also going to school. They never acknowledged that until approximately 2 years. I was advised to apply for the help Vets Childs? program. I was approved, but they should have backdated it to when I got out of the military. I'm appealing. I've been out 4 years, and this process is horrible. I'm lucky I can rely on my retirement and my disability, but for other people, it can be devastating. some of them commit suicide for various reasons, aren't able to provide for themselves or their families, feel like a failure because they aren't able to get a job.**

## First Task: Getting to the form 

### Scenario
[Use staging server](http://staging.vets.gov)

You have an existing rating of 20% for amputation of the little finger on your left hand and tinnitus. 

You have recently come to realize that you are suffering from PTSD related to your service. Your doctor recommended that you make a claim for this new condition, as well as a cyst in your left wrist.

- If you wanted to file a claim for a new condition related to your service, show me how you would proceed using this site.

  - **Explore and apply for benefits > Burials, pensions, there's nothing in here to say to apply for those benefits. Maybe it's disability. Oh, here it is. I thought they'd call it "VA compensation". I know everybody addresses it as a disability, but I thought it was VA compensation. Okay, so this is it. Maybe they can put it in there - "VA compensation and disability". I know the majority of people understand it. But me, I just go off of United States Code or Code of Federal Relation or public law, whatever they consider it, that's how I understand it. **
    - How do you find out about those codes?
      - **they don't teach you that in the VA or the military. I go to forums - Veteran to Veteran information? You have people in there who are pretty knowledgeable, you have people who reference the laws or a website in there, and that's how you learn. You have to be careful, because some of the info is not peer reviewed or scholarly. You want to stick to government websites or law school or a disability lawyer. A few nonprofits, I would trust, but I just go to a government website**
        - Which nonprofits do you trust?
          - **Cornell law has a pretty good one. All of the law schools, I would trust. Online, Electronic ECFR, need to remember what the number is. GTO, governent training office, I think. I would probably go to House of Representatives or Senate - Veterans committee, doesn't hurt to go there.**

- Where would you go next?

  - **I would tell the individual to audit their medical records. Once you identify what impairment they have - people think they have something, but their medical records don't match it. you could say all day you have this impairment, but the medical records don't say that. I can understand some people may go to Web MD or something, and they're not medical doctors, that's not their profession. For someone who does spinal surgery, wouldn't go to my PA, urology, or pulmonary, I would go to neurosurgery or maybe orthopedic, but preferably neurosugery. Those are the ones who are expert. **
  - How would you begin the process here once you have those records?
    - **Then you go to a VSO, have them review it, apply on your behalf preferably. to have an organization that's already known like the paralyzed veterans of america, wounded warrior project, VFW, I forgot the other one. Legion. Old organization, can't remember what they're called. Those, they have historical, people who are certified who can submit on your behalf. **
    - Would you consider doing it yourself?
      - **Doing it yourself is historically - it's going to take longer. I talk to other individuals, and because they know the legal procedures, how to speak on your behalf. If they have a historical pattern of processing, they're going to have a historical pattern on how to apply. It takes longer to do it yourself. There's no incentive for VA to expedite your claim because there's nobody speaking on your behalf. If you have an organization that puts pressure on, I think the process would be a lot faster because of the organization representing the individual. The legal knowledge also on how to approach things. Good example: my son, it's been 4 years. I appealed the date. I have Paralyzed Veterans of America representing me. Said you should do a different method, say it was an error on the VA's end, that would take less time than an appeal. It's been 2 months, haven't heard from him, hope it will be faster. I went on this page, said it would take 7-9 months, hope it's a lot less.**
      - **I would do it like this (on vets.gov) and after that go with a VSO**
        - Submit on your own and ask the VSO to help track it?
          - **Yes, I would. For me. But for others who have never done it before, I wouldn't tell them to do it that way. I'd tell them to go through a VSO first. they can talk to the individual and help them understand better and help them process it that way.**

### Things to watch for:
- Was the participant able to successfully begin a new claim?
- How did the participant respond to / understand eligibility information?
- How did the participant respond to the choices before applying?

## Second Task: Submitting a claim 
*remind about scenario if needed*

- What would you do here first?
  - **Go into menu**
  - Doesn't work. what would you be looking for
    - **apply for compensation**
  - **Read the whole thing. Click on the stuff it tells me and click next.**
  - **Would click "new or worsening". Don't want to appeal. would just click next.**
  - **So you can either do a formâ€¦ track. but how do you apply for it? It doesn't take me to apply. Just gives me a form. I've done this track the status of your claim deal. I guess I would go to help because it's not giving me an option to apply. [didn't notice that the question went to a next step]**
  - **checked on both "new conditions" and "one has gotten worse"**
  - **It's kinda hard because it's using a phone. If it had a desktop view option, that would be great. It's hard to work with this. I've used my phone to get onto vets.gov. **
  - Something like this, you'd go to a computer?
    - **Yeah. this is difficult. You know how Google Sites has an option to go to desktop view? Yeah, I'm seeing a zoomed in portion, not everything I need to view.**
  - **Click continue on step 1. This address needs to change? no. Not sure why it keepsâ€¦ oh. Add another service period?. I press continue and it keeps taking me back to step 1. Oh, here it is. I'm finally in step 2. I'll just keep on doing that.**
  - **[tries to click on select a condition dropdown] This doesn't give me...**
  - **I like the picture. This is what I see in the doctor's office. Where does it hurt? sometimes they want you to draw on the body.**
  - **[tries to click "add another condition" first, doesn't advance]**
  - **I'd just select all because it's ptsd. It just won't. It's like I'm fighting it. (arm is selected) was looking for the cyst. Then I would click hand. It picked wrist. I don't know why.**
  - **went back to beginning. I want to add another one [tried to click "add another condition" to start]. Okay, it clicked the head. PTSD can also be TBI as well. Because if you got blown up, that's a physical. Maybe remembering that might be, you know, emotionally traumatic event. The physical part of it, might have lost a limb, get dizzy, tinnitus and what not. **
  - **You may have a couple of major impairments. You may have a secondary underneath it. Under PTSD, sleeping difficulties, breathing difficulties, may gain weight. If it's TBI, you might get tinnitus, vertigo, memory, whatever.**
  - Are you talking about other things in the list or the diagram is hard to pick?
    - **Should be an option to choose a secondary condition under PTSD. That's how they have it in eBenefits, and that's how you can claim it legally**
    - **You know, people have sleeping problems or breathing problems because of it. could be a whole bunch of secondary. the first condition could be causing order of effects. that's a military term.**
  - Which would you consider to be the secondary one?
    - **It's whatever the doctor's diagnosis gives them. The doctor says, hey, based on your other symptoms. Symptoms are secondaries. Say someone lost their arm and they still have pain in their arm even though it's gone. They may have other sec, you know, maybe they got burned. maybe they have problems perspiring and controlling their core temperature. each individual is different. there are different scenarios. each one is different.**
  - Looking for more options to describe it
    - **primary, secondary, symptoms. what are you diagnosed. sleeping disorder, tinnitus, whatever.**
  - Do you feel secondary condition is the terminology?
    - **yeah, the VA knows that. it's on their phones. **
    - Veterans?
      - **some, not the new ones. they won't know this.**
      - **They'll have a letter from their doctor telling you primary and secondary, and they try to connect it and submit it when they submit their claim**
- Step 3
  - **You gotta ask a couple of questions**
  - **Okay, I understand the form (additional form required). the VA wants a form, you give it to youru doctor and fill it out. Going to be your diagnosis from a doctor. forms or whatever.**
- Adaptive benefits
  - **that's pretty cool. sure. I'm just clicking (checking all the options)**
  - Does this look familiar
    - **Yes, I know what it's about**
  - **Need assistance at your house. Nope. None of these.**
- Unable to work - what would you expect to see if you clicked yes?
  - **the question is, to be honest, I want to click yes, I'm not able to work. and then no. It won't let me click yes. **
  - What would you expect if you clicked yes?
    - **Nothing. just click yes and move on. Some people, depending on disability, may require additional forms or whatnot. **
    - **It would be nice when you do this, like on amazon, if you could get a receipt, when you ordered it, how long it would take, exam date, approximately your review, VA conversation around this date or date range, when you apply to be approved. kind of like when you order something. It's hard to tell because I don't know the VA's schedule.**
  - Did you have to do exams?
    - **I just went to appointments. yes, for the military and the VA. I don't think the military was forthcoming at the time.**
- What are your thoughts on the instructions?
- *Guide through the body diagram*
  - How was it going through that process?
- What do you expect will happen next?
  - **Something that you completed. The VA compensation, some type of checklist on what's expected of the individual. All the forms you have to download and whatnot - all those. okay, you have scheduled. this is what you submitted. 30-60 days exams. these are the forms that need to be completed by whom - PCP or doctor or whatever. date where your next appointment is. they can do that. I doubt it. Kind of like a checklist. Not only where you can print it out, but it can be tracked. Like if you order anything it has a tracking number, and who's working on it. maybe they don't want to disclose the employee but they could put an employee number. don't have to give out their names, where they live, but everyone has a login. so if someone makes an error, this person was tracking it, because some of these people lose paperwork.**
- How are you feeling about the process at this point?
- Anything confusing?
  - **options, where you have the body. I don't know if it's going to have all the impairments on there. Will it give you the option where you can drop down and type it in rather than just the options that they're giving you? that would be it. **
  - **Desktop view option for the app. That would work a lot. **
  - **the main screen. hard to tell where to start anything. Maybe "start your VA benefits here" or something like that. **
  - **Something that looks clickable. everything looks plain. I'd just start clicking everything until I find it.**
- Questions for us?
  - **Is this primarily going to be used for like an app? that's what it looks like.**
  - **Also, is there any way to upload documents? like a file. Just where you can upload it to your phone or on the computer. also it keeps track of that document historically that you uploaded it on that day.**
    - You'd like to be able to find it again?
      - **yes, have a record of it and also be able to find it. date and time stamp also - that is important**
    - Where would you go to find something you uploaded?
      - **I have no idea. I'd start clicking everywhere.**
      - I saw you go up to sign in
        - **Is there like on the top right "my profile" / "documents i uploaded", my picture, username, password, I can change it.. "I uploaded", "I communicated". No VA employee can go in and delete it because it's archived. "I uploaded something to the VA" then "no you don't have it". I can use that as evidence that I uploaded it. It protects me saying that I did something.**
    - On the phone
      - **Menu - I can go to menu.**
      - **{PII} If it says my name**
  - Desktop view
    - **remember how we had the desktop view in the previous screen. I can see more stuff. When I want to go between multiple tasks (mousing over explore and apply / manage / request records)**
  - **I'm still trying to figure out - where do I go for my information. I don't know where I can go to see my profile. when I logged in, when I logged out, when I have an appointment. When I need to go to MHV. secure message. A one stop shop would be nice. I can still go to MHV or eBenefits or whatnot, but if you're going to get people to go to vets.gov, you're going to have people familiar with those other systems. The new guys are going to get used to this format. Guys like me, I'm going to convert, but I need to get information like how it is on MHV and eBenefits. I'm used to that format. If you can get some of those features from ebenefits onto here - the ones that work.**
  - **You can submit a claim on eBenefits. Like I said, you can have a primary and a secondary, and it submits it. It has like a tracking system. It should be like a timeline. Everything has a lifecycle. Should be some type of format. When you submit something. what phase are you at in the process. Should be a beginning, middle, and end. Should be some type of tracking. Phase 1. How many phases are there? VA conversation adjudication. why don't they just have it in there. I understand some people are going to take 1 or 2 years, but they should have it in there. Gives me a time frame of when it's going to be completed. For an appeal it says 7-9 months. for the initial claim, it should say. you submitted it, second phase _, then gathering evidence. should have dates, hard dates, when it's completed on those dates. Like on Amazon. Shipped out, tracking number, where it's at. okay, supposed to be delivered on this date. then it sends you a message saying it wasn't delivered because of weather. expect it on this new date.**
  - You said you submitted an appeal?
    - **yes, It said it would take 7-9 months. I understand there are other people in the queue. But mine's a simple one. I'm just asking to appeal the date. I have evidence already. Don't know why I had to wait so long. I had to wait 2 years just to get a response from them. It was denied. I have to write additional evidence, but golly. **
