# Notes: 526 New Claims

Participant Info

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me about your time in the service
  - **In US NAVY CBs. Started June 1966. Boot Camp, Vietnam for 8 months, came back to CA for 6 months. 1968 returned to Vietnam during Tet Offensive. Returned to CA where he was discharged**
- Tell me about your experience with disability claims through the VA. 
  - Have you ever filed for a disability claim? 
    - **100% for prostate cancer 30% ptsd, 10% ischemic heart disease, 10% tendonitis**
    - **Pending claims for Sleep apnea secondary for PTSD**
    - **Pending claim for _ sleep apnea exam. VA got something wrong, never been treated for cancer but under active _. Have a letter at the VA which they acknowledged they have but VA has not been able to respond to it. Saw that doctor submitted an erroneous report, and he had to get a letter into the VA office**
    - *If yes,* could you share your experience with filing a claim? 
      - **When he was discharged, had no experience with _. Amazed at the number of people who spend time in sick bay. When I was in, you just sucked it up, especially in Vietnam. My brother contracted prostate cancer, alerted me that I need to take a look, found out I had prostate cancer. Filed initially through state department of VA. they did a very poor job - someone there was since terminated. Since then I filed all my claims online through the VA. I've become quite proficient at it, having educated myself at how to file through the internet.**
    - *If no,* have you considered filing for a disability claim? Tell me about the process.
      - Is there anything stopping you from filing for a disability claim?

## First Task: Getting to the form 

### Scenario
[Use staging server](http://staging.vets.gov)

You have an existing rating of 20% for amputation of the little finger on your left hand and tinnitus. 

You have recently come to realize that you are suffering from PTSD related to your service. Your doctor recommended that you make a claim for this new condition, as well as a cyst in your left wrist.

- If you wanted to file a claim for a new condition related to your service, show me how you would proceed using this site.
  - **Well, I'm familiar with eBenefits. Let me see. The heading shows a military woman and says explore benefits. I would probably click on explore benefits. Okay, it popped up. I see Disability > I would go to Application Process.**
  - **I kind of know what I'm after here. We have presumptive diseases for Vietnam. Would click on "claim types". Standard Claim… I learned a lot more about that fully developed claim. I'm going to be examining the one on reopened claim one of these days. Had a claim denied for a GERD which was not service connected. Learned you have to put a stressor that occurred during combat time. don't think the va does a good job since I don't have any treatment records. Particularly because I came out of tendonitis. Went to a C&P exam, but they don't tell you you need a stressor to validate your claim. Fully developed claim - don't think a person the first time would have total knowledge about how to go about that one. At the bottom, it says New claim, secondary claim, I guess that's where the VSO comes to help you out. Unfortunately my experience with the VSO has been poor. I'm going to help a brother in law with radiation exposure on a submarine that he received in the 70s with his claim. I'd click on them and try to get going on it. Reopened claim.**
  - **Yes, that would be very helpful here because my claim was listed more than 1 year ago and I didn't appeal. Interesting when it talked about new and material evidence. I would allege that my GERD is due to a stressor factor... of combat**
  - **I would do a narrative letter explaining what I'm going to do First time I filed a claim with the VA, the person didn't know what CBs were and that offended me. Asked what boat were you on. I was never on a boat in my life in the Navy. I was in _ batallion. that was offensive. I would put my documentation ready, get it scanned and ready to load on the eBenefits website.**
  - **I would go out and go to the PDQ that was set up for the specific disability I am applying for. If required, I would get my doctor to sign the form, fill out whatever info they have. Go out to the link for the information that I'm going to the VA to get my treatment, copy and scan those and get them ready to upload to the system**
  - How would you acquire that info from your doctor?
    - **I would print out the PDQ and bring that to my doctor. It's out on the VA website. I wouldn't know offhand. I would go to va.gov to get that**
    - How might you find that PDQ here?
      - **Not sure. It's out on the VA website.**
      - Do you see a place on this site where you might be able to find that?
        - **I'm not sure that it says right here PDQ forms. No, I don't see that here.**
  - What would you be eligible for?
- [Mobile prototype for application]
  - **I'd click "start the disability compensation application"**
  - *Moderator started in the wrong place, reset to the right screen*
- On this screen, what would you do next [*disability benefits application process]*?
  - **I'd check one of those boxes right there (under "ready to apply")**
  - Pretend you have a 20% rating, partially for amputation of a small finger and also for tinnitus. Recently you realized you are suffering from PTSD, and you developed a cyst in your left wrist, common complication of an amputation.
  - **check "new or worsening condition"**
  - **clicked on "next", but nothing happened (actually went to next step, but he didn't notice)**
  - **Okay, I see new conditions, worsening, or both. I'd check both of them and click next.**
  - **I'd scroll down. It says "start the disability compensation application". Gives steps on items you should have in your hands. That #1 prepare is very good. there's no problem with that.**
  - **At this point, i would have to get my medical records - either that my private doctor has or e-health...**
  - **I probably would scroll on down here. This is very helpful about the list of forms I'll be needing. it may be the first time I'd ever heard of a VSO, so have to work on that one. This is very helpful. it gives me an order of sense on what to do to get my claim to be in a presentable format to submit. On #3 it does give me a heads-up. You might put that even though you live in [state], your claim might not be processed in the [city] office - it goes to a central clearing and then goes throughout the country due to a volumes workload.**
    - How would you use that info? would it change the way you made your claim?
      - **It wouldn't help. It may be a matter of the devil to have the file signed in [city] rather than [other state] where my brother in law's claim went through. He got an immediate reponse, and I got stuck with [city]. I'll give the VA credit. It goes into a queue and gets farmed out around the country. I've gotten letters from [state] and I know that they farm it out to areas where their workload would promote a faster turnaround time.**

***Starts Claim***
[Use prototype](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/82GKT4PWVQJ)

### Things to watch for:
- Was the participant able to successfully begin a new claim?
- How did the participant respond to / understand eligibility information?
- How did the participant respond to the choices before applying?

## Second Task: Submitting a claim 
*remind about scenario if needed*

- What would you do at this point?

  - **Now that I've been to the doctor and I have all my forms. I guess I would reopen this up again.**

  - **We need to have more info on the first screens about intent to file because that protects your date. Don't know that I saw that. You have up to one year to get your act together and file your claim. I looked into that earlier. I would have that up front. Right after "start the disability compensation process", you should have a heading about intent to file "do this now - 1,2,3" and that will protect your date.**
  - **I got all my stuff, so I'd go back here to start the disability process again, attach my stuff, and submit the file.**
  - **After you file one claim, in my experience, when you go to file another claim, much of the info will be pre-filled. One thing that's confusing - you have to tell them where your medical records are out of. Good grief, there must be 25 offices. I didn't know that my records were in [city] office. Not sure if you're familiar with that part of the screen where all the offices are listed**
  - How did you find out where your records were listed?
    - **[24:28 - start here for scrubbing PII] Through trial and error, through a FOIA request, I got my records out of [city 1], and that's how I found out where they were at. I was discharged out of *[city 2]*. I thought that's where my records were. But then they tell you they had a major fire in [city 1] and may have lost some records.**
  - **Scroll down. Veteran information. I'd complete it and hit continue and keep on going down. I'd put in my items. My SSN and date of birth and all that. (Implied he had to fill it in) Pretty straightforward.**
  - Establishing your disabilities
    - **Pretty straightforward. One thing to think about re: 10% or more. I'm rated 0% now on loss of hearing. Not sure if that item #2 is relevant. There are people that get rated 0%. I got tinnitis at 10% which is fine, but I got to a point where I needed a hearing aid, and I got rated 0 for hearing loss. That would cause me to say "wait a minute. I'm feeling my hearing is getting worse", but you're saying that I can't make a claim to raise it to 10% for instance. Any condition if you've got 0% or higher and it's gotten worse...**
  - List conditions > worsened conditions (skipped through it)
  - New conditions
    - **Is there a spot I'm supposed to put in there to claim whatever it is?**
    - **Hit continue… oh, wait, there was something saying if you need help filling out the form - who is that?**
      - It's a help desk
      - **Oh, so it's not counseling advice.**
      - **Oh, so the number 2 one - technical help. that's fine. The first one, I thought the VA should help me with what I should say in the form. the VA doesn't do that as far as I know. I want (?) counseling advice**

- What are your thoughts on the instructions?

- *Guide through the body diagram*
  - First, the cyst in the left wrist
    - **Well, when I look at the screen (pause)… Am I supposed to circle something on the wrist? I can see that. Is that a drop down box?**
    - **PTSD. What do I do - circle the whole body?**
    - **Yeah, that doesn't help me.**
    - **Under condition: is that a drop-down? Oh, so if I click - oh, so by clicking on that arm, these drop-down things come up then? [Pause] The question I would have is… Is heart / veins / arteries - is that a spin-off of my arm? I'd click cyst or benign growth. Then it fill it out. Okay. Select a location. I guess it would be another drop-down? okay, that's good. **
    - What is your next action?
      - **If I don't have any condition, I'd click continue. If I do have another condition, I'd click "add another condition"**
        - So the PTSD
        - **Right**
        - **Oh, so you're saying PTSD affects my head. Is that what you're saying there?**
        - **So anyway, I'd click on that "other condition".  After the word on Post-traumatic stress disorder, I'd put (PTSD) there. It's just a lot of long words. That's everywhere in the public eye.**
        - **I'd click continue on to the next screen**
    - Condition details > Cyst
      - **Here's where you get into that question - is it service connected? I don't think the average Veteran has the knowledge that it's really important. I think service connected - I would say when I was early on filing, that question would not have meant a lot to me. I'd say "yeah, it was service connected because it happened when I was in  the service". Is there definition put in to what that means? Maybe "please see definitions" or something like that. You should put that in or you might as well close up shop because it's not going to happen. I think there should be an asterisk saying 'please refer to service connected on page 1 of the software' or something like that. That is really critical. You need service records or service treatment records or stressors or something. It's so important - too important to be just one little thing here. the va will have issues with that later on.**
      - **Would answer yes, it's service connected. and continue**
      - Prototype is set up to be related to another condition
        - **I misread that. When it says "no it's related to another condition", are they referring to another condition for which I'm receiving benefits?**
      - PTSD
        - **Okay, that's fine - going to ask me some more questions**
        - **Hm, that's interesting (military sexual trauma or personal assault) - is that one of the major reasons it's filed? When I think of the military, I think of men, combat; this to me is geared more toward women. That wouldn't be the first question I would ask. Nevertheless, that's a legitimate question.**
      - Additional form required - how do you feel?
        - **That's fine. I'd download the form. Depending on what the form asks for, I'd download it, complete it, and upload it when I'm ready to upload my forms. **
        - **My doctor filled out a form. I scanned it using my printer/scanner combo.**
          - Was any of that hard?
          - **No, not at all**
  - How was it going through that process?

- What do you expect will happen next?

- How are you feeling about the process at this point?

### Things to watch for:
- How does the participant go about submitting claims for multiple conditions (submitting each condition in a separate claim vs combining conditions into a single claim)?
- How does the participant respond to the body diagram interface?


- Does the participant feel supported?


## Third Task: Additional Benefits
### Scenario: 

[direct back to additional benefit step if needed] Suppose you are looking for assistive equipment for both your home and your vehicle.

- **This is fine.**
- What is this first page telling you? What do you think will happen next given that you're currently at 20%?
  - **I'm thinking additional claims will increase my rating. This box would not be of value to me since I'm at 20%. It's kind of nice to have it on there for others who are 30% or more. Should be at the end of the application form though, not in the middle / body of it.**
- Adaptive benefits?
  - **Well, they're trying to be proactive in saying "do i need other adaptive benefits due to my condition?" This is a very good question. I feel good about that.**
    - Answers yes to "do you need help adapting a house or vehicle to be more accessible", reveals "I need help with a vehicle", "I need help with a home"
    - **If I answer one of those, will someone at the VA follow up? When I say that, what are you going to do about it? I'd expect a follow-up from a VA counselor saying "you checked this on the application box". Should contact me via whatever I indicated in my form - either phone or email - you tell them how you want to be contacted**
    - Have you ever applied for a vehicle allowance before?
      - **That's a good question**
    - **Either way, I know people in either cases right now with the VA. Know someone who put a wheelchair lift in his house and they're trying to adapt his car.**
    - Ability to work
      - **I'm 70 years old, and I don't work anymore. How do I answer that when I'm 70? That's a legitimate question, but I don't know how to handle it when I'm retired. It's a legitimate question if someone is employable and in the normal work age.** 
- [direct to go through the process]
- What are your thoughts at this point (download additional forms)?
  - **That's fine. Get these and put it in with your application.**
  - **When I said someone should call you. Well, here we're going to have you get the form and submit the form. There was another question about do you need help adapting your house or car, then you scroll down. i'm getting ahead of myself because there's another form below. Maybe there should be something saying "complete form below". **
- Exam scheduling
  - **When it says the appropriate exams, is that referring to C&P? It has to be C&P, right? **
    - Is that C&P terminology helpful?
    - **Yes**
  - **I'm going through a C&P exam right now. FedEx just dropped off a form from the outside vendor. I was going to do a C&P exam in _ which was north of hear. When you get a call, it comes in from 866 whatever. You get so many of these calls, you don't know who it is from a lump of coal. I saved their number so I identify them now. I have a problem because I have a dental appointment that day in _. I'll see if I can get another date - or someone on the phone said they can just cancel it, but [that's not what I want]…**
  - **First of all, the call did come in. I didn't take the call, so it says "call back". so I call back, they identify themselves as LHI. You have to punch in the numbers and then they can't identify you. Thankfullly my cell phone had a charge on it. The latest one is it came in and I took the call. I had 2. one for PTSD C&P, the second one is for a pulmonary test for C&P. They said okay, here is your date. but I couldn't make it. She said okay we will call them and if you can't get something set up for the VA we'll tell them you aren't going to do it. I said, wait a minute. I don't want that. Then they said they'll send you a FedEx letter. They have to use that wand thing and go across the bar code and they can only deliver it if you're there to accept it. How do I know when FedEx is going to come to my house?**
  - Did you have some warning that FedEx was coming today?
    - **I confirmed with her late monday afternoon. Then I figured they got the order out yesterday, so I was looking for FedEx today. (wed) . Then I said, why do we have to do the FedEx thing? Can't you just ask me on the phone if I can make it at the given time?**
    - They didn't give a date or time to expect FedEx.
  - **When you first submit your claim, you get a letter acknowledging your claim. You expect some kind of follow up…. Notify you by mail, it's FedEx, so that's okay**
- What would you do next?
### Things to watch for: 
- How does the participant respond to having to download additional forms?
- Does the participant know it's possible to save and come back (especially when having to download additional forms)?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- How do you feel after completing these steps?
- What would you expect to happen next?
- Was there anything surprising about the process?
- Any questions for me? 
- **I don't have any beef with the VA, but when you call the EBenefits people, their hands are tied, and they can't say some things. They have the same canned speech.**
- **when I look at the site, it says you're trying to assist the Veteran. And it seems you're really trying to do that.**

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

- Gift card preference?
  - **Amazon**
- Willing to share recruiting blurb via email?
  - **Sure. Just don't FedEx it.**
