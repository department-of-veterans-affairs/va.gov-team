An initial set of tags to use for [the project in Reframer](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/a/adhoc/reframer/projects/3b36f8f4-429f-4e24-a59c-b40d73abbc25) so that we can have consistency and gather themes. If you come up with a need for a tag that's not included here, please feel free add it to Reframer. It's helpful to include a description for new tags (use the description field in Reframer) so that others know what they mean and can use them in the same way.

# [Research Project Goal](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/issues/9201) Tags

1. Getting to the form - **tag: getting_to_the_form**
   1. Can Veterans get to the form easily? - **Tag: findability**
   2. Do they understand what type of claim to make? - **Tag: claim_type**
   3. Do they understand what happens next? - **Tag: what_happens_next**
2. Adding new conditions - **tag: new_conditions**
   1. Is the New conditions / worsening conditions distinction clear? - **Tag: new_conditions_distinction**
   2. Does the `body system` mechanic make sense? - **Tag: body_system**
3. Additional Forms - **tag: additional_forms**
   1. Is it clear which additional forms should be submitted? - **tag: which_forms_should_be_submitted**
   2. Is it clear what is involved? - **tag: expectations**
4. Supporting Evidence - **tag: supporting_evidence**
   1. Does this flow still work when dealing with both new conditions and increase? - **tag: new_and_worsened_conditions**

## "Painpoint", "neutral", "success"

1. Use these tags to indicate whether an observation indicates a problem or a successful outcome. It's possible to combine them with each other, and we should combine them with other tags when possible to indicate the topic covered. For example, if a user had a problem with supporting documents, use both the tags "painpoint" and "supportingdocuments". 
2. It is also possible for a single observation to be both a painpoint and success if it is successful in some way but also a painpoint in another sense. In that case, use both the "painpoint" and "success" tags



# Other Tags

1. **usefulness** - a finding indicating whether some functionality is useful to the user, as opposed to whether it is usable
2. **background** - a noteworthy finding about a participant's background (don't need to list every participant's background here - that's what verbatim notes are for)
3. **overall** - finding about the process as a whole
4. **quote** - Doesn't mean anything to us. Reframer will automatically add this any time you put in an observation with quotation marks. Don't worry about deleting each instance of this tag - we can easily bulk-delete them at the project level at the end.
5. **researchprocess** - a meta-tag. Ways we can improve our research process for next time
6. **shareout** - a finding worth sharing outside of this research project - something that impacts other projects or the roadmap
