When talking with Bill (NSO), he explained the three conditions that must be in place for a PSTD claim to be approved (0781 or 0781a). These are similar to the three required conditions for any claim, but there is potentially more flexibility with these conditions.
The three factors are:
 - Current diagnosis for a condition that is disabiling (Confirmed diagnosis of PTSD)
 - Verifiable stressor that occurred during active duty
 - Doctor's opinion that the disabling condition is a result of the verifiable stressor
 
 The verifiable stressor can be identified through a DD214 if there is combat award associated. Also may need to fill out 0781 or 0781a form to document the event that occurred. It is important to have the veteran accurately identify the date of the stressor event, as the information will be sent to the Joint Services Records Research Center for verification of the stressor statement. If the date of the stressor event provided on the form is more than 30 days from the date the JSRRC determines an event occurred (either before or after the the date), the JSRRC will deny that there was an event.
 
 As it relates to PTSD assault (0781a), the VA may ask for personnel records to look for evidence of a drastic change in behavior after the date of the event, and this can trigger an exam; laws allow for diagnosis of condition and the doc believes it is service connected but if the event canâ€™t be disproved, the claim should be granted. This is different from other claims.
