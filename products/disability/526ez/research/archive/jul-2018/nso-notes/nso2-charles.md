### Questions

**What do you wish veterans knew that they don’t seem to know?**
When we talk to veterans and inform them about what VA will look for:
 - a diagnosed condition 
- In service treatment showing in their medical records OR a doctor’s opinion

**When are exams denied?**
If they weren’t treated in service, they’ll deny a claim just based on that. If they say they receive treatment at a 

If they identify any records, if they weren’t treated in service but treated afterwards 

**What is the most difficult part of helping the veterans with their claims?**
Explaining the reasons and basis for denials

**What’s the biggest mistake veterans make when submitting their claim?**
Filing for individual unemployability and not understanding how IU works
If veteran is unable to work due to service-connected conditions, VA could keep his percentage and get paid at 100% because they can’t work

Only 70% for mental health and files for IU b/c he can’t work due to PTSD, so VA has to set him up for PTSD exam, so veteran goes and doesn’t report or it doesn’t come out in their favor, then VA has to make a decision which results in reduction

Understanding the percentage requirements 
IU - requires combined 70% (with one being 40%) or one at 60%

On the IU application you’re really asking for a claim for increase


**What’s the one thing that eBenefits could do better?**
eBEN doesn’t provide a more current update to where their claim is in the process. Also doesn’t track the appeals process very well.

**What is your understanding of the Appeals process?**
File a claim, VA makes a decision, you have one year to appeal. If veteran can gather new evidence to ask for a reconsideration. This only works if veteran new and material evidence. So if veteran gets denied, we would file a reconsideration before filing an appeal. 

Appeals (traditional and DRO)
DRO Review - VSOs only do this kind; File Disagreement along with New Evidence, they can select what type of review they would get it reviewed by a DRO

Traditional Appeal - claims file goes back to the same person that just denied it

**Why would someone file for a traditional appeal?**
I have no idea
