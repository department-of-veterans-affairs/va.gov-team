VBMS Legacy Systems - In VBMS if you don’t have POA they can see the VA File (can check to see if one exists),  find Payment History (if VSO has POA), can find out who the POA is if they are not the POA to properly redirect the veteran

### What qualifies a claim for DRC?
 - service-connected disability
- ITF date plus a statement on 4138

I don’t mind doing DRC. It’s the way they do it that increases the VSO workload that’s the problem.
They have to scan docs and do mail portal uploads, which sends things to DRC. It would be more helpful if there DRC could be established in 1 or 2 button clicks. Death benefit claims are fine because they’re automatically DRC.
