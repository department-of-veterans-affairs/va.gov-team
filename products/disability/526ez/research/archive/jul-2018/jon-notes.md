# Findings from Jon

- Claims fall under the following 3 categories. if they are not labeled and organized into these groups, it will confuse veterans and POAs:
  - pending
  - service connected
  - not service connected
- disabilities should be listed in order from highest to lowest %. this helps the VA/VSO when reviewing disability lists for a veteran as well as calculating total disability %
- last date of treatment on SSCI form: recommend being more specific, possible options:
  - use today's date
  - add box for "currently being treated for this condition" (like LinkedIn's current position)
- SEP's maximum file size is 25 MB
  - this isn't typically a problem for most cases
  - worst case scenario: there is a case at HQ with 2 reams (1000 sheets) of 2-sided paper that they have to upload--this is rare!
  - If there are files or multiple files amounting to more than 25 MB, they bundle files and upload batches, not a big deal. 
- File types:
  - typically PDFs, but sometimes JPGs or PNGs
  - exam/lab reports are preferred, never need MRI/X-Ray, but veterans do submit these. 
    - *should add content to specify what types of documents are useful for claims
    
### Dimensions360 - 
Different from SEP in that:
- Direct Mail; Direct upload not POA specific.
- does not speak directly to VBMS or create forms; 
- everything gets date stamped and is not limiting; still restricted inside VA network; 
- goes to Jainesville for processing by contractor after getting picked up from a shared server

Step 1 - veteran info

Step 2 - Personal Flashes

Step 3 - File attachment

Returns confirmation number
Effective dates protected 
Can see loaded docs
Latency - 1 week before it can be seen in VBMS


### SEP - 
- is POA specific, speaks directly to VBMS and creates forms; 
- outside of VA network, good for dependency claims but process is lengthy; 
- because itâ€™s external it has SSO issue and speed variance/reliability issue

Step 1: have to do a search for veteran, 15 pgs or so before you get final confirmation
Sets up EP code and contentions list in VBMS automatically (uploads go into NWQ to get picked up by VSR)
