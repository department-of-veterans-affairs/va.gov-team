# Self Service Claim for Increase, 7-14-2018, Fred

- DAV member, represented by DAV
- came into DAV claim clinic to submit a PTSD claim for increase
- Assisted by Michael 

## User Interview Notes

- Asked if he would be interested in testing new tool for Vets.gov
  - never heard about Vets.gov
  - as long as it would not interfere with or impact his claims for increase submitted by DAV he would be interested in participating in user research
- "I dont go online to use the VA."
  - Why?: I don't find the VA helpful. 
  - Uses online banking and email
  - Doesn't view the VA as an online business, doesn't trust that the VA will keep his information safe
  - Thinks that his information is likely going to fall into the wrong hands if its put into the VA digitally and then will be used for something other than helping veterans

- "I would bag it." doesn't have records on hand. would five up/wouldn't bother at this point, assumes friends would too. 

![step 3: va review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/jul-2018/participant-notes/526-3-va-review.png)

- called 99 days a misnomer. " if it wasn't for the DAV helping me i'd still be trying to fill out forms"



- assumes it would take it more like 50-60 minutes, acknowledges that it takes him longer to fill out online forms

- tried logging in with DS logong because assumed it's the easiest option
  - Asked why he selected this method for signing in: didn't know what DS logon or any of the other options actually were, but chose this one becuase assumed it was the easiest
- wife manages all of their accounts, very frustrated with accountc reation/email checking
- feels better about identity protection
  - "this is a redundant sustem"
- page reloads after account creation to start application, doesn't notice anything new on the page. 
  - **design observation:** verify identity button is undetectable to user
- doesn't like the idea of using drivers license for identity verification because concern over identity protection, but is comfortable with manually entering in personal information and verifying personal information. 
- repeatedly clicks "disability beneifts" link in footer and breadcrumbs
  - **design observation:** when data is loading, user loses place on page because page jumps below navigation and breadcrumbs to main content area. this confuses this user and causes wayfinding problems. 
- when asked to start application, scrolls to loading, got distracted and clicked link to "disability benefits" in footer. went back and had to restart application again, saw infor retreiving
