# Claim Assistance: New Claim, 7/15/2018 Stanley

- assisted by Chris

- Navy

- VA told records were destroyed in a fire in 1973, which was when he was active duty. this is impossible, also that was Army records, he was in the Navy

- submitted ITF and POA through DAV last August, probbaly submitted because made DAV POA. 

  - no background in DAV system why ITF was submitted. Chris said most likely just submitted to start the process when DAV became POA. 
  - DAV doesn't have any information in the system about why they submitted ITF or for what condition it pertains to

- Chris walks through 526EZ, doesn't fill out the form with them. Explains how to fill out the list of disabilities and the steps that will follow. 

  - Stanley and his wife seemed a little confused by the form and what to put down for each part
  - wife will fill out form for Stanley
  - Chris said that if Stanley didn't have someone to help him, had more physical impairments, or had more servere/difficult conditions he would have helped fill out the form with him today. It's not part of *his* process to complete a 526EZ with a veteran, unless they really seem like they need the assistance. In this situation, he seemed like he could handle it with the help of his wife. 

- wife asked about caregiver benefits, heard from word of mouth that she could get $1600 per month 

  - 10-10CG - administered through the hospital
