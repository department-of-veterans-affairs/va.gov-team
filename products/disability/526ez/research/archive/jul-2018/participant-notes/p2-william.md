## NSO Claims Review with Vietnam Veteran

NSO: Does DAV represent you with claims?

Yes, my latest claim was for hypertension. I didn’t bring any pprwork because I didn’t plan to do this. I submitted claims 4 years ago and they all got denied and I didn’t follow up with the appeals process and they expired.

NSO: The hypertension got denied because they haven’t determined that there’s a connection between herbicide exposure and hypertension.

Service agent told me to put in for hypertension. The letter I got said I needed to get an outside doctor to make a determination if I wanted to pursue this claim. I have tinnitus and I thought it was cause by hypertension. They denied tinnitus and also put in a claim for liver damage. Had hepatitis in Vietnam from eating tainted food.

NSO: Let’s see why they denied tinnitus
I tried to submit pics and all the planes and service officer said they didn’t want those.
Hearing exams showed 100% hearing in both ears. 

Was in a college study for tinnitus but my problem is if I can see you, that’s when I can understand what you’re saying. Have had tinnitus since 1975. 

NSO: You’re not helping yourself. That’s where you made a mistake. Hypertension is not service-connected so tinnitus secondary to hypertension would not be service connected.

How did you submit claims in the past?
I did it on my own with the help of a service officer with VFW. 

Lost end of finger from splinter in a ___ pit, no feeling in finger. That was rated a 0%

Submitted claims, got denied, missed the appeals window (past 1 yr), 

NSO: [Found active ITF, printed 781 and 526-EZ, advised veteran to resubmit for:
Bilateral Hearing loss
Rt Hip replacement
Heart attack
PTSD
Tinnitus
Because he felt their might be sufficient evidence for benefits to be granted but that the appropriate evidence may not have been submitted.]
