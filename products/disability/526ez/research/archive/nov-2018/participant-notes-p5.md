##### What's your service background? Which branch and when? And if you've interacted with the VA and used disability claims or education benefits?
USAF from '87 to '94 and then Air Guard somewhere around 2000. I have major depressive disorder. We ddin't know what it was I was dealing with depression I was sick. Someone said you're a vet. Go to the VA Clinic. Then I found out if it was something in my medical records I might have a claim. I  never thought anything about it and moved. I later filed a claim and they said I didnt have enough medical evidence because of not having a doctor for the last 10 or 15 yrs. So I had to start at ground zero. I did the first and second myself. I got one turned down one approved at 10%. They couldn't deny it, but there wasn't enough evidence to support a better rating. I've had to go back several times filing claims throughout the years and now I've got 100%.

#### Rated Disabilities
What do you think would happen if you select these?
Just looking at the ratings so there's no use having a box for 100%. But if you're claiming Allergies or Sarcoma I'd say click both of those if you're claiming for an increase.

##### Is "increase" language you've heard before?
Yea, because I've had to do increase multiple times.

#### New Disabilities
This makes sense because we don't know a lot of the medical names for condition. So if you didn't know you had cancer, elbow pain increasing or whatever.

#### Service-Connection Details
Do you have any questions about these options? How can we improve this screen?
The easiest one is if there's a military injury, you started with that one first and that's where most of the conditions come from. [Secondary bullet] self-explanatory because you have an example. [Pre-existing] that'll put people on defense. They'll worry VA is going to look for a reason to turn it down. I didn't realize I was depressed when I was younger and then I went to the military and the military excerbated it and I started seeing a shrink when I was in the military. So that one people will think I won't get any help.

##### Do you think that we can change that perception by how we present this? What advice do you have about that one?
Well the word 'but' shouldn't be in there. Should be 'however'. Change the harshness of it "I love you, but..."
[VA Care bullet] Sounds self-explanatory. I never knew that could happen but I guess anything could happen b/c I had Stage 4 cance earlier this year and the VA didn't cause that but if they went in and took the cancer out of my liver. I could see like in my case with colon cancer, let's say they cut too much, didn't cut enough. I don't know how that'd work but that's interesting, I like that bc accidents/complications can always happen.

##### Is there something that we should change about the way this is presented to make it more presentable.
No because your asking "Please briefly describe..." so like with my cancer they're still trying to link asbestos to colon cancer. So just working in building and tore it down without apparatus so it's self-explanatory. I'm a little more analytical than probably most of your vets. So you just fill it out.

#### Retirement Pay
I agree. Why would you want to pay taxes when you can be getting VA compensation and pay no taxes. That just makes sense. Very simply. I want my VA compensation and pay less taxes.

#### Separation/Severance Pay
Are these terms you hear/are familiar in the real world?
In the real world you hear this all the time. You hear all the time about severance packages on the news. Assuming you have a house and access to media. If you're in the military you know about separation pay.

#### Training Pay
Some people would be asking what's the difference since you're not going into whether training pay gets taxed. You're saying if you're eligible for training and VA you need to decide which one you want, you can get the VA conmp pay for the same days as training but if you want to keep your training pay you need to waive. What's the difference? You're not giving me enough information to make an informed decision.

#### v2 Add New

Some people I'm gonna guess aren't comfortable with typing up a description over answering questions. Questions are easy. Not everyone is going to be able to type the full description they need to and that would affect the level of understanding. It may lengthen things. So just answering questions is probably the easiest.

##### How do you feel about the 'best match' question? Is there a better way we could phrase that?
Maybe put in best match 'area'. Just change one word. So if you go area, you're not listing elbow but it's the area.

##### What would you do with the text box?
Some would put "it hurts", some might put "aching". If you say shorter is better you might get a one word answer which might not give you the full picture.

Since I deal with depression I'm kind of in that [PTSD] area. Instead of trying to relive everything b/c there's no way to do a brief description I'd probably go with answer some questions.

##### Do you have any overall thoughts?
I know they just opened up agent orange within the last year or two. Those are going to be older folks, frailer, and it needs to be as easy as possible or they're going to need to have a representative every time. Give them more choices that might match their situation but don't inundate them with too much. Like the mouth, neck throat. Make it simple like that the whole way through.

##### [v2] steps to narrow it down, did that feel like the right level of detail?
That is a good level I think, because if they don't know what they're mouth, neck, throat they need assistance and somebody watching out for them anyway.

##### Any other thoughts about the overall process?
No I appreciate the fact that you're trying to make it easier for veterans and trying to make the process as easy as possible. It needs to be that way it can maybe speed up the process instead of getting bogged down by "you didn't tell us this". Maybe just some chart system. I think that's the easiest because not every vet is going to be at the same level.

#### Key Takeaways
- provide an example for training pay to make it more clear. "In general training pay is going to be more than your compensation pay for any given day."
- v2: change "Which seems like the best match?" options to add "area"
- pre-existing bullet on service connection will put people on the defensive, change the word but to however
