# 526 Add New Condition Conversation Guide

Thank you for joining us!

- We're going to take about an hour, but you can leave at any time
- Some of my colleagues may join us to help take notes
- Were you able to download the GTM software?
- There are no wrong answers, we are testing the software, not you. We want to find out things that arenâ€™t working before we release this stuff into the wild.
- We're going to be looking at some work in progress software. Some stuff may be broken, I'm happy to explain or help skip to the next part, but I'd love to hear your reactions whenever you come to something that seems weird or wrong.
- We'll be using some specific disabilities in this session. 
  - PTSD
  - Tumor in elbow
  - After effects of Frostbite
  - If you are uncomfortable with any of them we can skip right over.
- I'd like to record the session for notes, if that's ok?



## Warm-up

- Do you mind telling me a few sentences about your service background and interactions with VA?



## Staging form

- Skip through the opening screens (should be pre-filled)
- Can you try to add a new condition here, and think out loud as you go through the process?
  - Please try to add PTSD
  - Please try to add a tumor in your left elbow
  - Please try to add numbness in your feet from frostbite
- Skip ahead to waivers



## Prototype

We're going to look at a different way to do the same task you just did.

- Try both paths
  - Text entry
  - Answering questions
    - Please try to add PTSD
    - Please try to add a tumor in your left elbow
    - Please try to add numbness in your feet from frostbite
