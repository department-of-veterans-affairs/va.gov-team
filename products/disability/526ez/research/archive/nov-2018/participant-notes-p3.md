##### What's your service background?
I spent 20 yrs in the Marine Corps, served in Vietnam, then I retired.


##### Have you worked with the VA?
I have. I've filed a claim 8 or 9 years ago.

##### Have you used any other VA Benefits?
I've used the home loan. I've used Education. All that's been 20 years ago. I use the dental service.

##### Do you use the healthcare?
I have.

In all honesty I had a VSO fill out my initial application for disability.

#### Disabilities Screen

#### Rated Disabilities
What does this look like?
Looks like its listing my disabilities with the VA. The ones that I've filed for. Please choose one if you want to raise your rating I guess. Filing claim for increase -- this makes sense.  

Is that something you knew before today or were you reading the context?
I'm just reading and figuring it out. I've never filed a claim online. Sounds right to me. 

#### Add new Condition
Test cases:
PTSD
Tumor in Elbow
Frostbite in Foot

[Free texted "frostbite on toes"] There's no button to push now that I have that in there. [Hit 'Enter' and it changed to "loose teeth"]. Corrected and selected "Enter" nothing happened.

If you were adding more than one thing, how would you handle that?
I would `Add Another Disability`.

#### Service-Connection Details
I would go through, pretty straightforward. They want to know at the bottom -- do they want you to talk about both of your disabilities? I've got two items would I put both in there? I would guess both since they didn't say each one. My frostbite and PTSD. [Typed: While at the Chosin Resevoir in North Korea, came under heavy fire and the tep was -25F]

#### Retirement Pay

I want to get VA Compensation pay because it's not taxable [selected "I don't want to get VA Compensation pay"].

##### Did you know that or did you extract it from this page?
Both I read this paragraph and then I knew it anyway?

##### Is there anything you would change to make this more clear?
It's pretty clear. It makes a point of saying dollar for dollar you're not losing or gaining any money other than the tax benefit.

#### Separation/Training Pay
Separation - that kind of makes sense except I'm not familiar with those programs. I'm not familiar with VSI. I didn't know they paid you to get out. I was in financial acctg in payroll, we paid all money  due at separation but we didn't pay separation pay.

Training - I want to get VA Compensation pay because it's non-taxable. Seems pretty clear. One or the other, you  can't have both. I was a couple years in the reserves, that makes sense.

#### v2 Add New Contention

I'd pick answer questions, it's probably easier.

##### What about  that sounds easier?
If they ask the questions they'll get exactly what they want but if I type it myself I won't explain it well enough.


##### [Describe new condition] What would you expect to happen here?
I guess I'd put tumor in there.

##### What  would you expect when you're typing? If you were entering frostbite what would you say here?
I'd say my toes have turned black. But I would right that (ringing in my ears) for my  hearing.

##### Is it too many questions?
No it's pretty good, it gets right down to being specific. That's what I was saying early. If you write your own description, you might not think to put in left or right. If I did it the other way, they would come back with questions. Is it your left or your right?

##### Do you have any overall feedback or thoughts?
No, it looked pretty self-explanatory. I don't think I'd have any problem navigating it. I thought it was pretty simple. I'm 72 years old. When it said describe your condition where sounded like one time -- do they want one or all. 
Other than that I thought it was pretty. I'm 72 years old, if I can follow it, heck anybody can follow it. 

##### Do you have any questions for us?
No, everything was smooth.

#### Key Takeaways for Consideration:
Add New Contentions 
- Enter doesn't work, there is no save button
Service Connection
- make it more clear what condition is being looped through
