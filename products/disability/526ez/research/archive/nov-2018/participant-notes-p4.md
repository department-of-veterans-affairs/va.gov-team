##### Could you share about your service background and if you've interacted with the VA?
I served in the Marine Corps 84-88. I currently receive compensation for knee injury I sustained in the Marine Corp, 10% disability. I also have 0% for hearing. I receive hearing aid through the VA.

I've gone back for my knee three times because it's caused me problems. Either the evaluator said no you're not missing work, we're not chaning your rating or the doctor saisd there's nothing I can due for you, you have arthritis, which he admits is from damage. So roadbloacks along the way. For hearing, I did have a VA doctor ask me why I have a hearing aid but no rating.

#### Rated Disabilities
This would be if my disabilities and rating and so forth. So that would make sense. Right knee, ACL would be 10%. Ol so that's helpful to know.

#### New Disabilities
I'm gonna say yes. My job I would hit 'Finish Application later' because I"m constantly interrupted with things so that's helpful to have along the way.

I can imagine PTSD is pretty common. 

#### Service-Connection Details
I'm going to click [secondary] to see where that one goes.
Just reading through this [PTSD intro] and fortunately I don't deal with PTSD but I see that Crisis number since in my job I do deal with crisis. It's important to have that number and text. I don't text but I know a lot of people do.

##### Are there any things about that [PTSD] page we could improve? That covers the three main, computer phone and text. I'm hearing impaired but hearing aid takes care of that. A TTY number might be helpful. Sometimes phone calls are difficult it's hard to understand some words without additional cues.

I would call it Non-Combat. My PTSD comes from training. I don't wake up with night screams anymore but I did for a while.

#### PTSD - Upload or Answer Questions
Is there anythign we can do to improve this screen?
I don't know that talking to someone directly would be of value or not but that's the only thing I think might be more beneficial or a chat.

Have you encountered questions about retirement pay before?
No but I did get severance pay and they included my vacation pay in that then I had to pay that back even though I earned it separate from disability, I had to pay it back before I started to receive my disability payment.

#### Retirement Pay
[Selects I want to rcei]
I currently receive disability payment and I don't pay taxes on it. But as I get closer to retirement, it could make a difference and put me in a different bracket. If I did take it in retirement I would also be paying taxes so it's kind of like a double tax. Pretty clear graphic. It makes sense if you want to have more benefit, the compensation pay is the better way to go.

##### Do you feel like people to tend to understand that?
It's not something we talked about in SEPs? at all. When I talked to my VA rep she handled everything so there wasn't a question I dealt with and that's been 22 years ago. It was not something that was offered at that point and for guys taht I know it's not really a conversation idea that we talk about. But it seems clear here and is presented in a way that's logical.

#### Separation/Training Pay
Does this reflect your experience? 
Yeah and I was not aware of it at the time and it was rather frustrating. In this statement it says you may have to pay it back which meant it would delay my payments longer. It would be good to know at the time of separation. It's important to know here because there will be a delay?

##### Would you do anything differently at separation knowing what you know now? 
I would have taken the vacation time before I got out. I would have taken leave time set up my new home, come back and done the discharge, received the full benefit vs not knowing I was going to be "penalized" because I took it as it came without question and it delayed my benefits. I would have certainly enjoyed that vacation time that I could have enjoyed with family and still gotten paid. It would have made the transition easier. I could have set up electricity and phone or a rental in my new home. I could have done all that or at least started that process. As it is, we left on SEP stay and I had whatever possessions I had in my car, everything else was shipped to  an offsite storage facility b/c I had no place to send it to and it was 6 months before I received my belongings because it took that long to find a viable place to live. It  might have speeded that, had I not had to work and do all that at the same time. If I had gone home and leave and tended to that I wouldn't have had to worry about working cause I would have received my normal  paycheck.

##### Did you apply for compensation as a part of your separation? Did you do a BDD Claim or wait until later?
I have no idea what that is. [BDD is explained] If it was there and presented I don't have any memory of it.

Are there things you would change about this? I think it explains it enough. If I had questions at this point I might  call my vet rep to explain it if it wasn't clear. The separation pay is a lumpsum that puts everything together but what is it? One of them is vacation time and leave time and I had a lot of it. But I was told I was crucial and couldn't leave. So not knowing what's included in that separation pay. It also might be helpful to know what it means that you might need to repay the money, that means delaying the time that I begin to receive benefits. It would be helpful to have in there because that my spur questions as well.

#### Training Pay
##### Is that training pay question something you're familiar with?
No I got paid to be a Marine. I didn't know anything about active or inactive duty. Since I was medically discharged they told me I would not be eligible to go into the reserves.

Training pay is that going to extend again my dates to receive benefits which is not addressed here at all.

#### v2 Add New Contentions
Let's answer some questions this time.
Do you have any thoughts about the message [PTSD details will be asked later]. One thing here is I'm adding multiples and there's no option for multiples. So the conditions that go along. As long as it's expanded to include the things that might be connected.

##### So you would like to be apply to check all that apply?
Yea because best match means one but if I have PTSD and I have several things I'm going to want to answer all of them and why can't you let me.

[Tumor in elbow]
Let's try the description this time.

##### What do you expect would happen with the options you can see here?
It's really not feasible to have a collection of maladies so the example is ok. It might be helpful to have a couple of questions leading you to narrow it down. Extremities, Emotional, my arm, what part, then you can type in elbow, what's the medical condition 'tumor'.

##### So if you were presented with this and you were feeling uncertain what to put in what would you do next?
I'd probably try several variations for what might work. We think about Google Search so I think refining a search is a thing most people with computer access know. So I'm going to try several things and keywords. It could have a pop-up that was a little more extensive, tendonitis, pain, things that would fit with the elbow and then other.

That's pretty easy [selecting shoulder or arm]

##### Given what you've done, what do you think you'd put in that last input?
I think just tumor  because we've already narrowed it down to my left elbow and shorter is better according to that.

##### Do you have any general thoughts or suggestions?
I think we pretty much have talked it through going through it. I think it's far better than my initial experience with the VA website. So that's a good thing.

#### Key Takeaways:
- Bug on add new contention: selecting 'Enter' picks from the picklist; expected behavior-finalize my text entry [05:26]
- Add chat/phone option
- explain what is included in separation pay (e.g. vacation pay) and
that repaying money means delaying benefits
- Potential Bug? Separation pay year entered and service branch dropdown showed error
- Address whether training pay will affect benefits
- v2 Add New - have an option for multiples (can't select PTSD AND Eating Disorder or Shrapnel wounds AND Cancer)

**Not from the session, but a thought, can we add a "this doesn't apply to me" or "skip" button for training and retirement waivers?
