##### What is your service background and history with the VA?
I am a 20 year AF retired. I retired in 2015. I am a disabled veteran so I have had to the claim stuff with them. I did most of it prior to leaving the service. Because of my rating I did not have to submit any other things. I did questions and went back and forth with them. I have an adult child who was considered handicapped prior to the age of 18. So my next step is to go to VA to have her put on my record. She aged out. I've been collecting her data and documentation from the doctors and the resource exchange can get her put back on my record so I now I have to do the claims form. I was going to go back to the DAV in Colorado Springs. I just haven't made it over there yet. The guy that I'm going to talk to is out of Mt Carmel (??) a VSO set up in Colorado Springs to help veterans with everything filing, job hunting, resource connections, that kind of stuff.

Have you used education benefits, home loan, 
The education benefits I used so I have my GI Bill. I'm 100% disabled permananent so my dependent has been using her education money for her schooling. I have a Master's degree and it was like pulling teeth to get the education beenfits for voc rehab. That was a nightmare so I just stopped.

I have used the medical services for a variety of things, re-evaluating things that were an issue when I first retired. So I'm satisfied with that process as well.

I like the autosave because I've been through some of this stuff where it didn't save.

#### Rated Disabilities
So I'm going to choose Sarcoma because that's where I'm submitting another claim.

#### Add New Contention
I like how it has the what if I don't know the name of my condition so I would hit that to see what they mean by that.

##### What did you expect and are there any changes to make it work better?
That was a good option because if it wouldn't have said required I probably would have tried to go to the next screen. 

#### Service-Connection Details
What did you think about the four options?
Those were pretty self-explanatory. Sometimes when you're older you don't remember if it was service-connected, so an option where it could say "I don't know what the cause was".

I'm not sure I would know how to explain how the disability caused my secondary condition. It makes it hard to ask for them to help b/c how do I know it was the soft tissue damage in my elbow that caused my knee problems. I would probably write "I'm not sure how it's connected" I think that's the problem with some of the VA forms, is that they aren't very clear. I have a medical background but if I didn't how would I know. I have an uncle that doesn't know how to do it so he just says forget it, it's just too hard. I don't know what the cause and effect is. I would prob choose it was caused by another disability because that makes sense.  Because that's what I think would get me to the next level.


#### Retirement Pay
Reading this I don't understand why I'm waiving my retirement pay. So I would probably want to skip this. I would say I want the VA compensation pay but I would question why they want to take my retirement pay.

There are some situations where you get both of them. So I would panic. Why are you taking away my pay?

The only thing I would probably put on there is an explanation. WHen I read this screen, I don't know if things change based on the person and the disability itself or is this a general example. Do we see the exact same screen even though our scenario is different.

I would put the 'example' language towards the top. I see it now but when you mess with someone's money it puts them in panic mode and they don't read everything so I didn't see.

##### Are there any changes that you would make to how we're explaining the two relationships?
I had to read it twice. I think the emphasis where it says 'dollar for dollar'. The first time I read that I confused myself (misread is or isn't).

##### Did you say that you were medically retired?
No, I got out. They were trying to get ppl through the process prior to leaving to make it easier. I started my disability process while I was still on active duty. So when I retired I still had a few medical forms that I had to do, but I started ahead of time.

#### Separation/Severance Pay
##### Is there anything about severance pay that we might not know about like with retirement pay?
I don't think of any off the top of my head. I know for the active duty side there's got a be a way to explain your final pay but that's not on the VA side. I had a bonus and when I retired they allowed me to retire early. They told me I would not have to pay back the bonus money. When I retired, my final paycheck was $0. They didn't understand my request for an audit. Then you can't talk to anyone in person so it's a neverending loop.

##### Is there a way to put which one I selected or what type of pay I received? 
Because you know how you have medical, separation...what if it's something not listed and I say maybe I didn't get severance pay then you guys come back and say you did gegt severance and I'm gonna take your money.

On the first screen if I clicked no because I didn't understand the terminology.But you know how you had a dropdown box (for "what if I don't know) that said "examples could be". You won't see separation and severance if I select no, that goes away.


#### Training Pay Waiver
Maybe put reserve national duty time because that's when I would receive that pay.
If I say I don't want to get VA comp does it mess up your entire system. I don't know how these things come together (active duty versus non-active duty). On this one, I'd say I don't want the VA compensation because I want to make sure I'd get paid for active duty. I'd prob go back and forth and end up selecting "I want VA comp"

##### How did you decide which you wanted more?
Mainly because VA comp is my every single month pay and the training days are once a month but the VA comp helps me pay my bills. If I said I didn't want it and it didn't get turned back on then I couldn't pay my bills. 
If I knew for sure it was gonna work, but I don't know for sure that would work so I'm gonna get my compensation pay because that's what's gonna pay my light bill. I've heard nightmares about the pay gets so messed up because someone didn't turn the paperwork in. But it could be on the active duty side when I go active duty, so on that side them being responsible for not paying on training days vesus messing up my VA compensation. 

##### Which one represents more money, training pay or VA comp?
I don't have a feeling on which one b/c I don't know for sure but my VA comp pay is tax-free so I'd say it's prob my better choice and it's a guarantee that I'm gonna get paid.

#### v2
I would probably in the beginning choose to answer questions because I don't see what my optionsare sometimes multiple choice is easier versus trying to describe what I'm having a hard time describing. Especially when you said how is it service-connected but if I could answer some questions then I could go back and choose the back button or choose 'which should I choose' so I can read what the description is and read what you're trying to get from me at this point.

##### What are you thinking about that?
I think that one is user-friendly because you're giving me and/or type choices. But right here [describe condition in your own words], I can put that in even if I don't have the words. In the beginning I might not have the words but after seeing right side left side, now I can just say "I can't use my right arm" but in the beginning I may not have known to put that in there. 

##### Is there something we could do with the original text field?
I'm pretty inquisitive so since I can select it, I'd probably do it for that reason but the options you gave were good. I would prob go back to the beginning and type my description and be done. 

##### Do you have any thoughts you want to share?
No, I'm happy you are making ways for things to be a little eaiser for us as veterans to do this kind of stuff because it's frustrating and you go back and forth and you don't know if you're submitting correctly or you wait forever for responses just to find out you didn't submit the right thing. That's super annoying so if this gonna help us get a little bit quicker responses. Even if it means my compensation isn't going to change for a while, but I'm getting feedback. I never cared as long as I got feedback. So this, is as long as we're getting feedback at some point, a step in the right direction.


#### Key Takeaways:
- add option for Service-Connected Details; Don't know what the cause was
- Waive Retirement Pay is alarming
- Make retirement pay options different so people can skip, esp if they are eligible to receive both
- clarify training pay refers to reserves, say reserve national duty time
- give examples of separation pay and guidance in case I don't know what that is
