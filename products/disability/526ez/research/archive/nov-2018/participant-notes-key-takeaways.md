### Key Takeaways for Consideration:

P1:
- entered a full story in the new disability field where we say "as much detail as possible" in the guidance, but this is intended to be brief

Retirement Pay
- simplify table, move retirement and compensation labels to the left 
- remove "dollar for dollar" text
- make the second sentence bold
- provide info on what the impact of giving up retirement pay would be

Training
- define inactive training pay 
- re-write/remove notification for PTSD path for v2

P2:
- add option for Service-Connected Details; Don't know what the cause was
- Waive Retirement Pay is alarming
- Make retirement pay options different so people can skip, esp if they are eligible to receive both
- clarify training pay refers to reserves, say reserve national duty time
- give examples of separation pay and guidance in case I don't know what that is
Add New Contentions 
- Enter doesn't work, there is no save button
Service Connection
- make it more clear what condition is being looped through

P3:
- Bug on add new contention: selecting 'Enter' picks from the picklist; expected behavior-finalize my text entry [05:26]
- Add chat/phone option
- explain what is included in separation pay (e.g. vacation pay) and
that repaying money means delaying benefits
- Potential Bug? Separation pay year entered and service branch dropdown showed error
- Address whether training pay will affect benefits
- v2 Add New - have an option for multiples (can't select PTSD AND Eating Disorder or Shrapnel wounds AND Cancer)

P4:
- Remove conditions rated at 100%
- Service-connection - remove the word ‘but’

P5:
- provide an example for training pay to make it more clear. "In general training pay is going to be more than your compensation pay for any given day."
- v2: change "Which seems like the best match?" options to add "area"
- pre-existing bullet on service connection will put people on the defensive, change the word but to however

-----------------------------

General
- flow is odd currently; change Screen Order (vetted by Alex):

Service History —> separation —> retirement (question only) --> training (question only)

Add new contention --> service-connection details loop --> summary of disabilities --> POW --> ancillary wizard (branches into 8940)—> summary of suggested ancillary forms to download --> supporting evidence

Retirement waiver —> training pay waiver --> FDC

Rated Disability
- gray out disabilities rated at 100% (update: we should not gray out, per Paul)
- find out from Paul what other conditions max out at a certain percentage (update: we talked to Paul and will still allow conditions rated at 100% to be claimed if the veteran chooses, because there are nuanced circumstances where this would be relevant)

Add New Contention
- needs "Shorter is Better, we'll ask for details later" content
- add Save Button for `Add Another` functionality

Service-Connection Details
- change the word but on the third option xx (update: not implementing this change)
- add another choice "I don't know what the cause was" (update: not adding another choice following discussion with Paul, we want to route users to the 4 selections provided)
- make the choices more distinct (switch to active voice)

Retirement Pay
- simplify table
- add third option "I'm eligible for both." (update: no change for now, will discuss with pay experts)
- add consequences for choosing VA comp over retirement pay  (update: Paul will schedule mtg with pay experts to get the right answer on what to do here)
- Bold 'dollar for dollar' and add coma after it
- Retirement Pay Waiver language modification, what about folks who are eligible for both (update: no change for now, Paul will schedule mtg with pay experts to get the right answer on what to do here)

Separation Pay
- provide examples of separation pay (vacation, bonuses, etc) as a bulleted list; contextual help for additional guidance (update: no change for now, Paul will connect us with pay experts
- provide an example with specific dollar amounts if possible (update: no change for now, may modify after Paul connects us with pay experts)
- explain that repaying money means delaying benefits (update: no change for now)

Training Pay
- Training Pay will be significantly more than day rate for VA comp. "In general training pay is going to be more than your compensation pay for any given day." (update: confirmed with Paul, we need to add this language)
- provide an example with specific dollar amounts if possible (update: no change for now, may modify after Paul connects us with pay experts)
