**Intro - 5 minutes**
---------------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about disability compensation on VA.gov. We will look at the online version of Form 526, that service members can use to apply for disability compensation.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

● This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

● In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

● You'll be interacting with a VA.gov test site. We will log into the site and give you the control of our computer through zoom, so you don't need to log in, but still be able to try out the website. Since it's a test site, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

● If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

● Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**
---------------------------------

Before we look at the website, let's start with a few warm-up questions.

● Can you tell us a few sentences about yourself, where you live for example?

● Have you ever filed a disability claim with the VA? Would you feel comfortable talking about how this experience was?

○ If you have never filed a disability claim, have you considered doing so?

**Let participant take over control of our computer in Zoom.**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, I'm going to let you take over my screen and have you try out the website and complete a few tasks.

**First Task: Add a condition - 15 minutes**
--------------------------------------------

Could you talk me through what you see on this page? What do you think you can do on this screen? *If they understand, continue to the next step. If they do not, explain a bit about how this screen works.*

On this screen, we are filing a new claim for disability compensation. We have confirmed our personal information and now we are going to add two new conditions to our claim. Let's choose for the purpose of this test, Tinnitus and Back Pain.  

Remember that this is not your account --- none of the information you enter will be saved and it will not impact your actual VA information or benefits. *Suggested condition to claim: Tinnitus and Back Pain.*

Now that we've chosen two disabilities to add to your claim, would you please submit it?

It is very helpful if you talk out loud as you walk through this form: what are you trying to do, what are you thinking and experiencing. Also feel free to tell me if anything on any page is confusing or unclear and what is helpful for you.

### **Things to watch for:**

● Does the participant understand how the form works?

● What is confusing, unclear? What is helpful? Do they feel that they have all the information they need to complete the form?

**Second Task: Edit a disability description/remove a disability assignment - 15 minutes**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● Now we've successfully added two disabilities to our claim. Imagine now that you realized that you picked the wrong disability from the list. You wanted to choose Back Sprain, Not Back Pain. How would you go about changing the disability Back Pain to Back Sprain? Please say what you're thinking out loud so we can understand your thought process.

● Did this work as you expected?

### **Things to watch for:**

● Does the participant understand how to correct the disability?

● Is anything confusing or unclear for the participant? Is anything especially helpful?

**Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes**
------------------------------------

● What do you think overall about the process of going through this form?

● What was confusing or unclear within the form?

● What was especially helpful for you in the form?

● If you could improve one thing in this form, what would it be?

● What did not work like you expected it to?

**Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes**
-------------------------------------

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you again and enjoy the rest of your day!
