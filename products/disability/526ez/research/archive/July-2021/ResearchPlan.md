**Research Plan for a Usability test of Form 526**
==================================================

VSA Claims & Appeals Team, Form 526, Christian Valla, July 2021.

**Background**
--------------

This is a usability test of Form 526.

Several changes have been made to Form 526 in the last several months. A comprehensive usability test with veterans is therefore needed.

Veterans with a disability and who are planning to apply for a benefit for their condition(s), can use the online version of Form 526 to apply: <https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction>.

We will use VA Staging, but have the users control our computer to get around any problems with providing participants with any test user credentials.  

**Goals**
---------

● Understand the current user experience, what pain points and usability issues exist, including confusing or unclear content/copy.

● Is any necessary information missing throughout the form?

● Can participants go through the flow by themselves, without any problems or blockers?

**Research questions**
----------------------

● What usability issues and pain points exist in the 526 Form?

● Can users go through the form with ease and no blockers?

● Is there any confusion with regards to language and terms used?

● Do participants feel they have all the information they need to complete the form?

**Method **
-----------

● We will be conducting a remote, moderated usability study with approximately 8 Veterans (separated from active duty).

● Allowing users to interact with and walk through the 526 Form online, on their own, in their own environment, can help us detect usability issues they encounter, in a test situation that is as close as possible to the "real" situation. 

● We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.

● We will use VA Staging, but instead of providing the participants with test user credentials, we will log into Staging and have the participants control our computer through Zoom.

● The sessions will include a short interview (3-5 min.) about their experience with VA.gov and any disability claims they have applied for (or planned to apply for).

● We will log into VA Staging and share our screen via Zoom. We will hand over the control of our computer to the participants.

● We will ask the participants to go through the 526 Form and perform a task: they will submit a claim for a condition (Tinnitus), as well as a few other sub-tasks.

● We will ask participants to speak out loud as they move through the form, and probe for usability issues and relevant feedback.

● Pre-test interview questions will probe this experience and past relevant experiences with VA.gov and submitting a claim (paper or online).

**Participants and Recruitment**
--------------------------------

We would like to interview 8 participants.

● In order to get 8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 15 participants in total, with the expectation that there will be a max of 7 no-shows.
