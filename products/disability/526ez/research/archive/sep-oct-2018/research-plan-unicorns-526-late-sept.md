# Research Plan for Unicorns 526 – New Disabilities et al
(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 

## Goals
1. Unicorns is looking for feedback on methods to collect new disabilities as part of a 526 application 
2. Background: We have an MVP out there that only deals with increase for rated disabilities. Adding new disabilities (and still dealing with increase claims) is new more complicated territory.
3. Research questions: We have some new approaches that need validation
   1. How does list and loop work for new disabilities? 
      1. Are our follow-up questions sound?
   2. Does the 781 fit sensibly into this flow?
   3. Does assigning conditions to treatment locations work in the composite supporting evidence flow?
   4. Maybe 781/4142 walkthrough as well
4. Hypothesis: 

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
    - Moderated usability feedback with live forms

## Participants and Recruitment

1. Participant criteria: 5–6 people
    1. Some experience with disability comp
    2. Diverse age range

## When? 
1. Timeline: As soon as practical
2. Prepare: From a functionality standpoint, we could probably do this today. But we will be adding more things this sprint that would be great to get eyes on
3. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times. Please request enough dates and time slots. Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.
4. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? (Ideally this should not be someone on your team).
