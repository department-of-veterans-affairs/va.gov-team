## Introduction
Thank you for your time. I want to give you a little information about what our session will focus on today and give you time to ask any questions you might have before we get started. 

### Housekeeping
Before we begin, I'd like to ask: Is it ok with you if I record (audio only) this discussion? The recording is for internal purposes and to ensure we have record of our conversation. If yes, begin recording now...

Great! One last thing before we get started, I want to give you this gift card, to thank you for your time today. 

### Background
We are here today to get a better understanding of your experience filing a disability compensation claim. There are no right or wrong answers here; the goal is to learn about your experience, what worked well and what could have gone better for you during that process. We are in the information gathering stage and want to hear from you. It may seem like you are talking a lot, but that is good. This is all about you.

### Roles
As the moderator, my role is to ask most of the questions and my colleague(s) will be taking notes, so we have a record of what you've shared with us today. We would also like to take a photo of you if you would allow us. This again is just for internal purposes and for the small team working on this. Your photo will help us share your story.
