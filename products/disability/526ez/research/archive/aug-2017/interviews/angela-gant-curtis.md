Ensures that we are able to receive the claim from the Veteran. And, once that claim is received, can process it through to get: 
- medicals scheduled
- access medical records
- get ratings to Veterans

Replacing DBQ with CY evaluation

Working for four years to get decisions to Veterans

CUI -- Clinical User Interface - why so much focus?

- not the major pain point per se (Angela)

Other pain points

- Scheduling the exam
- Having access to medical records already reviewed
   - Send over to VHA, have them schedule and get results back (again) before can make a decision
   
132 VHA systems where they schedule systems

Different systems, processes, documents

If want an increase, you should only be asking answering a few questions not entire DBQ. 

Why still doing entire form if CUI is helping to only answer a few questions?

- Brad Houston (VBA) wants to continue using the vendors and wants all of the exams to happen outside of the VA. Wants VHA out of the business of doing exams.
   - problem: vendors all have own systems. VHA does __2M exams a year__. Difficult to staff up. 
   
VBA is trying to take VBA out of the process. 

Downloading medical records takes __forever__ for the vendors.
