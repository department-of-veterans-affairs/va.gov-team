## Do not forget

(1) Look at overarching questions adjudicators ask during rating and let that drive the application experience.

What are the if then statements:

- service history
- type of claim
- current diagnosis

(2) Special issue or exposure development

- functionality that can be built into a self service app is complex
- complexity associated with capturing the information the right way on a paper form is the barrier today
   - thinks a service that pings off another data source to ask more specific questions
   
(3) Mental Health

- Suicide rate is very high
- self service portal could help automate this process
   - can you give us an example? Leverage _both VHA and VBA data_ to give seamless delivery of service. 

## Raw Notes

2008 started in St Paul Minn.

- general intake of mail
- ratings

2011 Central Office

- started on business side 
- VBMS
- procedure staff today so he is involved in business operations

Projects

- automation of decision ready notification email
- evidence gathering has historically been the longest piece of the process
   - obtaining exams
   - private treatment records
- when did fully development program, developed it into 526EZ
- In early stages of project to increase decision ready claims "Decision Ready Claim Initiative"
   - already service connected
   - filing for an increase
- 

Identifying claim type upfront
- different if you've had a claim versus had a claim

// Important

Part that slows it down...

- Not helping the Veteran identify the type of claim the Veteran wants to file before the Veteran files
- Specifically some of these categories
   - Special issue development
      - Agent Orange
      - Gulf War
      
// Important Done

Parts of the process
- Almost always have to do an exam
- Small amount do not and that is up to the rater

DRQ really is allowing us to have a fully developed claim when it comes into the door. It allows them to get the information to process the type of claim.

Based on:

- when and where Veteran served
- type of disability they are claiming

Three Things Need in Place

- current diagnosis
   - can look at previous related diagnosis to stand as facts they have another diagnosis
- had an event in service
- have a connection between current diagnosis and event in service. 

Then, also look at other entitlements. What rewards are they *also* getting so they can determine if they need to withhold payment.
