# Richard Kitchen

## Do Not Forget

serving in the military is all about doing stuff for the person next to you, then you get out…and there’s no one standing next to you

## Goals

- Learn how Richard fits into the ecosystem
- Learn a bit about Richard's teams design process.
- Learn where Richard has hit walls.
- Learn what Richard would do if he had endless resources and full control over the process and could do it again.

## Broad Areas

### How he fits into the ecosystem
- Tell me a bit about your role as it relates to the disability claims compensation process.
- Has this always been your role?
- What is your team makeup, including your colleagues at the VA?

RK:
- 2 years ago joined EVSS working on ebenefits. 
	- Team of 2-3 UX designers, analytics engineer, research person for UX. 
	- Going through a major redesign phase, then it stalled with vets.gov. EVSS, there's only so much you can do with the design side. 
- Problems are primarily communications/business/data areas. 
	- Can't get access to data: Moved from IL, went to VA hospital, none of medical records transfered, benefits didn't update with new location, had to re-regisgter with DC VSO, online (VHA side, MHV) does not connectg with ebenefits or VBMS + DEERS and DoD system. 
	- Pressure on veteran to manage all those conections. 

### Process
Tell me a bit about how your team approached the design of the eBenefits form.
- Claims: First experience with paper. Worked with a VSO because overwhelemed with paperwork. As soon as started talking to anyone who had done a claim, learned there was a "knowledge base that was very tribal". 
- A lot of the data isn't available through ebenefits because submitted via paper. 
- SEP hard...knows someone who scheduled appts at pentagon beacuse their firewall is magic and makes it work.
- Worked with Frog: enlightening, good for the VA (esp legacy VA) to see how commercial world works. 
	- Valuable, but not productive. not productive because it came up with ideas like "have the veteran have access to all their info throughout the process". 
	- No benefit to the VA from frog research, beacuse it wasn't actionable. They were so far detached from what's actionable, first time working with governent. 

Limits and constraints:
- everything is silowed. with the way appts work, people come in for 4-10 years, not a cohesive roadmap/vision for where the business is going. people move around a lot, come in with ideas.
- constant = technology underneath it all

LC: tell us about a time when you broke through it all. RK: "well, that's pretty much what we do"
- need a boat load of $$ and great UX people to redesign infrastructure. everything is so piecemeal. 
- all systems have own logins. DS systems have some common logins. Even with ID.ME, still inheriting problems from various systems. This causes vets problems because results in "black hole"

*Veterans choice program: need clarification*

- what were the biggest surprises along the way?
- what were the biggest challenges?

- if you could do it again, what would you do differently? Why? (what have you learned and how did you learn it?)
	- Don't focus on technicalogical issues and focus on how to improve things for the interpersonal relationships between veterans and VSOs.
	- "Virtual VSO": 
- we know a lot about the fact that veterans have problems with the usability (workload, lack of udnerstanding) of forms that can't necessarily be solved through UI. 
- when you go in and are filing a claim, you add evidence (some pre-populated, some you upload): the decision on what to do is very stressful for veteran becuase they don't want to leave anything out but also don't want to add in anything that will hurt them. 
	- *this is where the VSO is key: get real deep value out of VSO becuase there are tasks and processess that could be more systematic, but the communication and collaboration between vet an vso can make all the difference*
- no digital inbetween for VSO/veteran. "digitize or make this cross communication easier" whould save a lot of time

Backend research:
- Talked to Vets and VSOs about this
- Vet in Alexandria, VA: has all files in hierarchy mgmt system that veteran has provided her. Then has to upload everything, which is a wonky system. Every other page is missing. That is official submitted adjusicated piece
- Ebenefits doesn't have same upload problem

- Dance between VSR and rVSR: tagging and file naming is poor. 17 of them have the same name. Rater will look at evidence, but won't look at everything else. Gaming tools...
Is there any connection you found in talking to VSOs that goes back to things you were trying to change about the ebenefits applicaiton?
- it all got presented to the scaled agile machine and never went into development

Why doesn't everyone work with VSO?
- There is availability, but some people don't want the "handout" -- emotional thing to deal with disability. VSOs do a good job looking out for that, but vets are deterred because some vets have more severe conditions
- Some VSOs have membership fees
- Frsutrated with DoD, that frustration carries over to VA. MIlitary mindset doesn't transfer over to an active/proactive system, which makes VSO more important

### Biggest opportunities
- Gulf war vets, OES/OIS
	- Higher tech expectations, greater demand for claim submission is outpacing the ability to provide it
- want the experience of getting new car, driving off the lot, and simultaneously getting insurance through USAA.

What does this tech demand mean for VSOs?
- "Gritty old VSOs"
- expectations of ease are higher, conflicts fighting in are much differnet than Vietnam vets, for example. more door to door combat that messes with peoples heads, have more emotional/social/family problems. "more invisible injuries" harder to connect with VSOs.
- need shepard to coach them through the process outside of the VSOs who have been there forever. in military you have the mindset that you do work for the people next to you, then you get out and you dont have someone next to you

### Data
- what are most common claims:
- demographic of submitted claims: not all known digital vs. electronic
- largest users of ebenefits are 55+
- do you trust the data? No
- what % VSO help is in person?
- when you re-file, opens everything back up. If I go back in, they can decrease my other stuff. Question if it's worthwhile to go back in and re-submit, even if you need the resources


### Walls

I want to go back in time for a second. Think back, can you tell us about a situation when you introduced a change to the eBenefits form and it went really well? Who did you work with? What was the result?

- did some really good research and had some breakthroughs around document management. very veteran centric. actionable items up-front. has deck
- there is a misunderstanding of iteration in general. doing small things all the time does not necessarily make things better. believes this misunderstanding is primarily on EVSS side. "we were primairly a portal, subject to the other systems"
- all metrics on look and feel = solid

Communicating walls:
- the parts that were more acted on, we really treated our VA counterparts as subjects and participants, which got them involved in the process up to the recommendation part. So they feel the same things as we do: they want to do all these great things and they see the challenge.
	- mini win because SMEs could see there were challenges and were also frustrated
- as a contractor it was harder because he couldnt walk into a room and say stuff isn't working and I need to fix it. needs to be more of the above communication to break through these backwards systems

Now, think about a time when it didn't go so well. Describe to me what happened.

### Progression

If you had endless resources and time to rethink the form experience today, where would you start? What pitfalls would you avoid?

Are there areas you feel you still do not quite understand fully? Why?

### Depending on how the convo goes, we may want to ask:
- When designing the flow, is there a reason why EDC option/checkbox was placed at the very end? 
- When desiginig this experience, what were your inspirations? How much of a role did the paper form/process play in the eBenefits experience?

### Research


### 526 Form

History: 
- 526 started out as paperform. 
	- More or less digitized, but didn't think about how to approach from digital point. Heavily influenced by technology and ordered in ways that don't make 100% sense. 
	- ex: upfront about you, then military, then benefits. Hard time pulling together the logic and the journey.
- "not so much a form, you're building knowledge for a relationship." 
- "misleading to call it a form, more like profile building"

Technical challenges:
- didn't allow them to move sections of the form around. the sequential logic was dictated by technical constraints
- 90 different systems involved (!?)
