All people think about when they hear VBA is claims.

99 percent of meetings are claims.

-- Field officers would rather process a claim end-to-end. By splitting it up into different chunks of work, it costs to switch context. why?
   - FO's say no one does it as good as they do
   - they don't like the work being spread nationally
   
Mike: can't predict flow of work so need to spread the work out.
