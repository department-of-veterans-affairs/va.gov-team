### Intro

- 21 yrs in air force; after 19 years overseas, final assignment to Pentagon
- friend from service suggested where to live
- Pentagon: 2005-2007 (15mo); retired
- worked for federal govt and began filing claim
- TAPS: transition assistant; good briefing from VA (Mr. Bell); suggested go to a service org; VFW, Amrican Legion, Disabled American Vet because it's a process
  - you won't understand the process, the paperwork
  - went with DAV; did initial claims
- filed around May/June 2007; "got disapproved" for sleep apnea, back, knees; VA fought me
  - sleep apnea: when active duty, was referred to Walter Reed; can't take the test here b/c there's a war going on; referred to civilian clinic
  - went to Mr. Bell (from briefing); said go to the VA, not a civilian clinic, b/c now you're a veteran
  - went to VA to set up appt;
  - Mr. Bell: apply for sleep apnea; said no, didn't have it while on active duty b/c wasn't tested
  - VA test positive; but VA said no, you had it when you got out
  - July 2016: made it to the appeals board
  - changed from DAV to VFW for assistance
- VFW: represented him to appeals board for sleep apnea and for back
  - back was only rated at 10%; having problems
  - board hearing: judge had case; rep said this isn't a regular court of law; she will keep you at ease; it's her court and she decides
  - told judge: didn't want to talk about my back; why--so many years of frustration explaining and being denied
  - judge asked questions and going over records; started to get mad; this should hever have come to me, this should have been taken care of 9 years ago; waste of your time and my time
  - rep was smiling; said it was a slam dunk
  - a few months later, decision in his favor: service-connected back to retirement day
  - judge was so mad at how VA handled case, esp. back problem, had case remanded back to Baltimore; called back for appointments

### eBen
- checks it every day
- never updated
- can't tell what's going on with case
- call up: same thing; real frustrating
- first thing: go to Payment History; December payment for $140
  - called: what is this payment for?
  - we shorted you on shoulder, so we're paying you back
  - December 29: received letter in mail: "You owe us $140. We paid you $140"
  - Called Jan 4 to ask: they said we overpaid you. Asked about December call. 
  - Angry: You owe me 9 years of payment for back pain and apnea. I still haven't heard anything and you owe me 9 years of backpay.
  - But you know 29 days after overpaying me that I owe $140!!??
  - And you're saying I can pay it or you can take it.
  - I shouldn't have to chase my money b/c you don't have to chase your money.
- Now in customer-facing role at VA. Currently fingerprinting
- when someone works at VBA, he gets to know them
- told friend from VBA about above incident; asked for help
- 4 weeks ago, $2200 dropped in and he knew it was short
  - called friend; need to know what the payment is about
  - friend looks up case and found out it was backpay
  - out of the blue: you're rated 100% but he didn't know
  - it's still not teling me anything; I got paid, but no information about why I got paid
  - eBen should tell me something about why I drop money in my account. Because if they drop money and then pull it back, what if I spent that money and now I don't have it.
  - There's a lot on eBenefits that's not as friendly as it needs to be
  - I'm not computer-dumb, but I'm not the smartest. I know there's people who
  - Helped a lady interpret when a letter was needed from her
 
 
 ### TAPS
 - what did Mr. Bell say?
 - at the time, lots of vets werne't applying for benefits; he was trying to educate, tell them you should put in for benefits
 - he opened up a light for me because I didn't know what I could do as I was retiring; and TAPS was all new
 - he was a good public speaker; he was a vet who could relate to other vets
 - if you put a civilian in front of a military crowd, sometimes it shuts the crowd down
 - he could tell some vets didn't want to apply for it. Explained, "These benefits are benefits you earned." Some people left planning to apply and when asked what made them apply: Mr Bell
 - before eBenefits
 - back then: brought in medical records, and DAV spotted all things in medical records they could spot that you can file claims for
   - we need a POA for us to represent you
   - takes the ease off you as a vet
   - retiring is a scary thing when you're so used to that structure
   - go from that uniform to, now I gotta pick a tie
 - good TAPS program at the Pentagon; came here during the bubble (2007) and didn't want to take off more than 2 months; just refinanced house a few months ago--house finally recovered
   - has always had good credit, but bought in 2005; value dropped; couldn't walk away
   - 4-5 years ago: tried to refnance but couldn't
   - when I bought this house, I couldn't get a VA loan
   - no one wanted teh VA to inspect it; but 2nd time around, used VA loan for refi
  
  ### Paper claim
  - started with VSO b/c Mr. Bell said their job was to help us
  - that's all they want to do is help vets
  - maybe people didn't feel like they deserved it, younger, but he convinced them that they did hard work and if they got hurt but don't feel it until 20 years from now, then missing out
  - process was easy with DAV; they told him every step
    - when records move within the VA, VSO knows about it
    - there was a time for 2.5 years when nothing was happening with records
    - DAV was asking: what's going on? couldn't get an answer
    - finally called congressperson, and the next day he got his disapporval
  - didn't get frustrating until the VA got involved
 
 Appeal:
 - waited and waited; was told it was a long process
 - got a family vacation scheduled; got letter in mail, had to reschedule vacation to apppear;
 - got about 10 days notice; has been wiating 9 years so it was a priority
 - in touch weekly with VA during those 9 years
 - guy in Baltimore named Bob; would ask him Mr. __ how are you doing? Anything on my claim? No
 - DAV started to get like eBen (couldn't get information)
 - DC was easier b/c he could walk there
 - heard of someone at VFW: signed POA and started being represented
 - lost confidence in DAV after waiting 9 years (and he's a member of DAV); tired of hearing that he'll
 - how would the taxpayer react of the VA had to pay interest/penalties?
 - IRS tried to tax him on DAV payment (which is non-taxable)
 - frustrating: go to eBen; the technology I feel is not there
   - I look on it and how come you're not updating?
   - You got my name right
   - If it says you're going to put case information there, then you should
   - It says, "My appeal has been set back" (shrugs)
- working with DAV in Baltimore vs. VFW in DC: different answers from the DAV; saying it's in final stages and getting close, but then checking and realizing that's not true

### VA hospital : Washington Center DC

- walking into the VA: first words aren't "What do you want?"
  - does not tell people immediately that he works at 810 Vermont
  - nurse told him he had high blood pressure; he said no, just knows what's going to happen and feeling frustrated
  - walk into Tampa VA hospital: people want to be there; you can feel the atmosphere
  - in DC, (shakes head)
- goes in for appt; sent to another floor to get mask
  - told to call back on Tuesday; why can't it just be ordered?
  - no, have to call
  - calls to ask for it; 
- friends ask why not go to private provider
- why? I earned that. Why shouldn't I get treatment for a service-connected condition?

### Appeals process
- May 2010
- first thing: told DAV wanted to fill out paperwork to go to appeals board
- VSO takes all the stuff you've already submitted and get it ready to take to appeal
- when he told judge he didn't want to talk about his back, she was so mad she remanded, which pushed him to 95%
- appeals: waited 6 years
- agony of waiting: I would never have put in for it. I thought I was having a heart attack. This doctor looked like Doogie Houser. Didn't know what sleep apnea was. He referred him ot doctor at Pentagon. Told him to get a sleep study done while on active duty. Military medical records explain clearly that he has sleep apnea.
  - when first put in for the original claim, could not find this record
  - once you retire, can't go into Pentagon. Called his supervisor to get a pass to get to clinic. Gets a pass
  - goes to clinic and starts talking to young airman who didn't know anything; need my records; talked to supervisor (civilian)
  - told him it would take 6 weeks to get all his records
  - can tell he's not getting through to her; she does not want to entertain me
- back to office: sent the best butt-kissing email I could think of
- asked to come back on Tuesday
- called buddy for another pass
- took envelope, too much anxiety to open it until back at his office; first record is sleep apnea; DAV sends it over to VA; comes back immediately with disapproved; doesn't say you've been tested
  - that's why vets give up the fight
  - disapproval: no proof that you had it on active duty; legal jargon
  - DAV said, it's OK, we'll appeal
  - VA would not test you; that's not your fault
  - Mr. Bell: from the day you retire, for 364 days, you're covered (considered active duty)
  - they didn't test me because they said they didn't have no days
  - Walter Reed wouldn't test me because the war was going on and they need to keep operating rooms open
  - VA wouldn't test him until after retired
  - retired May 1; appt for September; obstructed sleep apnea, but it was after retirement
  - "I think if I had filed a claim somewhere else, it would have gotten approved." if there's a backload in Baltimore, they should push claims to other parts of the country
  - some friends have fast cases, others slow
  - if they're not going to have time to work them, they should move them
- when he got letter to go to appeals board, anxiety began
  - was a cop in the military, so has been in the courtroom for murder
  - didn't know what to expect
  - VSO was great; just bring evidence
  - so many cases (you can Google them) denied, b/c they fill place with neighbors, etc but don't bring evidence; all you need is evidence
  - would have liked to talk with VSO about what to expect at the hearing much earlier, but VSOs are too busy to meet with you beforehand, only at the hearing
    - she was great
    - asked him some ?s during hearing; said a few words: client should be paid since the day retired, or since day tested
- Paperwork with VSO: they would do it, I would review and sign it

### eBen
- could be a good tool, and maturing
- but for me, it's not doing what i want it to do
- they shoudl flood it with data
- if I got something from my doctor, I could upload it; but I'm past that stage now; useful if he wants an increase
- now, the VA needs to do their part when they're pushing down; I don't think they're pushing down enough
- pay history is shared well
- but case data isn't
  - waht's going on with my case?
  - prime examlpe: why did they drop money in my case? I don't want to wait for snail mail to try to figure it out
  - I could go to DC and say, what's this about vs. wait 2-3 weeks
  - shows stack of paperwork received on 7/20 (see photo); "this could all be shown on eBenefits"
- 2x his information has been lost by govt
  - once b/c a VA laptop was lsot
  - once by OPM
- what else about eBen is helpful?
  - ratings are all there
  - nice little circle thing breaking it down by percentage
  - shows teh different service-connected conditions even if 0%
  - that's always updated well
  - but lots of things in paper that's sent aren't there
  - it's getting better, going in the right direction b/c before they didn't have this
- any types of evidence especially hard to get?
  - electronic records from different locations are hard to get for some people
  - Pentagon: had he not been able to get in, that would have been difficult
  - when they denied the sleep apnea, they said there was nothing in his records; he looked through all his records to look for it; had a magnifying glass looking through; concentrating/frustrated; thinking hard: realized maybe he had records at the Pentagon
  - it's sad to say, but I became that frustrated vet that decides to educate other vets; make sure you do this b/c otherwise teh VA will screw you when you get out
  - son was being recruited by a marine; he asked , "If I join, will the VA take care of me?" yes, "He said, why don't they take care of my father. He served 21 years." Then tells marine, makes ure you get your records before you leave
- doesn't even want to think about where he would be had he not been able to get into the Pentagon
- probably would have filed a congressional complaint; has done it twice; feels it slows things down
- DAV had kept telling him the average was 6 years and he was next
- every time he receives something form the Va, wife would get excited
  - he would say, no, it's from a different place (e.g. ed benefit; shakes head--knew it wasn't about appeal0
  - when finally got the mail from Wichita, hands were shaking 
  - hearing assigned day after July 4
