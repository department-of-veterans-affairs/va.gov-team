Are you a Veteran who has initiated or submitted a disability compensation claim or do you know a Veteran who has? We want to hear from you.

My team at the VA is working on some new online tools to help veterans manage their benefits, and we want to talk to Veterans feedback to make sure we understand your opinions and needs. It's really important for us to hear your thoughts directly, so we can be sure that what we're building works for you. 

For this particular project, we want to hear from Veterans in the D.C., Maryland, Virginia (DMV) area who have initiated or submitted a disability compensation claim. We will be conducting 60-minute in-home or in-office interviews Tuesday, August 8. You'll receive $50 as a thank-you gift for your time spent with us. 

If you’re interested or know someone who might be, please email us at feedback@va.gov. 

Thanks!
