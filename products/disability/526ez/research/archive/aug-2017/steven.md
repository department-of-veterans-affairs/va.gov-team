## Intro

Steven mentioned he's having a busy week but that this is worth it--he'd be glad to do anything to make this process better.

Said he would be willing to do this

From New York. Signed in 2003. Did a few deployments. On the borderline of re-enlisting. Decided against it, but friends talked him into it and re-enlisted together. Were told they would be stationed close to NY, but were stationed in Arlington, VA
Responsible for driving generals around, teaching martial arts. Got in some trouble. Left the services. Drove a truck, shot a machine gun, taught people how to fight (martial arts).
Could not get a job-unemployed for a while.

Went back to school. Someone told him to apply for disabilities--did have mental health issues while in the military

Separted March 2011.

Submitted first claimin Sept 2012. In school for 4 months. Everyone told him It's a long process, buckle down. Got a decision Jly 2013. Almost a full year and had only claimed 1 disability.

Has had outlashed. Some PTSD. Comes and goes. Had an outburst in class. Told him to go and get the help you need.

Warnings from people:

"Information is not regularly available." DId not believe them in this digital age.

Dell Portal is #1 worst sites
eBenefits 2ned worst
CHat optoin could never work. WHen it did--canned responses.

Started a chat--person gave him same answer and copy-pasted what was in the file. 

Not happy with the VA. Not a hpapy customer.

Now realizes he should have used a VSO.

Current VSO: having problems. WOrked with someone who got promoted, got bounced around. Says maybe it's his fault, but now good to have 
WOrks with Parallized Veterans of America. Wife's friends got it done through them in 6mos. THey handled his appointments. Compared to him getting a clal from someo esaying here are 3 options, if you cna't maek this appt, it's a 6-month wait.

Also a emmber of VFW. Will help with filling out paper work but not with more.

Looked into wounded Warrior project, but already into paperwork.

Had already begun paperwork; and had 1st appt w/ Psycologist/psychiatrist. Initial process wasn't bad--was more informed. Didn't have a resource to talk with. VFW can't.

Yuku - site for help with disability claims for Veterans. Run by Gulf War/Vietnam War vets helping younger generation. Lot sof message boards. Finding the right ones w/right info is hard.

People share ratings scores and break down reasons , e.g. you must hae been talking this way if you got this outcome. THey will say things the VA won't tell you.

## Process

Flied Sept 2012
Did not get any information  fEbruarl 2013
Appt end of June 2013.

Then faster turnover: decision and rating by July 27 2013.
Didn't agree with rating.
November 2013, filed an appeal.
Still in appeal process.

DId you think it would take that long?

Prepared. Suprised it didn't take longer. Knew it was only a single disability, so 10mos isn't htat bad. Some people he knows, it took 2.5 years for an initial claim and they didn't get what they thought they needed.

Appeal: now serving stuff from Octoer 2013.

Biggest frustration: don't know where you at.
eBen gives you a timeline, but dioesn't tell you if your claim has been moved to a new stage.

E.g. site says "Missing information" -- call in to find out what's missing, and find out that no, you're not 'misisng information'. The staff is using the same view of your benefit as Veteran is.

Quick to get in touch with you when e.g. you owe money b/c you messed up with GI bill. Why so slow to let you know of othe rupdates?

When you call, you feel lke you are giving them a pain. Feel like you're deterring them from their day. That they have other work to do. Gets that people have bad days, but "we're just calling for infomration because it's not there."

If you log in and hover over appeal or claim, the information doesn't tell you wha, "Where in the world do you need me to be right now?"

Veteran needs more information. When you have to write down what you went through, that's hard. EWish there was more of a "traumatic envets" checkbox. Let that come up when you talk to you r psychiatrist. You dn't know who's going to see what you write down. Lots of cliams people look at it. Maybe you don't want to write about it.

Never a time int e process where he felt comfortable.

At one point, told wife, "I don't even care anymore." If it happens, it happens. Then got a call 4 months later out of the blue. Here are 3 appts available at this VA hospital. If they don't work, 2 month wait."

Understands that they're bapcklogged.

eBen "My Appointments"
Portal is not intuitive about. If you make an appointment, only shows up in the system until the day of or after your appointment.  SUpposed to show you past 90 days but doesn't.

Called 1x a month. Didn't want to overload them. Always, "We're experiencing high call volumes." Current wait time 1 hour, give callback #. Tried to be available, but if you miss that callback.

At peak volume, Has called before and gotten a message "There is noo one available, call back later." and it hangs up on yu.

Any time between 1st and 8th: has attributed this to that's when the military gets apid as well, so maybe people get retirement or pension. WHy is my pay less than what it's supposed to be so volume high.

Has wokred in contact centers before, but seems they don't care. THey might see you called a week ago, and tel  you nothing's changed, why are you calling again.

Vague letters in the mail: your claim has been received, you will be notified when you claim has been moved to the next step. Months later, nothing's changed.

VFW: was hoping they could help youput the right information in the right box and seal it the right way and send it to the right place.

### FDC

Only thing he did on his own: log into the portal. No FDC yet. To file a claim, click here.

Has done a new claim since then that was FDC. Process and being able to submit your service records was much better. Got a decison in 4 months.
Around 2015. 

What was different ws that they didn't have to pull your records. Submitted for knee surgery. Sent all doctors' notes. Sent to an appt and flexed knee. Gave 10% for knee. Very easy. Made it service connected.

Hearing: same, but appointments were the same. 

Found out about FDC on the site.

"For a speedier decision, you can submit a fully developed claim"

Used VSO. VSO did everything. SEnt all the paperwork you needed to fill out. It was quick. They said to be responsive for apppts. Make sure FDC was the way to go. Have everyting ready. Don't submit one piece, and then later while being developed to submit another. Submit all at once.

HVSO tlls you form numbers or where to download. Parallized Veterans work at VA, so it's like talking to the VA.  They said to submit everything from your doctor from pre-op to post-op to physical therapy. 

He has all of his service records and medical records in a drawer at home. Every duty station, certificates of accommodation, etc. shot records.
You get all that when you separate (at least from Marine Corps).


## Appointment

Initial claim for PTSD: psychiatrist.
Waited for 2 hours. Talked about past. Sat and typed on computer. Talked about suicidal thoughts, death, etc. Initial appointment took 15 minutes.

Stood me up, and walked me over to a mental health clinic because she thought I needed immediate help."
Got a 30% rating 

What do you wish? A little more in-depth. Focused a lot on childhood than anything in military. Questions about parents, chlidhood, drinking before military.  When I started talking about militiary experience and suicide thoughts, just typed. 

3 weeks later, made decision and got 20% rating.
Rating: noticed that the 50 and 70 had suicide mentions but 30 didn't. Wondered, "Did she listen to what I was telling her?" VSO said, "if you feel that way, file an appeal."
Had not been told anything about the appointment, what it would be like.

What would have been helpful to hear after the appointment?
Nothing. False hope for us kind of sucks.

What might have been helpful to hear before going to the appoitment?
Was prepared to talk to someon about this. The option to stop talking would have been nice. No security blanet, like feel free to stop the meeting.

What do you wish eBen would have said afte rthat?
You can click on the disability and see the rating. But on the phone, they can't tell you reason for decision. Have to wait for papers to show up in the mail.
If it's in the portal, but don't have the letter, and says, "Hey, we made a adecision about you and here it is, but we're not going to tell you why right now."

## Apppeals

Called VSO: said he didn't agree with the decision. Felt that score didn't reflect what he had said during his exam.

November start: VSO rep left. Started again in December 2013. Filed in March 2013. Sent supplmenetal information (letters from people he's worked with). Didn't hear anything for almost a year. Sent a request for a hearing (in-person or video). Aseked VSO: told that the process is quicker for video. December 2015 signed that.
Did not hear more until April 2017: got an appt at VA (for 3 days later).
Got the exact same doctor . Stayed for 5 minutes. She said I was there for something I didn't think I was tehre for.
Said this wass a random check every  years to see if you're making process. Didn't make sense that this could happen in the middle of the appeal. VSO later told him.
"How hav eyou been?" She started typing away at her computer again.
Admitted his rating shoudl have been 70% not 30%, But wouldn't change ffective date. Should go back to initial claim, but appeal date was May 2017. Now appealing the date.
If efffective date goes back to 2012, the tenure of time for PTSD: at 10 years, rating sticks. Every 5 years they can re-evaluate you. 
Appeals: shots in the dark. No status updates. Just says, you have been scheduled for a VBA hearing. Doesn't even say your stuff was received.

Has tried calling VSO--hard to get them on on the phone.

There should be a different way to track appeals. If I go to "Open Appeals" it doesn't show my appeal. It shows as "Historical Appeal" even thought still open. Wants better information.

Historical Claim doesn't have all records from original claim accessible.

Was stuck for 3 years at "originating VA office" but doesn't know which office that is so how do I contact them?

IF you're going to put a system in place to automate and streamline the process, it should be more intuitive. You should know where stuff's at. Kind of like DOmino's. At least you know that your pizza's in the oven. Tell me it's in the oven."

Appeals: call and find out you were gathering evidence, but we found out we needed your signature in this block. Would have been nice to know that on the site. Now have to wait 3 more months and last in line again.

Supplementary information: from wife and friend, statements about outbursts, not being in crowds, etc. 

VSO: have to go into eBen to change your VSO. Otehrwise the VSO can't a
Painful to change VSO. Hit dropsdown, shows VSO's in area, no search function. 8 at a time of hundreds of VSOs, go apge by page.

Apeal: submit written form, but track on eBen. But go in and get nothing there.

### VSOs and other sources of info

Chose PVA based on recommendation from friend. has only worked on phone. One of the few that will work with my wife. ONe of the only ones who will do that. 

Hepful with the rating increase, but not the effective date. Gaot information about whether o not it was worth appealing the effective date. Talked to someone at the VA: called and said we should continue.

If VSO had recommended not to appeal date, would have agreed. Knows that they know the system. It's a cloud haning over you. Do I have time to take off work and drive to DC? Etc. Not worth it unless you expect it to work.

Does not feel ever misled in process, "NO, you need to have information to be misled."

Yuku, called firends, va website, all message boards, bashed on Twitter. Even a retrweet or post on Facebook and link to other Veternas, you can open up channels to maybe get something done.

Message boards: 
learned about them from Google
Googled "PTSD ratings decisions"]
BVA (board of veteran appeals) posts appeals decided on. 
A vet that's been appeailng from 2005; kept misisng hearing and rescheudling; when they got them, the originating office was not informing him that he had appointments.
Missed 4 VBA hearings.

Still doesn't have email or paper with docket # for appeal. Docket # is specific to the hearing. Tracks where you're at the process. 1310 = beginning of docket number for appeals filed in October 2013.
bva.va.org  (probalby .gov)
shows hisorical decisions
SOme from vietnam era only got decided last month.
You can understand how BVA is handling appeals and gives you a leg up on decisions, letngth of time. Sets expectations for how long it will take.

eBen: syas normal cycle for appeal is 298 days. 
some states are known for processing fast (Washington State) others are known for slow (North Carolina)

### eBen

Showed us historical claim info. Showed all "requests" e.g. information needed from "you" (Vet) over time (dates no longer shown).

Eg. STRs and RMCs (doesnt' know ahtat thesea re)

E.g. Service Treamtnet Records needed (said he has already submitted with original application)

E.g. COmbat info not verified (doesn't know how to do that)

ITF info link: links to  pdf named "burial fact sheet" (though does have ITF info)

"Search decisions" keywords + years and can see docket numbers and can have hearing from BVA:. Can see which were decided and when they were originated.

70K records in BVA
Can see which kinds of cases get decided in the Veteran's favor and decide whether worth it.

Instructions on BVA process are helpful (except when it tells you to go to eBen since there's no useful info there).

Particular parts of eBen 526, or claim evidence that is hard to get?
Mental health records from private provider.
Know exactly where you were, time frame, pic up in person phycially to get records. 
Can't get them transferred and won't be mailed. 

Or the VA can get the records for her. Sign paper to allow the records to be transferred to VA. No visibility into how long it took. "AS you can see on site, didn't really update."

Requests for more documents was received in a letter. But nothing popped up in eBen. WOuld get letters about progress, etc. but no match to what's visible on eBen. "There is no correlation between the two."

When received letters, call VSO: do I sign this? Wording is confusing. Which option to check? WHat does "De novo" mean? WOuld be nice if those were explained. Now knows that "de novo" is not for an appeal; means to start fresh. Turned down "De Novo" -- then had to do formal appeal.
Chose "de novo" because felt that he was right and she (md) didn't do it right. Having her do it again was confirmation.

"If you start yoru claim when you're in the military, it goes faster than if you start it when you get out" The appointments getting scheduled are easier b/c you're sitll in." Did not know this when he was serving. 3-week wait time for active duty vs 9mos-year. Some people expect a decision at the moment they get out.

Education forms: ITT Tech is no longer a school, lost accreditation. Has to backpay the VA b/cause accounting blip. Can't search "education appeals" on va site. 

## Wrap-up

What would you do differently? Get a VSO from the start. Not too many other options.

Unsung hero? would not.

VSO (PVA): can't give authorization to pull health records but can do many other things

VA superwoers:

- read fast to get through backlog (appeals)
- better customer service
  - caring about giving people help
  - VA hostiptal: went in May with no disability card; went early; system was down; went back 3 hours later after appt; system still down; took picture, was going to have card printed; freezes on photo; try a new computer; can't get it to work. Our supervisor is at lunch, wait 10min? Supervisor didn't know he was tehre: what am I supposed to do about it? felt like he was bothering them. Asked for ID, announced 7-10 days, slammed door. Worst expereince ever--felt like a #.
