## What We Know

### Overall Pain Points
* "I know the process of receiving my disability rating will be slow. I'm ready for that. They have a lot of people and a lot of paperwork to get through." – Tony, Veteran
* “Only tell a Veteran what's relevant.” – Jim, VSO
* "I would like to know from the source—I want to learn from VA—I want clear language when getting ready to apply." – Jenn & Howie, Veteran & Spouse
* "You know how to describe something but you don't know what it's called. Vets don't speak VA." – Kristina, Veteran 
* "This application is in lawyer and insurance speak." – Phillip, Veteran 
* "Why aren't My HealtheVet and eBenefits connected?" – Meg, Veteran 

### Getting Started

__Researching Requirements__

Veterans lean heavily on other Veterans, friends and family for information about the process. 

One Veteran told us they went on a "learning spree," searching forums and contacting older Veterans.

* “Getting started was the most frustrating.” - Phillip
* "Everything in the military is figure it out on your own unless you find someone who's done it before and who cares about you." – Codi, Veteran
* "I learned early on from my peers to collect my medical records at the beginning of my service." – Rob & Taylor, Veterans
* "I don't know what to do next or how to figure it out so I'll just go to DAV and they'll help me." – Joy, Veteran
* “I don't know what I'm entitled to. Do I fit into that criteria? I don't know just by reading.” – Josh, Veteran
* "I called and was told I was not eligible until I got a rating so I did nothing for 2-3 years. Many spiral and commit suicide." – Jenn & Howie, Veteran & Spouse
* “I was on a learning spree.” – Lisa, Veteran
* "Am I taking valuable resources from 'more deserving' fellow Veterans?" – Kasie, Veteran
* "Did anything happen automatically when I separated from the service?" – Meg, Veteran
* “I am my best advocate.” – Lisa, Veteran

__Gathering Documents__

Service members and Veterans have it drilled into their mind that they must keep all paperwork. The nature of these records -- private and not digitized -- makes accessing these records after separation nearly impossible.

[Veteran Name] needed to get her records from California to Virginia so she could file the records and upload them to her eBenefits application.

[Veteran Name] was able to retrieve his records from the Pentagon in-person using some creative tactics.

Phillip, fortunately, took the warning to keep all of his records quite seriously. He said his records sat in a box for years until he decided to file a claim.

* "Doing the claim wasn’t hard. Getting stuff for the claim was hard." – Meg, Veteran

### Apply using eBenefits

* "Tell me: what's happening, what's next, what's needed--no jargon." – Rob & Taylor, Veterans
* “Well, that sounds like a lot of work.” 
* “It is not going to take me one hour and ten minutes to do this. It is going to take me one hour and ten minutes to read this.” – Carolyn, Veteran 
* "Why the burden is on the Veteran is unclear--it shouldn't be." – Meg, Veteran 

__Personal Information__

* "Anything that compiles my military documents and doesn't require me to do any additional work would be awesome." – Jason, Veteran
* “I wish my DD214 was available on eBenefits. I expected it to be.” – Lamar, Veteran
* "Why do you need me to provide my service history? You have this!" – Carolyn, Veteran
* "The VA should be able to get this information. Why do I have to provide it?" – Jason, Veteran 

__Entering Claims__

The Veteran strategically adds conditions. They learned they will need to show a trail of evidence to support that claim.

__Submitting Evidence__

* What do I need to supply to get a rating? 

Adding evidence is overwhelming because of the high stakes and difficulty getting access to their records.
* "I have to compile proof for 7 different items and have my service-connectedness re-rated. I am overwhelmed. It's just too many steps." – Joy, Veteran

Doing the claim wasn’t hard. Getting stuff for the claim was hard.

* "Because I knew the process, the paperwork wasn’t hard." – Meg, Veteran
* “I had to write out an account of my PTSD trauma, it was like it happening again.” – Steven, Veteran 
* "I wasn't prepared to retell my PTSD story to a physician I didn't know, and write it on a separate form, when I was filing for my disability compensation increase. It didn't feel good to be surprised." – Carmen, Veteran 
* "I don't understand how to get all my personal medical records into the system. Am I really supposed to scan each one?" – Jason, Veteran

__Requesting a Decision__

The Veteran did a lot of legwork to submit their claim. They hope the time spent will pay off.

### Checking Status

Logs on to eBenefits to check claim has been started. No status updated in tracker.

Reviews letters from VA with status updates.

Looks for information online regarding status and upcoming exams.

Provides new evidence to the VA.

Goes to the doctor for medical exam.

* "The status goes back and forth and this is confusing the Veterans. you should rethink or simplify steps." – Zorina, Veteran
* Check claim status: “Why isn’t there a Domino’s Pizza Tracker for my claim?” – Steven, Veteran
* Calendar mostly records past events, not future. "Appointment shows up [in eBenefits] after you've had it." – Steven, Veteran

__Phone__

Does not trust information found online in claim status. Calls VA support for help.

* "My biggest fear in life is having to call the 1-800 number." – Jenn & Howie, Veteran & Spouse
* Sometimes phone support just auto-disconnects. Not “larger than usual call volume” just dropped. – Steven, Veteran

### Received Decision

* "Access to my decision letter online instead of waiting for a hard copy would be great." – Joy, Veteran
* “I didn’t know what the benefits were, I just knew I had money in my account." – Jason, Veteran
* “Once you’re in the system, service is great!” – Phillip, Veteran
* Have to fill out the entire form in eBenefits again for an increase. "It's hard to find previous claims." – Carolyn, Veteran
* "I expect most Veterans not to understand their decision." – Jim, VSO
* The "why" behind the decision is a guessing game.
