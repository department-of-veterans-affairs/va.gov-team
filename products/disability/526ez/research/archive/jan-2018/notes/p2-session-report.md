# Participant Description

Describe the participant in a few sentences, including their role within the system, why we’ve chosen them for a feedback session and relevant demographic information.

# Key Findings

List summary Info here. 3 to 4 bullet points

## From Research Goals

1. **Are users able to successfully self-select onto the correct path (claim for increase)?**
   1. Successful once he got to triage. Hard time getting there initially, didn't think "apply" was the right word.
2. **Do users feel supported during the flow?**
   1. Pro:
      1. responded to some of the language in a positive way
      2. Log in: name and info, then flash questions. appreciated the checking in. described it as a pause.
   2. Con:
      1. had a question that we answered later, but he didn't know that
         1. (maybe) beginning of evidence: If I'm being treated by the VA, they should be able to get my info. If I'm being treated by a third party, I'll have to sign an affidavit… [he made the correct assumption]
      2. End, after he submitted: "now I wait 7 years to submit it. any way to see if it's been received? do I sit on my hands for 60 days?"
      3. Expected a confirmation - when someone was reviewing his claim. He knew his application went in. wanted to know when someone was looking at it.
   3. ?:
      1. Homelessness: he knows homeless veterans and they expect proactive help
      2. Emphasis on suicidal thoughts. high frequency of it in his circle, expected them to get immediate help. Phone calls amongst his peers - they expect someone to reach out
      3. Sign in options? talked about it when we probed on it, but he clicked MyHealthEVet first
3. **Do users feel confused during the flow?**
   1. **What would users do if they were moving to a new address in the future? (forwarding address)**
      1. Wouldn't fill it out until after he moved
      2. Didn't think the forwarding address was it
4. **Are users able to get to the end of the flow and "submit" without feeling cheated by VA?**
   1. Generally didn't feel cheated
   2. Just doubts about when someone is going to get back. Would probably call back in 60 days, they may ask for another thing and then he'd have to wait another 60 days
5. **Do users easily understand whether to upload supplemental docs / what types of docs to upload?**
   1. He understood it. He has been strongly advised by a representative (looks like a non-accredited VSO)
   2. He named the correct documents that it would be helpful to see
   3. **How important it is to veterans to upload additional documents?**
      1. He said to "throw everything at them" - wanted to upload everything he had because it could only help his case
         1. This may be based on his expectation for an original claim
6. **What should we expect about how often a user would leave and come back in the process before submitting?**
   1. He would if he didn't have all the documents he needed. Would like to be able to go in and out to upload documents as needed
   2. **Do they know their progress is saved if they leave and come back?**
      1. Assumed he would have to start over. But if he had to start over, it wouldn't be a big deal
7. **Expectations / reactions about length of form**
   1. Within his expectations. Didn't seem surprised at the end, just pleased.

## Other Findings

1. ​Interested in having access to his records digitally? Maybe just in the context of his claim? Maybe about redundancy, if something happened with the original records he had
2. Interested in knowing when it will be live

# Convergences 

What themes or ideas do we see here that we’ve seen elsewhere?

1. Also maybe interested in indicating multiple practices for a condition?
2. Successful in triage step, once he got there
3. Wanted to sign in first

# Divergences

What’s different about this interview? (note what’s different about this interview can easily become a convergence later)

1. Understood supplemental documents
2. Wanted to upload everything with supplemental docs (as opposed to p1)
3. Didn't get the forwarding address

# Key Quotes:

1. I do like the suicide one, it's such a big deal. I dont' know any Vet that hasn't been affected by it, in terms of they've thought it themselves or know someone who's killed themselves. I have quite a few buddies who've killed themsleves since getting out. It's sad bc every time we try to make contact w/everyone to see how folks are doing since getting out, but it's kind of a short term thing… I'd hope that I'd be contacted by someone. Because honestly if I click on it and it just gives me resources... the homeless veterans I know they don't want resources, they want someone to reach out to them. It's not like let me read about resources and then I might not kill myself, they need someone to talk to them. That's what I would hope would happen. Plus you said that... if my PTSD is getting worse, I'm probaly having thoughts of suicide, so if I'm here...
2. (If I didn't hear anything for 60 days) I'd probably call the help line and I wouldn't be mad at the person on the other end of the line, but I'd be mad at the process. I thought I did everything right, what did I do wrong? What else do I need?

## Next Steps From Discussion

* Iterate
  * We probably don't want people to log in first and have to go through ID.me and then end up being redirected to eBenefits - may need to adjust landing page for that
    * Can test this via an unmoderated test - Optimal Workshop has a tool. ([Chalmark?](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/chalkmark)) Melissa can help set it up. Rachael says yes please.
* Fix bugs in prototype?
  * ~~mock up a "Log in first flow?"~~ - not a big deal, decided not to do it
  * add blurb that we will save their progress 
  * Change the ["your disabilities" step](https://adhoc.invisionapp.com/share/7KFC6I9XFZ2#/screens/273512369) to allow users to select only one condition at a time so that we know if they would select both or only one before continuing
* Modify conversation guide / moderation
  * How to go in and come back to the forms - how do we ask in a not leading way?
    * Phone call and have to step away, what do you expect to happen?
    * If we couldn't access their VA records and they had to search for them?
  * See if people naturally select only one of the two conditions that got worse and go all the way through for one at a time, or if they select both before they continue.
