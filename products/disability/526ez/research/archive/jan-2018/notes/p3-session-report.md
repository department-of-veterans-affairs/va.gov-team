# Participant Description

Said she started a claim, but didn't finish. not sure if she put in an intent to file. Probably used eBenefits, but couldn't quite confirm that. Intent to file is probably expired

# Key Findings

List summary Info here. 3 to 4 bullet points

## From Research Goals

1. **Are users able to successfully self-select onto the correct path (claim for increase)?**
   1. Went around in circles for a bit. Initially picked the correct option. then when asked, chose appeal, just wanted to make changes on it. Then asked which one she would choose, chose the right one
2. **Do users feel supported during the flow?**
   1. Triage section: redirect to eBenefits step. said "I think it's going to be fast since you preselected new or worsening… you know me"
3. **Do users feel confused during the flow?**
   1. Login: didn't understand the difference between the options. which one do you want me to use.
      1. Thought the one she chose would have an impact on the application process. "does it matter which one you sign into?"
   2. Some confusion on Language in treatment history
   3. Felt confused the majority of the time, starting from landing page. Wanted to go back in the breadcrumbs "disability comp" to see more options. Wanted to go to help and type extension of benefits to get a library.
   4. Said she was understanding to placate us but was actually confused
   5. Wanted to go to help several times
   6. Didn't understand "since your rating" language
      1. may have interpreted "since" as "because"
   7. didn't understand buddy statements
   8. confused that we have her VA medical records but then we asked for VA medical records
   9. Facilities - only thought she could add one
   10. 95 days:
      1. is it business days or calendar days?
      2. thought it wasn't necessarily submitted yet. thought there was an arbitrary date in the future when it would be submitted, worried about expirations
      3. thought they would drop her case if someone didn't pick it up in that time frame
   11. **What would users do if they were moving to a new address in the future? (forwarding address)**
       1. Would edit the primary address
       2. Would wait until she moved until filling it out
       3. Thought forwarding address was a fallback, not a permanent change
4. **Are users able to get to the end of the flow and "submit" without feeling cheated by VA?**
5. **Do users easily understand whether to upload supplemental docs / what types of docs to upload?**
   1. **How important it is to veterans to upload additional documents?**
6. **What should we expect about how often a user would leave and come back in the process before submitting?**
   1. **Do they know their progress is saved if they leave and come back?**
7. **Expectations / reactions about length of form**

## Other Findings

1. Didn't think eBenefits would be a separate thing.
2. Wanted to double check everything in review page to make sure it's right
   1. Review veteran details, treatment records
      1. wanted to click on review veteran details to make sure all the medical info was in there
