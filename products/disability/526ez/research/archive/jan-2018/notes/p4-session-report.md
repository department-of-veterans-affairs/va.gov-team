# Key Findings

List summary Info here. 3 to 4 bullet points

## From Research Goals]

1. **Are users able to successfully self-select onto the correct path (claim for increase)?**
   1. Not initially. Frustrated by getting redirected to eBenefits many times with other options.
2. **Do users feel supported during the flow?**
   1. NO. Very suspicious.
      1. Upload your own documents or getting them from the facility: didn't trust the VA to pull his records in a timely manner
   2. mentioned several times quitting and going to an advocate.
      1. They know how to play the game, and he doesn't want to
3. **Do users feel confused during the flow?**
   1. Some confusion on Language in treatment history
   2. **What would users do if they were moving to a new address in the future? (forwarding address)**
      1. ?
4. **Are users able to get to the end of the flow and "submit" without feeling cheated by VA?**
5. **Do users easily understand whether to upload supplemental docs / what types of docs to upload?**
   1. MRI files: may not be able to upload them. Very specific file format
      1. *Internal note: What does the VA do with those files?*
         1. *Doesn't trust outside records, would be liable for the records, have to do their own exams to avoid liability*
         2. *Does the VA actually look at the records? How useful are the files?*
         3. *Would taking a photo of an MRI from a phone be useful?*
         4. *Is the VA getting the doctor reports on MRIs, or the actual MRIs themselves?*
   2. **How important it is to veterans to upload additional documents?**
6. **What should we expect about how often a user would leave and come back in the process before submitting?**
   1. **Do they know their progress is saved if they leave and come back?**
7. **Expectations / reactions about length of form**

## Other Findings

1. ​
2. Initially wanted to fill it out as a hard copy. Traumatic brain injury. Seemed it would be easier for him to fill out paper. 
   1. Maybe easier to keep context seeing the whole form on paper versus sliced up into small bits on screens

## Discussion

A discussion covering the following points:

* Identify key issues in the results, particularly results that are large or unexpected.
* Give possible explanations for the results, including explanations related to the program as well as external causes. 
* Discuss the implications of the results for the outcomes and impact of the program.
* Outline potential recommendations based on findings.
  * Do we need to:
    * Iterate?
    * Fix bugs in prototype?
    * Modify conversation guide?
    * Adjust number of future participants?
