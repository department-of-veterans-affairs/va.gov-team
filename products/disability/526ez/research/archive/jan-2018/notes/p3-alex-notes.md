Army, last deployed in 2014

- Washington DC
- Filed about a year after separation from the Army
  - Applied because she found out she was eligible
  - Advice from some peers
  - Maybe eBenefits?
- Very lengthly for me, all the information that you have to put in, but had to re-do it. Got a message that my email was already being used. I didn't understand why it wasn't linking. Maybe it expires if you haven't been on in a while
- Still in the process. About an hour of the application first time. I like to read every little thing. I want to make sure that I'm eligible, something you hear one thing but read another.
- Trying to avoid putting in the wrong information. Had to change names, and some other things to keep it up to date.
- Does this (save) mean that I'm going to pick up my existing account?
- I would go to help to see if there is anything about how I can extend benefits
- I would choose "I never filed before " because I haven't finished the claim
- I first though I would choose appeal to make...
- I would choose new or worsening > and choose new conditions
- I'm thinking it's going to be fast since they highlighted new or worsening. It feels like you know me. I would expect that it would be simple like this. I wouldn't need to fill out my address and stuff like that.
- I don't know which one to sign in with.
  - I don't think I have an account. I do have a MHV login. I don't have insurance with them. But I would try MHV.
  - I don't understand the difference. 
- Details screen was expected
- I just did a study on one of these (flashes) the other day
  - I think these are what qualify you for disability?
  - Where is the help section?
    - I would call the 1800 vets number
    - These categories might have other categories under them?
- Would edit the address if moving
  - In case you can't send to one address you could send to another
- (Concerns) concerned about incorrect charges. Worried about having to keep track of it. Everything is weird and tricky now. I would be very careful. I would put it in. I'd have to trust my government account. I might use another bank account that I use less often.
- Chooses just one option first.
- "Since your rating" what is it worded like that?
- "Buddy statements" what are those?
- "You will not need to add VA medical records if all you have are VA medical record you can't add them?"
- "If you don't have my records you're not going to get back to me"
- "It looks like you only have space for one. I would squeeze it all in there. I need a little more space"
- **Review**: I would check my details to make sure you had it right
- "I wish there was an estimate of when it would be seen"
- It would be nice to have an expiration date. It will be filed no later than  .It will be submitted today, but when will it get seen"
- "Is it 95 business days?"
- Does that mean that if you haven't gotten something in 95 days does that mean you need to start over?
