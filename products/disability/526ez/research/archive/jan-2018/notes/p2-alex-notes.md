- Army Infantry 2004-2010
- Fayetville, Arkansas
  - Birds and Gardening
- Therapist suggested filing a claim
  - Back issue started, and lead to PTSD 
- Two brothers have experience and are helping
- Buddy statements and family statements
- Visited VA to get advice
  - End of November
- Have not considered online, because the process is overwhelming
  - Maybe online process or maybe all of it
- If you are doing it on your own you don't know what people are looking for and you end up filing an appeal anyway
  - I didn't want to go through the process twice!



- First up I would sign in because I have some information already in the system and I'm going to be adding to the pile
- Apply for disability seems redundant if I already did this once
  - “Maybe apply or update?”
- “Normally you appeal anyway, is the standard as I understand it”
- I don't know how all the websites are interconnected. Isn't DS Logon using the CAG card?
- Seems like Facebook, there are three options and they are all the same
  - It seems like every time I use DS logon I have to change my password
  - I don't know what ID.me is
- I would assume I would see the {identifying details} 
- I would hope that I would be contacted by someone
  - I don't want resources, I want someone to reach out and contact me
- A lot of things I see with the VA lately do this thing that I like
  - Login > Is this you? > Are you ok? > Ok, let’s go on
- I would wait to move and then update, and probably forget
- I've moved around a lot and I never started a claim because I knew if I moved I would have to start over.
- Not sure what forwarding would do
  - Would it update on a certain date? Is it permanent?
- I like how it says buddy statements, that's what I call them too
- If I am getting treated at a VA medical center I would assume that they would be able to get any records from my therapist
  - If it was my private doctor I would assume that I would have to sign an affidavit or something
- I assume the dates are to only get the information for this condition
- More is always better.
  - I'd upload it to have a digital copy
- I wish I could see if they got it
- I like a notification that someone is actively reviewing it. As long as I know someone is working on it I can wait. I just don't want to wait while it sits in an inbox
- I would call
  - I wouldn't be mad at the person on the phone, but I'd be mad at the process
- I like that it’s simple
- Effective date is the day they will pay me from
