# Participant Description

Describe the participant in a few sentences, including their role within the system, why we’ve chosen them for a feedback session and relevant demographic information.

# Key Findings

List summary Info here. 3 to 4 bullet points

## From Research Goals

1. **Are users able to successfully self-select onto the correct path (claim for increase)?**
   1. very quick, successful.
2. **Do users feel supported during the flow?**
   1. Did up until a point. 
      1. look for a quote (Melissa can find it later)
         1. Reflections at the end: wouldn't have questioned anything up until supporting documents
      2. First screen about evidence (content page before selecting VA or private doctor)
         1. "do i have to have my VA info for this? thought they'd already have my VA documents"
   2. Liked being able to have her military history pre-populated
   3. Confirmation screen after submitting: would save info for her own records, used to the VA losing documents
3. **Do users feel confused during the flow?**
   1. **What would users do if they were moving to a new address in the future? (forwarding address)**
      1. Understood forwarding address right away
         1. Consider microcopy around it, curious how it plays out for other participants
4. **Are users able to get to the end of the flow and "submit" without feeling cheated by VA?**
   1. Yes
5. **Do users easily understand whether to upload supplemental docs / what types of docs to upload?**
   1. On her first pass, she went through it successfully - when asked later if she had concerns about this step, said "I don't know what other supporting documents might be… no clue what those might be"
   2. **How important it is to veterans to upload additional documents?**
      1. Not very important in her first pass - went through and chose no to supplemental documents
      2. At the end: "I'll just wait and see"
      3. After digging in - "don't think I have anything to upload. am I supposed to?"
6. **What should we expect about how often a user would leave and come back in the process before submitting?**
   1. Didn't seem to understand that you can save and come back
      1. *add this to the conversation guide*
   2. Wanted to sign in at first, but not sure what the value would be for her - having info filled in?
7. **Expectations / reactions about length of form**
   1. Didn't think twice about it
   2. Surprised at the end at how quick it was

## Other Findings

1. Login screen - recognized ID.me
   1. Chose MyHealthEVet because she just remembered her password for it
2. *curious whether people who don't have an account to any of those questions understand that you can click one to sign up*
3. Personal Flash options
   1. *Tech question: she hoped someone would contact her if she selected one of the personal flash options. Think those aren't actually going anywhere. Think we have data to display for users, but don't think we can send it anywhere. If we can, will someone reach out?*
4. Triage
   1. "Oh, that's kind of sucky (that you can't file for an appeal in vets.gov)"

# Convergences 

What themes or ideas do we see here that we’ve seen elsewhere?

1. ​

# Divergences

What’s different about this interview? (note what’s different about this interview can easily become a convergence later)

1. ​

# Key Quotes:

1. it was a lot easier than I thought it would be. I mean, it’s really straight forward in getting the information for you. It takes a lot of the confusion out of it. 
2. I guess because I’m kind of used to the VA losing paperwork and documents. My entire military medication medical records. For my own safety I would certainly save a copy of this page (the confirmation screen).

## Next Steps From Discussion

* Quotes
  * (Melissa) find the quote you referred to about feeling supported up to a point
* Conversation Guide
  * Added changes to the [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/jan-2018/conversation-guide.md)
* Moderation
  1. *don't worry about being pushy about asking participants to think out loud*
  2. *Emotions check? - feel free to ask explicitly*
  3. *Seemed to be awaiting instructions - can we set expectations up front that they can run with the prototype*
* Tech investigation (Rachael)
  1. She hoped someone would contact her if she selected one of the personal flash options. Think those aren't actually going anywhere. Think we have data to display for users, but don't think we can send it anywhere. If we can, will someone reach out?
* Reframer / Github
  * Let's use Github for verbatim notes
  * and Reframer for synthesis
    * Add a lot of observations and quotes up front as you get them, and we can narrow them down in synthesis
