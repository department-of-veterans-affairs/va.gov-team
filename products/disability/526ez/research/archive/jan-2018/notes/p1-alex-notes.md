Estimates 20-30 minutes to complete (mental model)

- DS_Logo if you were active duty
- MHV is awesome, it's easy
- Recognized ID.me
  - Choose MHV because she doesn't remember ID.me password
- Flash questions look like standard new doctor questions
  - Would hope that flash would make someone call
- Recognized forwarding address purpose
- “At this point I'd normally be off trying to find my DD214”
- Recognizes banking info is to pay her
  - The blanked out numbers are nice if I'm in a library
  - The VA has to have my banking info
- Evidence intro:
  - It looks like this is for getting outside doctor records
  - I would hope the VA would already have my VA records
- I'm guessing I could choose either or both (VA/Private)
- That makes is easier that they will go get that information
  - It's surprising that they will
  - That makes it a lot easier
- I don't like that you have to pick on or the other you should be able to pick both
  - I can get seen for the same condition both inside and outside the VA
    - Why?
      - Specialist outside VA system
        - Brings those records in to Primary or VA neuro to get treatment authorized 
    - Recognizes release of paperwork form
      - I've seen the paper version of this. This is standard even on a civilian doctor.
- I'm not sure what other documents you would need
  - It would make me think I might need other documents that I don't know about


- That was a lot easier than I thought it would be. It kinda takes a lot of the confusion out of it
- The application is effective the day you apply… back pay to that date
- Would save the confirmation screen
  - I'm used to the VA losing paperwork and docs. My entire military medical records, I save everything.
- Now you just wait
  - Everything is submitted, now you just wait to hear back from the VA on their decision
  - Used to get a big manilla envelope in the mail
- Find out what happens after you apply
  - I guess it would tell you to be patient and wait

## Questions

1. If she remembered ID.me password would she have chosen differently?
