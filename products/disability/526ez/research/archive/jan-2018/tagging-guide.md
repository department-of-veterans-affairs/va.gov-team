An initial set of tags to use for [this project in Reframer](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/a/adhoc/reframer/projects/12486) so that we can have consistency and gather themes. If you come up with a need for a tag that's not included here, please feel free add it to Reframer. It's helpful to include a description for new tags (use the description field in Reframer) so that others know what they mean and can use them in the same way.

# Research Project Goal: Tags

1. Are users able to successfully self-select onto the correct path (claim for increase)? - **tag: selfselection**
   1. Is it useful for only claims for increase to be possible in vets.gov and to have to go to eBenefits for other types of disability applications? - **tag: scope**
2. Do users feel supported during the flow? - **tag: feelingofsupport**
3. Do users feel confused during the flow? - **tag: confusion**
   1. What would users do if they were moving to a new address in the future? (forwarding address) - **tag: forwardingaddress**
4. Are users able to get to the end of the flow and "submit" without feeling cheated by VA? - **tag: cheatedbyVA**
5. Do users easily understand whether to upload supplemental docs / what types of docs to upload? - **tag: supportingdocuments**
   1. How important it is to veterans to upload additional documents? - **tags: "supportingdocuments" and "usefulness"**
6. What should we expect about how often a user would leave and come back in the process before submitting? - **tags: "saving" and "usefulness"**
   1. Do they know their progress is saved if they leave and come back? - **tag: saving**
7. Expectations / reactions about length of form - **tag: length**

## "Painpoint", "neutral", "success"

1. Use these tags to indicate whether an observation indicates a problem or a successful outcome. It's possible to combine them with each other, and we should combine them with other tags when possible to indicate the topic covered. For example, if a user had a problem with supporting documents, use both the tags "painpoint" and "supportingdocuments". 
2. It is also possible for a single observation to be both a painpoint and success if it is successful in some way but also a painpoint in another sense. In that case, use both the "painpoint" and "success" tags



# Other Tags

1. **usefulness** - a finding indicating whether some functionality is useful to the user, as opposed to whether it is usable
2. **background** - a noteworthy finding about a participant's background (don't need to list every participant's background here - that's what verbatim notes are for)
3. **initialapplication** - a noteworthy finding about the participant's inital or prior disability claim experience
4. **login** - finding about the login process / choices
   1. Combine with individual login method tags. I.e. if there is an observation about using id.me to login, use both the "login" and "idme" tags
      1. **idme**
      2. **myhealthevet**
      3. **dslogon**
5. **overall** - finding about the process as a whole
6. **quote** - Doesn't mean anything to us. Reframer will automatically add this any time you put in an observation with quotation marks. Don't worry about deleting each instance of this tag - we can easily bulk-delete them at the project level at the end.
7. **researchprocess** - a meta-tag. Ways we can improve our research process for next time
8. **shareout** - a finding worth sharing outside of this research project - something that impacts other projects or the roadmap
