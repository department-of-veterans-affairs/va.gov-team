# Agenda

We should have generated a lot of raw material at this point in Reframer and Github between verbatim notes and session report documents from the mini-debriefs, so let's take this time to assess what we have, refine it, and discuss how to present / document it.

1. Review themes at a high level across all sessions ([outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/jan-2018/readout-outline.md))
   1. From research goals
   2. Other themes related to the project
   3. What did we learn that's relevant outside of this project?
2. Do we have enough data? From the right participants?
3. Discuss report / readout approach
