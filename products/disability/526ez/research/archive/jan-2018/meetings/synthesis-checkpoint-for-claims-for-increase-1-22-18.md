# Agenda

We should have generated a lot of raw material at this point in Reframer and Github between verbatim notes and session report documents from the mini-debriefs, so let's take this time to assess what we have, refine it, and figure out how to present it.

1. [Tagging guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/jan-2018/tagging-guide.md)
2. Add your [verbatim notes in Github](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability/526ez/research/jan-2018/notes) and [observations in Reframer](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/a/adhoc/reframer/projects/12486)
3. (got this far - do the rest in another checkpoint)
4. Review themes at a high level across all sessions
   1. From research goals
   2. Other themes related to the project
   3. What did we learn that's relevant outside of this project?
5. Do we have enough data? From the right participants?
6. Discuss report / readout approach



# Discussion

*Take a look at [Scheduling](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/a/adhoc/reframer/projects/11571/themes/47209#/t/overviewTab) as an example*

Entering observations into Reframer: Alex to start at P2 and work forward, Mike to start at p5 and work backwards

Mike to set up meeting with the group to review findings at the end of the week
