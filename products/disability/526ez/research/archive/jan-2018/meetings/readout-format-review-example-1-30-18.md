1. Prioritize the findings

2. overview of process can do double duty (also show the rigor of data we gathered)

3. Low info density up front, appendix as leave-behind for more support - Capture comments / notes for posterity

4. clear info hierarchy

5. Use the US Web Design Standards (Merriweather, Open Sans)

   Suzanne has a template for discovery readouts, but it's maybe broken? Can use Homepage document for now
