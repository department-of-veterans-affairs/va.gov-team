## Facebook Status

Are you a Veteran who is interested in or familiar with disability compensation? My team at the VA is working to improve online tools to better meet Veterans' needs, and we need Veteran feedback to help us get it right. The goal is to test concepts with Veterans like you to make sure they really work. It's important for us to know whether they're easy to understand.

This short online activity will take approximately 10 minutes and can be completed on your computer at a time that's convenient for you.
