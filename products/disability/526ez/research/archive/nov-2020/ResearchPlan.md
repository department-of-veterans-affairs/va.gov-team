Research Plan for a Usability test of Form 526 (PTSD flow). Part 1 of 2. 
=================================================================================

VSA B&M1 Team, Form 526, Christian Valla, November 2020.

Background
----------

This is Part 1 of 2 of a usability test of Form 526. 

Several changes have recently been made to Form 526. A comprehensive usability test with actual veterans is therefore needed. 

Veterans with a disability and who are planning to apply for a benefit for their condition(s), can use the online version of Form 526 to apply: <https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction>. 

A part of this form is specifically about applying for disability benefits for PTSD as condition(s).

Part 1 of the research, is a usability test of the PTSD part of Form 526. 

Goals
-----

-   To understand the current user experience, what usability issues exist, including confusing or unclear content/copy. 

-   Is the flow easy to understand and do participants have all the info they need?

-   Do participants feel that an adequate amount of information is presented?

-   Can participants go through the flow by themselves, without blockers or problems? 

Research questions
------------------

Overall:

-   What usability issues exist within the flow? 

-   Are participants able to successfully navigate to and through the form? What deviations exist from the anticipated happy path of the form and why?  

-   What kinds of frustrations and usability issues do participants experience throughout the flow? Do patterns exist? Why? 

-   Can participants successfully complete the flow without assistance from the moderator? 

-   Is the content and copy across Form 526 clear and concise? 

-   Is there ambiguity or confusion experienced by the participants within any of the pages within the 526 Form? 

-   Do the participants feel that they have all the information they need to complete the flow?

-   What is most helpful for the participants?

-   What is most confusing or unclear for the participants?

-   What part of the form is most frustrating or difficult for the participants to complete?

-   If you could change one thing within this experience, what would it be?

-   Why? / Tell me more?

-   Do participants feel that they are being asked about the appropriate level of detail?

-   Do they believe that they can remember this level of detail? 

-   Are the participants comfortable filling out the questions about their PTSD? 

-   If not, what questions are making them uncomfortable?

Details:

-   526 intro page: Is anything here confusing or unclear for the participants? 

-   New condition page: Are users confused by anything on this page? 

-   Are they confused by the terms "disabilities" and "conditions" used throughout the form? 

-   What do users think about the link: "What if I don't see my conditions?" Is it self-explanatory? Is any info here unclear or missing?

-   Do users value the text input box? 

-   Additional benefits page (about PTSD): Is there any confusion around choosing the correct checkbox on this page?

-   Do the participants understand what info is required and optional to enter on these pages? 

-   PTSD combat page: is there any confusion on what form (526 or 21-0781) to choose on this page? Do they think both are online forms? 

-   Do participants see value in the questions about honorary Medals? 

-   Assignment and event location page: do participants see value in these questions? What are they thinking about these questions?  

-   Individuals involved, name, ranking: what do participants feel about these questions? Would they remember these details? Do they see value in them?

-   Event description and additional details: do participants value these steps? 

-   Supporting evidence page: do the participants find this information easy to understand and self-explanatory? 

-   How many of the above-mentioned details do participants think they would be able to remember?

-   Does it make sense for participants that Contact info and bank info comes after the Summary of benefits page? 

-   Fully developed claim page: is the content on this page clear and easy to understand for participants, or is something unclear?  

Method
------

-   We will be conducting a remote, moderated usability study with approximately 8 Veterans (separated from active duty).

-   Allowing users to interact with and walk through the 526 Form online, on their own, in their own environment, can help us detect usability issues they encounter within the form, in a test situation that is as close as possible to a real user experience.

-   We will test the online version of the 526 Form in staging: <https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction>. 

-   We will provide veterans with a fake user ID in staging.

-   We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.

-   The sessions will include a short interview (3-5 min.) about their experience with VA.gov and any other disability benefits they have applied for, or have planned to apply for. 

-   We will ask Veterans to navigate to VA.gov (a link provided in the Zoom chat) and have participants share their screen with us via Zoom.

-   We will ask the participants to go through the 526 Form, specifically the PTSD part of the form, from its beginning to its end. 

-   We will ask participants to speak out loud as they move through the form, and probe for usability issues and relevant feedback. 

-   Pre-test interview questions will probe past experiences to unveil contextual details absent in a test including setting (location, time, tech), key frustrations, and goals/purpose behind accessing the form historically. [Write into conversation guide]

Participants and Recruitment
----------------------------

We would like to interview 8 participants.

-   In order to get 8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 13 participants total, with the expectation that there will be a max of 5 no-shows.

-   For the participant's Perigean recruits:

Primary criteria / Must have: 

-   All Participants must be Veterans (separated from active duty), with a PTSD condition.

-   Note: due to the sensitivity of this information, the participants will not be asked to describe their actual, personal experiences. We will provide a scripted scenario through Zoom's chat We will help them to create a "story" so they don't need to go through their trauma in this usability test.  

-   The participants must have applied for compensation for PTSD in the past, or they must be planning to do so in the near future.  

-   Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom.

-   At least 2 participants with a disability rating with a disability rating of 70% or greater and identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. 

-   50% of participants use a desktop or laptop.

-   50% of participants use a mobile device.

Secondary criteria  / Would like to have: 

-   Participants should be able to describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing, and what they are thinking, as they are interacting with VA.gov.

-   50% women, 50% men.

-   50% people who identify as an ethnicity/race other Caucasian.

-   At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55.

-   At least 1 participant without a college degree.

-   At least 1 participant who uses a screen reader.

-   Consider including more participants who use other assistive technologies (AT) as well: specialized keyboards, switches, and hearing aids are examples of AT that may be generally included.

When?

-   Timeline: The timeline for this study: 8-11 1-4 December 2020.

-   Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? It is ready now
