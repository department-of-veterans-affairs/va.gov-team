## INTRO - 5 MIN 
Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME] and \[NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, let me tell you what we will do.My colleagues and I work on va.gov, improving the site so that Veterans can submit claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. We hope to improve the process by talking to veterans like you.  Before we start, I want to confirm some information with you: 
* [ ] Do you use assistive technology (screen magnifier, screen reader, alternative nav) 

* [ ] Are you using the tech right now? 

  - [ ] What’s the type of AT and program you are using (ex. Screen reader, JAWS) 

  - [ ] What type of device and operating system  (mobile/desktop/tablet on Android/windows/mac) 

* [ ] Will you be using it for this study? \[if no to any of these questions, say “I’m sorry but unfortunately, you do not qualify for this study. Thank you for your time, but we will be ending this study. End the study] Great, we are good to continue. I have a few things that I want to go over with you:* [ ] We have an accessibility expert on this call in case we need any support 

* [ ] This entire session should take about 60 \[for screen magnifier and alt nav] and 90 \[for screen reader] minutes. 

* [ ] In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback

* [ ] If you want to stop the session for any reason or at any time, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of it we complete.

* [ ] Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - If yes: Admit observers.

  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

* [ ] Are you comfortable with me recording my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  - Moderator starts recording. (\*Ensure that you are recording to the account cloud\*)

  - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

* [ ] You will get a pop-up that the screen is recording, click “Ok” |

## WARM UP - 3 MIN
| Today we're going to be evaluating a website. Before we look at the website, I’d like to start with a few background questions and learn more about your experience with AT. AT user questions* [ ] How would you rate your level of experience using a screen reader/magnifier/alt nav - beginner/intermediate/advanced/expert 

* [ ] How long have you been using this AT?  

* [ ] When or how often do you use it 

* [ ] Have you encountered any specific challenges when using AT with VA websites or forms?Thank you for sharing that information. Next, I have a couple of questions about your experience with VA benefits.* Are you receiving any disability benefits from the VA?

  - When did you apply?

  - Do you recall how you filed claims in the past (online or by mail)?

  - How satisfied were you with the claim filing process?

* Are you in the process of or considering filing any new disability claims in the near future?

  - If yes, how do you intend to file the claims (online or by mail)? |


## TRANSITION TO WEBSITE - 2 MIN 

| Copy and paste website into chat or email link Today we are going to test out two versions of a website. Let’s start with the first version, Ape \[Condition by Condition] You have now entered the page on the disability benefits application where you input what NEW conditions you want to claim. This is a test account. Nothing you do today will impact your actual claim. I’d like you to go through this website as if this is your very first time applying for disability benefits. I’m going to ask you to think of your own situation as you move through and answer the questions.I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this page.  |


## PROTOTYPE #1 - 15 MIN 

## APE - CONDITION BY CONDITION 

 Alright, whenever you're ready, please start exploring the page, and please think aloud as you go through it. Go ahead and do what the page is asking you to do, then I’ll give you a few more tasks and scenarios. _Have participant enter their own conditions and answer all cause questions_  **Tasks*** [ ] Task 1: Add a condition

  - [ ] Try to have them submit 2 conditions without prompting, to see them navigate to “Add another condition” 

* [ ] Task 2: Add multiple conditions 

* [ ] Task 3: \[If they didn’t add any questions with side of body] Suppose you had “bursitis in your left knee”, how would you submit that?  After they’ve added all their conditions and answered all cause questions * [ ] Task 3: Edit a condition: You've realized you accidentally selected the wrong condition. You have bursitis in your right knee, not your left. How would you change that? 

* [ ] Task 4: Remove a condition: You've decided not to claim for 'bursitis in knee, left' at this time. Please remove this condition from your claim.After they’re done inputting everything**General*** [ ] What are your general impressions of this page?

* [ ] Was anything particularly challenging when using your assistive technology on this page?

* [ ] Did you encounter any unexpected behaviors or announcements from your assistive technology while using this page?**Survey**- [ ] Please rate your experience with entering conditions on this page 1. Very bad

2. Somewhat bad

3. Neither bad nor good

## COMPARISON - 20 MIN 
Now that you've tried both approaches:**General - First impressions after asking both** 1) Which approach did you prefer? What made you prefer it?

2) What were the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

3) How did the two approaches compare in terms of:

   - Mental effort required?

   - Time and efficiency?

   - Ease of providing accurate information?

   - Working with your assistive technology?

4) How did you feel about the number of pages/steps in each approach

5) How natural did the order of questions feel in each approach?

6) How did you handle recalling dates of when the condition began? Is this information you knew? 

7) Did you feel like you were able to provide complete information about your conditions in both approaches? Did one help you be more thorough?

8) Which approach would you recommend to other Veterans? Why?**Cause Questions**Now I'd like to ask about the questions regarding what caused your conditions_Bring them to that part of the prototype to reference_ 1) What was your initial reaction when you saw the questions about cause?

2) How clear was it to you why VA was asking about what caused your conditions?

3) When answering these questions:

   - How confident did you feel in your answers?

   - Were there any conditions where it was difficult to identify or explain the cause?

   - What made it easier or harder to answer these questions?

4) What concerns, if any, did you have about:

   - Answering these questions?

   - How your answers might affect your claim?

   - The level of detail needed?

5) Do you have any suggestions for:

   - Making these questions clearer?

   - Making it easier to provide cause information?

   - Additional information or guidance that would be helpful?Follow-up probes if needed:* Was there anything confusing about how the cause questions were worded?

* Did you feel like you had enough options to explain the cause?

* How did you decide what level of detail to provide?" |
| ### **Specific Topics to Probe (if not covered)**1) Laterality Selection (right/left/bilateral):

   - How did this work in each approach?

   - What was your experience with the condition list in each version?

2) Condition Timing:

   - What helped you determine dates in each version?

   - Which approach made it easier to recall timing information?

3) Cause Attribution:

   - How did the different flows affect your ability to explain cause relationships?
