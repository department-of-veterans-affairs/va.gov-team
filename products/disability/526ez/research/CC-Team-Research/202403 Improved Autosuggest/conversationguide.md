# INTRO

5 MIN 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME] and \[NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, let me tell you about what we will be doing.

My colleagues and I work on va.gov - making improvements to the site so that Veterans can submit claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. By talking to Veterans like you, we hope to better understand how we can help Veterans submit a strong claim. 

Today we're going to be looking at a prototype as part of the online disability claim form and asking you to imagine you are filling out the form based on your situation, or if you prefer, based on a made-up scenario. We will also be talking with you about your experience with disability claims. 

_What I don’t want to do is add to any frustration you may have_ had with getting benefits. We may look at things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation. However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the website in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- Feel free to ask any questions you may have at any point, but just know ahead of time that I may not be able to answer them until the end of the session.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?

  - _If no:_ Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - _If yes:_ Admit observers.

  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

  - _If yes_: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  - _Moderator starts recording. (_**\*Ensure that you are recording to the account cloud\*)**

  - I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## WARM UP

5 MIN 

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

- Talk to me about your past experience with disability benefits at the VA 

- Could you tell me about any disability benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 

  - _If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_

    - About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?

  - _If they are not getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_

    - Have you filed any claims previously? If so, what was the outcome of the claim? How did you file the claims (online or by mail)? 

    - Are you in the process of, or considering filing any new disability claims in the near future? How do you intend to file the claims (online or by mail)? 


## TRANSITION TO PROTOTYPE

5 MIN 

****

Great! Now let’s get into evaluating some prototypes.

We’re going to show you two prototypes that we’re working on.

- This prototype is not the real website, and it may not function exactly the way you expect. This conversation is to help us make decisions about how to improve the website in the future. 

- Some areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not. 

- And, since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

We’re going to go through a few different scenarios. I’m going to ask you to think of your own situation as you move through and answer the questions. If you don’t want to do that, then I will provide a hypothetical situation instead that you can use to answer. Are you comfortable thinking about your own situation for this exercise? 

I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

****

To save time, we are skipping the beginning of the form, including the introduction and the screens in section 1 where you enter your personal information and information about your military service. We’ll start you on the first screen of the second section. 

- _\[If they have filed previously (but do not have current plans in the near future:]_ 

  - You mentioned before that you have filed for a disability claim in the past. I’d like you to go back in time and imagine that you are filling out the form for that disability claim for the very first time. You’ve come to the VA website today and have started filling out the form. You have come to the screen where you are asked to specify the condition or conditions that you are filing for. 

- _\[If they are planning to file a new claim in the near future:]_

  - You mentioned before that you are considering filing a new disability claim in the near future. I’d like you to imagine that you are ready to fill out the new disability claim. You’ve come to the VA website today and have started filling out the form. You have come to the screen where you are asked to specify the condition or conditions that you are filing for. 

- _\[MOCK SCENARIO: If they have not filed in the past and do not have plans to file in the future, or they are uncomfortable speaking about their medical conditions:]_ 

  - I’d like you to imagine that you have 5 conditions that you’d like to claim. I’ll give you more details about those conditions as we look at the screens. 

    1. You are ready to start filling out the form for a new disability claim, and you’ve come to the VA website today to get started. You are on the screen where you are asked to specify the medical conditions that you are filing for. 

    2. _You hear a ringing or hissing sound in your ears. You believe that this is due to operating loud machinery during your active service._ 

    3. _Your right knee bothers you on a daily basis. You tore a tendon in the knee during active service and since then the knee has never recovered fully. It is painful when you walk downhill or try to kneel or squat._ 

    4. _You have developed bursitis in your right knee._

    5. _You have chronic congestion and full body aches_ 

    6. _Your doctor told you that you have Tonic-Clonic Seizures_

Before I send you the link to the prototype, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. If you have tabs you don’t want to show, you can close them before you share. 

_Wait for screen sharing to work (instructions for_ [_iphone_](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share) _and_ [_Android_](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share) _if participant is having trouble)._ 

Now, I’m going to put a link to the prototype **ADD LINK HERE** in the Zoom chat. You can click on that link

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. I just want to check once more that you are still feeling good about us using your feedback or if you would like to redact anything we discussed today?

****

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

****

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
