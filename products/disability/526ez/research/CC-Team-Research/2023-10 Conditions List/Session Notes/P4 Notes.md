P= participant


## Warm-up

- M: Can you talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov?

- P: With va.gov, as it relates to claims, I have done my intent to file a couple of times and submitted all of my documentation and initiated my claim as va.gov as well.

- M: Could you tell me about any benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time?

- P: I’m currently at 90%. I have 4 or 5 different disabilities I’m being compensated for.

- M: if you are comfortable, can you share which conditions you are receiving compensation for? 

- P: migraines, depression, tendinitis, chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis (rated at 0%), another one that is a gynecological issue.

- M: Do you have plans to file in the future?

- P: An increase. But it would be like a new claim. 

- M: How do you plan to file that, online or by mail?

- P: Well, I already have the intent to file, initiated through va.gov. So it will be finished through va.gov

- M: For the claims that you are already rated for, did you apply through va.gov? 

- P: yes 


## Prototype testing

Test 1 – actual situation 

- M: I would like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype....

- P: let’s say I’m doing an increase for allergic rhinitis. I typed in allergic rhinitis but it only says rhinitis but I’m going to go with that. So I click save. If I had an additional condition, I would add it, but if I don’t, I don’t really know what to do because I don’t see an option to move forward without adding another condition.

  - Types in “allergis rhiniti” and selects “rhinitis” from the auto-suggestion list.

-  P: Let’s say I also need to add in migraines

  - Types in “migraine” and selects “migraines (headaches)”

- P: Now I’m not really sure what I’m to do, once I’m done entering conditions

- M: That’s ok, that is the main thing we are testing today so think back to your first time applying and imagine everything is a new condition. 

- P: Ok, I’m going to go with depression

  - Types in “depress” and selects “depression (major depressive disorder)”

- P: Ok I’m going to go with tendinitus

  - Types in “tendoniti” and selects “tendinitus (tendonitis) in knee, right”

  - Has to scroll a bit to fine the relevant tendinitus term. 

- P: Sinusitis

  - Types in “sinu” and selections “sinusitis (sinus infection)”

- P: i have applied for GERD but I was previously denied. So I will go with that. 

  - Types in GERD and selects GERD. 

Test – mock situation

- Ringing in ears

  - Starts typing in tinn and selects tinnitus (ringinig in the ears)

- Torn tendon

  - She types in “right knee pain

  - P: Nothing appears to come up. Pretending I don’t know it is tendonitis. So I’m kind of stuck. I’ll say tendon pain. Maybe spelling would helpind of stuck

  - Tries typing in right knee tendon pain 

  - P: It appears that I have to know the term tendinitis in order to get this. 

  - Types in tendonitis, and selects “tendinitis (tendonitis) in knee right)”

- Bursitis

  - Starts typing in bur

  - Has to scroll a bit, but selects “bursitis in knee, right”


## Prototype testing -  Follow-up questions

- M: What was the experience like for you of entering your medical conditions? 

- P: pretty uneventful. Not very challenging. I would have expected something come up when I typed in right knee pain, but nothing seemed to populate when I typed that in. 

- M: What would you have done in that scenario?

- P: Honestly, I would have gone to google and search for knee pain and see what comes up.  

- M: Can you do that for us?

- She goes to google and searches for right knee pain. Goes to Johns Hopkins website with page about knee pain and conditions

- P: I see ruptured ligament, torn cartilage. Knee pain and problems. Let’s see what Johns Hopkins might have to say. Okay, so under the second bullet I see common need problems include. Sprained or strained ligaments, cartilage tears, tendonitis and arthritis so then I think I would probably go back and either type in tendonitis or arthritis

- M: So for you, if you knew your symptoms, you would go to google and try to learn a little bit more and then enter that. 

- M: for you yourself, how did you know what to put in for condition? 

- P: Just cause I knew I had tendonitis, like I had been told by my healthcare provider that it was tendonitis, so that’s why I knew. It’s a matter of being knowledgeable about my conditions. 

- M: So when you were applying yourself, you knew every condition? And you knew those because of diagnoses? \[disruption]

- P: yes, I did

- M: So for rhinitis, when you typed it in, you noted that it didn’t have allergic rhinitis. How did you go to select rhinitis on its own?

- P: So for me, long before I get to the point of like actually filing my claim, I tend to do a lot of independent research on my own. So I just went with rhinitis.  

- M: And was it okay that it wasn’t allergic? How did it make you feel to select that?

- P: I felt like it was not accurate. So then I would have concern as to if I would possibly be denied because it’s the wrong classification. 

- P: I definitely would have preferred if it had said allergic rhinitis

- M: Where did you get the term allergic rhinitis from?

- P: I don’t know. It has been a long time. When I initially filed the claim back in 2002, I was denied for allergies. And it was denied. And so years later, and by years, I mean in 2015 I submitted for allergic rhinitis and it was awarded. Not because of the term changed, but just because of the documentation of the symptoms and issues over time. 

- M: So you don’t remember where you got the term from?

- P: I don’t. But I probably got it from the VA website. You can go there and see all the conditions that are awarded compensation. So I’m pretty sure that’s where I initially got it. 

- M: So you have referenced that list before?

- P: yes. 

- \[shares screen again]

- M: So for the one where you type in tendinitis for yourself. Go ahead and to that again

- Types in tendon... 

- M: ok so 2 questions for you here, scrolling through and seeing tendinitis and than tendonitis

- P: Tendonitis, I guess that’s the same. In parentheses.

- M: Did that raise any thoughs for you?

- P: No not really.  I thought I was spelling it right with don, but now not really a concern cause it was right there in parentheses

- M: Ok, and then how about there’s a lot of body parts and the a lot of different right, left. How is that experience for you navigating and selecting yours? 

- P: It’s a lot. I’m okay with it.  I would think if I’m older, that could be a lot to sift through. But it was fine for me

- M: why was it fine for you?

- P: Because I could easily scroll down and find right knee

- M: Did you read the instructions in the grey box?

- P: I only read the first paragraph and not the second. It is too much reading \[she reads outloud]

- P: What does that mean you don’t have to include one of the suggested? You can type your own? 

- P: It’s just too much reading. Most people won’t read that. Well some people might.

- M: So what does this section mean to you? What do these instructions mean? 

- P: For me, I would want it entered correctly from the start because I feel like again like I said previously if not then that could possibly hurt my chances of it being classified correctly , thus the correct CMP exam, impact my ability to get compensation or not. Because I have never heard of the examiner helping  you to name the condition. You know, the examiners are a third party, and that just would not make me comfortable at all. 

- M: So that's like a personal preference for you that you would wanna  know the condition. After reading these instructions for the one where you were typing in like right knee pain, which you Do it differently now.

- P: Yes I think I would leave it just right knee pain. 

- M: Can we see you do that? 

- Types in right knee pain

- M: how was that experience for you?

- P: it was fine, no issues. 

- M: So what do you think about the list of suggestions that were displayed as you typed in the conditions?

- P: It seemed to be a pretty comprehensive list and I could see how it would be helpful if you know someone knows their condition but also someone could just possibly guess. And put in the wrong thing. But I guess whoever will help figure that out at appointment. Maybe that is ok

- M: What do you think the list of items represents?

- P: I would imagine it would be conditions that you can receive compensation for

- M: Based on the conditions that you entered, do you think the VA has what it needs to understand your claim?

- P: Yes I do. This is a starting point, it appears, and from there the exam, or if they have other question, then they can reach out and get any follow-up information, or within the medical records that they receive either from you or when they reach out to the medical providers or from the VA.

- M: Before when we talked about rhinitis and allergic rhinitis, you had mentioned a concern you had was around that it would be the wrong classification and could impact the CMP exam. Can you say more what you meant by that? 

- P: Just in terms of, if I put in for one thing and I go in under the....they are assuming that I’m coming in for allergic rhinitis. I mean there are different types of rhinitis, so if I think I’m going in for allergic rhinitis and they are using a DBQ for something other than allergic rhinitis, how would that impact by chance to get the compensation? 

- M: You see really knowledgeable about the process with DBQs and CMP exams. Where did that knowledge come from?

- P: my own research

- M: Okay, and then was that research like desk research or from your experience with the VA?

- P: Some of both. Some of it was my own personal experience and then like after a couple of appointments myself, then I just started doing information in the internet. And there is a plethora of information out there. I mean, through the VA website in and of itself, they give you lots of information about the process. There is just a lot out there. 

- M: was there anything that was confusing about the prototype?

- \[disruption] 

- P: No, I mean I think just being able to type what you need to type, actually works. Of course I missed that part in terms of reading over it the first time. But yes, that's fine.


## Post-testing interview

**_A. If they have filed previously_**

- S: So thank you so much for sharing all of that. Not that we've been through those scenarios, let's talk about your actual experience. And any question you don't want to answer, please let us know. So for that claim that you did where you had those like 5 or so conditions, when was that that you applied for that?

- P: My initial claims were in 2002. It was allergies and migraines. Over the last 5 to 6 years is when I’ve submitted additional claims. It has never been 5 at one time. 

- S: When was the most recent experience filing?

- P: I would say roughly a year ago. 

- S: We talked about it already, but can you tell me a little bit more about the resources that you used or support that you got while filling out that claim on VA.

- P: I’ve always done it by myself. I didn't get any help from any outside entity or anything. I did some research, made sure I had my medical records, uploaded it if it was from an outside provider, and then requested medical records through the VA, through va.gov to file.  

- M: What are some of those resources that you would use while filing?

- P: The VA’s website, various, like I said, google searches. And that’s about it. 

- M: Okay, and you felt from those resources that you were able to get the information you needed to apply?

- P: Yes, I mean in terms of the application piece, I didn’t need google searches for that. It was just in terms of my conditions and such. 

- M: How did you decide to submit a disability claim? 

- P: How did I decide I was gonna submit? What do you mean?

- M: What made you decide to apply for disability benefits?

- P: I mean, because most of the conditions either started while I was in the military or were a result or secondary condition as a result of other conditions. 

- M: Okay, so based on that you wanted you knew you qualified and you wanted to offer a disability. And then for those conditions. For those, how did you decide which ones to claim?

- P: Basically based on how much care I had. Received, you know, related to those or if I could tie them into a previous disability or had documentation from my medical records when I was in the military to show proof that the condition started during that time.

- M: Did you receive a diagnosis from medical professional prior to submitting your claim?

- P: yes

- M: And are those diagnoses what you used for your claim. 

- P: Yes

- M: Okay. If you can think back to when you were filling it out, do you remember what the experience for you was like of entering your medical conditions to claim?

- P: I don’t remember it being difficult. I don't recall me just being able to type in the conditions. I thought I had to select from one that was already there. Now my memory could not be serving me well, but that's what I thought.

- M: Okay, after adding all your conditions, how confident did you feel in your selection of the medical conditions?

- P: I feel good about it. I mean, the ones that I wanted were there, so I selected, you know, accordingly.

- M: When you applied, has the VA ever reached out to you to ask for clarifications or additional information regarding your claim?

- P: No

- M: And have you gotten the decision back?

- P: yes

- M: What was the decision?

- P: which one?

- M: For your most recent claim that you submitted. 

- P: For the most recent one, it was granted and came ith a 0% rating, but it was for special compensation. 

- M: So do you have any thoughts on anything else we discussed today or you want to share before we wrap up on just your experience adding conditions, the prototype itself.

- P: No I don’t think so. I mean, I think it was pretty straightforward.
