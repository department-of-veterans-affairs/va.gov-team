## Warm-up

- Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov.

  - I think I have made like  3-4 different claims but me myself I have not done it by myself so I always go to VSOs or someone at VA to get help filling out form because I do not feel comfortable filling out by myself

- Could you tell me about any benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 

  - Yes I am. I am getting Education and disability benefits 

E: If you’re comfortable sharing what conditions are you receiving those benefits for? 

3: You’re talking about like a percentage? 

E: more like the type of conditions

3: you have to refresh that question for me 

E: you mentoned youre recieving education and disability benefits. What medical conditions are you recieving those benefits for 

3: I get dental,I get health, and I guess disability or does it take services that I get? 

E: Ok. Alright. Well, let’s move on for now 

E: Do you have any plans to submit additional claims in the near future? 

3: yes, I am. I think they have the new, I guess the PACT At that just came in. SO that’s what I’m thinking about trying to submit

E: Ok so is it accurate to say that you’re thinking of submitting a disability claim for a condition that may be Pact ACT related? 

3: Yes

E: Ok, great. Let’s move on now to get into evaluating the prototype 

_I_Prototype testing

Test 1

- ~~Actual situation, claim not filed yet ~~

* Talk me through what you would do on this screen. 

* What do you think would come next after finishing entering your medical conditions? 

**Things to watch for:**

- General behavior of how they use the autosuggest component

  - Did they end up using a suggested condition or using free text

  - Did they understand that they can use free text

  - Do they scroll through the suggestions

- Did they find their condition easily or did they take time trying to decide what suggestion to go with (or whether to enter free text, or edit an existing suggestion)

E: Talk through what you would do on the screen 

3: Well of course I need to sign in 

E: Let’s just assume for now that you’re already signed in 

3: First they asked me to enter the conditions right in this box 

Condition #1 

- Read the instructions and recognized they should add the conditions in the box 

- Types in breathing, does not see in the list. Types in respir looking for respiratory condition, types in lun looking for lungs, goes back to resp, types in Respiratory. Types in breathing again and cannot find their condition.

- 3: I’m looking for some type of respiration or respiratory problems some breathing problems..... so I’m trying to type respiratory and I guess they give me a pretermined names of the conditions already but I don’t know how else to find it. Some type of help... breathing problems you know\.... 

- If i type the first letters they gave me whatever. Let me see lung \*does not find something in the list that relates\* goes back to typing “Respiratory” and scrolls

- “So how else can I describe my condition any type of respiratory issues.” 

- E: So we’re interested to see what you might do next 

-  3: Yeah so that’s what I’m looking, I guess, I’m looking for a word that describes my conditions. So I get breathing because I don’t know the actual medical wods. Like I said, I haven’t done any claims. 

- E: Can you try you mentioned you’re currently receiving benefits can you imagine you’re filing a claim for something you’ve already received  

Condition #2

- Looks up PTSD, selects very quickly, “I found this one this is an easy one, Ok I’m going to save it so you say ‘please tell us the new conditions you want to claim’ so I already put this one so I’m scrolling down adding conditions o enter the name but I already put my conditions up here so tby this one they want me to edit it. Why?”

-  the “editing condition” part of the directions were confusing 

- “I don’t know why they’re asking me to edit the conditions” 

- “So I don’t have to enter anything at all.. I’m going to have to save it” 

- Added PTSD twice when confused by the editing condition. Once they recognized it wanted to remove the extra one “I think I added two claims here so I’m going to edit this one” 

  - E: since this is a prototype this function does not work 

- Is not able to remove item

- “So I’m going to save it and I’m done” 

- E: Are there any other conditions you can try entering? 

- “I’ve got many conditions” 

Condition #3

- Types “ba” quickly scrolls and finds “spinal arthritis, back” 

- “That was easy. I’m going to save it.” 

- “but this is confusing why does it say editing condition. For me It’s that I have to edit what I already submitted so I’m just going to add another condition” selects _Add another condition_ 

- It’s not working so I’m going to save it before I add another condition. I’m going to refresh it again. 

- E: I think it’s not quite working quite for the sake of this just use the field here

Condition #4 

- Types “knee”, quickly scrolls and finds bursitis in knee, left

- E: can you tell me what you’re thinking? 

- “yeah I put bursitis in knee in your left side” 

- “So what is this “add another condition” for if I can just type another condition right here? 

- E: Yeah that’s a good question and I will take a note that is confusing to you 

- So right now I have three conditions. I save it. 

- E: Do you have any other conditions to add? 

- Yeah I’ve got many

Condition #5

- in p, scrolls, erases, types in s and finds sleep apnea and selects it” 

- “you see how I'm doing it, right? I’m just typing in here. The editing condition is confusing so I’m not using this box I'm using add another condition instead. 

- E: so if you were adding another condiiton you would expect to click the add a new condition box? 

- Right

- “It is working so far by mistake or error” 

- E: what are you looking for now? 

Condition #6

- The same thing, knee. 

- Types in knee, select knee strain 

Condition #7

- Types in sho

-  “I like this one, I like the prewords that are already set up so I don’t have to come up with some new terminology, it’s already here. I like that part” 

- “I press shoulder and it disappeared…. Ok got it… so I’m saving it” 

- “What else do you want me to do it only says add a new condition it doesn’t say continue” 

- E: Can I give you a hypothetical situation? 

- Yes. 

Test 2 \[optional - only if participant has time to do actual and mock scenarios]

- Mock scenario

* Talk me through what you would do on this screen. 

* What do you think would come next after finishing entering your medical conditions? 

\#1: “So I do have that.” Types in HEARING and Selects “hearing loss, other than tinnitus” So this is what you want me to do? 

E: yes, let me give you another one. 

\#2: types “knee” scrolls the list “you said right side right” looks through the list. Likes “knee instability” but has to find knee instability, right 

E: can you walk me through how you selected knee instability 

“You asked me if I have problem with knees and I injure my knees. I guess it’s hard for something so.. That's the reason. So I don’t have full control of my knees so that’s the reason I think it’s knee instability. 

\#3: types “knee” “you said bursitis? It’s the first one” selects bursitis in knee, right 

- What do you think would come next after submitting this page?  

  - "I would anticipate to ask me to review all my conditons before I submit it” 

  - E: Ok, so like review the information that you already added to the application

  - “Review or review what I just added or if I miss 

  -  Something I can add or go back in a moment 

  - E: Is there something different than this page? 

  - No because this one has edit. But I don’t know how the next one how it’s going to present all the conditions. Separately, together, how it’s showed right now 

  - E: So you want to see them in the format they will be submitted in? 

  - Right. 


## Prototype testing -  Follow-up questions

- E: So in the beginning you entered you were starting to type a condition respiratory or first you typed breahting and then you typed respiratory and you’re scrolling through the list. SO you didn’t end up entering anything for that. WHat do you think you would do next, given that you weren’t able to find. 

  - So I will check my medical records to find the right word. To find the right medical. 

  - E: So you could see if you could find the medical terninology 

  - Right.  Because I wasn’t typing anything you know \[wasn’t finding anything] find a term, so I will check my medical records to find the right word of it I would search my medical records to find the right terminology 

- E: And then for the other one, for one of the hypothetical scenarios, the ringing in the ears, I noticed you selected a term called “hearing loss other than tinnitus” Can you tell me how you decided to choose that term? 

  - That’s what I actually have. I had a test done. I was told that was my condition. Hearing loss NOT tinnitus. 

- E: One other thing I wanted to ask, like on some of the examples that you gave where it was like you were looking for your knee, the left knee or the right knee. Can you tell me about your experience finding the term in the list that was for the you know the side of the body you were looking for?  

  - It was easy because I can type like I do this and it was able to give me different conditions and I was able to see and pick the condition I have on the same thing.

  - When I put my shoulder, it gave me different conditions that people have with shoulders and that’s what I have. 


## Post-testing interview

**_A. If they have filed previously_**

- E: So let’s move along to talking about some of your past experiences with disability claims. So I think you’ve said before that you’ve submitted disabiilty claims in the past, but with the help of a VSO. Can you tell me what that experience was like for you and Talk to me about the resources you used as you were putting together the claims 

  - So first, well, as I was getting ready to get out of the army we have some type of briefing, some retirement breifings and one was about how to make the claims and who to contact and everything like that, where to go and who to contact and the type of claims. SO that’s how I found who I needed to talk to. 

  - So that’s who I found who I needed to talk to. So I contacted a VSO and it took a while because she was very busy. It took like 3 mnths because she was very, she was very busy. 

- E: what made you decide to apply for disability from the VA?

  -  I want to apply because all the health problems that I have that I didn’t have before I came to the army and ok and I know it was going to be hard for me to pay for it after I got out of the army. So I decided I had to take care of myself and I won’t be able to do it all by myself 

- E: how did you did you decide which to apply for?

  - Went to the doctor and found out what the major problems I was having 

- E: Did you receive a diagnosis from the army doctor before applying for disability? 

  - Yes, from the army doctor 

- E: do you have any claims that are currently being evaluated?

  - No

- E: for this current claim, what resources are you using to help you submit? 

  - The VA, they have a lot of information about Pact Act so i’m going to see if my problems or my issues are listed and if VA will claim those conditions

  - E: where are you finding that information? 

    - Va.gov 

  - E: any other resources?

    - Getting my medical records together and going to a VA center to have them help me fill in all the things 

  - E: do you anticipate applying online? 

    - I’ll be doing online. 

E: do you anticipate getting help with VSO for the online claim?

-  Yes, and getting help from VSO to submit that claim 

* E: Anything else you want to share about your expereince with the claim? 

  - It’s a little intimidating filling out these forms. I don’t think I’ll be doing it byself. I will work with someone to go over it and make sure I’m doing it the right way.

* E:  what is intimidating?

  - You want to have everything correct. You don’t want to put in wrong information. Putting the right information, needing to put the right medical terminology. The form is very huge and confusing at times. Sometimes you don’t know if you did it wrong. 

**Prototype Questions**

- How did you know what to put for “condition”? 

- Did you read the instructions?

  - If yes:

    - What did these instructions, “Please tell us the new conditions you want to claim?” mean to you? 

      - Medical issues. Health related issues

    - E: Ok then if you scroll down you see some additional instructions under Editing condition where it says enter the name of your condition below.  First question, did you read those?

      - Yes I did

    - E: Ok if you can go ahead and read those again and explain to me what you think those instructions mean to you 

      - Ok the first part where it says I need to type my conditions, that I don’t need to choose the conditions given but they can give me different suggestions but I don’t have to pick the ones. So I guess I could type anything but I don’t have to pick it. So I can make my own conditions is what I understand

      - Ok, so at First when I was doing it I thought I HAD to pick but now that I read it again it says I don’t have to choose. 

    - E: Can you think of a scenario you would like to type in your condition? 

      - Like I was looking for the breathing problems. SO I will type something generic and will just leave it like that. ANd like, I mean it says here, so we will you figure out the name and condition during the exam.  So I don’t have to, I don’t have to have any medical terminology to finish this stuff. So then whoever’s reviewing this it says they’re going to help me to put the right words. 

      - “It says we will help you I don’t know how is we but I’m assuming someone at the VA” 

    - E: so before you mentioned you would look at your medical records to find the name for the breathing condition. Now that you understand you can type in a description that does not populate in the box what would you do? 

    - E: what would you do?

      - Types in breathing problem but it still confused how to save it 

      - I’d hope that the person who’s helping me figure out the right terminology 

- What do you think about the list of suggestions that were displayed as you typed in? What do you think that list represents? 

  - Conditions that the majority of Veterans have claimed 

- E: Based on the conditions you entered, do you think the VA has what it needs to understand what you are trying to claim? Why or why not? 

  - What do you mean? 

  - E: Before you entered bursitis in the knee, left

    - Back Pain 

  - Yes etc. Based on those do you think the VA has enough to understand the condition you’re applying for?

    - I’d hope so. So They send me to a specialist to get the right condition 

  - E: do you think they have enough information to get you to the right specialist? 

    - Yes 

  - E: You mentioned a couple things that were confusing. Is there anything else that was confusing to you as you were trying to add medical conditions? 

    - Nothing… everything is uh.. If I have the right words then the cell  automatic populating is a big help, it will save me time. Save me the headaches of what it is I need to write in this.
