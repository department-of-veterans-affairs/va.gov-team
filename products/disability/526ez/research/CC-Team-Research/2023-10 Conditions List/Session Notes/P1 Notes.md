## Warm-up

- M: Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov.

  - P: I use it frequently

  - M: What do you use it for?

  - P: When I have a claim that is ongoing. I check on the status of my claim. But it's usually frustrating. And I am curious. If I log in to VA Gov. And I want to go to my healthy vet. Why do I have to log in all over again? Why aren't they all incorporated into one?

  - M: Yeah, that definitely sounds frustrating. I'll make a note of that. It's not an area I work on, but I can definitely make a note.

- M: Could you tell me about any benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 

  - P: I use the VA healthcare system. I have some disability claims that I’m rated for.....are you wanting to know which specific disability benefits I receive? 

  - M: If you feel comfortable, yes. 

  - P: rated for hearing loss, rated for right strain, ....arthritis, an ankle injury. I’m rated for SSD, and I think that is about it. 

  - M: do you have plans to file for additional disability claims in the near future?

  - P: yes

  - M: If you are comfortable sharing, are you filing because existing conditions have worsened or because you have new conditions you’d like to file for?

  - P: I have additional conditions to file for.

  - M: how do you file?

  - P: I have a certified organization that is going to help me. An accredited organization. 

  - \[S starts explaining about prototype but then he has more to add about his claims]

  - P: I’m in the process of filing a couple of claims with an accredited organization. And I’m waiting to file a supplemental claim. That is a claim that was denied. 

  - P: I do have a little bit of a beef, since you do have someone with the VA on this call. I have an intent to file that is on record and I had an intent to file and I did a supplemental claim and an appeal to a claim that was denied. And it took my intent to file away. Which it shouldn’t have done. The intent to file is supposed to be for a new claim because after you do an intent to file you have one year from the activation of that intent to file. But I did an appeal and it got gobbled up, so to speak. So it was gone. 

  - M: Yeah, that definitely sounds frustrating. I'll make a note of that. It's not an area I work on, but I can definitely make a note

  - M: have you ever filed for a claim online yourself? 

  - P: yes

  - M: What have you used va.gov for versus using the accredited organization? 

  - P: I’ve had quite a few claims. I’ve had organizations helping me. And then totally on my own, I’ve submitted claims through va.gov. 

  - P: Since you are talking about va.gov, I would like to share that it was a disappointing experience.

  - M: Do you mind if we chat about that at the end? 


## Prototype testing

Test 1 – at first he said he wanted to do the hypothetical, but then starting doing the test with his actual conditions. 

- P: I might just use a condition that I intend to claim if that’s okay.

- M: That’s completely ok. 

Condition 1: 

- P: The condition is psoriasis. I entered the term and it populated as I began to spell the word and it is displaying there.  And if you weren’t there now, I would just go ahead and click save. Can I do that?

- Types in “pso” and selects “psoriasis” 

- M: yes

- P: Do we need more or is that sufficient?

- M: If there's another condition that you are claiming or you can think to the past when you've claimed something previously, we’d like to see you

Condition 2: 

-  Starts typing in pes and is looking at the list (up and down) and selects “claw foot (pes cavus, left”

- M: Can you tell me what you were doing when you were thinking when you were scrolling up and down? 

- P: “I was looking to see if there is something else that would more adequately describe the condition that I wanted to claim. O what populated,  I didn’t see anything else that would more accurately describe it. 

Condition 3: 

- P: I do have a 3<sup>rd</sup> condition. And it would pertain to the PACT Act. But I don’t think there is going to be something that populates there, so I would go to something more specific.

- Starts typing in PAC but then deletes. 

- Starts typing in “neurological” 

- P: Neurological is what I’m looking for but I don’t see that populate there. Which is why I’m having an accredited Veteran service organization to help me. I would be at a standstill here. I wouldn’t know what to enter since nothing else populated.  

- P: And I have a question for you. Is it possible to enter something that is not populated there? Or do you have to use something that is going to populate when you are doing a claim? 

- M: That’s a good question. I’m just observing your actions. So I’ll answer that after we’re done here. 

- P: Okay. I'm gonna just remove that third one then. And I'm gonna stay with these other 2 unless for the purpose of this.

Test 2 – hypothetical 

- M: So since we kind of went through your section quickly, do you mind if I give you a couple hypotheticals and we could see how you use their form for it?

- P: sure

1<sup>st</sup> scenario (ringing in the ears)

- M starts typing in “tinn”

- M: I noticed you typed in tin, what made you decide to do that?

- P: for one thing, i was in the infantry in the Marine Corps and I do have ringing in the ears. And I am service connected for this.  

- M: So you type that in because you already knew the name of what ringing in the ears was? 

- P: Correct. 

1. M goes back and starts typing in “ringing....” to see what comes up. “tinnitus (ringing in ears)” comes up. 

- P: so if I didn’t know tinnitus, I could start typing in ringing and it would lead me to that. 

2<sup>nd</sup> scenario (torn knee tendon)

- S gives M the second scenario. 

- M starts typing in knee and scrolls through a lot of things.

- P: I'm going through the suggestions here. To see which one I think is most appropriate. Yeah

- M ends up selecting “knee instability, left”

- M: how did you choose that?

- P: Well, of the options that populated there. But since I'm not a position or physical therapist or that knowledgeable in the medical field that's just one that I thought would get us to where we needed to go to. 

- M: I noticed that you typed in right and then you type in knee? What was your thought process?

- P: Well, I thought that perhaps if I typed in right knee that something would show up like that when it didn't show up. Figured we would remove the right and just go to the knee and that would give us some options that we weren't seeing on the first go around

- M: I'd like you to kinda talk through as you were scrolling them and how you chose me and stability.

- P: Of the options that seemed like a generic one that would cover the current situation with the knee.  

* What do you think would come next after finishing entering your medical conditions? 

  - P: Well I don’t really know what would come next. I’m sure there would be guidance at the bottom of the page. 

  - M: What would you expect to come next?

  - P: I would expect it to say go to the next page or submit. 

  - M: What would you expect to add on the next page?

  - P: possibly upload some evidence. 


## Prototype testing -  Follow-up questions

- What was the experience like for you? 

  - P: it was easy, peazy

  - M: What about it was easy? 

  - P: I was able to add the conditions that I thought were appropriate for your claims. 

  - M: It was easy to enter and save?

  - P: Well, I wouldn't say that I knew how to do it. I would say that I got some assistance from the page itself that you know was kind of self-instructional.

- How did you know what to put for “condition”? 

  - P: because that is the condition that I have

  - M: So you were familiar with the term condition and you new what medical conditions you had?

  - P: correct

  - M: Okay. So, were terms that you already knew from your past experience and you were able to just add those.

  - P: yes

  - M: So psoriasis and claw foot were terms you knew?

  - P: Actually I typed in pes cavas, which is partially claw foot. But I wouldn’t have thought that it would have been claw foot. Claw foot is not a term that I would have looked for there. If I didn’t know the term pes cavas, I would have typed in left foot and if that didn’t populated something I would have type in foot. 

  - M: When you typed in pes cavus and you saw clawfoot? What did you think when you saw clawfoot? Did you still feel confident selecting that option. 

  - P: I did as far as pes cavus only because it was already populated there.

  - M: It didn’t confuse you to see qualifying text next to it? 

  - P: It didn’t because my options were limited to that. 

  - M: How do you know the names of the conditions?

  - P: Because I have been diagnosed with them. 

  - M: so you know them from the diagnoses

  - P: correct  

- M: Did you read the instructions?

  - P: yes

  - M: What did these instructions, “Please tell us the new conditions you want to claim?” mean to you? 

  - P: for me to list the condition or conditions that you wanted to claim 

- What do you think about the list of suggestions that were displayed as you typed in?  

  - P: I think it was helpful. Because it gave me a term to input there. I might not have used the verbatim listed there. 

  - M: What do you think the list represents?

  - P: I think the items in the list are conditions that are typical type claims that most closely resemble a condition that someone might be wanting to claim. 

- Did you read the instructions under editing condition?

  - P: I did at some point but not initially

  - M: Can you tell me your thoughts on these?

  - P: I think it is great that I would be able to use my own words as an option to utilizing the choices that populated. Because the choices that populated might not be exactly an accurate description of the claim. For instance, I am going to file for a left foot condition. And I would probably rather put my own words in there, rather than using pes cavus. Because it is more complicated than that.

  - M: what would you have wanted to put for that one? 

  - P: I had a major surgery down on my left foot due to arthritis. I’m rated for arthritis already for my right foot. But I’m not rated for my left. And it is a disability that prevents me from stand or walk on it. Or run. I’m not able to do because of the impairment. If was doing it, I would put “left foot condition, pes cavus, pain instability”  

  - P: I would probably ponder a bit to see if there is anything else I could add to that condition. 

  - M: Why is it that you wanted to add more information?

  - P: Because it is complicated because of the major surgery I had on my foot It wasn’t for pes cavus but I have acquired it because of related injuries. But pes cavus does not totally describe it. It is just a partial description. If my purpose in filing the clam is to get acknowledged and rated for it and then I get denied, then I would have not done myself justice by not giving it a more complete description of the issues. 

  - M: So, looking back to the instructions here, so the first one says, Enter the name of your condition below and will suggest some possible matches. What does that mean to you? 

  - P: Instead of just writing pes clavus, I could go into more details to broaden the potential of my claim beyond just the populated answer. 

  - M: What does the rest of the paragraph mean to you?

  - P: It kind of is what we were talking about. For example, in the pes clavus, I would add a forward slash/comma and then more info

  - M: Can you show us how you would do that?

  - M starts typing “claw foot (pes cavus), left/foot instability/pain”

  - P: I’d do something like that

  - M: When you did this before, were you able to figure out that you could write something in? Or did you need more guidance?

  - P: I figured it out after I looked at the editing condition down there in the paragraph that gives you the specific instructions. For some reason, I didn't, I didn't see that. So I. I didn't read it. Maybe it's ADD on my part or something.

- M: Based on the conditions you entered, do you think the VA has what it needs to understand what you are trying to claim? 

  - P: I think so. 

- M: Was anything confusing? 

  - P: No, but since we are talking about it. 

  - P: Have I maxed out on the number of digits it is letting me add? It’s not letting me add anything else to that. 

  - M: I’ll take a note of that. What would you have written there?

  - P: I would have typed “strain”

  - P: I am rated on my right foot for right foot, strain

  - M: What is it you were trying to edit?

  - P: under the claw foot, I was trying to add strain. 

  - M: So it would be “pes cavus, left foot instability, pain, strain” ?

  - P: yes

  - P: So this is a prototype? It is not actually the site? 

  - M: Correct it is not real. We are getting input on it. 

- M: Are there any ways that you can think of making it easier to enter a medical condition? 

  - P: Fortunately, i can’t think of anything that would make it easier. 

- Any last thoughts on the prototype before we move to the next section? 


## Post-testing interview

**_A. If they have filed previously_**

- M: Can you tell me about your most recent experience filing a claim on VA.gov?

  - P: Yeah I sure can. And I can moan and groan about it while we are talking. I had an intent to file and 6 months after I did it and went online to do my claim, there were quite a few things I was claiming and I was only able to get 3 of them in. And it wouldn’t let me do anymore on that particular session. There was no option...on the scenario we just did it looked like I could have added 10...but when I was doing it, it wouldn’t let me add more than 3. Since I was doing that against an intent to file, I immediately called the toll free number and I spoke to a representative and they told me that if I went ahead and added those conditions in the next couple weeks It should piggy back on the initial claim. So I paused for a week or so and then went back and added the other conditons. It was in the same month. It was Oct 2021.....Well I come to find out that I got approved for some of the first 3 and some of the other ones in 2021, but they didn’t go back to my intent to file date. They were effective as of late October 2021. 

  - P: What happened was contradictory to what the representative said. 

  - M: Was that the same page you were looking at today?

  - P: yes

  - M: when you tried again, were you able to add more than 3 

  - P: yes, I think so

- How did you decide what medical conditions to claim for? 

  - M: Because I knew what medical conditions that I had.

  - M: how did you know your diagnoses were?

  - P: Because I was diagnosed with them.

  - P: I knew after a physician told me. I didn’t do a self-diagnosis. These were medical conditions I had received consultation or treatment on.  

- M: Has the VA reached out to you to ask for clarifications or additional information regarding your disability claim

  - P: Medical records from treating physicians. 

  - M: So they contacted you because that was information you needed

  - P: I signed a consent form for them to get the medical records

  - M: What was your experience with that?

  - P: It was ok. They sent me a letter in the mail.

- M: How confident did you feel in your selection of medical conditions to claim for?

  - P: No I did not

  - M: What made you feel not confident?

  - P: because I was only able to add a limited number of them. There was no option for me to finish. It caused immense frustration. It got even worse when I did the only thing that I could do and I called the help line. And the help turned out to be no help at all. There was no way to pick back up on claim a. Claim A was over with. It was like I started a new claim.....and then it was too late. When I followed up on it to say, I was told this or I was told that, it was all for naught. 

* Do you have any other thoughts on anything we discussed today you want to share before we wrap up?

  - P: I don’t think so. You have done a thorough job. 

* Is there anything you would like to redact from today?

  - P: you are going to use my feedback as anonymous?

  - M: yes

  - P: yes that’s fine
