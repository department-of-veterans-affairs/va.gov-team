## Warm-up

- \[confirmed that participant is ok with recording]

- M: Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov.

- P: I retired from the Airforce in August 2020. My initial claim was submitted through a VA rep on Andrews Airforce base. Initially I had to kind of go back and edit information update additional information. Until the point I received my final disability rating. Since then, I’ll use va.gov for appointments, available resources. I’ve done a few different programs through va.gov.

- M: Okay, so you said that you applied, for disability benefits through someone with the Air Force.

- P: Initially it was done through. I wanna say it was like one the the VA reps through the like the VFW\.. I think it is, they're like they're like approved to start your claim. I learned about  them through the taps program, but they were the ones who basically, you know, did my initial, got my medical records. things that nature. Then I had to actually send the information in myself. 

- M: You still had to submit all of my medical information?

- P: They gathered the information for me and I had to submit the information. They pulled out the items that could be service-connected and then I basically built the package and had to submit it myself. 

- M: oh nice, And then did you submit that on VA. Gov or a paper application or another way?

- P: I had to send it all via paper. 

- M: Can you tell me about any benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time?

- P: I am receiving full medical benefits. I also have “track air prime” but I use the VA for some of my therapy related care. As well as some of the PTSD groups I am in, have been assigned through VA. 

- M: Were you granted compensations?

- P: yes:

- M: How many conditions? 

- P: If I had to take a guess, I’d say maybe 20 or 25. I did initially get a rating and then I had to provide additional information and then I was provided an additional rating. 

- M: Do you have plans to file any additional disability claims in the near future?

- P: Yes, even though I am at 100%, I was told that I should still submit findings that relate to my time in service. I’m not submitting it to get an increase, but just to have proof that I have additional ailments. 

- M: Okay, so you're not submitting a new claim you're submitting kind of a claim for increase, but it's not the purpose of increase, it's just to give more evidence.

- P: yes

- M: Okay, so you're not submitting a new claim you're submitting kind of a claim for increase, but it's not the purpose of increase, it's just to give more evidence.

- P; Yes

- M: Okay, there's not like new conditions that have come up that you want to apply for.

- P: It is considered a new condition but it will not change my rating because my rating is as high is can be. 

- M: And for those additional information, how do you plan on filing that claim? 

- M: I’m going to do it through claims and appeals on va.gov.


## Prototype testing

Test 1 – actual situation 

- \[M walks through directions and P shares screen]

- M: I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype....

- P: My experience has been that I would do step by step just like it is asking me to. The website has always been pretty self-explanatory. I don't necessarily think it's been difficult to follow along, so you know step 2 says, please tells us a new condition you want to claim. So into the name of the condition below, I guess it looks like it’ll suggest some possible matches. You don’t have to choose one of the suggestions. So basically, whatever ailment or disability I’m applying for, I would type it in here. Should I do that or am I just talking?   

- M: We are going to have you do this as if you were actually filling out the form. 

- P: I’m going to type lower back pain. 

- Types in LOWER BACK and selects “lower back sprain (lubmosacral sprain)”. Clicks save

- Types in ANKLE SPRAIN and scrolls list but doesn’t find what is looking for. So just types in SPRAIN and looks but cannot find it. Types in ANKLE and still cannot find what he is looking for. 

- P: I don’t see ankle sprain. It could be the terminology. So I would probably in this instance, I guess at this point maybe “post-traumatic arthritis in ankle, right.” I guess I’d be taking a guess at this point. If I had ankle time and I think back to a time I had multiple injuries to my ankle. And I felt the repeat issues have since carried over to current day and age and I was trying to receive additional benefits with that claim, personally I would look back at my records to try to find the times I went to the medical facility to have my ankle examined. Given that there is not actual ankle sprain. Let‘s say I’m having chronic pain in my ankle. I guess I can try chronic.

- Types CHRONIC but does not find what he is looking for. Scrolls up and down. 

- P: So ‘”m not necessarily seeing something that I would feel comfortable submitting. From my experience when you submit a claim, they are going to ask you specific to what you are submitting. Which I think is what you want. If ankle sprain is not on here, if I pick something else related to ankle, like if I pick arthritis like I said earlier, I would be concerned because if I am examined by a VA facility, and they say tell me about your post-traumatic arthritis, and I say I don’t think it is arthritis, I think it is chronic pain from sprains from over 10 years of doing physical fitness tests, I would be worried that they would just throw it out immediately because I’m selling it as ankle sprain when this is a claim for post-traumatic arthritis. But there is not necessarily one for me to pick that is related to ankle sprain. So I would basically be going off the closes thing that makes sense. So in this instance I guess I’ll save that. But I would be concerned., I mean, I wouldn't immediately be concerned that they would just throw that one out because it's not. I’m basically determining it to be arthritis, even though our records would reflect ankle sprain. 

- P: I just saw one in. So I'll just pick that just because I know it's in there. \[he saw acne in list while scrolling for ankle]

- Types in ACNE and selects acne

- Types in KNEE and selects “knee instability, right”

- Types in MIGR and selects migraines I(headaches)

- Types in  HAND ARTH and scrolls list. Changes to HAND and scrolls. Changes to ARHTRI and scrolls. Selects post-traumatic arthritis in shoulder, left

- P: So basically I would keep going through. At this point, I don’t think any Veteran would have to go in and report 10 initial conditions following their initial claim. From my experience, from former colleagues, the initial claim is going to gather 95-98% of your medical history. In my personal opinion, if I am submitting a new claim following my initial claim, I don’t think I would have this many conditions. I guess there could be one or 2 people that may feel like a lot of stuff was missed. P: I will keep doing this until you tell me to stop. 

- Types EAR and selects tinnitus (ringing in the ears) \[mentions that he has that so he just selects it]

- P: I would verity that everything I want is submitted here

- M: Thank you for doing that.  

Test 2 – mock

- Scenario 1: tinnitus

  - P: I would select tinnitus because I know that one. I have that condition from 25 years in airplanes. And I mean, I would just, I guess you can type ringing or hissing.  

  - M: Even though you already have it, you can just do 

  - TYPES hissing and selects tinnitus (ringing in the ears) \[tinnitus showed up at top of auto-suggestions!]

  - P: I guess some people would say hearing loss. But I guess it is hard cause I know what tinnitus is and I saw that ringing in the ear and it populated. And I typed hissing. And even though it didn’t say hissing in the description, it pulled up something very similar to that. 

- Scenario 2

  - Types KNEE and scrolls looking at all the options. 

  - P: I would look at all of the options, but because it says painful when you try to walk down hill, I would personally relate it to instability. I would go to knee instability, right. Let me check and see if there is anything that makes more sense. I would be making an educated guess as to which of these is the closest to what they are experiencing. 

  - P: I would be concerned that if I don’t pick the right one, it is just going to be thrown out. But, I would pick knee instability, right, because I’m saying that my right knee bothers me on a daily basis and I know I tore a tendon so then having pain when you walk downhill, knee or squat, to me is instability because of the torn tendon.

- Scenario 3 – bursitis

  - Types BURSITI and selects bursitis in knee, right

  - P: This one’s pretty easy. If I type in the keyword, okay, I think this is it. If you had to describe it yourself, it would be much more complicated, but being that it auto populates something that is close to the keyword as possible. I think it definitely makes it easier. 

Test 3 – new conditions

- M: And then you said that you had some new conditions that you wanted to. Apply for. Could you go ahead and show us how you would do those?

- P: I was diagnosed outside of the military with sleep apnea . I would gather all the documentation that I received from the outside provider stating that I was diagnosed with it and that I have a sleep apnea machine

- M: Is there any other condition? 

- P: No, that's, that's the only one I'm thinking of. When I initial filed a claim, I had to have a cervical fusion. And there was a lot of different issues that were related to having the next surgery. So my initial claim was just for the surgery. I want to say the findings were 10%. Then I spoke to the claims representative who represents service representatives. They basically told me that they had to go find the EMG tests on my left arm that proved that I had nerve damage on my left wrist that made my arm go numb. The chronic headaches, that related to tension from the degenerative disc. They had to go in and gather all of the times that I went to flight medicine and reported the fact that I’m having issues with my neck. All of my MRIs. If you go to the doctor in the military and said hey, I’m having neck pain, my left arm is going numb and I my headaches are so bad I can’t concentrate, they probably would just give me motrin and tell me to go home. And then a week later you have to go back again, and then you’re gonna go to physical therapy, and then they say they want to give you an xray and then an MRI and the months later, you go see the orthopedic surgeon. It was never an easy process. Whether your arm was hanging off or whether you had severe arm pain, it was never treat you for the worst case up front but let’s treat you as minimally as possible. And then making you wait a certain amount of time before they could determine that the ailment was more than just a temporary issue. I say all that to say that one of the initial reasons for me having to go back in and edit the initial claim was that I personally felt that the degenerative list on the knee warranted more than a 10% disability. It was an educated guess, I’m not the individual that is going to approve it. But I felt that 10% was not capturing the overall disability. Even though I have a surgery and a million different ways to deal with the pain and discomfort. I felt that it was something that I would have to deal with for the rest of my life. I felt that it allows me to get the care I have now. I have less pain but it is chronic pain. So providing all the information, turned out to be very helpful, because I was able to get a much higher rating. And I think it allows me to get the care that I do now through the VA. It’s less pain, but I's still chronic pain. If I say I have tension headaches, I think being able to receive medication from the VA is much easier. Because going back and submitting those additional findings, justifies why I  may need medication following a surgery. I think a lot of Veterans who retire and look for a disability claim. One of the biggest challenges is being able to justify the need for additional care. I have felt that and I’ve heard it through other Veterans. Former troops that I supervised who come to me for assistance on submitting claims or how they should go about getting proof that there’s an injury that occurred during service and it’s still and issue now.  

- M: for the back condition that you were referring to earlier? Did you go through an appeal process to get a higher percentage?

- P: The appeal process was me going back to the gentleman who gathered all of my information earlier. And he explained that I would need to appeal that particular ailment. And that in order appeal it, I would have to prove that there were additional findings. It was the second, third and fourth ailments that are related to your initial claim, that that helps you get a higher rating. That just supports that fact that there are actual ongoing issues that should be related to the initial claim. Again, the initial claim was just the fact that I had a cervical fusion. 

- M: Was this referring to secondary claims? Like you can show you have a condition because of the disc. 

- P: Yes

- M: What would be an example of that? 

- P: The chronic headaches. That was one of them. He gather all of the, I think there were two additional claims on top of the first injury. The first one was chronic headaches as a result of the degenerative disc in my neck .The second one was my left arm would go completely numb and I had no use of this. Over time, I went to neurology, and they did an EMG, and they determined that the degenerative disc pressing on my spinal cord was causing my left arm to go numb. Then I had no use of it. It was not captured in the first claim. The only thing that was captured in the first claim was that I had a cervical fusion. I think the second and third claim was in addition to, I don’t know if I am saying it properly, but yeah that’s what it was. 

- M: So the to clarify the first time you applied you applied for the disc. Did you also apply for migraines in the arm condition at that time?

- P: I did not. I guess, not thinking through. You know all of the issues related to an injury, but I assume that if I show proof that I have a cervical fusion, the VA or whoever determines the disability would do the research. But  in reality, after the fact, you have to prove everything. My assumption was that they are only going to do the minimal research to do your disability rating. My assumption was that they would look to see why I had a cervical fusion. I also understand after the fact, that after serving for 25 years I have books of medical records, and that could take months to go through, to figure out injuries that could have been a result of the issue in my neck injury. 

- M: Thanks for sharing.


## Prototype testing -  Follow-up questions

- What was the experience like for you? 

- P: It was very easy. Being able to type keywords. You start to type something in this box, the fact that it pulls up suggested ailments is great. It may be beneficial if there is a way, let’s say I pull up post-arthritis in knee, if there was a way to link. Let’s say that I have knee pain that also results in shin splints....it may be beneficial..I think it would be helpful if there was something that cued the Veteran to think to any additional injuries that may have been a result of arthritis in the ankle. Do I have foot pain? Do I have toe pain As opposed to submitting arthritis in ankle. You go to the clinic and they evaluate you. I’m thinking of when I went to the exam. They have you bend it and turn it. And you say, I can’t turn my ankle 90 degrees or 45 degrees because of my toes. Well did you submit a claim for your toes? If there were something to help the Vet think to other issues they are claiming. I think it would have been helpful to me. I didn’t submit online, so I guess it is a little different. I  couldn’t believe in 2020 I had to do it on paper. I don’t know if that is just initial claim. I was required to do everything on paper. They had to go through and find everything and I had to write probably 200 different lines. I think they had to annotate where in the medical records they found that stuff. 

- M: that was a lot of helpful information there

- M: How did you know what to put for “condition”? 

- P: Again, It think you are just guessing. You would think to what is bothering you and start to type that here. It is fairly self explainable. I think most individuals would just go with the most basic terminology to put back main, my ankle pain, headaches, you know whatever the case may be.  You would go off of how you best describe what ails you.. And then choose whatever pops up

- M: Some of these, you had a more specific diagnosis. How did you know what to put, what medical term to put there? 

- P: Only because I went through the process and had 6 million tests. I would not have known. I guess over time, going through all of these tests, and they reference tinnitus, and they educate you what on that is. 

- P: If you are young or new to the military, you might not know what that is. There is some stuff that I looked at, I probably wouldn’t know. Like lumbocacral, but now seeing that it is actually back pain \[shows term in prototype].  

- P: You have to rely on being educated from the medical staff. I would not have know what it is had I not gone to audiology. 

- M: So it sounds like in general if you have experience with medical system, that's how you're able to like learn the term, but otherwise you don't know the medical term.

- P: Correct

- M: Did you learn about them through C\&P exams or through earlier exams? 

- P: Through earlier exams. It helped when I went through the VA exams. I was already educated on the issue because of having so many hearing tests. Reevaluated over the years. 

- M: So you knew the term when you were applying. It wasn’t because of the application 

- P: Correct

- M: Scroll down to the directions. Did you read the instructions?

- P: Yes, I did

- M: Let’s read them again. What do you think they are saying?

- P: It basically says that you need to type in conditions and the systems will suggest possible matches. It does say that you don’t have to choose one of the suggestions. 

- P: I guess I could have just entered it as, now that I’m looking back, I could have just typed ankle sprain and not have necessarily had to choose, post-traumatic arthritis. I should have just typed ankle sprain for that. So maybe I didn’t fully read it. 

- M: That's okay. So before rereading it and kind of, you know, thinking about it like you did right now, did you feel that you had to choose an item in the dropdown?

- P: I did 

- M: How did it make you feel when you didn’t find your item? 

- P: I just thought I had to choose something that I thought was personally close to. ...Maybe bolding that, may make it stick out a little more. We tend to look at the bold items. It might stick out more. 

- M: What do you think about the list of suggestions that were displayed as you typed in?

- P: I thought it was good. I thought you had a lot of options to choose from. I thought that made it simple. For me being able to browse through and first see if I found exactly what I was looking for or something that may be closely related to. 

- M: What do you think that list of items represents? 

- P: I think they represent medical conditions that are similar to what you are typing. Someone is taking the time to build this system and going in and adding every possible ailment related to foot pain that then makes it easy for the user to choose one of those ailments

- M: Do you think the VA has what it needs to understand what you are trying to claim? 

- P: I’m not sure if I can answer that questions. All of my appointments were contracted out to another medical facility and the medical facility that I went to, there was a huge language barrier with all of the staff that was there. The language barrier made me feel like i wasn’t being seen properly.  

- P: They would refer to the ailment by its medical term. And I would say, I’m not really sure what that is, you need to be more clear and they would say something like, oh, so you don’t have this so you’re not dealing with this issue? And it’s like no, it’s the fact that I don’t even know what you are saying. If you say abracadabra of the knee. I might be like, what is abracadabra of the knee, and if you say that’s a knee sprain, and I can say, oh yes, I claimed a knee sprain based on xyz. But if you just approach me a medical term, I may have no idea what this word is. And I think most people would not know the medical term. I feel that if the VA is using this outside agencies to conduct the exams to determine whether or not you have an ailment. It could the person I was dealing with, there should be some ability to discuss what this actually means prior to you having to speak to it. Everything was addressed to me in the medical term. The only reason I was able to put two and two together. Can you explain it to me in a way that I can understand what you are trying to ask me? The language barrier became an issue and it was very frustrating. 

- M: That definitely sounds frustrating. I so taking a step back to pretending that this now this has happened yet and you're just entering your medical information right now and you're estimating the thing for the first time. Do you think based on these conditions that you've entered right here, the VA has what it needs to understand what you're trying to claim.

- P: Yes, this is definitely much clearer than my experience

- M: When you were doing this prototype itself, I noticed that you typed in hand, but then you ended up selecting something with the shoulder. Can you kind of talk through what your thought process was there?

- P: Because I had to choose so many options and I just chose shoulder because it was an easy way to choose something. I just chose whatever I saw next

- M: Okay, so it was just because it was something that you also had and then similarly, you typed an ear and then you selected tinnitus. Is that what you were looking for there? 

- P: Yes, I was thinking of the issue I had in my ear. But trying to think of the easiest way, cause most people might not know what tinnitus is. So if I type in ear, it did say ringing in the ears. There was another one that was humming or something like that and I thought it was nice that it \[the system] brought it up so easily. 

- M: How was it scrolling through and seeing the left, right and bilateral?

- P: I don’t think it was too much. I think it helped to make the best possible choice. It will make it easier for you to speak to it, when you sit down with the examiner to discuss. If I’m going in for right knee instability. If the provider is expecting me to speak to that,  It is going to save time, as opposed to coming in and saying, what’s wrong. I think it saves time for both the provider and the Veteran

- M: You had talked about, when you are entering these, I’m not going to enter anymore because realistically the initial claim will gather 95 to 98%. Can you say a little bit more what you meant by that? 

- P: In my experience, when you are submitting your initial VA claim, whoever is assisting you with that claim, is basically telling you that everything they found is something that warrants a disability rating. So I wouldn’t expect to have to go back and add multiple new ailments. Usually it is just having to provide additional information on something that you have already submitted. There may be cases where someone tries to do it themself. And then they realize that there is only 3 or 4 things they claimed and there should have been 20. But I’ve never met someone who tried to do it themself. They’ve always used the resource that is communicated to you to use. To help ensure that you are doing in the right way up front. 

- M: You feel that people would only enter a few conditions because that’s the kind of guidance they are getting when they are first applying? 

- P: When you are first applying, they are capturing all of your medical conditions while you served. the bulk of whatever you’re told is claimable. So based on that, I don’t think someone would have to go back and add a bunch of items. It would be a handful of issues which is really in support of you needing an additional disability for a particular ailment that you claimed. 

- M: So you said the initial claim is very thorough, so if you have to submit more, it is likely because you’re submitting conditions that are related to conditions you already claimed. 

- P: yes

- M: Before when you were reading the directions, if you could scroll down, you recognize that you could have just submitted ankle sprain. Could you do that? 

- Types ANKLE SPRAIN and scrolls and clicks save. 

- P: I did have to think for a second. Like how do I save it? I think you saw me scroll down? I was expecting it to be like, just save, but then when I scrolled passed it and saw save. I thought that has to be how I save it. 

- M: Overall was there anything that was confusing? 

- P: I thought it was pretty easy to use. Pretty step by step. Fairly user friendly. 

- M: Any ways that you can think to make it easier? 

- P: I would say, no. I can tell that continuous improvements are being made to make it easier for the user. And you can tell that. I think this is pretty easy to use.

- M: Any last thoughts on the prototype?

- P: o 


## Post-testing interview

**_A. If they have filed previously_**

- M: So, going back to your experience filing, so your 2 experiences filing, there was the 2000 claim after you were discharged and then your supplemental claim afterwards. What's the most recent experience?

- P: Well I haven’t actually done the most recent experience. I’ll need to go in and add. If I’m going to honest, part of me feels like, why go in an add the additional claim if I’m already at 100%. But I also realize that it is necessary to add an issue that is related to my service. The only reason I haven’t done it, is that I know it is not something that needed to be done yesterday. I think someone who is not 100% would probably do it the second that they are diagnosed with sleep apnea. If I’m not mistaken, sleep apnea is like 50% disability, if you are a Veteran looking to get additional percentage, you would do it much sooner. I know I have to do it, but it is not something that I need to do immediately. 

- M: So for, so then the most recent one that you have submitted was the additional information about the disc or was there another claim?

- P: yes that was the most recent. 

- M: And that was when you said you did it by yourself online?

- P: yes

- M: Can you tell me about any resources you used or people that helped you to fill it out? 

- P: The VFW claim representative. He actually gave me a print out, step one, step two, it was just as easy as the prototype that we just used. Literally everything from start to finish was on there. I felt that everything I was submitting, was valid. The last step was to notify him when I was ready to submit.  I guess I don’t know if there is a way for them to go into the system and say, hey you know check this individuals new submittal because there’s something. For some reason, he wanted me to notify him when it was complete and he could go in the system, I guess to process it. Or to put it on top of the list, or something along those lines. 

- P: As a veteran in your last 6 months of service, you are told you get preference for disability, as opposed to waiting till you are after you are out. Those who are transitioning are going to get priority, so you tend to make it a priority, because you know that the disability rating is going to be huge when you are separated, especially when you need care, if you need medical coverage when you get out.You are educated to do the claim as soon as possible to ensure you are receiving proper treatment once you are separated

- M: What resources do you plan on using for the sleep apnea claim. 

- P: I know this is a prototype, but having used va.gov in the past, and knowing that it is step by step to add claims, I’m just going to do it myself. It tells you how to file a claim. It is pretty step by step. Even though I know you are working on continuous improvements, the program is fairly easy to use now. You sign in, you start a new application, step by step, I can add my ailment, I can add any supporting documentation, I know when I submit there is a way for me to check the status of my submittal. 

- M: Do you have any thoughts or anything you want to share before we wrap

- P: I thought the prototype was easy to use, as a Veteran, as a Veteran who knows troops that are separating and I know the process can be difficult for them. I appreciate that someone is making these continuous improvements to the Veteran community. 

- M: How did you decide to submit a disability claim

- P: I served 26 years, so I knew that how important it was to have additional coverage once I separated. You hear form colleagues about the benefits of having disability. A disability rating. Whether it be benefits for your kids to go to college, property tax, just the additional funding, there is so many different benefits to submitting your disability and then based on your rating, state by state there are a bunch of different ways you can use the rating to benefit you and your family. 

- M: Is there anything you would want to redact?

- P: No
