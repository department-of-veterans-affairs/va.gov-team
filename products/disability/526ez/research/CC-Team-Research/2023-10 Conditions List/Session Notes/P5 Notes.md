# Notes

## Warm-up

- Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov.

  - You know, I use it very frequently, actually, probably at least a couple times a week. .

  - Very frequently, couple times a week 

  - Use it to order prescriptions or look at my blue button medical record and see what my doctor is writing about me 

  - I had CT and MRI and electrocardiogram and I logged in yesterday and there were no results so I will wait till next week and look at the results, I don’t want to wait till the VA calls me I want to see my results 

- Could you tell me about any benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 

  - _If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_

    - About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?

      - Oh god, it’s a whole long list. I can’t remember all of them offhand but it’s everything from that I have a neck injury to my right hip injury to a whole host of other things 

    - Do you have plans to file additional disability claims in the near future? 

      - How do you plan to file the claims (online, by mail, with VSO, etc.)?

        - I have something pending right now I just did a HLR a high level review and I am waiting to hear back. The virginia appeals attorney chimed in the call and i’m just waiting and they should it should only be a week or so to hear the result and im like wow that’s quick to hear the result of that by anyhow 

        - No plans to apply for more disability claims 

  - _If they are not getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_

    - Have you filed claims that are currently being evaluated?  How did you file the claims (online, by mail, with VSO, etc.)?

      - I don’t think I personally applied online. And here’s the reason why. Okay, now I get it, you know Veterans going in and file things I get it but here’s the problem - most Veterans don’t take the time to research their disabilities, Title 38, you know what I mean? So they, I mean, not unless this is really gonna be extremely helpful and tie things together to medica records and such. I use the Virginia Department of Vetearns Services they have a representative at my work. I use a representative there to review everything I wanted to submit and they submitted it for me as my representive. 

      - E: alright. And are you aware whether they submitted online or paper form? 

        - Oh I dont know. They just.. I email them everything. They scan documents that I had like hard copies of they submitted it however they did not show me their screen so I have no idea how they submitted it 

        - Now, would I like if the question is like, okay, me, if I was a younger veteran, for example, and I was doing this for the first time, would I want to do it this way?Yeah, probably because you know most younger people I mean I just turned 60 okay so people that are probably younger they want to do everything electronically and do this and that so yeah they I probably would use this sure Absolutely.

        -

    - Are you in the process of, or considering filing any new disability claims in the near future? 


## Prototype testing

Test 1

- ~~Actual situation (past claim filed)~~

* Talk me through what you would do on this screen. 

* What do you think would come next after finishing entering your medical conditions? 

**Things to watch for:**

- General behavior of how they use the autosuggest component

  - Did they end up using a suggested condition or using free text

  - Did they understand that they can use free text

  - Do they scroll through the suggestions

- Did they find their condition easily or did they take time trying to decide what suggestion to go with (or whether to enter free text, or edit an existing suggestion)

Condition 1: 

- Basically, I’m assuming that’s gonna want me to enter, for example, should you want me to just go and start typing (E: yes) Typed in migraines (headaches) “Right there, boom, I like how it populated like that. Alright, there we go, migranes, headaches.”  

- Ok, and then I would save that and then I would hit the save button I’m not gonna do it until you tell me to (E: prompts him to continue) Ok so boom, that’s what I have right now. So add another condition if I wanted to 

Condition 2

- Ok let me think about something. Ok I have another one I can add. 

  - types in “right hip strain”, scolls list, and does not see it in the list, “Hmm doesn’t show but I’m gonna hit save. Because that’s the way that one is listed in my VA record. Let’s just say it’s just those 2. 

  - So I don’t want to add another condition. SO I don’t where I continue (E: prompts him to continue adding conditions – Are there any other conditions that you would be comfortable adding for the purpose of the session ) 

Condition 3

- So I’m gonna dd another. Just for you. 

  - Types “tinn” I don’t know if I’m going to spell it right, pulls tinnitus

Condition 4 

- Types in “hearing loos” finds “hearing loss, other than tinnitus” 

- Okay oh that’s enough because the more conditions you add the longer it’s going to take for them to evaluate it so that’s enough. Ok, next question. 

- E: So if you were filling this out for real, would you hesitate to add more than 4 conditions? 

  - That’s just me based on experience and knowledge and wisdom and you know all the years of dealing with the VA, but a younger soldier? I don’t know they might just enter everything they think they have or whatever but yeah if they do it that way man, it’s gonna take forever, but do they know that? Who knows? Maybe yes. Maybe they have other friends that share information on how to navigate through the system of VA or maybe they don’t, you know what I mean? 

  - E: Ok, well assume for the sake of this exercise you’re comfortable adding more. Are there any other? 

  -

Condition 5

- “Types lower back pain”, scrolls the list, and submits 

Condition 6 

- I’m going to add another one here .. I’m trying to think how to spell it. I think that’s how you spell it. Something like cervical retricolopthy 

- “Cervical radicolopthy” i think that’s how it’s spelled, scrolls the list does not see it and presses save 

Test 2 \[optional - only if participant has time to do actual and mock scenarios]

- Mock scenario

* Talk me through what you would do on this screen. 

* What do you think would come next after finishing entering your medical conditions? 

* TINNITIS: I already put that, doesn’t add it again

* KNEE SCENARIO: Types in “Right knee pain” and submits free-text

* BURSITIS: “I don’t even know what bursitis is. Should I use chatgpt to figure it out? I would probably go to my phone and search it. Googles bursitis - hmm interesting. Okay…… See so you gave me this so how would I know what to put? I know I have right knee pain but you just gave me bursitis.” 

  - E: right, i gave you the name of a condition

  - So should I just enter the condition? I would probably just enter it like that. B-u-r-s-i-t-i-s … scrolls and finds bilateral first, scrolls and finds right knee. 


## Prototype testing -  Follow-up questions

- What was the experience like for you? 

  - 16:23 I think it’s ok. If you look a bunch of things populated and it was easy like “hearing loss” but if someone typed “right ear hearing loss” would that work? Because you noticed that a lot of what I typed in did not pop up. This dictionary needs to be so broad that it can have. What if there’s a dumb Veteran and they type in “ I can’t hear in my right ear” will it show up. THis is for someone who’s halfway decent and has vocabulary and knows what to put” 

  -

- How did you know what to put for “condition”? 

  - Cervical radicolopothy is a term I know but will a younger Veteran know the term what if they just say the symptoms. This list has to be very broad

  - Some of it is generic, if I’m a veteran who just came out and it’s on the Veteran to start looking at their medical records 

  - I know because I do my own research, I look at Title 38, I look at medical records, I look at medical terminology. Sometimes it is just “lower back pain” 

  - I think that’s why a lot of Veterans use VSOs. I used to use disabled veterans of America. They’re trained professionals, they cut right to the chase. 

- Did you read the instructions?

  - If yes:

    - What did these instructions, “Please tell us the new conditions you want to claim?” mean to you? 

  - If no:

    - Go ahead and read the instructions now. 

    - What do these instructions, “Please tell us the new conditions you want to claim?” mean to you? 

  - “Oh it’s NEW conditions?” - shows he did not read the instructions before 

  - “Maybe instead of right hip I should type in hip instead of right” 

  - No I did not. I skimmed and saw “ok this is where you enter a new condition” 

- What do you think about the list of suggestions that were displayed as you typed in? What do you think that list represents? 

  - Correlates to the actual condition. How I entered right hip strain and nothing came up, I might have confused the system. I think what this is trying to do is automate things more but it also depends on how well you enter things but either way you still will get a C\&P exam. 

  - E: What i’m hearing you say is you might have some concern if you type in something and it’s not prepopulated 

- Based on the conditions you entered, do you think the VA has what it needs to understand what you are trying to claim? Why or why not? 

- Was anything confusing? 

  - Right hip does not pull up something, that is how I would enter it and nothing pulls up. This tells me the algorithm is not capturing everything. 

  - When I type in just “hip” things show up. 

- Are there any ways that you can think of making it easier to enter a medical condition? 

- Any last thoughts on the prototype before we move to the next section? 

-


## Post-testing interview

**_A. If they have filed previously_**

- Can you tell me about your most recent experience filing a claim on VA.gov?Tell me about any resources you used or people that helped you?

  - First application was 2002. Newest claim was 2018 or 2019. I think it was a supplemental claim and my Virigina Veteran representative were the ones who submitted for me. 

- E: Let’s go back to your original claim. Back in 2002. What resources did you use to prepare that claim? How did you decide to submit a disability claim?

  - None, I did it on my own. You know what the resource was? An army buddy of mine who is older and retired before me says “Kenny do this and do that and you’ll thank me later put in this put in that for that. So when I was out processing, I remember at Fort Belvore they had a VA representative there and this lady was very nice and she was going over all the things, you know, for everyone leaving the military and I was like Oh this might be what my buddy was talking about. Ok so then I could have sworn I filed a paper claim maybe? It’s been so long ago. Something like that. And then that’s how the process started. Yeah, I think I even went for a CMP exam and this and blah, blah, blah 

- E:  Ok it sounds like an army buddy suggested that you apply for a disability, is that correct?

  - Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. 

- How did you decide what medical conditions to claim for? 

  - I looked at my medical records and saw everything that I had. And I said, you know what, I have, I know I got hearing loss. Let me put in for that. Boom. You know what I mean? Stuff like that.

- E: You mentioned earlier that you’re the kind of person that would do a lot of research is there any you recall doing? 

  - Yes but back then there wasn’t too much things on the internet. 

- E: how do you access things now? 

  - Oh my gosh, there’s so many resources available. 

* I looked at my medical records and submitted everything I had. 

* I know the VA is even, you know, contacting even more saying, oh yeah, put in for this, put it for that.You know, I mean, that's a good thing. But back in my time when I retired, there wasn't too much available. As far as resources. In other words, I think a lot of it is about, yeah, if you have interaction with those that have come before you or passed through the halls before you and you know you're at the right place right time and you just happen to meet a friend or a veteran that that teaches you. Because I've run into a lot of even old friends that, you know, I haven't got a high school friend who was in the Navy.He lives on Long Island, New York, and I talked to him now about a month or 2 ago.

* I said, John, man, you get anything in the VA? He goes, oh no,I don't know how to do that. You know, he's missing out, and missing out on benefits. And he's sort of like, I don't like 8 years in the Navy and stuff.

* See, so a lot of guys they just either, you know, don't think they can get anything or it's just you know they don't know how to do it they're too late to put the paperwork in and figure it all out and You know, so I think there's a lot of veterans out there that just missing out...But me, my driving factor was my army buddy, you know? Cause I, I didn't have him.I mean, what, what would I have done?  I'm glad I did put all that stuff in because I think back to when I sustained all these injuries \[and it was] when I was in the military. I'm like, oh my god, I'm thinking.Thank God my buddy, you know, showing me all this stuff. 

* I have daily headaches, my, by the way.I've been in 2 vehicle accidents, one was in the military, one was after. Oh my god.And it's funny because I have a new VA doctor now too, cause they sometimes rotate.And he brought up like he says \*name\* I think you got a TBI and I think about that I said oh my god I said, you might be right.I might have it. So that's what I did the CT and MRI for and I'm waiting for the results and stuff.

* Because my head hurts every day. It hurts right now even as I'm talking to you.But I just. My life, you know, just, okay, I accepted. I'm in daily head pain.You know, I get headaches every day. You know? But whatever. Alright, yeah.Moving on.

- E: That's sounds really hard. Thanks for sharing. So did you receive a diagnosis from a medical professional prior to? Submitting your disability claims.

  - Did I receive a diagnosis prior? Yes, I, I received the diagnosis that, yeah, they thought it was due to my neck injury because, you know, when car accidents, whiplash and stuff, yeah.

  - And so that's why, you know, I think this one, the headaches, I think that was the supplemental that I got in.

- Okay, that was the supplemental claim. Okay, and you're still waiting for the results on that one?

  - Oh no, that one's done. Okay.That was approved really fast too. We only had to wait like 4 or 5 months. 

- E: Any other thoughts or suggestions?

  -  Again, I think it think it wide in that, you know, when you start typing things in, if they can widen that to pick more things up.That's gonna be a heck of a lot better. Yep, but overall, I would like to say.That like I said earlier. I use the va.com website like at least I swear to God it's like 2 times a week at least.I love it. My refills on my prescriptions, you know, I do secure messaging with my doctors.I love it. Everything works great. It does. It really does.It works great. And I love it.

- E: It's nice to hear that really positive feedback too. Thank you for sharing.

  - I mean, I love it. So I'm a champion of the VA. Hoorah!
