P = Participant


## Warm-up

- M: Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov.

- P: Probably back in the early 2000s was when I first got my online account. Some of it, I have been happy with and some not. Some of it is totally useless. And some is very beneficial

- M: Have you used it recently

- P: I filed a disability claim in the last year. I’m just receiving health benefits currently. 

- M: Are you receiving any disability compensation

- P: No, I was denied

- M: So there are no conditions that you are receiving benefits for?

- P: Correct

- M: do you have plans to file additional disability claims in the near future? 

- P: If I remember correctly, they said I had a year or 2 appeal it, so that's probably the route I'm gonna go.

- M: so you don’t have any plans to file new claims but want to appeal a past claim?

- P: yes

- M: And how do you plan to file the claims? Online or by mail? 

- P: Yeah. I had started with a Texas Veterans Commission, and honestly, I'm not real happy with the lack of response from them. So, I will probably try another Veterans Association and see if I have better success.

- M: So for those veterans associations, do you file online by yourself and they support you or did they submit the claim for you? 

- P: Well, with Texas Veterans Commission, they submitted the claim for me. But follow-up was almost nill and, You know once I finally did get in touch with them they didn't seem very interested.

- M: Did you look into submitting online?

- P: Well I did have a VA pension approved in 2011. But because at 65 my pension turned into retirement pay, and I didn’t understand that they were going to pull the pension and eventually they did. And Texas Veterans Commission was the person who filed the original pension claim for me. So I just continue to use them, but like I said, I'm not happy with the recent experience I had with.

- M: Okay, so to clarify your previous experiences following have all been through that one organization.

- P: correct


## Prototype testing

Test 1 – actual situation (past claim filed) 

M: Walk us through what you would do on this prototype....

P: okay, this kind of looks familiar. 

M: Do you have any questions before you start?

P: There was a list of 5 or 6 conditions and I’m not sure which ones got submitted. I can take my best guess.

M: Yes, let’s do that

M: I’d like you to talk through what you would do on this screen.

P: I would click where it says enter the name of your condition below. Start with that. 

\[has trouble getting focus on the field; able to get there on recommending hitting tab button]

P: I’m tying in as much as I can remember from the application from TRC. 

- Types in migraines and selects “migraines (headaches)”

P: Should I add another condition? 

M: Yes do it as you would. 

- Types in major and selects “depression (major depressive disorder)”

- Types in bilateral frost bite, clicks out of the field and clicks save

- Types in renal cell carcinoma, clicks out of the field and clicks save

- Types in hearing and selects “hearing loss (other than tinnitus)”

- Types in tinnitus and selects “tinnitus (ringing int he ears)” 

P: Ok, I see all the conditions above with an edit box. 

M: Are you done adding conditions?

P: Yes, I think that was it. 

M: What do you think would come next? 

P: Probably when they started. How long I’ve had them and when they started. 

M: So you would expect additional questions? What else would you expect?

P: Common sensibly, I would think the VA would want to know when it started and for how long. M: What made you select the migraines option?

P: Because it came up. Anything that happens with the VA, I go with the dropdown box rather than trying to ad lib something. 

M: When you typed in bilateral frost bite, when you typed it in, nothing came up. What did you do, what did you do then? 

P: Yes, I just left it as bilateral frostbite. 

M: So it was clear that you were able to type in your response there? 

P: yes

M: How was the experience for you? 

P: Yeah, as far as this, I mean, it was fairly straightforward and fairly simple. I didn't see any problems as far as getting the symptoms that I wanted.

M: How did you know what to put in for condition? 

P: Well, again, this is going back to Texas Veterans Commission. They looked at all of my stuff and she said, okay, well, let's put this, this this this and this. She said basically said, let's it's kind of a situation where we throw stuff at the wall and see what will stick. 

P: I figured, ok, you know what you are doing, so I went with what they went with. 

M: Did you come in knowing certain conditions? 

P: Yes, absolutely. Because I’ve had them for so long and I’ve been treated by the VA for so long. It seemed like there is a long term connection between my service and these conditions. 

M: So there were certain diagnoses that you knew you wanted to apply for from your healthcare experience and the the veteran organization helped identify more conditions for you?

P: Correct. 

M: But you would not have put those conditions if they hadn’t surface them?

P: Well, I wouldn't have known that that was a condition that the VA would have considered. For example, let's say the renal cell carcinoma. I didn’t get that until 2009 and I left the service in 77. So that was something they \[TRC] suggested that I put in there that I would not have considered. 

Test 2- mock scenario

M: So thank you for doing that with your conditions. We have a couple of mock scenarios that we would like also like to test to see kind of how you would navigate those. 

1 Tinnitus

- Type in tinn and selects “tinnitus (ringing in the ears)”

2 Torn tendon in knee. Painful knee. 

- P: Oh I wouldn’t know. Something to do with orthopedics, maybe, but I would have no clue what area they would come under. 

- M: give it your best shot

- P: I’ll tell you what. Normally I would put this on hold and go to another screen and google. What this would be and would the VA cover it and what would it fall under. So I would I would get that information off the internet and then come back and answer this. If you ask me how you would approach this. 

- M: Can we see you do that? Yeah, can we see you do that? Can you open Google and show us what you would type?

- P: yes

* Opens up google

* Searches for “va disability for torn tendon” and looks at top search result from Veterans Guide.org

* It comes up with “TDIU and tendonitis” 

* P: I’m thinking tendonitis but I’m not sure what TDIU is. Oh, total disability, ok. I would go ahead and go with tendonitis then. It looks to me from this that VA would approve that as a service-connected condition. Do you want me to go ahead and enter that?

* Types in tend and selects “Tendinitis (Tenonitis) in knee, right” 

3 – bursitis

- P: I’m guessing right off the bat probably bursitis

- Types in “bur” and selects “bursitis in elbow, right” but that isn’t what he wants. Goes back and selects “bursitis in knee, right” 

M: Can you tell me your thoughts as you were navigating those options (bursitis)?

P: Well it was listing several body parts for the bursitis. And you said just to look at the right knee one. I miss-clicked the first time, because my mouse didn't go where I wanted it to, but I just clicked from the drop-down box on bursitis right knee.

M: so it was an ok experience for you having to scroll, read through and select the right one? 

P: yes


## Prototype testing -  Follow-up questions

- M: Did you read the instructions on the page before you started? 

- P: yes

- M: So I would like to kind of understand better what the instructions meant for you. So for this first one, it says, enter the name of your condition below and we'll suggest some of the possible matches.

- P: So you don’t have to choose one of the suggested conditions. What does that mean? Well, if it’s not something that’s specific to what you have, then I wouldn’t choose it. I would just type it in, ad lib kind of. But as I mentioned earlier, if it’s in the dropdown box that’s the choice I’m going to make because to me I’ve been dealing with the VA for a long time. 

- P: It always seems to streamline things with the VA if they have choices available to you from a dropdown box that match what you need. 

- M: How did you know what to do if your item was not in the dropdown

- P: Well, for example, the bilateral frostbite. But like I said, I just type that as bilateral frostbite since it was nothing in the drop-down box that said that I just left there was and hit save.

- M: Ok, so you were able to navigate not selecting an item and typing your own without problem?

- P: correct

- M: What did you think about the list of suggestions that came up as you typed in?

  - P: it seemed pretty extensive. I mean, all but that one, 5 or 6, I was able to choose straight from the dropdown box.  I’m guessing that bilateral frost bite is not one that would come up a lot otherwise it would have been there. 

  - M: What are the items coming up?

  - P: Different options. If you are trying to convey to them what your medical condition is that you are claiming. So, I'm guessing bilateral frostbite is not one that they come across very often or probably would have been in there.

  - M: Ok what do you think the list itself represents? What do you believe the items and list are when you're typing in and you see them?

  - P: Different options. I mean, if you’re trying to convey to them what your medical condition is that you are claiming. I’m guessing of the experience that they have with all of these claims, they have all of these lists already compiled, and especially with the, I’m forgetting what it is called, the new claims

  - M: Pact Act?

  - P: Pact Act, yes. They are probably coming up with new ones all the time. Unless you starting typing in there what the symptom or medical condition is, you are not even going to know there is a dropdown box. You have to start typing something. For the first one, as soon as I typed in “mi” migraines come up.

  - M: you wouldn’t know there were suggestions until you start typing. Is that an ok experience?

  - P: yes. It is similar to if you are web searching. You are typing something in the search box and a list of suggestions comes down. It is basically the same thing to me.  It achieves the same purpose. 

- M: Was anything confusing? 

  - P: I will say, yes. I wasn’t sure because they had save and add another condition. And that was completely out of the box. Do I click the save first or add another condition first. 

  - M: how about in general, this process of adding conditions? Or would you prefer to add conditions in another way? 

  - P: to me this is a whole lot easier than me having to manually type in everything. 

- M: Other than the save in the add another condition, is there anything else that you can think of that you'd want to improve on this page here. Are there any ways that you can think of making it easier to enter a medical condition? 

  - P: No, this is pretty straight forward for the most part. 

- M: So, if you scroll up and we look at yours, so you knew that the ringing in the ears was tinnitus immediately. How did you know it? 

- P:  I’ve had ringing in my ears for probably 50 years, but I didn’t know it was tinnitus. It took some hearing tests and other kinds of stuff and the C\&P exam. I got information from the examiner that I not only had hearing loss, I also had tinnitus. 

- M: So what does it mean to you to have the condition listed like that? “tinnitus (ringing in the ears)”

- P: Ringing in the ears might be misleading. Because for me it isn’t ringing It’s like loud static all the time. And so I would have a problem with just the word ringing. Maybe there is another word they could use. Ringing or static in ears or some other kind of disturbance. But just rining in the ears by itself, that doesn’t cover all tinnitus. 

- M: Would seeing ringing in the ears make you not want to choose it?

- P: maybe before I had learned about the condition. But since I’ve been educated, no I wouldn’t be confused. 

- M: how about for hearing loss? Did “hearing loss, other than tinnitus” make sense to you?

- P: yes

- M: ok, if you scroll down, can you type hearing loss into the suggested box? 

- P: yeah, apparently that is the only other hearing loss other than tinnitus. I guess that is a broad category. 

- M: Could you go ahead and type in “a” and scroll down a little bit. I'm wondering like for you, what it's like to see the, condition, the, like, information and parentheses, if that brought up anything to you.

- P: If I just type in a, I’m seeing lots of different words with a in it. That is not much help. Especially since they are not all words that begin with a. It’s got an a at the end of the word. Why are you looking for pneumonia if you are typing in an a. 

- M: How about this one. Do flatfoot.

- P: Three of them come up. Left, right, and bilateral

- M: See the term in parentheses, what does that raise to you? What are your thoughts when you see another term in parentheses?

- P: I'm assuming that is what the medical term might be. I guess that is what they need to you as the medical terminology for the condition. 

- M: so you would still select that if you have flat feet

- P: yeah.  


## Post-testing interview

**_A. If they have filed previously_**

- M: So I have a couple of questions on your experience filing. So you said you applied about a year ago with that Texas organization. Were there other resources you used when you were applying?

- P: I did a lot of google searching. I do get some VA newsletters. I forget whether it is called rally point or video of Veterans with experience filing claims. So I did look at some of those

- M: So you did all of that in advance of applying? 

- P: yes, I did a lot of google searching. 

- M: Why kind of information would you google?

- P: What constitutes presumptive conditions. I know Agent Orange is considered presumptive for cancer for Veterans who are in country for Vietnam. For example the hearing loss, because I was an infantry man and a missile crew man, there was a lot of times I had ringing in the ears or very muffled hearing, and it goes away after a little while and you don’t think much of it. Over time that can cause a lot of damage and cause a lot of hearing loss. That is not necessarily presumptive but they take into account what your MOS in the service was. That is one of the things I had to google. 

- M: Anything else? 

- M: How did you decide to submit a disability claim? 

  - P: When they pulled my pension. That was the beginning of the year. I knew it was coming cause they told me. My income was almost cut in half. And I saw all these other people are getting service-connected disabilities. And I thought let’s find out how many of mine are service-connected and went from there. 

  - M: Ok so you decided to submit a claim after that pension situation happened, but before you hadn’t done it. 

  - P:I thought about it before. And actually, back when I applied for the pension. I talked with one of the claims people that was at the VA at Temple. This was back in 2010. I had mentioned bilateral frost bite and his exact words to me were good luck with that. 

  - P: so you know, well either this guy isn’t going to be much help, or there isn’t much shot. 

  - M: so that person dissuaded you. 

  - P: yes. 

- M: When you did decide to apply, how did you decide what medical conditions to claim for? 

  - P: Some of them I already knew, like the migraines, the hearing loss. The other conditions were offered up from the TVC. She suggested some of the other conditions. 

  - M: Did you need to go back to your health records or did you just know the diagnosis? 

  - P: I knew what symptoms I was having. Yeah, I had to go back and check some of the medical records. I did get a disc from VA with all of the claim information. It is 100s of page and I haven’t had time to go through it. That is something I will do prior to submitting the appeal. 

  - M: Ok so that is like a review of all your records? 

  - P: There was a time when I had to keep hard copies of call my records. And after it it filled up a full file cabinet...and the VA has this online thing where you can actually download copies of VA records...it is a lot easier than requesting the release of information. 

  - M: Good, I’m glad that option is working for you. 

  - M: How confident did you feel in your selection of medical conditions to claim for? 

  - P: I was pretty confident at least 2. I figured the hearing loss and tinnitus. Apparently that's just very common among, people who worked around jet aircraft, rocketry, missiles, things of that nature. Plus I was in infantry and you know you got a fire and maintain all these infantry weapons and I fired a red-eye missile which was a shoulder launched missile. Those things are very loud. You can have hearing plugs in your ears but that is not going to stop the sound of a rocket going off next to you. 

  - M: so you were  confident in the ones you knew were more common? 

  - P: yes, I was pretty confident when I submitted the claim. But it came back kind of piecemeal. They would deny this and deny that. The others would be in process or awaiting information. It was probably 3-4 months I got the first information, before I got the final denial of the other claims. Including the tinnitus and hearing loss. At that point, I was just like I don’t understand, I don’t understand how they could deny it. 

  - P: I was not rated for any. I was denied all of them. The biggest thing they said was that there was no “nexus” which is apparently the connection between the start of the disability and the continuing of the disability afterward. They decided there was no nexus, so they denied everything. 

- M: Did the VA reached out to you to ask for clarifications or additional information regarding your disability claim

  - P: NO not for this. There was a point when the VA hit me with an overpayment bill for my pension. So they asked for more information on my financial status. But as far as the claim itself, no. I think they had access cause I have been going to the VA for over 20 years. So they have access to all my medical records from that period do they really didn’t need anything else from me, once I had completed the paperwork. Except for the C\&P exam. 

  - M: Would you be confident apply on va.gov or was it a better experience going through an organization?

  - P: I don’t know how to answer that other than to say I would not go with TVR again.

  - M: So from the page that we saw today, which is just one small part of the website, is there any concern for you doing that by yourself? 

  - P No not at all. That was actually easier. And you know, I mean there might be some who are very computer illiterate, that would have a problem with that, but I’ve been using windows since 95. I wouldn’t say that I’m an advanced user, but I’m an intermediate level.

  - P: Using that page was not difficult at all. If I can do it myself and achieve the same outcome without getting this other organization involved, I’ll go ahead and do that. But if I need their help I wouldn’t hesitate to try to find one that would help me. 

- M: Was the disability claim submitted online or on paper?

  - P: TVC submitted it so I don’t know how they submitted it. Again lack of contact, lack of response, lack of information was just appalling. 

  - M: How did you work with them?

  - P: I was on the phone. 

  - M: You mentioned being familiar with the form online. How is that?

  - P: When I applied for the financial waiver, I did that all myself. 

Do you have any other thoughts on anything we discussed today you want to share before we wrap up?

- P: I have some suggestions for my healthy vet. One of the things that is most useless is prescription tracking. They like to make a big deal about that. You get your prescriptions before you see it online. No you can’t. You get your prescriptions before VA has a tracking online. I mean that to me is totally useless. They might as well just do away with that and stop misleading people. 

- M: I’m sorry to hear that is frustrating.
