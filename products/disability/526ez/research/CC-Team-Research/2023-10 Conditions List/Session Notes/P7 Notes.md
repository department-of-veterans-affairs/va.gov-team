## Warm-up

- M: Okay, great. So before we look at the website and the prototype, let's start with a few background questions. Can you tell me about your past experience using va.gov?

- P: I’ve a trusted folder. I have a va.gov account that I opened in 2019. I access it when I have to. Haven't been using as much as I probably could because I am retired from the military. But I have not signed up for VA clinics yet. I’m still being seeing at Fort Belvoir in the Washington DC area. But I am familiar with the VA and I know it is a one stop shop and you can sign up and you are goof forever after that.  

- M: Are you receiving any, benefits from the VA at this time?

- P: I get disability every month. As far as using the clinics, not yet. I tried to sign up for the VA clinic at Fort Belvoir, but they are over-subscribed. They said to keep checking back. What I’m finding with the Fort Belvoir hospital, is that they are not able to see retirees for all of the primary specialties, like dermatology.  I prefer to use VA if I can. 

- M: I see. To clarify, you said, are you receiving disability benefits right now?

- P: yes

- M: If you are comfortable, do you know how many conditions are receiving benefits for in which conditions those are?

- P: Probably 8 or 9. 

- M: Do you remember how you filed for this? Did you apply online or by mail?

- P: What I did was when I retired from the military, I went to veterans of foreign wars, I think VFW, and they assigned me an agent who helped me go through my medical folder and said this is admissible this is not this is not admissible. Then I went to the VA hospital up in Washington DC. And I went through a series of physicals. And then they gave me a disability rating after about a month.

- M: So was the, group that you worked with the VFW, the ones who submitted your medical, your disability claim?

- P: yes

- M: Do you know if they did it online or mail?

- P: I'm assuming they did it. He took hard copy, so I'm assuming you did it by mail.

- M: Okay, alright. Thanks for sharing that. So now we're gonna go into evaluating our prototype.


## Prototype testing

Test 1 – actual situation based on past claims filed (on paper) 

- \[shares screen]

- S: Just to clarify. You have the claim that you applied for in 2013 with that organization. Do you have any new claims you are filing for?

- P: PACT Act. I have one year and I filed for that about a month ago, so I have 12 months to submit for the PACT. That’s one. Also some flare ups from my 2015 physical have not improved. So I was going to ask VA could re-look at some of certain areas of my original disability from 10 years ago

- M: So you're gonna apply for a new claim for your PACT Act eligible claims and then you're gonna apply for your claims for increase for some of the conditions that you already have been claimed for.

- P: correct.

- P: Did you say you had already applied a month ago? 

- P: I had to get it through by I think September 15<sup>th</sup>. You had to meet the deadline . You have 12 months to follow after you meet the deadline to say that you are interested in, willing to go forward with it. So that was about a month ago that I did that. 

- M: So you just did the intent to file?

- P: That is correct. I have about 11 months left.

- M: So now we are on the prototype. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. To save time....

- P: OK, so I’m going to look through now and file for disability compensation \[reads the directions outloud from “Step 2 of 5...” through to “if you don’t know the name of your condition or aren’t finding a match, you can save the condition as you entered it” Ok so what I would do here is start typing in possible afflictions and see if it hits...I’ll start with tinnitus. I’ll start with ringing in the ears. 

  - Types in TINN and selects “tinnitus (ringing in the ears)”

  - P: Then I’m going to save that. I’m wondering if I should click Save or go to add another condition. Ok. I’m gonna go ahead and save it. Then adad another condition.

  - Types in GOUT and selects “gout in foot, left”

  - Types in GOUT and selects “gout in foot, bilateral” 

  - P: Gout, right foot. Or bilateral. Okay I’m going to do that. 

  - Types in SLEEP and selects sleep apnea.

  - P: The question I have is when I went through the medical records with the VFW guy. He went through everything. So I would probably have a stack of conditions in front of me to make sure that I have captured everything. I would like the VA to have captured everything that would have occurred while I’m on active duty. I would like VA to give me credit for somethign that occured during active duy. 

  - Types RIGHT SHOULDER ARTHRITIS. Scrolls down. 

  - P: I don’t see it. \[scrolls down] Should strain. Left bursitis. I’m looking through here and all the things that are on here...oh maybe not. I had a rib fracture. I’ll so that

  - Selects rib fracture from the list. \[context: he saw this autosuggestion when he typed RIGHT SHOULDER ARTHRITIS and since it was applicable to him, he went ahead and selected it.]  

  - Tries typing RIGHT SHOULDER and scrolls down.

  - P: I’m going to just put in RIGHT SHOULDER ARTHRITIS and see if it pops up. Shoulder strain \[hovers over shoulder strain, right]. \[keeps scrolling] I don’t really see...\[hovers over poststreptococcal arthritis] I see arthritis, \[hovers over bursitis in shoulder, right] bursitis in shoulder. The question I have is, I don’t know if it is bursitis or a shoulder strain. \[hovers over shoulder strain, right] and selects. The VFW guy was able to help me with that. I will just put in shoulder strain and see what comes up. 

  - Types in SHOULDER STRAIN and selects shoulder strain, right

  - P: I would just keep adding in conditions here as I look at my folder.

  - Types in EYE. Scrolls. 

  - P: Let’s see if there is anything with the eye. Not really. 

  - Types VISION and scrolls down

  - P: I like that they have added these ideas on here. Some of these, I don’t know what ankylosis, hip means, without some sort of reference. I’m not sure what the difference is between ankylosis and bursitis. I know what varicose veins are. Shin splints, yes. Some of those are not applicable to me as a male. I don’t have iron deficiency. I’m going to put in vision impairment

  - Types in VISION IMPAIRMENT and saves vision impairment. 

  - Types in KIDNEY D and selects chronic kidney disease (CKD)

  - P: I’m trying to remember some things I have had. 

Switch to mock scenarios

Scenario 1 \[ringing in ears]

- P: I would have put tinnitus. I don’t know if there was anything after tinnitus. Acute tinnitus. Severe tinnitus or something like that.

- Types TINNI and selects tinnitus (ringing in the ears)

Scenario 2 \[torn tendon and recurrent knee pain]

- Types in KNEE. Hovers over knee instability, right. Continues to scroll down. Goes back and selects knee instability, right.

- P: I’d go with knee instability, right

- M: What made you select that?

- P: I was looking for a torn ACL. Bursitis, I don’t know if that is related to a torn knee tendon. My knee was probably not fully functioning. So I thought instability of the knee. When you walk, it is painful  as you walked downhill.

Scenario 3 \[bursitis]

- Types in KNEE and scrolls. Selects bursitis in knee, right.

Actual situation – new claims 

- M: You had mentioned that you had some new claims for the PACT Act. Could we go through those?

- Types in GOUT SEVERE and scrolls down

- P: I’ve already got gout in there. but I’ve already put those in there. 

- P: What I’m trying to do is emphasize that the gout has worsened, so I don’t know where I would do that with the choices that I’m given here. 

- \[selects gout, bilateral” 

- P: What is confusing me is that it is already in there. It is bilateral and I already added it again. 

- M: Are there any other PACT-related conditions you want to apply for?

- P: Let me think here

- Types DERMATOLOGY and scrolls down. Hovers over eczema.

- P: Is there a help button that says what something is? Dermatophytosis. Or I could google it. 

- P: I don’t want to select dermatophytosis if that is not what I have. 

- M: What made you select dermatophytosis here?

- P: Because I have had some recent annual dermatology appointments where they have had to take a biopsy. It seems like every year. What is materializing is that years after exposure to the skin. Probably in a Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan or Iraq type environment that would not have developed if I had not done serps (?). I’m going to say that this is a condition that has been morphing since I retired and I would just like to get it checked out. 

- M: You had originally typed in dermatology and then you scrolled and selected dermatophytosis. What made you specifically choose that term?

- P: Because I didn’t see any other term on there. Eczama was close. Derma leads me to believe that it is skin related. I would have gone to google and looked to see what dermatophytosis is. I’m assuming it is something to do with dermatology. That is just a guess. 

* M: For gout, when you first selected it, you first selected left and then you saw that there was bilateral? The first time you entered it, what was your experience entering gout. 

* P: So why did I put bilateral?

* M: At first you put left and then I changed it to bilateral

* P: Since 2013 I’m had episodes of gout in one foot. Never at the same time until about a month ago. And then it appeared in both joints. I would have put in the right foot, but then I saw a bilateral. So I assume that, if it's referring to both feet, that I’ve had experiences with both feet simultaneously. 

* M: For shoulder strain right, you had spent some time on that one and you originally typed in right shoulder.

* M: Let’s go ahead and replicate that experience. Type in right shoulder

* M: Can you walk me through what you were thinking?

* P: I was trying to refer back to an injury that I sustained overseas, where I fell on my shoulder. What was the diagnosis of the shoulder injury? What are my choices? Ankylosis, bursitis, tendonitis, degenerative arthritis, shoulder strain? It gives me a lot of different choices and I’m trying to think back to what was the diagnosis of my shoulder injury when I was in the military. It was a fall that I took. I don’t think it was tendinitis. Bursitis, no, I think that is acquired, Anklyosis, again, I don’t know what that is. Shoulder strain is probably what I would click on. It was a one-time episode. I injured my right shoulder and it didn’t go perfectly back to the way it was before. 

* M: To recap. You knew that you had something in your shoulder. So you looked in the list and you selected the one that was most related to what you had. Was there something specific that you were looking for when you scrolled the list?

* P: Something like separated shoulder. A torn ligament in the shoulder. Something along those lines. Tendinitis and bursitis tend to be things that worsen over time. I don’t think those were the immediate cause of the injury. I think it was traumatic, but I see post traumatic arthritis. Osteoarthritis, now I don’t think it’s degenerative. It was an episodic injury and that is the closest that I came to it. 

* M: You had typed in “eye” What were you looking for there?

* P: I now have floaters. So I could have written in eye floater. I just acquired it about a year ago. It started to appear in my left eye. I don’t know if that is degenerative eye disease or if it is episodic. I’ve been told it can go away. This is the first of what I hope is not more floaters in my eye. Which is a detached gel that is in everybody’s eye. 

* M: Ok so you were

* P: That’s what I was looking for. Eye impairment. I should have written eye floater probably on there. 

* P: How did it feel when you could not find your option? A little frustrating. I would recommend a dictionary. Maybe something where if I clicked on ankylosis, they would tell me what that is. I don’t know what ankylosis is. And how it differts from bursitis, tendonitis or strain. 


## Prototype testing -  Follow-up questions

- M: What was the experience like for you adding medial conditions? 

- P: I would say that I would still rely on VFW. I always value the experience of what they have seen before. This would take a long time for me to go through. I would wonder if I got everything. That would be a little frustrating. I tend to be a dinosaur. Not today’s generation where I can write quickly, type quickly. I am a little more paper oriented. I’m not so much, same things on the web and such. I tend to keep paper in the event I have to show something in the future. If I have to prove something that I had. I’m not so trusting of the system. That they’re gonna scan everything and make sure it is in my file. 

- M: If you were doing this, you would prefer going to the organization with you worked with? So they're the ones kind of submitting the claims. But just based on kind of your experience right now and you kind of running through this project with us, how was your experience for you of doing this?

- M: I think it was okay. I don’t think I got everything by any means. Did I put everything down that I could have. But most of it matched up with what I remember I applied for disability. 

- M: How did you know what to put for “condition”? 

- P: From memory. Remembering some of the things from 10 years ago. Things that I had been afflicted with over the course of 30 years and 10 deployments. So just off the top of my yead, started throwing things out. 

- M: So did you read the instructions on the page? It’s okay if you didn’t. 

- P: Please tell us NEW conditions

- P: The first one, the second one,......\[goes on reading through conditions] 

- M: If you scroll down and you see the two paragraphs on the page. Did you read those the first time you went through?

- P: I did read the first paragraph. \[starts rereading] Ah ok, didn’t read that \[about being able to enter your own]. Can I enter my own?

- Types in eye floaters. 

- P: I didn’t catch that

- M: So that is something you hadn’t read understood before that you could type in a condition and submit it as you typed it. 

- P: Correct. I just thought those were my choices. My mistake. 

- M: What did you think this list represented?

- P: I thought that would be one, would go forward with an exam and what they would address. 

- M: What did you think were the individual items?

- P: I thought they were helpful. But again, I wish knew what some of those medical terms because maybe I qualify for it. I just didn’t know that. I should have written in dermatology biopsies or something like that. If I didn’t know what dermatophytosis was.  

- M: The items that were popping up, what do you think those items are?

- P: They covered pretty much the gamut. A lot of things in there. Things that also didn’t apply to me. Some of those were female things. Others were things I don’t remember ever having. But it was helpful. It allowed me to look at the range of options and it might have jarred something in my mind. Hey, don’t forget, you had a left hand injury or something like that. It was helpful. 

- M: Do you think the VA has what they need to understand?

- P: Yes, especially after you corrected me on that where I could have put in anything, like eye floaters. if you give us the option to put in things that we can't explain or we don't know the medical terminology for, I’m sure the doctor can figure out what eye floaters are. Some long term with tosis at the end. So that gives us the opportunity to get that in there without knowing the exact terminology. 

- M: So you liked both options. Is there a preference that you have? 

- M: Yeah probably putting in what I think the problem is and then letting the doctor figure out what the medical terminology is. Like I said, dermatophytosis, I should have looked that up, instead of putting that in there. 

- M: Was there anything that was confusing for you?

- P: Just frustrating of not remembering everything. Number two, not being able to determine the difference between bursitis and tendinitis. That is where I look at google and determine the difference. 

- M: Thanks for sharing that

- P: Are there any ways you can think of ways that we could make this easier for folks to enter their medical condition?

- P: Maybe a glossary. Like type in the first 5 letters and it gives me choices and it says “this is what this is” and “ this is what this is.” If not, you are going to end up with shoulder hurts with incremental pain. That is pretty wide. If we could narrow that further with a medical term or something that the VA looks at and says, this guy has bursitis or tendinitis. They can pinpoint it better than I can.

- M: You are looking for something to define the terms better? 

- P: Something that narrows what I’m trying to find. 

- M: Can you talk me through what that ideal experience would be for you? 

- P: Maybe if I could type in a sentence. My shoulder hurts where the collarbone meets the rotator cuff. I don’t know what that is, but when I go in for a physical, they could say ok, according to your records, there is something that hurts between your shoulder and your rotator cuff. Something where I can write a sentence instead of two or three words. Like gout, right foot, bilateral. Could it be an extreme flare up? Is it long lasting? How painful on a scale of 1 to 10? Where is it? Is it between your big toe and your second toe. Or is it in your ankle? Making it a little more descriptive, instead of just gout in the right foot. 

- M: you would want the option to include that information. 

- P: Be a little more descriptive. I don’t want to waste the doctors time and he has a better idea of what my problem is. 

- M: When you were scrolling through you saw left, right and the different options. What was that experience like for you? 

- P: It allowed me to narrow. So when I go in, we are not looking at the wrong ankle or x-raying the wrong ankle. We are able to pinpoint where the issue is. 

- M: Do you have any last thoughts?

- P: Anything that VA can do that would improve the service that is provided and that can give the Veteran to explain conditions that may be worsening over the years would be helpful. If I don’t have to have a 3<sup>rd</sup> party involved like VFW, I don’t even know where to find these guys now\....If I’m an old guy with not a lot of social media experience on how to get through some of these. Forms and things, I think it would be helpful to be as descriptive as possible. 

- M: If you can think back to your experience in 2013 working with the VFW? Do you remember how they supported you in entering your medical conditions? 

- P: We were advised, before we got out of the military, to make several copies of our medical records. Then you make an appointment with one of these agencies. The soldiers and the officers know by word of mouth how to get hold of these folks. They go through the folder in 15 minutes. They look at the reason why you went to the doctor and the ones that you have credence to the left and the ones that don’t to the right They’ve done so many of these and they’ve worked so closely with the VA, they know what’s going to go forward. They saved me an incredible amount of time. They took care of everything. They mailed it off. Then the next thing I knew, I had an appointment for dermatology and an appointment for ophthalmology. An appointment for orthopedics. All I had to do was report to the hospital in Washington and I went from one x-ray to another hearing test to another thing. It was over the course of 3 weeks. The next thing I knew, the paperwork went through the system and I got my disability diagnosis. It wasn’t long at all.

- P: And it's just when you're getting out of the military, it's so there's so much going on and that was so helpful for me not to have to worry about that.  Because a lot of folks will just say, you know what, that's too much of a hassle. I'm not going to go through all that. I'm just gonna, you know, I'm either not gonna collect disability or I'll get to it when I get to it. And then of course you never get to it. So I can't tell you how helpful that was 10 years ago. .

- P:  This system that you have here didn’t exist 10 years ago. I would say this is helpful. I’m still a dinosaur so I still like to get folks to help me out. 


## Post-testing interview

**_A. If they have filed previously_**

- M: Was your most recent experience filing the 2013 claim?

- P: On a scale of one to 10, it was a 10. It was a great experience.  

- M: Other that the VFW, were there other resources or people that helped you with the claim. 

- P: Some peers. They said, you gotta do this. I know some guys that that never filed a disability claim ever. And what I understand is that if you file it in 2023 and you got out of the military in 2013, you’re not going to get disability payments retroactively. They’re only going to pick up what happened 10 years later. So I’m thankful that through my peer network I was given good advice and I was able to make that priority when I got out of the military. Even before starting a job search and all that. Take care of yourself first because your body’s been broken, beaten up for the past 30 years. Also if you don’t file it when you first get out, it may not be admissible later on. ... So I made sure that I went through everything that could possibly be wrong with me. And I asked a lot of questions at my disability physical. 

- M: So what made you decide was your peer network and they were the ones that inspired you to do this? 

- P: Word of mouth and folks that had retired 5-6 years earlier and were receiving disability payments. It was a non-taxable payment. That is such a major advantage. Aside from that I wanted to know over the course of 30 years, what was going to cause me problems down the road? Was it arthritis? Was it something with my knee or ankle? Maybe a shot I took to the head. All of that I wanted to have tested to verify that I was ok coming out of the military. 

- M: When you were working with that organization in 2013, and they had entered the medical conditions for you. You said that it was based off of your medical file. That is how they knew what conditions to file for? 

- P: Correct, and if it wasn’t in your medical file, you really had to have some sort of proof or documentation that this had happened to you. I remember that I was playing softball at a military event in 2005 and I got hit in the mouth. When I went to the dental portions of VA , they said that this is not claimable. I can’t remember why they denied that. I felt that it was associated with my military time because it was at a military event. So I’ve had some success and some not so success with disability. 

- M: When you applied did the VA ever reach out to you for verifications? 

- P: For the dental, I had to go back to newport RI where the dental facility was. I had to look for any documentation on what the dentist did at that location. I had to do a little extra homework. I had to go back to the facility where I was seen. 

- M: you physically have to go back to the facility?

- P: Not physically, but I had to contact them and see if they had any additional documentation to show that it was a major injury to my mouth. 

- M: When you got back all your decisions from that claim, what did you think of the decisions?

- P: I was very happy. I felt that my time in service was recognized and that injuries and events that occurred over those 30 years were compensated. 

- M: So when the VFW organization was working with you and viewing your medical information, did they help you claim anything that you didn't’ know that you had? 

- P: yes, so you get a hearing test and it goes up and down over the course of your 30 years in the military. Sometimes you’re hearing test is better. Sometimes not, it worsens. What they were able to show was that from the time I entered ROTC, I had shown hearing loss. And they called it tinnitus. They said most Veterans are going to suffer some form of hearing loss. Because of being on a truck or being near generators or being near weapon systems that are loud. They said, it is a pretty good statistical possibility that you have tinnitus, so we are going to put you down for that. And then of course, I had to get another hearing test and I went to the VA facility and they verified what these guys had put as potential hearing loss. These guys are really good. We want to make sure that you get credit for everything that you are aware of. 

- M: So earlier you said that you had submitted an intent to file for a PACT Act claim. 

- P: How do you plan on submitting those claims?

- M: I’m going to fill out the paperwork. It’ll probably ask me where I served because I know there is a specific time when the toxins were exposed. Solders were exposed to toxins in Iraq, Afghanistan. And then I will have to show some kind of documentation on my DD 214 that I was in that war zone. So I know that I’m going to have to go back to my records and try to find proof, records, something that proves that I was assigned to that division that deployed. So I know I'm gonna have to do some homework and kind of been putting it off but I'm gonna get it done within the next 11 months.

- M: And how do you plan on submitting that claim? Are you going to go through an organization or do it online?

- P: I think I'm gonna do it online. And then I'll wait for a follow on saying you need to report to this clinic. To verify or see whether you, you know, through x-rays of your lungs. Or blood test or whatever it is that you actually were afflicted by that toxin.

- M: And how have you identified which medical conditions you're going to apply for?

- P: I'm not really that familiar with the PACT Act, but I assume it’s afflicting breathing, lungs. I don’t know if there is a way to verify that it worsened from the time of the episode to today. Can they test for carcinogens? I’m not really certain what they are going to look for. I tend to fill it out. From what I heard, most soldiers are finding that if they were in that environment, they are getting some compensation. 

- M: Okay, so at this point you're not exactly sure what you are submitting. The claim for, but that's something you'll do the research for.

- P: I was in a certain area that was known to have burn pits. As a result of the burn pits, I may have been exposed to carcinogens that I was not even aware of 

- M: Anything else you want to chat about today? 

- P:....I want to thank the VA for that and for folks like that you are taking notes and recording this up for VA. 

- M: Thank you for sharing that. One last question. Is the dermatological condition that you shared earlier? Was that PACT Act related? 

- P: I don’t think so. I think it was exposure to sun in places like Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia. It was like hundred degrees and you take your protective gear off and  then you get sun....every time I go to the dermatologists now , she finds new spots....the next thing you know she wants to do a biopsy on it. So, that is what I do every year. It is a ritual.
