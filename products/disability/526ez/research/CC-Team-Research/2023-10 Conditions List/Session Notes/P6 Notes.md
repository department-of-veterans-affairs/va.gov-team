# Notes

## Warm-up

- E: Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov.

  - I’ve been pretty successful with using Va.gov. I’ve been using it for a long time now. I don’t have too many complaints except travel. Travel has caused me a little stress sometimes. I haven’t been there in a long time. 

- E: What do you use it for? 

  - I go in for my prescriptions, I go in to see if I have mail. Mostly those are the 2 basic ways that I use it. I check it routinely. I’m actually on Va.gov at least once a week 

* E: Could you tell me about any benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 

  - _If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_

    - Yes, getting disability benefits. I have never used it for education.

    - E: About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?

      - I wish I could remember. I know I was attacked in the Navy. And I am receiving benefits for that. I have a hearing problem. I don’t think I was approved for that, but that happened during the attack. But I don’t remember, I had to go through a psychiatrist to be able to pull up all the details of the attack and the aftereffects. And the psychiatrist was able to help me to remember. I was in the Navy in 1962. I was there from 62-65, and it was not very nice at that time. So, my disability is mostly PTSD. And I’m a little slow. I’ll have to think oh, and unemployability. Okay, I’m an educator. I’ve been an educator most of my life and began working with children. Well, I had to stop working with children because I had problems where I could not deal with violence. 

    - E: Do you have plans to file additional disability claims in the near future? 

      - No, I don’t see any reason to. 


## Prototype testing

Test 1

- **Actual situation (past claim filed)**

* Talk me through what you would do on this screen. 

* What do you think would come next after finishing entering your medical conditions? 

**Things to watch for:**

- Okay, well, as I mentioned earlier, hearing really is a problem. And. You know, I, I never received compensation for that. So I could just pretend with that.

- _Types in hearing and clicks save - does not use the suggested items_ 

Mock #1: Tinnitus 

- Okay….um

- Let me ask, it says add another condition. Is that what you want me to do or do you want me to edit this hearing

- E: We want you to imagine you’re adding another condition 

- _Reads the instructions “enter your condition below”_ 

- _Types “ring” and finds ringing in the ears and saves_

Mock #2: Knee Tendon

- Painful kness. Did you say painful knees? 

- “Ok right knee pain… knee pain”

- _Types in “right knee pain” erases and changes to “knee pain, right” once she sees the format_ 

- _Scrolls down, doesn’t see it. Clicks save_ 

Mock #3: Bursitis

- Bursitis…. Oh now it switched for a file for disability compensation but I cannot go up or down..tell me what to do. It just switched. 

- E: Can you scroll down on the page maybe

  - I’m on step 2 of 5 disabilities. How do I get out of this?

  - E: try scrolling down the page, move your mouse down...... \*we continue troubleshooting and it doesn’t work so we close out and move on\* 


## Prototype testing -  Follow-up questions

- What was the experience like for you? 

  - It’s been a lot of trouble because my ears are so tiny and the hearing aids dont’ fit as well. Is that what you’re talking about? 

  - E: I actually mean what was it like for you entering the conditions on the page here that we just did as part of this exercise

    - Oh Okay, wasn’t any problems. 

- How did you know what to put for “condition”? 

  - I’ve had it since 1962. I haven’t been able to hear for a long time. That is an issue but at this point i’m 100% so I don’t really don’t have to worry about doing anything. But that has been a problem for a lifetime 

- Did you read the instructions?

  - If yes:

    - What did these instructions, “Please tell us the new conditions you want to claim?” mean to you? 

      - I did \[read them], yes 

      - Well I really already knew how to do this. I hadn’t thought about trying to claim anything more. I couldn’t really get into playing like I could, you know. You know what I mean 

      - E: Yeah no I understand. You know it’s just an exercise. So you did read the instructions. So when you type. I noticed you started typing “hearing” 

* What do you think about the list of suggestions that were displayed as you typed in? What do you think that list represents? 

  - Possibilities. Examples of different types of hearing loss. What we could call them. 

  - E: Yeah, ok. So you think they represent possibilities of what options. Ok. So I did notice that when you did it you didn’t end up selecting one of those options you just typed in hearing and saved it as hearing.

    - That was it 

    -  E: Did you notice that when you were doing that?

      - I saw the other things but I hurridly went on hearing loss other than tinnitus even though they call this tinnitus what I have

    - E: Oh tinnitus is what you have? 

      - Yes. 

      - Let me try and read everything instead of hopping on the train immediately 

      - These are other things. I think that's what I noticed when I first looked at it was that hearing loss and then I started seeing things that did not relate to any kind of. I have in \[the suggested conditions list] Bulimia, anorexia.

    - E: What do you think those other items represent? 

      - I don’t know if they have anything to do with hearing. Then I hurriedly went on in and did that, especially after I saw things like bulimia. 

    - E: So knowing that this now that you read this a second time here it says hearing loss other than would you, is this what you would select? So you do have, so what, if you were to try to enter a condition for that, what would you do?

      - I would still keep it. I would keep this entire thing “hearing loss other than tinnitus” 

Based on the conditions you entered, do you think the VA has what it needs to understand what you are trying to claim? Why or why not? 


## Post-testing interview

**_A. If they have filed previously_**

- Can you tell me about your most recent experience filing a claim on VA.gov?

  - Tell me about any resources you used or people that helped you?

    - It’s been a while. I didn’t even realize that I could file a claim for years, you know, I just suffered through it. So it wasn’t until. You know, too late, that I even thought about it. I didn’t even know people filed claims. So it was in the 90s. 

    - E: How did you submit that claim?

      - Disabled American Veterans (DAV) 

      - E: is that a VSO? 

      - Disabled American Veterans 

    - E: What kind of resources did you use? 

      - I had to fill out.. Well actually I went to the Veterans admin building it’s in Los Angeles and then we relocated here in 2000s so I went to the administrative to see about my hearing and I knew that I had lost my ability to hear in the Navy so when I went in for that but I couldn’t remember the circumstances I just remember that’s when I couldn’t hear anymore because I couldn’t remember the circumstances the hearing doctor told me I had no options 

    - E: How did you get to the DAV and submit the claim?

      - They did everything for me. They took me through they were very kind and patient and they actually did everything. It took a long time. And I was denied and they re-submitted my forms and after a while I’ve finally got it. 

    - E: How did you know what conditions to put the claim in for? 

      - I went to a psychiatrist and I was telling her what kinds of things were bothering me. The nightmares and things I was having and she took me through a situation where I began to remember a lot of the details of what happened to me in the Navy. It wasn’t easy. It was very difficult. Because really I had never been able to pull it in and now I think about it as… had I remembered I probably would not have been successful in life. I was actually attacked. During segregation, to have a white dude come after me in a sexual manner, you know what I’m saying. Being raised on this strict segregation and all of a sudden you know, somebody wants you for that. You know? So it wasn’t easy. It’s much simpler now. They have words for those things that happen to people. Actually a lot of folks are hurt and they don’t even know they are damaged. I didn’t realize I was damaged until I knew that something was wrong with me and I had good friends. I had friends through the Navy who were lifetime friends who brought it back to my attention. You know, along with faith right. The psychologist, all of a sudden, whatever she did brought out all of those memories. It’s amazing. 

      - She wrote a report of it and was got really disgusted with me because she said you know, you’re not realizing everything. You’re not telling me everything. It was quite an experience to go through 

* Do you have any other thoughts on anything we discussed today you want to share before we wrap up?

  - I’m just so happy the VA is a newer place, you know, and trying to help. And getting young minds together like yours and the other 2 people. To change the old ways of just saying no to Veterans but dig a little deeper to find out real reasons as to why. They hurt, you know, like recently upon the death of my husband and I had to go to a thing called PRC. And I’m happy that the VA has things where they are actually trying to improve. You know, my biggest problem lately has been dental. So I’m thrilled that you know at least they see that need other programs set up to help Veterans.
