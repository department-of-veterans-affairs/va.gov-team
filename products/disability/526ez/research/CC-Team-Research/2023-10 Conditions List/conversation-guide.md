## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, let me tell you about what we will be doing.

Today we're going to talk about helping Veterans describe a medical condition for a disability claim.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Feel free to ask any questions you may have at any point, but just know ahead of time that I may not be able to answer them until the end of the session.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _If no_: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - _If yes_: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
   - _If yes_: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Moderator starts recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.
* Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov.
* Could you tell me about any benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 
  * _If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask_:
    * About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?
    * Do you have plans to file additional disability claims in the near future? 
      * If you are comfortable sharing, are you filing because existing conditions have worsened or because you have new conditions you’d like to file for?
      * How do you plan to file the claims (online, by mail, with VSO, etc.)?
  * _If they are not getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask_:
    * Have you filed claims that are currently being evaluated?  How did you file the claims (online, by mail, with VSO, etc.)?
    * Are you in the process of, or considering filing any new disability claims in the near future? 


## Transition to prototype - 5 minutes

Great! Now let’s get into evaluating our prototype.

We’re going to show you a screen that we’re working on.
* This prototype is not the real website, and it may not function exactly the way you expect. This conversation is to help us make decisions about how to improve the website in the future. 
* Some areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not. 
* And, since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
  
We’re going to go through 1 scenario. I’m going to ask you to think of your own situation as you move through and answer the questions. If you don’t want to do that, then I will provide a hypothetical situation instead that you can use to answer. Are you comfortable thinking about your own situation for this exercise? 

* _[If they have filed previously (but do not have current plans in the near future:]_ 
  * You mentioned before that you have filed for a disability claim in the past. I’d like you to go back in time and imagine that you are filling out the form for that disability claim (that you previously claimed). You’ve come to the VA website today and have started filling out the form. You have come to the screen where you are asked to specify the medical condition or conditions that you are filing for.
    
* _[If they are planning to file a new claim in the near future:]_
  * You mentioned before that you are considering filing a new disability claim in the near future. I’d like you to imagine that you are ready to fill out the new disability claim. You’ve come to the VA website today and have started filling out the form. You have come to the screen where you are asked to specify the medical condition or conditions that you are filing for.
    
* _[MOCK SCENARIO: If they have not filed in the past and do not have plans to file in the future, or they are uncomfortable speaking about their medical conditions:]_ 
  * I’d like you to imagine that you have 3 conditions that you’d like to claim. I’ll give you more details about those conditions as we look at the screens. 
  * You are ready to start filling out the form for a new disability claim, and you’ve come to the VA website today to get started. You are on the screen where you are asked to specify the medical conditions that you are filing for.
    
Before I give you the link to the prototype, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. 

_Wait for screen sharing to work._

Now, I’m going to put a link to the [prototype](https://codepen.io/ccteam/live/poqxVpB) in the Zoom chat. You can click on that link.

## Prototype testing - 15 minutes

I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

To save time, we are skipping the beginning of the form, including the introduction and the screens in section 1 where you enter your personal information and information about your military service. We’ll start you on the first screen of the second section. 

### Screen 1 - Start

**(if testing based on mock scenario)** There is a description of the mock scenario on the zoom chat. Open up the zoom chat to read the scenario. 
* **Moderator copy/paste this in the zoom chat** 
  * _I’d like you to imagine that you have 3 medical conditions that you would like to file for._ 
      * _You hear a ringing or hissing sound in your ears. You believe that this is due to operating loud machinery during your active service._ 
      * _Your right knee bothers you on a daily basis. You tore a tendon in the knee during active service and since then the knee has never recovered fully. It is painful when you walk downhill or try to kneel or squat._ 
      * _You have developed bursitis in your right knee._ 

Do you have any questions before you start?

Go ahead and click Start.

### Screen 2 - Enter/select Condition

Talk me through what you would do on this screen. 

_If the participant is done adding conditions._ 
What do you think would come next after finishing entering your medical conditions? 

**Things to watch for:**
* General behavior of how they use the autosuggest component
  * Did they end up using a suggested condition or using free text
  * Did they understand that they can use free text
  * Do they scroll through the suggestions
* Did they find their condition easily or did they take time trying to decide what suggestion to go with (or whether to enter free text, or edit an existing suggestion)

### Follow-up questions

_If it is helpful to facilitate discussion, the moderator can direct the participant to go back to the enter/select condition screen._

* What was the experience like for you?
* How did you know what to put for “condition”? 
* What did these instructions, “Please tell us the new conditions you want to claim?” mean to you? 
* What do you think about the list of suggestions that were displayed as you typed in? What do you think that list represents? 
* Based on the conditions you entered, do you think the VA has what it needs to understand what you are trying to claim? Why or why not? 
* I noticed that you….
  * _if there were actions/behaviors of interest, this is our chance to follow up on them_
      * _Did they appear to struggle to decide what term to select? If so, ask what they were deliberating._
      * _Were they looking for medical conditions or terms that were not in the suggested conditions list? If so, how did this make them feel? How did they decide what to do next?_ 
      * _Did they use a suggestion as a starting point and then edit the content? If so, why did they want to add additional information?_
* Was anything confusing? 
* Are there any ways that you can think of making it easier to enter a medical condition? 
* Any last thoughts on the prototype before we move to the next section? 

## Post-testing interview - 15 minutes

Thanks so much for sharing all of that with me. You can go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Now that we’ve been through those scenarios, let’s talk about your actual experience with your own disability claims. I’d like to just let you know up front that if you do not wish to answer any of these questions, just let me know and we can skip them. If there are things you’d rather not discuss, feel free to leave them out of our conversation.

**If they have filed previously**
* Can you tell me about your most recent experience filing a claim on VA.gov?
    * Tell me about any resources you used or people that helped you?
* How did you decide to submit a disability claim? 
* How did you decide what medical conditions to claim for? 
    * Did you receive a diagnosis from a medical professional prior to submitting the claim? 
       * [_if yes_] If you are comfortable sharing, what were you diagnosed with? 
* If you can think back to the digital form, what was the experience like for you entering medical conditions to claim? 
    * How confident did you feel in your selection of medical conditions to claim for? 
* Has the VA reached out to you to ask for clarifications or additional information regarding your disability claim?
    * [_if yes_] What were the nature of the requests? What was your reaction to these requests? 
* Have you gotten a decision back?
    *  [_If yes_] what was the decision?
       *  What do you think of the decision?
       *  What were the conditions that you were service-connected through this decision?
       
**If they are planning to file in the near future**
* Where are you in the process of filing for a disability claim? 
    * Tell me about any resources you have used or people that have helped you, or that you are planning to ask for help?
    * What has the experience been like for you?  
* Why are you thinking about submitting a disability claim?
    * What medical conditions do you expect to claim for? How have you identified these? 
      * Have you received a diagnosis from a medical professional?
        * [_if yes_] If you are comfortable sharing, what were you diagnosed with? 
* When do you expect to file the claim? Why? 

## Thank you and closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. I just want to check once more that you are still feeling good about us using your feedback or if you would like to redact anything we discussed today?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
