## Background

This study evaluates design directions for allowing Veterans to file Supplemental Claims in the online 526EZ application.

Two [prototypes](https://www.figma.com/proto/P6IUm8gN00H3Yi1XzN80fj/-526ez--Condition-information-entry?page-id=6174%3A18589&node-id=6524-47192&viewport=653%2C-7741%2C0.75&t=lVGxess9idiVg78M-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=6524%3A47192&show-proto-sidebar=1) were tested: “Apple” and “Banana.” There were two key differences between the prototypes:
- Display of denied conditions
  - “Apple” includes a Veteran’s denied conditions on the Add a condition screen, along with their rated disabilities and the option to add a new condition
  - “Banana” puts denied conditions on a secondary page. It also has a slightly different visual treatment for Add a condition options
- Options for claiming rated disabilities
  - If a Veteran adds a rated disability to their claim, Apple assumes they want to file a Claim for Increase
  - Banana, on the other hand, requires Veterans to choose between a Claim for Increase and a Supplemental Claim on a rated disability

## Study goals
The primary goal of this study was to determine which of the designs best meets user needs when filing a supplemental claim within the online 526, without negatively impacting the user experience of filing a standard disability claim. This top-line summary focuses on this goal.

Secondary study goals will be addressed in the full research report. 

  
## Initial Findings

### Finding 1
**Veterans strongly prefer viewing all of their conditions, both rated and denied, on the ‘Add a condition’ screen. (🍎 for the win).**

- Of the 10 participants:
  - 6 participants strongly preferred Prototype Apple
  - 0 participants favored Prototype Banana
  - 3 participants liked the presentation of Banana, which featured tiled radio buttons, but liked the content choices of Apple (showing both rated and denied conditions)
  - 2 sessions were limited in time and didn't review both prototypes (both only made it through Apple)

- A common reason for preferring the presentation of one's denied conditions was the likelihood of not being able to remember received past denials, and saving the user from research or document sourcing
  > **P2:** "Apple breaks down the categories. Banana looks like a big blob. The way my brain works I start sorting by groups. Banana, I have to read everything in it. Apple, I can scan the headers and go straight to denied conditions."

  > **P8:** "I MUCH preferred Apple. It tells you everything right up front. No second guessing. Banana makes you go through an additional step. With Apple, I can do everything right away from the first screen."

  > **P13:** "I like Apple. All the information is in one spot: all my rated disabilities and my denied conditions. So you can see – like, what if I don't remember what I applied for?"

### Finding 2
**It is extremely difficult for Veterans to distinguish between a Claim for Increase and a Supplemental Claim for a rated condition.**

- In Prototype Banana, we tested two scenarios that required the participant to decide whether to file a Supplemental Claim or a Claim for Increase on a rated disability. In the first four sessions, Veterans were very confused about the difference. We then updated the content in Prototype Banana to better distinguish between the two claim types. But participants still couldn’t understand the difference.
> [!NOTE]
> Note: This distinction only appeared in Prototype Banana; Prototype Apple did not offer the choice of a Supplemental Claim on a rated disability.

- A majority of participants perceived both avenues of action as a means of declaring that a condition had gotten worse.
  > **P1:** "For both, you're trying to get an increase."

  > **P3:** "[It's] giving me two options, two ways to claim this. They seem very closely similar... It seems like new & relevant evidence is the same as I'm trying to get an increase. Two things saying the same exact thing."

- Additionally, users did not understand what a Supplemental Claim is. While some Veterans had heard the term, they understood it to mean something different from the VA’s meaning.
  > **P4:** "To me, 'Supplemental Claim' and 'Appealing' aren't very close together. We know rating means you got a rating, [and if] you don't agree, you're going to appeal  it… I think the [term] 'Supplemental Claim' is what's confusing. I don't get supplemental anything, I'm 100% disabled. There's nothing supplemental in my life. 'Appeal' is way more clear than 'Supplemental Claim.'

  > **P7:** “Supplemental claim… means adding something [like asthma] on to the already existing disability claims that I have. But if you do that, you start the process from Day 1, and you lose all that time that your first part was being evaluated.”

### Finding 3
**Most participants were able to add a new condition on both versions of the 'Add a condition' screen, but some did have some difficulty.**

- For prototype Apple, we were concerned that the visual hierarchy created by the bold subheads between options would make it harder for Veterans to find the option to add a new disability.

|---|

- Most participants had no trouble identifying “A condition I haven’t claimed before” as the option for adding a new condition.
- However, one participant could not figure out how to add a new condition when asked to claim a new condition, arthritis in the shoulder.
  - The participant noticed the correct option when first looking at the screen but then scrolled down so the option was no longer visible.
  - Then, when asked how to a new condition, they focused on the rated and denied disabilities and did not go back to the “add a new condition” option.

    > **P5:** “If you wanted to file, it does offer you the knee replacement, sleep apnea, asthma… Nothing really about a shoulder situation.”
  - It’s a little unclear why this happened. One hypothesis is that the first option did not stand out enough visually to be memorable.
- Another participant had a moment’s confusion, but then was able to select the right option.

### Finding 4
**Users expect the opportunity to add more information, especially evidentiary support, about their claim. Many were confused when this didn’t happen.**

- In the current design, only new conditions have substantial follow-up questions in the Conditions flow. Because the testing scenarios focused on Supplemental and Increase claims, participants were surprised and confused by the lack of opportunity to add more details about their conditions.
  > **P8:** “Wouldn't they want some sort of explanation for why I want my hypertension reviewed?? Are they just going to do that by looking at my medical records without any input from me?!?”

- Although we didn’t specifically ask about it, 6 of the 10 participants volunteered that they expected the opportunity to add more details about their conditions.
- Participants most often mentioned expecting to upload evidence.
  > **P1:** “I expect I’ll be able to upload my evidence on the next screen.”
  > **P10:** “I have new evidence so I'm expecting something on the next page where I have the opportunity to provide that new evidence”
  > **P13:** “I would hit edit once again for the Hypertension... It would bring up a screen and I could show them my new evidence to prove the rating needs to go up.”

- They also mentioned explaining why they’re asking for an increase or appealing, providing a personal statement, or indicating whether a Supplemental Claim was based on new, relevant evidence or on a change in law.
  > **P5:** “I could do some kind of edit – state my case why it should be increased.”
  > **P8:** “I'd want to see a screen where I can say why I want to have the percentage increase on my hypertension.”

- Because their expectations weren’t met, many participants were confused when they got to the Review your conditions screen. Several thought they should click the Edit button to add additional information.
  > **P5:** “If I was pursuing the Hypertension, I would click Edit and it would give me more detailed options. I'd be looking for how my condition has worsened or gotten better. Or related things to hypertension[...] Why I'm filing the claim.”
  > **P13:** “I would hit Edit and see if I can edit what they want me to edit. I would put down ‘due to the fact that the law has changed.’”

- We included text explaining that evidence could be uploaded in a later step of the application. Two participants noticed it and said it was reassuring.
  > **P4:** “I don’t know when I'll get to step 4, because this looks like I'm on step 2. I'm thinking I'll go to step 4 to upload my docs next. I like that because it makes it very simple.”

### Finding 5
**'Add a condition' language caused confusion.**

- On both the ‘Add a condition’ and ‘Review your conditions’ screens, Veterans were confused by use of the word ‘add,’ especially for Supplemental Claim or Claim for Increase scenarios (in which the original claim for a condition was being modified).
- This was not an issue in a related study ([2026-06 New or Increase at Condition Level](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/CC-Team-Research/2025-06%20New%20or%20Increase%20at%20Condition%20Level/New%20or%20Increase%20at%20Condition%20level%20-%20Reseach%20Findings.md#2025-06-newincrease-at-condition-level-research-findings): [related finding #1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/CC-Team-Research/2025-06%20New%20or%20Increase%20at%20Condition%20Level/New%20or%20Increase%20at%20Condition%20level%20-%20Reseach%20Findings.md#1a-participants-easily-chose-between-a-condition-i-havent-claimed-before-and-the-rated-conditions), [related finding #2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/CC-Team-Research/2025-06%20New%20or%20Increase%20at%20Condition%20Level/New%20or%20Increase%20at%20Condition%20level%20-%20Reseach%20Findings.md#1e-all-participants-were-easily-able-to-use-the-list--loop-structure-with-a-continuation-question-on-the-last-screen)). We hypothesize the difference between studies may be due to the earlier study’s focus on new conditions, versus the current study’s focus on denied and rated conditions.

  > **P4:** “It's still confusing to me because I'm not adding, I'm editing or adding to the claim. If it was said to me like that, that I'm editing a current claim or denial, then it would make more sense.”

  > **P12:** “Me knowing [what I know] as a VSO, I would say Yes to ‘add another condition.’ But I don't know that a regular person would know. ADD another condition - I'm already rated for migraines, I don't want to ADD that. Do you want to add, or do you want an increase? ‘Add,’ to me, means something new.”
