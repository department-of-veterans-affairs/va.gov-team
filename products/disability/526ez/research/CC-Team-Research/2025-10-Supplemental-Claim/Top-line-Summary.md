This topline summary is a high-level, top-of-mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Background

This study evaluates design directions for allowing Veterans to file Supplemental Claims in the online 526EZ application.

Two [prototypes](https://www.figma.com/proto/P6IUm8gN00H3Yi1XzN80fj/-526ez--Condition-information-entry?page-id=6174%3A18589&node-id=6524-47192&viewport=653%2C-7741%2C0.75&t=lVGxess9idiVg78M-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=6524%3A47192&show-proto-sidebar=1) were tested: “Apple” and “Banana.” There were two key differences between the prototypes:
- Display of denied conditions
  - “Apple” includes a Veteran’s denied conditions on the Add a condition screen, along with their rated disabilities and the option to add a new condition
  - “Banana” puts denied conditions on a secondary page. It also has a slightly different visual treatment for Add a condition options
- Options for claiming rated disabilities
  - If a Veteran adds a rated disability to their claim, Apple assumes they want to file a Claim for Increase
  - Banana, on the other hand, requires Veterans to choose between a Claim for Increase and a Supplemental Claim on a rated disability

## Study goals
The primary goal of this study was to determine which of the designs best meets user needs when filing a supplemental claim within the online 526, without negatively impacting the user experience of filing a standard disability claim. This top-line summary focuses on this goal.

Secondary study goals will be addressed in the full research report. 

  
## Initial Findings

#### Finding 1
**Veterans strongly prefer viewing all of their conditions, both rated and denied, on the ‘Add a condition’ screen. (🍎 for the win).**

- Of the 10 participants:
  - 6 participants strongly preferred Prototype Apple
  - 0 participants favored Prototype Banana
  - 3 participants liked the presentation of Banana, which featured tiled radio buttons, but liked the content choices of Apple (showing both rated and denied conditions)
  - 2 sessions were limited in time and didn't review both prototypes (both only made it through Apple)

- A common reason for preferring the presentation of one's denied conditions was the likelihood of not being able to remember received past denials, and saving the user from research or document sourcing
  > P2: "Apple breaks down the categories. Banana looks like a big blob. The way my brain works I start sorting by groups. Banana, I have to read everything in it. Apple, I can scan the headers and go straight to denied conditions."
  > P8: "I MUCH preferred Apple. It tells you everything right up front. No second guessing. Banana makes you go through an additional step. With Apple, I can do everything right away from the first screen."
  > P13: "I like Apple. All the information is in one spot: all my rated disabilities and my denied conditions. So you can see – like, what if I don't remember what I applied for?"
