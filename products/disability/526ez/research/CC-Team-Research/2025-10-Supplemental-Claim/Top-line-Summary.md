This topline summary is a high-level, top-of-mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

#### Finding 1:
**There is a strong preference for viewing all of a user's conditions, both rated and denied, on a single page.**

- The primary intent of this research study is to understand which design direction is preferred by users. Prototypes Apple and Banana were tested, with Prototype Apple featuring all of a user's conditions, including both rated and denied, on the 'Add a condition' page, while Prototype Banana showed only a user's rated conditions and featured an option to view their denied conditions on another screen. 
- 13 sessions were scheduled and 10 were conducted. Of the 10 completed:
   - 6 participants strongly preferred Prototype Apple
   - 0 participants favored Prototype Banana
   - 3 participants liked the presentation of Banana, which featured [tiled radio buttons](https://design.va.gov/components/form/radio-button#tile), but liked the content choices of Apple (showing both rated and denied conditions)
   - 2 sessions were limited in time and didn't review both prototypes (both only made it through Apple)
- There was frequent mention of wishing the conditions, regardless of being rated or denied, were presented in an ordered list, either alphabetically by condition or numerically by rating percentage
- A common reason for preferring the presentation of one's denied conditions was the likelihood of not being able to remember received past denials, and saving the user from research or document sourcing
> P2: "I don't like the boxes. I don't know why. Apple breaks down the categories. Banana looks like a big blob. The way my brain works I start sorting by groups. Banana, I have to read everything in it. Apple, I can scan the headers and go straight to denied conditions."

> P8: "I MUCH preferred Apple. It tells you everything right up front. No second guessing. Banana makes you go through an additional step. With Apple, I can do everything right away from the first screen... Apple looks nicer than Banana. I don't like the little boxes. The bold print - rated disabilities, denied conditions -- there's something I like. With the boxes, my brain stops flowing. I see the boxes as limitations. It's lacking flow... I didn't find anything in Apple particularly challenging. Banana requires more focus, more reading, more attention. I really had to look at the whole thing... which maybe you should do anyway before you start clicking on stuff. Banana, lack of continuity. I don't know why, even when I'm looking at my current ratings, even though Banana has them in a box, it's easier to read the percentages in Apple. With boxes, it doesn't pop out to me right away."

> P13: "I like Apple. All the information is in one spot: all my rated disabilities and my denied conditions. So you can see - like what if i don't remember what i applied for."


#### Finding 2:
**There is no discernable difference between a Claim for Increase and a Supplemental Claim in how they are presented.**

- In Prototype Banana, we tested two scenarios that required the participant to decide whether they wanted to file a Supplemental Claim or a Claim for Increase. After the first few sessions, we made a content change to Prototype Banana in an effort to further clarify the difference between the two claim types, and still received feedback that the two claim options seemed the same.
- Of the 10 sessions conducted, 7 saw and interacted with Prototype Banana.

>[!NOTE] 
>In Prototype Apple, this decision was made for them - if they chose a rated condition from the 'Add a condition' screen, they were directed through a Claim for Increase flow, and if they chose a denied condition, they were directed through a Supplemental Claim flow.

- Contextually, a majority of participants perceived both avenues of action as a means of declaring that a condition had gotten worse.
> P1: "For both, you're trying to get an increase."

> P3: "[It's] giving me two options, two ways to claim this. They seem very closely similar... It seems like new & relevant evidence is the same as I'm trying to get an increase. Two things saying the same exact thing."

> P4: "To me, 'Supplemental Claim' and 'Appealing' aren't very close together. We know rating means you got a rating, [and if] you don't agree, you're going to appeal  it. And [a] Supplemental Claim means I want you to rerate me for this disability. My generation of VA is you either get reevaluated or you redo your claim. I think the [term] 'Supplemental Claim' is what's confusing. I don't get supplemental anything, I'm 100% disabled. There's nothing supplemental in my life. 'Appeal' is way more clear than 'Supplemental Claim.'"


#### Finding 3:
**Most participants were able to add a new condition on both versions of the 'Add a condition' screen, but some did have some difficulty.**

#### Finding 4:
**Users expect the opportunity to add more information, especially evidentiary support, about their claim, regardless of claim type (ie Claim for Increase, Supplemental Claim, etc.).**
