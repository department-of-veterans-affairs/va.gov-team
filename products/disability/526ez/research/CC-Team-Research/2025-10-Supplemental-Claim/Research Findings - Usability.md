key_findings:
  - "Veterans strongly prefer viewing all of their conditions, both rated and denied, on the ‘Add a condition’ screen, as in prototype Apple."
  - "It is extremely difficult for Veterans to differentiate between a Claim for Increase and a Supplemental Claim."
  - "Veterans expect to provide contextual information and evidentiary support about their claim, and were confused about how to do that and why they weren’t able to."
  - "Most participants were able to add a new condition on both versions of the ‘Add a condition’ screen, but a few struggled."
  - "Users were successful in adding secondary conditions, although they don’t know VA terminology."
  # etc.
recommendations:
  - "Implement Prototype Banana’s ‘Add a condition’ screen once the decision to support Supplemental Claims in the 526 form is finalized."
  - "Assume a Claim for Increase for rated conditions (vs a Supplemental Claim) to remove decision burden for users."
  - "Provide decision support to help Veterans understand the differences between a Claim for Increase and a Supplemental Claim."
  - "Make room for users to provide context and justification right after adding a condition."
  - "Make it clear and explicit that Veterans will be asked for evidence at a specific point later in the form."
  - "List conditions in alphabetical order on the ‘Add a condition’ screen."
  - "Explore asking Veterans to indicate whether their Supplemental Claim is based on new evidence or a change in law."
further_research_needed:
  - "The ease with which a Veteran can add a new condition on the ‘Add a condition’ screen that features tiled radio buttons, subheaders, list order method, and/or a combination of these UI adjustments."
  - "How Veterans respond to and interpret intent-oriented content changes to the screens regarding Supplemental Claims and Claims for Increase."
underserved_groups_missing:
  - "While we recruited for Veterans with other than honorable discharge, and had sessions scheduled with them, both either cancelled beforehand or were a no show."
  - "Additionally, because we tested in Figma we were not able to test with AT users."

## Background
The current online Form 526 only allows Veterans to claim a new condition or request an increase for a previously rated condition. Veterans who wish to file a Supplemental Claim — a contestable issue for a previously denied or previously rated condition, which requires new and relevant evidence — must currently use the separate Supplemental Claim form (VA Form 0995).

The challenge is to seamlessly incorporate the ability to claim contestable (supplemental) issues directly into the Form 526 online flow, allowing Veterans to claim supplemental conditions, or a mix of new, increase, and supplemental conditions, all within a single application. This enhanced filing approach supports VA’s “no wrong door” policy, ensuring a Veteran is connected to necessary services regardless of how they seek help. The design must accommodate this new condition category without disrupting the already successful mental model for "New" and "Increase" conditions.

This work will involve iterating on the existing 526 online form, and it will affect authenticated users.
In addition, there is a companion report that focuses specifically on Veterans’ mental models around disability claims. These insights will directly inform our work on the Conditions flow, and we hope also be of value to other teams across the VA working on the disability benefits user experience.

## Research Goals
This research had two goals:

1. Primarily, we want to learn which of two design directions best meets user needs when filing a Supplemental Claim within the online 526EZ form, without negatively impacting the user experience of filing a standard disability claim, and
2. Secondly, we want to understand Veterans’ mental models around disabilities and the claims and appeals processes so we can adjust the structure of the conditions flow to best meet Veteran expectations.

>[!NOTE]
>Another report document contains the mental model definition. This report is dedicated to our usability-oriented findings from our research.

Both of these goals support the Getting Out, Taking Care of Myself, and Retiring stages of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). In the Getting Out stage, Veterans are engaging with VA to access benefits and services, especially healthcare and disability support. In the Taking Care of Myself stage, they are continuing to engage in support services, like seeking disability compensation for service-related chronic and/or mental health needs. In the Retiring stage, Veterans are finding additional sources of income, like disability compensation. Regardless of the specific experiences unique to each stage, enhancements made to the form as a result of this research will improve the overall disability filing experience.

When time allowed, we also asked Veterans about secondary conditions to understand their familiarity with the term and concept to further inform our understanding of their mental models. Lastly, we gathered Veteran feedback and responses to some UI changes recommended by the Platform team.


## Research Questions

### Goal: Determine which of the design directions best meets user needs when filing a Supplemental Claim within the online 526, without negatively impacting the user experience of filing a standard disability claim.
- Is one design easier to navigate and understand than the others?
- How well does each design communicate to users that they can create a Supplemental Claim for a condition within the 526 flow?
- How easy is it for users to add a supplemental condition to their claim?
- Are there any usability problems introduced by the new design that might affect Veterans’ ability to file a new or increase claim?
- How do Veterans react to seeing a list of conditions that have been denied?
- Do Veterans experience form fatigue or get overwhelmed by the number of options?
- Does the design create confusion, especially in areas which could negatively impact the outcome of their claim?
- Which design is perceived by Veterans as easier to use or more supportive?
- Does the prototype help Veterans understand the basic evidentiary requirements for Supplemental Claims?
- For “CFI distinction,” do Veterans understand the difference between filing a Claim for Increase versus a Supplemental Claim?

### Goal: Explore some of the recommended changes suggested by Platform in our Design Intent meeting.
- What is the effect of clustering the conditions list with subheads?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of using tiles instead of radio buttons on the “Add a condition” screen?

### Goal: Explore differentiating secondary conditions on the main ‘Add a condition’ screen.
- Are Veterans familiar with the concept of a secondary condition?
- Are Veterans familiar with the term “secondary condition”?
- How would a Veteran add a secondary condition to their claim?
