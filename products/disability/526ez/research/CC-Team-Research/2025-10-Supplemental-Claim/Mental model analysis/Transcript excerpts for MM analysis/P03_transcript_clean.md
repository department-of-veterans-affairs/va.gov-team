00:01:11 Moderator: And so... and I've got some questions about your most recent experience when you applied for disability benefits. Do you remember when the last time that was?

P03: Yeah, it was in 2014.

00:01:24 Moderator: Okay, and is there, you know, can you tell me about that experience, what that application process was like?

P03: Yeah, so, I got a military... I'd been given a heads up, by my doctor, my military doctor, that I probably should go get checked out at the VA. Because I was already having medical issues when I was in, They, just decided that instead of medically separating me, I just asked them to let me get out, because I'd have to stay in longer. To get medically separated. And so, I mean, I probably should have done that in the first place, but... yeah, we don't know that now. But yeah, so I went home, and I just went to the VA, and back in... I was in Oregon at the time. And, it actually went pretty smoothly. I had a, like, there was a veteran service... Group... That kind of just ushered me around. Through all the, the different little places I had to go, they helped me get my paperwork, get my records and told me which ones I needed, and they kind of led me around to each office I needed to go to.

P03: And so, I actually had a fairly smooth process for... Comparing it to most other people, I feel like.

00:02:47 Moderator: and so what makes you say that you feel like it was a little bit smoother? Is this, like, just from anecdotal experiences you've heard from others, or...

P03: A lot of people don't get... go to medical and get things documented when they have injuries or anything like that. My camera just cut out, but I was just kind of... because my... I, like, my body... I had such a severe, illness, and I was forced into the hospital, so there was just, like, mountains of paperwork that... I had... there was no option of not going to medical or anything like that.

Moderator: Right, yeah, so the documentation was on your side, it sounds like.

P03: Yeah.

00:03:33 Moderator: Okay, and so when you got ready to actually apply for a disability, what was, what were some of the things that were going through your mind?

P03: I really didn't know anything about disability or what it was. I was just more interested in the healthcare, and... Being able to, like, get my... get... visit a doctor and, like, try to get whatever is going on figured out. So, that was the main thing. I was focused on.

00:04:06 Moderator: Okay. And, how did you find out what the VA ultimately decided after you applied?

P03: I think I got a, like, letter, and then... Or maybe an e... maybe a letter or phone... I can't remember. Letter or email or something. And then, they back-paid me, like, shortly after they had, like, let me know. Well, then I was like, oh, I guess I have disabil- I have disability now.

00:04:35 Moderator: Okay, and do you remember what kinds of things the letter or email said?

P03: Yeah, I remember it said, like. You're... they said my condition, they said you're total and permanent. Gave me my percentage. Those kind of things.

00:04:52 Moderator: Okay. And, what caused your condition?

P03: I don't know. They never figured it out. I blame, being on, Fukushima, and helping clean up with the radiation, but that's not really provable, or... Anything like that, so, who knows?

00:05:15 Moderator: Okay, yeah, my follow-up question was, did the VA agree with that? But you said, it sounds like it was maybe undecided.

P03: Yeah, they didn't... there was no, like... I mean, I got sick while I was deployed, and so I had to be taken to a hospital, so they... I mean, it was kind of documented that it happened while I was employed and in the service, but, like, no... they did a biopsy and stuff like that, but, like, there was no, like... I guess, like, concrete proof that, but I guess that what I was told is the way the VA looks at it is if You were fine when you came in, and you're messed up when you get out, like, it's considered the military's fault, so...

00:05:56 Moderator: And then I'm wondering, has there ever been a time when you disagreed with a decision the VA made about your disability benefits?

P03: Did you say that I disagreed with? No, like... We're... like, I don't know anybody that's ever gotten 100% the first time, so I didn't really have anything to disagree with, like, I was pretty messed up. And so, I feel like, kind of like a little bit of a unicorn. I never had to fight with him.

00:06:30 Moderator: In that scenario, what do you think might be some of the options if you did disagree with a.

P03: I said, well.

00:06:36 Moderator: Maybe they didn't give you 100% the first time, or...

P03: I know there's, like, you can get involved with, like, lawyers and stuff, and... like, they could advocate for you on your behalf. I just, like... I know that's also, like, a minefield. There's a lot of people, like, trying to take advantage of people also. and make you pay for that, and that kind of stuff, but I knew... and then I, luckily, I just got paired up with that veteran service organization. Like, very quickly, so I didn't have... those issues.

00:07:10 Moderator: Okay. And then, I want to ask you about,

00:07:14 Moderator: So let's see, we know that sometimes, or it sounds like, at least in this scenario, most of the disability that you have with VA was caused directly by something that happened while you were in service, but we know that sometimes an injury or illness you got while in service can later cause a whole different health condition. So, for example, maybe you injured your knee while you were in service, and years later, you've been overcompensating for that bad knee.

00:07:37 Moderator: And now you're starting to have back problems. So it's almost like an indirect cause, but it's still because of your military service. And I was wondering if you've ever, heard of a situation like that.

P03: Yeah, I kind of have one. I have, like, kind of severe bone loss in my, Hip from being on steroids. from, the treatments they gave me, but... I mean, I haven't done anything about it, because I'm kind of, like, already at 100%, and I can get seen for anything, so I haven't, like, followed up with, like, trying to document and deal with all that.

00:08:13 Moderator: And do you... well, and I'm first sorry to hear that that's been your experience, do you...

00:08:21 Moderator: know how the VA maybe refers to that kind of situation?

P03: I really don't know, like, I haven't interacted with the, like. The, like, kind of claims, sort of, like, people. a long time, like, I'm just in constant contact with my doctors and, like. They're doing my checkups and things like that.

00:08:43 Moderator: Okay. Well, thank you for sharing the details of those experiences with me.

00:08:49 Moderator: And then I've just got one more question before we get into part two of the session.

00:08:54 Moderator: So this one is, you know, more... I'm gonna ask for your perspective on how you would describe something, so pretend that I'm a young person, I've just gotten out of the military, and I have a few health problems for my service, and I want to know how to get disability benefits, and so how would you explain that to me? Like, I don't know anything about it, and this is the very first time I've... I'm encountering this process.

P03: I would say... Wait, just so I'm... you want me to explain it to you like you don't know what to do when you're trying to get benefits, right? Okay, yeah, I would say... Most importantly, grab all your paperwork, and I'm sure that they have electronic files now. But get copies of everything. go down to the VA, plan on spending a whole day there, don't, like, don't have, like, have to rush out in the middle of it or anything, like, just make that your main focus for the day. Take your time, try not to get frustrated, it's like a slow process, nothing goes quickly, and just because it doesn't happen the first time, you can keep, like. maybe find another angle of, like, ways to go about it, but, yeah, get all your paperwork together, go down to the VA, usually they have, like, some... they have, like, a lot of helpful people there. If there's not, like, a veteran service organization that's at the front, usually, like, there's, Guys that'll, like... you could ask questions in the information desk, they'll ask you where to go, find the claims office, and start... Filling out that paperwork, and all that.

00:10:35 Moderator: I have one more follow-up question. In the same scenario, pretending that I'm someone who's never done this before, how does VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries?

P03: Did you say how much money?

00:10:49 Moderator: Yeah, how much money would... how does VA decide how much they might give me for my...

P03: Oh, I know they have, A list of, like, injuries and, like, things that are, like, a certain... Percentage. And so, And so they'll calculate all those up, depending on what you have documented, and then it gives you... it gives you a certain amount of per... I think it's, like, starting off at E5 pay. And it'll give you a percentage of that.

00:11:30 Moderator: Oh, okay, okay.
