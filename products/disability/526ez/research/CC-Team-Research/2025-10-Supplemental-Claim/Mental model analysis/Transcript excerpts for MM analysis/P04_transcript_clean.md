00:00:40 Moderator: So have you ever filed for disability benefits?

P04: I have.

00:00:43 Moderator: Okay, and about how many times?

P04: I had... okay, so I... when I first filed was when I got... I didn't let... I didn't get medically boarded out of the military, I got out regular, and then filed for disability. twice. I came pretty much out of the military an automatic 40%, because they did a back surgery and screwed it up. at 25. I was 25, yeah.

Moderator: Very sorry to hear that.

P04: And then they had to take it out a year later, and then I had to have a third back surgery.

Moderator: Boy! That's what.

P04: I went... I got 100%, but it... it was... I want to tell you about it, because it was so different for me, because this was 04. This is a long time ago. And I know it's waaaay different now. And I got denied many times.

00:01:33 Moderator: How many times have you actually applied for...

P04: I did. I... I did it and got 40%, I did it and got 60%, so after my third back surgery, I was at 60%.

Moderator: Okay. So, it sounds like you applied twice?

P04: Yes.

00:01:52 Moderator: Okay. And then, how many disabilities has the VA approved for you?

P04: One, because I've... I've tried to do it again recently, but I know I'm probably not doing it right.

Moderator: Okay.

P04: Because I've done it so long ago, so when... what ended up happening was my dad was dying, and I promised him I'd try to get 100%. And I did. But I lived in New Orleans, I worked for a hockey team, and the VA was right there, and I had gone through a lot with the VA system itself, the healthcare, and I was done. So I filed... I went to DAV, is what I did. I went to Disabled American Veterans. And I was like, look, I need your help, because I don't know what I'm doing. They say they won't disable me for my back. It is not a legitimate injury to the, you know, for all this. And the guy was like, just give me some time, and he called me a week later, and he said, sit down. And I was like, what? He's like, you're 100% with back pay. And I was like, what? How'd you do that? I don't understand how I've been fighting, and so what he did was unemployable. Which has kind of screwed me for my 21 years of disability.

00:03:04 Moderator: I'm sorry, I missed what you said.

P04: They kind of screwed me, because I can't work.

Moderator: Oh, because you're on 100%.

P04: penny, because I'm unemployable.

Moderator: Got it. But that's what got you to 100%?

P04: Yes. And I'm still at that, so that's my next journey, is trying to get off that, because I... when I quit work and I was making more money on disability than I do now, right? So now I'm 30 years later. And I'm still just making disability, because I'm unemployable. But there are jobs that I could do from my house, sitting right here. and make money, but they won't let me, because I'll get flagged.

00:03:42 Moderator: Got it. Okay, so just... just to... so I understand the, sort of the landscape, is your back, is that the only disability that you're getting benefits for?

P04: For right now, yes. Because I have never reapplied again.

00:03:59 Moderator: And are there other disabilities you have that you would like to get benefits for?

P04: Absolutely.

Moderator: Okay, all right, that's... that's great background. Thank you for sharing that with me.

P04: It's totally different now. It was so different back then.

00:04:15 Moderator: Yeah, I want you to think back to the last time that you dealt with the VA on your disability benefits. Okay. When was that?

P04: I called the 800 number. Probably... A year ago, and 6 months ago. body about how to get it changed, or if I could work.

Moderator: Okay. So you just... you called somebody at the VA or at the DAV?

P04: At VA, at the VA.

00:04:42 Moderator: Okay, and what did you learn from them?

P04: Nothing. Literally nothing. You can work, you can't work, and you might get flagged, you might not get flagged. Go through this process. And then I had a VA employee, well, no, you need to try malpractice, and I'm like. That surgery is 1997 active duty, like, there's... no. That's... that's out of the question. But should I be updated? Yes. So when I called back the last time, and it was before the shutdown, I was like, I need... I don't know how to do this. Like, what I did 20 years ago is not what you do now. Yeah. The internet, like, we didn't have all the stuff that we have at our fingertips now. So I was like, what do I do? And she's like, you need to fill this form out, you need to do this, you need to do that, and I was just like. oh my god, are you ca- like, I can't even keep up with what you're telling me. I am in my right mind, right?

00:05:41 Moderator: When was the last time that you actually got, like, a formal decision from the VA on disability?

P04: That was 04.

00:05:50 Moderator: That was back in 04, okay. I know that was a long time ago, but can you think back... do you remember how the VA notified you, what their decision was?

P04: DAV did. AB told me, and then I caught a packet in the mail, probably. I would say, like, a month, a month and a half later.

00:06:09 Moderator: Okay, and was that when you got the 100% in unemployability?

P04: Yeah.

00:06:16 Moderator: Did... so, and what... what caused your back condition?

P04: The first surgery? Is that what you're asking?

00:06:23 Moderator: Why did... why did you have surgery in the first place?

P04: They never got, and I never got a real answer. I grew up playing, like, soccer, and I grew up on a lake in Louisiana, fishing shrimp and crab, and, you know, like the tomboy for my dad. played soccer and active duty, I started having bad back pain, and they ignored me for a year. No MRI, no MRI, and I finally got the doctor to do the MRI, and my disc was gone. I had a discogram, and I had no discs. The dye just went... It was already gone. So, you know, once you start that process, it kind of just...

Moderator: So did the... it sounds like the VA... so you and the DAV said, this back problem and the surgery was caused by my service?

P04: Yes.

00:07:08 Moderator: And did the VA agree with that?

P04: Not at first, that's why I had to get DAV involved, because they were like, we don't, we don't... we basically were not going to disable you 100% for having back pain. And I'm like, I'm not having back pain. I've had 3 back surgeries, because y'all screwed the first one up, read the records. He had to back the screws back out. I still have a metal fleck of the bone... the... the thing that they do to hollow out to put the screws in, I still have a piece of that floating in my bag. Yeah. That was the first active duty surgery, by the way.

Moderator: Unbelievable.

P04: Yeah.

00:07:43 Moderator: So when you first applied for this, you applied for it by yourself without the DAV?

P04: Yes.

00:07:49 Moderator: Okay. And then, what did the VA decide on that first one?

P04: It was 40... it was just gonna be 40%, and it was basically for... I'm trying to think of what the word was. it's almost like spondylosis or something like that, you know? It wasn't... it was, oh, you have this back thing, and we operated on you. You know, like, they're trying to tell me it was something genetic or whatever, and it wasn't. It was because y'all ignored me for a year when I hurt myself.

00:08:22 Moderator: So you got this decision that gave you 40%, you disagreed with it. What was going through your head when you got that decision?

P04: That's interesting, because I'm so young. That's the thing, too, I was... you know what I mean? I don't have P04: knowledge I have now, back then, I was like, oh, it's 40%, I'll be fine. And then I got out of the military because I was married and he was getting out. That's why I didn't let him medically board me. I was like, oh, I'll trust the VA to do what's right.

00:08:51 Moderator: Who's medically, medically bored you, what does that mean?

P04: When you're in the military and you have a medical condition that would actually require you to get out.

Moderator: Okay, like a medical discharge?

P04: Yes, exactly, and you have to go through a board and get approved, and I'll say, I ain't doing it. I'm not doing it. I'll let the VA do it. And that's... That's what happened. So, I had the 40%, and I was working at a hospital in Seattle. So, while I had that disability, I was still working. And that's when it started hurting worse. Okay. And I had the second surgery, and they had to take the screws and rods out. So I went a year and a half. So if you... imagine this, if you take bone graft off your hip. And stick it in your spine. And you put the screws and rods in there, and then you pull them out a year later. And that bone has not grafted yet.

00:09:45 Moderator: So, so after that happened, was that... how did you decide to go and try to pursue a bigger, higher rating?

P04: So after that surgery, I filed again. when they pulled the metal out, and I was like, see? Something's wrong, when they were like, oh, well, we'll... we'll... you're fine. we're not gonna give you any rate increase, we're not gonna do any of that. And I was like, you know what? Screw it, I'm moving home. So I moved back home to New Orleans, and I had a couple of job offers, and one was the hockey team, and I took it. And I was working on concrete, you know, I was working... that's a hard... Yeah. I'm working in an arena. That is hard on your back. It's very hard on it, and I was doing everything. You know, as a little minor league hockey team. I worked for my GM, I did everything. Accounting, website, I was that person. So, when it started hurting again, and I went to the VA, That's when I got told to live with the pain. And flipped them off and walked out, and went back to work, and my GM got me with our orthopedic surgeon for the team. And I went to the head orthopedic surgeon at Tulane, and he was like, here's the surgery schedule, don't know how you're walking. And I was like, oh, thanks, okay. So, I had that surgery, and I got better, obviously. And then my dad was dying. And I decided to go for 100%. Because my job was also trying to get me medically boarded to leave.

00:11:12 Moderator: Okay. Just thinking about, like, the actual, like, the claim process during this time, that was... was that when you went to the VA?

P04: Yes.

Moderator: I'm sorry, the DAV?

P04: AV after that last surgery. They were gonna put me at 60%, and I was like, I can't work, y'all don't understand. So it sounds like...

00:11:34 Moderator: When you, so the first time you applied, they gave you 40%.

P04: Yes.

00:11:40 Moderator: And then it sounds like you went back and applied again by yourself?

P04: Yep.

00:11:45 Moderator: Okay, and do you know, was that... do you remember what kind of claim that was? Were you just asking them for an increase?

P04: Yes. Pealing it... It was an increase. I was just asking for an increase. Never had to do an appeal. Because I was just like, oh well, I'll take it. Oh well, I'll take it. I never actually fought it, I didn't know I could.

00:12:06 Moderator: EAV do? Did they just ask for another increase, or how did... how did that work?

P04: Yeah, he... yes. He... what he did was, he was like, I can't believe they're doing this to you. Like, here's all your cert... you know what I mean? Like, I had a file like this. I've worked in healthcare, I have a copy of every... like, I am that person. And I just went, and he... I went and sat with him, and I was like, here. here. And he was like, oh... Okay, so because that office is right by the VA. He hand-walked my file to the VA. And sat with somebody, and said, nuh- you're disabling this girl. That's how I got it. He happened. It was the perfect storm.

00:12:49 Moderator: So, it sounds like they didn't take you through any kind of formal appeal process, or...

Moderator: Nope. I just...

P04: No, I just went, okay, if that's what you say, that's what you say.

Moderator: sharing all of that for background.

00:13:07 Moderator: So, I'm gonna ask you a funny hypothetical. So, pretend that I'm a young person, I've just gotten out of the military, and I have a few health problems for my service, and I want to know how disability benefits works, what I'm supposed to do.

00:13:24 Moderator: Can you explain it to me? Like, I don't know anything about it.

P04: Yeah. So you get, basically, like, a physical when you get out? And that's what you leave with. That's like the documentation of, hey, you left with these issues. So, to me, if they get worse, then you're supposed to... listen to me and be like, hey, I got out with it at this level, but here's what it is. So for every... I tell every young person, because I live in an area with an Air Force base and a Navy base. all, you know, right here, I tell people that when you get out, go straight to, like, DAV. or a veteran's organization like that, and go sit down with somebody and have them explain the whole process. Because it changes... it does. To me, it changes with every political cycle, too. So I never know from one second to the next what we're gonna get. So, to me, the best thing to do is go sit down with a representative that's been trained. So you can get the knowledge you need.

00:14:25 Moderator: And again, I'm this person that doesn't know anything. How does the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries?

P04: percentages. percentages. Yeah, so it's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. It goes by percentage based on You know, how disabling it is, and how many different disabilities you have when you get out.

00:14:48 Moderator: Thank you, and one... out of that scenario, one last question. Have you, are you at all familiar with the different ways that you can, like, actually appeal a VA decision?

P04: Have you heard of... No clue.
