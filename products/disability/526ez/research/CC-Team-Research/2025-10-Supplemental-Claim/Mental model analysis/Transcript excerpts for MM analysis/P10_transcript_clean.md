00:00:41 Moderator: And we might touch on some parts of your health situation, so please know that, you know, you don't need to talk about any topics that you don't want to, and what we're most interested in hearing is about your experience with that application process itself for applying for VA disability benefits. So, have you ever filed for disability benefits?

P10: Yes.

00:01:02 Moderator: And about how many times?

P10: Maybe 4.

00:01:10 Moderator: And, about how many disabilities has the VA approved?

P10: I think 4? Because they, like, you know, combined, combined some.

00:01:25 Moderator: and what do you mean combined, like, for your overall percentage rating?

P10: Yes.

00:01:32 Moderator: Okay, and, can you tell me what your overall disability percent is?

P10: 80.

00:01:38 Moderator: 80. And, so you've applied for benefits for individual times. Do you mind telling me what some of those, conditions or health issues that you claimed when you applied?

P10: Eczema... I applied for tinnitus. Polyuria... Now, you want the ones that are approved, or does it matter?

00:02:09 Moderator: Either, either, any that you can remember.

P10: For low... low back pain, mechanical strain, Patello... knee patella... knee patello Syndrome? Something like that.

00:02:27 Moderator: And now I'm going to ask you a few questions about your most recent experience of these four times when you applied for benefits. When was the last time that you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits?

P10: Actually, I've applied for an increase within the last, 2 months.

00:02:48 Moderator: Can you tell me what that, process was like?

P10: It was... it was okay, just... I went online and did the increase. I don't... I guess I don't like that it's not as detailed, so it's kind of... you just put, like, a sentence in, I think it's, like, 140 characters, something like that, and so it's very brief, but, you... I guess you get to file, upload a statement, a personal statement or something. So, I don't know, I... the... It wasn't the best, but I guess it did what it was supposed to do.

00:03:30 Moderator: Have you already heard back about,

P10: No, not yet, because they needed to schedule a CMP, but I'm out of the country, so I couldn't do an in-person, so I'm waiting to hear back if they're able to do a, a virtual.

00:03:47 Moderator: Okay, okay. And so, and you said, you know, there's something about applying for the increase that you didn't really like, like, was there anything specific, or, you know, was it confusing, or was there information that you thought, you know, maybe...

P10: Is it worth? maybe it wasn't as straightforward. I guess I wanted to give a little bit of an explanation, and didn't realize, like, I needed to add, I guess, an additional document or something. So, I applied for increase for two conditions, but for one of them, I... didn't get to, do the personal statement, and now I don't know how to add it, so it's kind of... Bill.

00:04:32 Moderator: And did you apply for the increase for both of these at the same time?

P10: Yes. Yes.

00:04:39 Moderator: And so when you were doing this, what was kind of... what was going through your mind?

P10: I don't know, I think I was just kind of, okay, let me... let me finish and do this, because I was, you know, getting ready... it was a lot going on. In the process of selling our home, we were having showings, I was trying to get it done before I left the country, so it was just, like, a lot of other things going through my mind, and so just making sure I had the right documentation, having to go to storage, and go back through my files. So it was, you know, it was a little... a little tedious, so I had a lot going through my mind.

00:05:17 Moderator: Yeah, wanted to make sure all your T's are crossed, and that, you know, the VA wasn't gonna hit you with one of the, oh, we haven't received everything yet, and you need to redo it, and da-da-da-da-da.

P10: Exactly.

00:05:32 Moderator: So, thinking about the... maybe a time before the increase application, like, when you got a decision letter,

00:05:42 Moderator: How... do you remember the kinds of things the letter told you?

P10: It would just state, I guess the condition I applied for, and then it would just say, oh, there were favor... it was denied, but it was favorable... favorable findings, and then would just kind of list the steps that you needed to do if you wanted to file for a, I guess a supplemental or something like that, so it just gave... gave the steps and contact information.

00:06:20 Moderator: And did you receive this information in any other way besides the letter?

P10: No, it was only in letter form.

00:06:28 Moderator: Okay. And,

00:06:31 Moderator: So, yeah, you shared some of the things that the letter told you. For the particular condition associated with that, disability benefits application, did you have to provide what caused your condition?

P10: I don't remember if I had to, say what caused it, or when... when the onset was, so I just had to provide that information, so I would just, you know, go through my military records, and then just highlight the parts where, you know, I first went to get seen for it.

00:07:11 Moderator: Okay, okay. And so did the VA ultimately agree with that application claim?

P10: Some... some of them they did, and then after going and getting a C&P exam, they did, and then there were others, even though there was documentation of it, It was denied. Even though, you know, I had documentation, went to physical therapy, and all, you know, and then they requested some Some other information, some other files, and I submitted all that, and then they still turned around and said no. So, yeah.

00:07:50 Moderator: Yeah, man, I'm sorry that that was your experience.

00:07:55 Moderator: I... it does lend itself well to, like, some of the other questions I have are, you know, I'm interested about times that you may have disagreed with the VA decision, and...

00:08:04 Moderator: you know, so maybe... was this an instance where, you know, you're like, okay, I've provided all of my information, but...

00:08:12 Moderator: You know, where's this decision coming from?

P10: Yeah, yeah, for two, for two in particular, because for one, for my knees, I... I got in trouble, I guess, in basic training, and so I had to scrub the... basically the squadron on my hands and knees, and so on being on concrete just kind of affected my knees, but I was... because of... because of my knee condition, they reclassified me into another, job. And so, like, all that documentation, the physical therapy and stuff, but because I didn't have any more records from, you know, from the military to now, they denied it, because I didn't have any other records of going to seek care. But I had outside... outside providers, so, you know, it's been over 20 years, and those providers are... have moved on, or they... They've already gotten rid of their records, so there was no... No way for me to get any, Any other documentation for those conditions? So that was... One, one I disagreed with, and the other I disagreed with as well, was for my back.

00:09:33 Moderator: Okay, and what was that experience like? Like, how did.

00:09:36 Moderator: out, and...

P10: Yeah, pretty much the same. They, because when I... when I first filed, which was back in 2000, apparently they didn't have access to my military records, so they just flat out denied everything, and they... I guess there was a letter saying that they would, once... they found my records, they would re-evaluate, but they never did. So... Never 20...

00:10:03 Moderator: Sorry, I want to clarify, they never found them, or they never re-evaluated?

P10: They never re-evaluated.

P10: Yeah, so then in 2022, you know, 22 years later, I'm, you know, I've... gotten approved for, for VA benefits, and then, I went to one of the people at the VA clinic, and they told me everything that, you know, the ball was dropped, and, you know, so then we resubmitted all of that stuff. So, when I got the decision, it was for all of those things, at once, so it was a decision giving me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, again, for the initial claim.

00:10:46 Moderator: Okay, so what did you do when you got that, that kind of... the result from that secondary claim?

P10: I... what did I do? I think I ended up... well, they did a C&P exam, and the doctor for that did agree with, you know, with the knee condition, agreed with the back condition, agreed with, you know, the eczema, but then they just... they came back and said, no for the back, no for the knees, yes for eczema, but no, you know, it was 0%. And so... I filed something... I don't remember what the... what the difference, the different filings are called, but I... I don't know if it was an appeal or a supplemental, but I filed that for my back, and, because I eventually ended up having, on-the-job work injury to my lower back. They wanted all the Department of Labor records and, all of that. So, yeah, so it was... it was frustrating. They still said, you know, favorable... favorable findings, but, you know, they didn't want to, Accept that. So, I could've... pursued it more, but I just... I was frustrated with the process, because I was in a car accident when I was in the military, so, you know, and my lower back was affected, so... I had records of being seen, but, I was told I should just do a nexus. you know, go to another doctor, so I would have been having to come out of pocket for stuff that I've already come out of pocket for, so I just kind of left... left it alone.

00:12:44 Moderator: And was there any other additional, like, backup documentation you were asked to provide outside of the Department of Labor records?

P10: The... just any, I guess, any records that I had on my own from... from doctor visits, but because the Department of Labor, it was such a thick file, like, I was keeping documentation of everything. So I had all the documentation over the years, for that one.

00:13:10 Moderator: Okay. And so, I know you said you were like, well, and then, by that point.

00:13:15 Moderator: you know, you kind of felt like you'd come out of pocket several times already. Have you pursued anything else, or, in regards to maybe getting an... I know you said you filed a kind of an appeal.

00:13:30 Moderator: Yeah, what happened then?

P10: No, I haven't done anything else for my back. And, you know, that one's probably the most... the most frustrating one, because I had been dealing with it for so many years, but that's the... that's the only one I just didn't do anything else with. I just kind of... Chucked it aside and said, you know... It is what it is.

00:13:52 Moderator: And so, is the back... do you know the rating for your back, or is that one that was just flat-out denied?

P10: It was just denied.

00:13:59 Moderator: Okay, so that's not contributing to your overall 80% rating.

P10: So...

00:14:04 Moderator: Okay. And then one more question about your appeal process. Were there any particular parts of that process that were confusing or unclear?

P10: I don't know, I think I just... I guess because they wanted all this documentation, and I... I submitted everything, I guess it was just kind of one of those things that was left in limbo that I provided everything, but I... I don't know if I needed to file a personal statement with it, which I didn't even know about the personal statements, or even, you know, the buddy letters, because my parents experienced... my experiences with this back stuff. So I didn't know about any of that, so... Yeah, I wish I would have known, but... Yeah.

00:14:56 Moderator: So, I'm wondering if, you know, if you could imagine that you were talking to somebody who found out that the VA denied their claim, and they were thinking of appealing it, how would you explain that appeal process to them from your perspective, and what kind of advice would you give them?

P10: Hmm... And to make sure that they have The proper documentation as far as being, just... anything that can state or back up their claim. So, you know, letters from friends, letters from doctors, family members, anyone who can, say that they've witnessed this pain, you know, doctor statements, any x-ray, what's the thing where... not the x-ray itself, but the... the letter that comes with it. I can't... the word is slipping.

00:15:51 Moderator: Yeah, I know what you mean, like, the readout, or...

P10: Yeah, yeah. You know, if they have copies of that, but just to, just have everything that they need, and. You know... Yeah, have everything you need, and if you're just... I would say, you know, don't give up. You know. if it's something you really want to fight for, but because from my personal experience, I was fighting the Department of Labor. this work. workman's comp, so I... I was tired of fighting. So for me, I just said, my sanity, you know, my peace of mind. far outweighed whatever I could, I guess, receive from this, so for me, I was okay to just back away, but for someone who just feels that, you know, they really... it's... it's something they really want to go for, then I would just say, don't give up, you know? No. Do what you have to do to... to get the result you're looking for.

00:16:54 Moderator: Yeah, yeah. No, that's... that's great feedback. And I'm wondering, do you have any conditions that are rated at 0%?

P10: Yes, one of the ones that I filed for an increase for, which is, eczema.

00:17:09 Moderator: Okay, and do you, like, how would you explain that that happened, that you got the 0% rating?

P10: I don't know, I guess there was... there was evidence in my military records, of... of having a flare, and then when I had the C&P exam, she could see the... the markings, from a recent flare. And they just... noted it as zero, I guess, because, again, there was no other documentation showing over the years that I've been treated for the eczema, but... I moved around a lot, had different doctors, so I wasn't, you know, I didn't have my records and stuff. So I guess that was why they gave the zero, but I've... I've... File for an increase on that one.

00:18:05 Moderator: Covered everything with the first bit, but...

P10: I think we're gonna go ahead and get into the prototypes here.

00:18:13 Moderator: So, before we get into testing that, before we get into Phase 2, would you like to take a brief break here?

P10: Oh, okay.
