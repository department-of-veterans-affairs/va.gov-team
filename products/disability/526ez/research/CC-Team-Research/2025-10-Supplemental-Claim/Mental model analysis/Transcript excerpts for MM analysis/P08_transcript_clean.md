00:00:49 Moderator: Okay, and with that, have you ever filed for disability benefits?

P08: Well, yes I did, but it was way back in 1995.

00:01:01 Moderator: And about how many times have you... was that the only time that you've done it, or have you done it another time since?

P08: No, that was the only time.

00:01:09 Moderator: Okay, and how many, disabilities has the VA approved for you?

P08: Well... oh my goodness. I would actually have to look at the letter. I'm rated at 80%. And I know it's for at least 3 separate, conditions.

00:01:29 Moderator: Okay, can you, tell me what some of those conditions are?

P08: Well, one of them is related to, my left shoulder. One of them was related to, some severe muscle damage that I had done in my back. And then, also part of it is related to a total hysterectomy that I had.

00:01:54 Moderator: Hmm, okay. And all... that's the combined, is the 80% of these conditions?

P08: Correct.

00:02:04 Moderator: So, and was that 1995 experience, like, was that the last time that you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits?

P08: Well, basically, yes, and to be perfectly frank. I do not recall Personally, Requesting disability benefits. they asked me to go to the VA hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. For my, physical. after I re... I retired from the Army. After 21 years in service. And so, they... sent me this letter, and I had to report at a particular date and time, and I had to undergo a complete physical. And then that physician is the one who Reviewed my medical records, gave me my exam, and sent all of the paperwork wherever it needed to go, and I think it was, like, 3 months later? I received a letter saying, this is your disability rating.

P08: And then... I don't know how it is in other states, but in the state of Wisconsin. Every single county has a veteran service officer. And so, you're supposed to record your DD214, that veteran service officer. And so. whenever I went in to do anything with the VSO, He was always on me. They wanted me to try to get 100% disability. And so the VSO would... do... would assist you if you needed assistance. But, I never went for 100% disability because I never wanted to stop working. And I didn't stop working until I turned 70.

00:04:18 Moderator: And so,

00:04:20 Moderator: That 1995 was... that was that when you had the exam, and kind of this ball started rolling, where you got the letter eventually that said you got the 80%.

P08: Correct.

00:04:34 Moderator: And, so you said you got the letter, and that was how you found out what the VA decided in terms of what your disability percentage is. Do you remember anything else that the letter might have said?

P08: Hmm. No.

00:04:50 Moderator: Okay, yeah, just wondering if there's any general...

00:04:52 Moderator: information in there. And what caused your condition, or any of these conditions?

P08: 21 years of service in the Army. I mean... Yeah. So... Well, my 21 years... was pure hell. So, and, you know, every unit the vast majority of the time, I was the only woman in any... I tr... I chose non-traditional, career fields. So I was usually the only woman. And, I was not appreciated. And my co... in fact, I have to laugh, because when people say they go to war, I was literally going to war every day, because I had some colleagues who literally went out of their way to try to kill me. I mean... My colleagues were my worst enemies, actually.

00:05:50 Moderator: Hmm... Yeah, wow, I'm sorry to hear that that was your experience. So...

00:05:59 Moderator: I'm wondering when you, you know, you said

00:06:02 Moderator: you spent 21 years in the Army, and you got this disability rating, that kind of almost seems like it fell into your lap a little bit after you had the physical and everything. Was there...

00:06:17 Moderator: any part of the, like, rating that you didn't agree with, or did you feel the 80% was appropriate? I know you said you weren't interested in seeking out 100%.

P08: Well... I guess I did think that the 80% was appropriate. I mean, I incurred... So many injuries. During my career. Because, well, back in the day, You didn't have the equipment that you have today. So, like, when we were, doing physical fitness training, we didn't have athletic shoes. And we were running, in formation. 4 miles, 3 or 4 miles, in formation, wearing combat boots. So, you were running in combat boots, and it's a contrib... I have severe arthritis as a result of I mean, my... I joke the only... I only have one joint in my body that doesn't have arthritis. Because that's because while I was on active duty, an orthopedic surgeon reconstructed one of my shoulders. So, and in fact, when I was... toward the end of my military career, I could no longer run, and so I was given a physical profile. And when I did my physical fitness test, instead of having to run, 2 miles. I had to bike 10 miles. Because bicycling was... You know. Not as hard on the joints as running was.

00:08:17 Moderator: Okay. And so, let's see... was there any part of the...

00:08:25 Moderator: I guess this disability notification that you got that,

00:08:31 Moderator: I know you said it felt appropriate. Is there any part of it that you maybe disagreed with in the decision?

P08: Gee whiz. I guess... I guess I was kind of surprised, because I think they gave me a very large percentage of disability. For my hysterectomy. Which, at the time, I didn't understand. However, You know, 31 years later. I understand it completely, because it has affected You know, as a result of getting a hysterectomy so early in my life. I'm... I'm currently osteopenic. So, you know, it's affected my bone density. So I guess I thought that was a little bit disproportionate at the time, but today I understand it. Whereas my physical injuries... Were very small. And I thought that The physical injuries. Should... probably should have been higher. Because they, they, they cause me pain. And, you know, when you have to live with pain. 24-7, 365, you know, that's kind of hard to deal with.

00:10:08 Moderator: I'm curious if you, you know, thinking about... we know that the overall rating, percentage is like a...

00:10:17 Moderator: you know, I know people call it, like, VA math, that each of the conditions will have maybe a different percentage associated with them, and they add up in a way to, equal the overall rating percentage. And, you know, thinking about, you know, some of these, you know, you said your physical injuries, you almost thought that those would be higher,

00:10:35 Moderator: And I know you're not interested in seeking 100%, but I'm curious, what do you think some of the options might be available to you if you, you know, were to disagree with one of these ratings and...

00:10:47 Moderator: Yeah, with any of the ratings that the VA gave you.

P08: Well, at this point in time, if I disagreed with one of the ratings, I don't see how I would attain any other benefits, because... so, the Madison, Wisconsin VA Hospital is classified as a VA hospital of excellence. Supposedly, it's the best in the country. And so... my disability rating may be 80%. However, I get 100% of my medical care through the VA. I don't have any co-pays. And there isn't anything that they don't pay for. And, the only thing I'm not entitled to, if I remember correctly, is dental care through the VA. But that I can understand, because... Fortunately, I never had a dental injury while I was on active duty. So, anything to do with my dental issues are either genetic or... Myself, you know, not... taking proper care of my teeth or something like that. Right. But I'm even entitled to, nursing home care, should I need it.

00:12:16 Moderator: So I know you said that they, yeah, they take care of a lot of your health needs, I just want to, like, probe a little bit more, and I think you mentioned in the beginning that you've worked with a, DSO individual or office, and...

00:12:34 Moderator: you know, that you go in, they push you to, you know, work for 100%. Have they mentioned anything in regards of what that process might look like, maybe?

P08: No, they never did. I mean, they just more or less said that if this is something that you ever want to pursue, come back. And we will walk you through it. Okay. Okay. because, I'm in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and so, since I've been here, we've only had 2 VSOs. They go in that job and they stay there for a very long period of time. And, both of them have been very hands-on. Okay. And very personable, and they want to help you in any way that they can.

00:13:28 Moderator: And then, let's see, I've got a few more, kind of, maybe seemingly oddball questions. I'm wondering if you know if any of your conditions are rated at, 0%.

P08: No. Okay. But, but, but, you know. If you would... wanted to, I could probably go dig up that letter within 2 minutes.

00:13:51 Moderator: You know what, let's, because I know we've got a long session, but depending on our time at the end, we may take you up on that.

P08: Okay.

00:13:59 Moderator: Yeah, that would be great. And then, let's see...

00:14:03 Moderator: Another one I'm interested in... so, it does sound like most of these, you know, health issues you've had, or that VA recognizes were caused, as you said, directly by something that happened to you while you were in service.

P08: Mmm.

00:14:16 Moderator: But sometimes we know an injury or illness you got while in service can then later cause a whole different health issue.

00:14:23 Moderator: You know, for example, you injured your knee while you're in service, and now that it's been several years, you've been overcompensating for that bad knee, and now you're starting to have back problems. So it's almost like an indirect cause, but it's still because of your military service.

00:14:37 Moderator: And I was wondering if you've ever had a situation like that, or have you ever heard of it?

P08: Oh, yes, I have heard of it, and I'm sure that I'm experiencing it, because, I have, In the lumbar spine. L4 and L5. are... are really bad. And I also have cervical spine issues, which, there's no doubt in my mind, are attributed to, my military service. And then, I'm also, I volunteered for the Million Veteran Program. So, they have my DNA and everything, and they just recently sent me the survey for the toxic substances. And, of course, one of the questions was, have you ever been stationed at, Fort McClone, Alabama? Which apparently has toxic water. And, I was stationed at Fort McClellan, Alabama twice. So I don't know if it... if that has contributed, but... so now I have... lupus. And I also have MDS, which is a form of blood cancer. And, I also have skin cancer. And, of course, I was stationed in the South, and spent a lot of time in the South. Yeah, and I was stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona 3 times, and spent a lot of time in the sun. And then, of course, they don't give you any you don't get any sun protection from the... when I was in, you didn't get any sun protection from the military. In fact, I had a heat injury, and was hospitalized, so...

00:16:39 Moderator: You know, it's funny, you've had time in these hot areas, and you, you know, as you said, you were playing in the snow with your dog this morning. Hopefully that, you know, gives you some kind of reprieve. And let's see, I'm wondering, too, you know, so you said, yes, this kind of situation seemed

00:16:59 Moderator: sounds familiar, and maybe you've even, as you said, mentioned, have experienced similar situations yourself, where you've had something happen in service, and maybe now it's triggered something else that you're experiencing. Do you happen to know how the VA refers to this kind of situation?

P08: Oh, no, I don't.

00:17:22 Moderator: Let's see, and I've just got one more question. So, if you could pretend that I'm a young person, and I've just gone out of the military, and I've got a few health problems for my service, and I want to know how to get disability benefits, can you explain that to me like I don't know anything about it?

P08: Well, if you live where I live, I would tell you one of two things. You could either go to the VSO. in Iowa County, and they would definitely walk you through everything that you needed to know about it. Or, you could go to the VA hospital in Madison, and they have a patient advocate there. Okay. And the patient advocate would refer you to the appropriate person who would sit down with you and walk you through the entire process. And then, we're also very fortunate in that we have some very hands-on organizations here, you know, like, if people don't want to drive, so... Okay, I live in an extremely rural community. So, like, for me, it's 8 miles to get to the closest highway. And if they didn't want to drive, most of the small communities have, either A VFW? or another military organization. And every single one of these organizations They'll help you. get going. And then, of course, you could go online. And which, you know, young people, they probably all go online. And they would probably... they would probably just Google, how do I get VA benefits? Today, they would probably use AI.

00:19:15 Moderator: Yeah, yeah, I think you're right about that. How do I... how do I get VA benefits? Yeah.

00:19:22 Moderator: And then one more question I have related to that. How, again, pretending I'm this young person, I'm asking you, how does the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries?

P08: Oh... That's a good question. Because it seems very inconsistent. just... From my personal... there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. I know there is a... Table out there somewhere. Because I remember seeing it at one time or another. And then, of course, the thing of it is, so... Like, my 80%? Actually, my individual disabilities added up to more than 80%. Up to more than 100%. But then, you still get 80%. So, I have no clue how... I mean, I don't understand it.
