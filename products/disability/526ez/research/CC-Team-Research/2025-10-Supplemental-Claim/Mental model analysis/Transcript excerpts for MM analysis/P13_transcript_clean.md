00:00:41 Moderator: So, have you ever filed for disability benefits?

P13: Yes, I have.

00:00:45 Moderator: And about how many times?

P13: Once.

00:00:49 Moderator: Okay. Do you know how many individual disabilities you're approved for?

P13: 1.

00:00:55 Moderator: Okay, can you tell me what that is?

P13: Ptsd.

00:01:00 Moderator: Okay, and what's your overall disability rating?

P13: 50%.

00:01:07 Moderator: When was the last time that you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits?

P13: I think it was in... It was last year. I mean, it was this year, because I got my... it was probably in March of this year, of 2025.

00:01:30 Moderator: Okay, can you tell me what was happening then?

P13: That was when they denied my last claim.

00:01:36 Moderator: Okay, and so tell me about the claim that they denied.

P13: Well, what can I... It was, I can't remember if it was my knees, I think it was my knees. That's okay. I don't know if you need to know why they... or anything.

00:02:00 Moderator: Go ahead, tell me what... what had you applied for, and then what happened?

P13: Okay, what happened was that I was a rare I made a claim, I was in the military, I got out, I married, a military officer. And I was treated from the time we married until 2005 at military installations, I was, because I was a dependent spouse. And then, but during this whole process of my claims. They were... they never were able to get hold of my medical records from 1978 to 2005. So the only records they had are the records from 2005 to present. Got it. And it didn't show all the times I was, I... I had, like, bronchitis so many. Another one was the fact that I had, bronchitis all the time. And, once again, They could only go back to 2005, and it didn't show all my hospital visits, it didn't show anything. So that one was denied, my knees was denied, my hearing was denied, because they could never go back.

00:03:35 Moderator: Wow, that sounds extremely frustrating.

P13: Yes, it was, but... You know. I got at least the 50%. The... when I was interviewed by the psychiatrist, she wanted me to go and get 100%, but I got 50.

00:03:52 Moderator: Okay, so it sounds like you, applied for PTSD, and you also applied for, bronchitis and your knee condition.

P13: In a hearing.

00:04:05 Moderator: adhering. So, did you apply for all of those at the same time, or did you do it at different times?

P13: At the same time.

00:04:15 Moderator: Okay. And when was the original, application that you did?

P13: I had to submit it by August the 9th, and I submitted it, like, August the 8th. My brother died. That week, and so it. For me to get it, but that's another story, but I'm okay.

00:04:35 Moderator: Yeah, that sounds really difficult. So, August the 8th of 2020...

P13: 4.

00:04:47 Moderator: So, you applied for 4 things.

00:04:50 Moderator: And then, when did you... oh, did you... how did you do the application?

P13: I did it online, and that was another problem, because, most places, they did not have... I went... I tried doing it online, and I had some problems, and so I didn't know what to do, so I went to the, DAV. To see if they would help me. Well, come to find out, the office here, no one knew that you could even apply online. So they did find somebody that, told me, you know, he had filed a couple online, because he was just starting, he had gotten training, and he had just started to learn how to file online, and so he did help me through some of the... answers that I needed.

00:05:45 Moderator: Okay. What were some of the problems you ran into when you were filing online?

P13: My problem was with the, PTSD, the sexual assault.

00:05:55 Moderator: And was that... you were having trouble filling that out and getting... and putting in details about that?

P13: Yes, because one time I filled it out, and supposedly it got caught off halfway through my story.

00:06:13 Moderator: So it sounds like that you were eventually able to get help from the DAV to get the application filed?

P13: Yes, I ended up getting it filed, correct.

00:06:25 Moderator: Okay. And then, what happened after that?

P13: I just waited, and then, I got... I then was called in to, like, one doctor checked... well, I had an audio test to see how Because I wear hearing aids now. And then, I was called in to a lung special... a PA, a lung specialist, and she listened to my lungs, and then my knees was never addressed, because they said there's no evidence of me ever having knee problems. Then, Also, my high blood pressure, because I'm on blood pressure medication, and it went down after I dealt with my PTSD. And I showed that, but they said that there's really no connection. So that's why I only got 50%.

00:07:22 Moderator: So, yeah, so I'm curious, how did you find out what the VA decided?

P13: I got a letter. As a matter of fact, it was really weird, because I didn't get a letter. I got a huge deposit, because if you filed before August the 9th, you got the year before. So I got a big check in my checking account, and I'm like, this is so weird. You know, so I called my son up, because he... He's the one that pushed me to file originally, because he is disabled that. And so I, I looked, and he goes, look and see if it says, you know, VA on it, and I go, yeah, it did, and it's this much. He goes, well, you must have gotten about 50%. And so, about... I mean, it took, like, 2 weeks later, I got a letter stating, no, he told me to go on the website, and there's a website you can go to, and it tells you what disability you have. how much of a disability you have. So I then went to that site, and I... and I found that I had 50%. And that was from my PTSD.

00:08:31 Moderator: Okay. And then after that, you got the letter?

P13: Yeah, it was, like, 2 weeks later.

00:08:36 Moderator: That's funny. And do you remember what kinds of things the letter told you?

P13: For my PTSD? No, I don't, but I've got it someplace. They only addressed it... they... at that... that letter was only... addressed the PTSD.

00:08:53 Moderator: Okay. How did you find out what they decided about the other things, the, hearing and bronchitis and knees?

P13: They sent me a thing saying that there was not enough evidence.

00:09:06 Moderator: Okay. And, can you tell me a little bit more about that? Like, what kind of evidence? I know you were missing your medical records. Did they, did they decide that

00:09:17 Moderator: it just wasn't, like, enough of a problem, or that they didn't think it was from your military service? What was their basis for decision?

P13: Because of the fact, like, you have to remember when I was in... I was in the military in the 70s. And, women didn't have a very positive role back then. Trying to be nice, okay? And so, when I got debriefed with the VA when I got out, because they had a VA rep there when you got out. And I told them about my knees and my hearing, and I told them that was it. I didn't tell them about my bronchitis, because my bronchitis was... I was only in for 2 years, so yeah, I had 2 bouts, but it could have been getting it... I was in the medical field, and so I thought just being around patients, you know. And then he... and he just chewed me out. You know, how dare you even think about making a claim? We have all these Vietnam veterans, and he put the guilt trip And he goes, don't you dare, I'm not writing any of this stuff down, who cares? And I go, yeah, but I wore... and I even, in my justification, I wrote the fact that, for my knees, that we wore... I was in a combat unit, we wore combat boots. you know, 18 hours a day, or whatever, we had no arch support, we didn't tee in them, we... on the roads with... and I explained all that, and I still got rejected. And I don't know if they understand back then what the boots were like. They were... stiff. There was... it was just... so, that's... And so, I did not claim it back then because of the fact that... so they said that they went through my medical, and the only thing they found was the fact that I had a panic attack one day. And that was the only thing, and I was in a medical unit, so guess what? You had a cold. What did you do? You just grabbed some medical, you know, you grabbed, you know, cough syrup and stuff. So you looked at my medical records, I had no... you know, nothing. I had... I think they said the only thing in my medical records was I had a panic attack.

00:11:40 Moderator: think of... did you think of trying to pursue any of those other, situations, like, to challenge the VA's decision?

P13: Well, I'm afraid to, because I've been told that If they want to, they can... they have up to 5 years to yank your disability from you. And my fear... you know, I'm happy the fact that, you know, this happened in the 70s, and here it is. You know, I got my first check in December of last year. It's... you know, I'm excited the fact that I got 50%.

00:12:25 Moderator: Did you investigate, or just, or ask around about your options?

P13: No, I didn't.

00:12:32 Moderator: Okay. Because you had just heard that it might be... you could get your rating lowered, it sounds like.

P13: Yes.

00:12:40 Moderator: Okay. Have you... Ever heard of any options if you did want to disagree with your claim?

00:12:50 Moderator: No. With their decision? Okay.

P13: No.

00:13:01 Moderator: let's... I want to do a pretend scenario with you. So, pretend that I am a young person, and I have just gotten out of the military, and I have a few health problems from my service.

00:13:13 Moderator: I want to know how to go about getting disability benefits. Can you explain it to me? Like, I don't know anything about it?

00:13:20 Moderator: In, like, in other words.

P13: I actually, I did this with a 70-year-old friend. He hasn't done it yet, but I've gone through all the steps with him. I told him he needs to go online and to fill it out, and he is very fortunate, because he's had the same doctor for 40 years. So, all of his problems are listed in his medical records. And then, I told him, you know, if you want, I will sit next to you while you fill it out. But I... I told them, I go, you deserve... the... and he really does, because his... he does. He was on a... he was Navy, he was on a ship, the noise, and just... the chemicals and everything, and I'm like, you really need to, you really need to. So, But if it was somebody young getting out, I would definitely tell them to go online, and if they have any problems, I still would go to the DAV if they had problems. But also, last... over a year ago, in... March or... it was either 20... 25, either March or May, I went to a meeting at the, VA Center locally, and they had a female speaker there. Talking about, things that you can do. She is an advocate for... for it. And then I went up to her after the meeting, and, you know. you can't talk to some... you know, should I re... you know, file? And that's all she said was the fact that if the psychiatrist said I needed 100%, I should think about that. And that's so... but I haven't pursued it because, once again. I know this... my son is really upset with me, because he says I deserve the 100% if... And with my knees. I mean, he's been through my life with my knees. And, but, I don't know, I'm afraid to. I'm... I'm intimidated.

00:15:35 Moderator: Yeah, that's... that's understandable. Okay, so you're still in, stay in the mode of explaining to this young person,

00:15:45 Moderator: How does the VA decide Whether to give me money.

P13: I feel that what they have to do is the more evidence... if you have a lot of evidence while you were on active duty, like you reported your knees, you reported... and I know this now because of my son. You report, you know, like, Like, for him, he reported, how his face is always broken out. And so, I would first say to the soldier, even before he got out, make sure everything wrong with you that you're going to claim on the VA, you have some evidence in your medical record. So that way, you've got evidence to back it up. And then I would tell them to do it online, not to do the paper. Because I've... I don't know, I... the online... and I tell them not to get frustrated, because when I was doing the online one, there were times when I needed to go back, and if I went back, it started me right from the beginning and everything. So, you know, and I know that that was a year and a half ago. chances are it's been corrected, so I'm, you know... And so, but, and I would... because I think the online, it's easier, and they don't have to worry about your writing. If you write really horrible, it's... everything, and to tell your story, and to go into... you know, for my PTSD, I went into every detail. Mine was... that's why I ran out of... apparently, I ran out of room on that page, is because of the fact that I went into detail, and that's just to, I'd say, put down every detail you can think of.

00:17:41 Moderator: And then, can you explain to this young person, how does the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries?

P13: I know that, for hearing it's 10%, for knees, it can be up to 30%. I know that they have Sleep apnea, you're supposed to report it, but it's 0%. So they have... different... I think they have different percentages.

00:18:10 Moderator: All right, great. Thank you for sharing all of that and about your experience.
