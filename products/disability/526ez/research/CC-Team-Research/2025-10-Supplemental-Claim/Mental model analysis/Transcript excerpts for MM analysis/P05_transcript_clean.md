00:00:32 Moderator: So have you ever filed for disability benefits?

P05: I did, and I believe it was probably back in 23. It was at a remote site, probably about 7 miles from where I actually live. Down here in South Florida. easy enough to find, just almost like a small strip office complex, probably, maybe around 8 different offices. I really didn't understand it at first, because I, I thought... Who was there was more of staff than... An interviewer, or somebody to take assessments? But as it turned out, the person who was there was the administrator, was the assessor, was the everything. Okay.

00:01:24 Moderator: Okay, great. And what's Only time that you filed?

P05: Yes.

00:01:29 Moderator: Okay, and how many... oh, go ahead.

P05: Go ahead.

00:01:32 Moderator: I was gonna say, how many, disabilities has the VA... did the VA approve during that, instance?

P05: Just one time.

00:01:39 Moderator: Okay, or just one disability as well?

P05: One disability right now.

00:01:42 Moderator: Okay, okay. And can you tell me what that is?

P05: I had... a condition that is, I guess, anxiety-ridden? where I would get almost like a Parkinson's sort of affair, you know, hand twitching and... and tremors, I guess is what they've, classified it as. It gave me a 10% disability. I was really looking for a little bit more than that. They have put me on a medicine that I've been taking, has prescribed for the last couple years, propanolinol. is the name of it. It's a small little blue dot-type pill. And I'm sure it's of a low dosage, I think it's either 5 or... Maybe 15 milligrams. And I take that twice a day as prescribed.

00:02:35 Moderator: Okay, and is that 10% your overall disability percent, do you know?

P05: It is. That's... that's as much as what they... Gave me at that time.

00:02:46 Moderator: And, let's see, you told us some great details about that experience when you most recently dealt with the VA regarding, getting that disability benefit.

00:02:56 Moderator: And I'm interested, too, in knowing, like, when you did that application process, what was going through your mind?

P05: Well, like I said, upon arriving at the address in question, Their office wasn't that easy to find. It wasn't on, like, the front part of... this strip of offices. You had to go around to the back, and then go through an alcove just to get into theirs. That's why I was... kind of surprised. I'm expecting maybe not a full-blown VA facility, sort of a fair big building. But I wasn't expecting something as small as, like a two-room office. the testing really consisted of asking questions where I was stationed. what I might have been subjected to when I was in NAM. Overall time? I don't know, maybe a half hour, 45 minutes? And, you know, she answered all of my questions that I had. Okay. Was it an okay experience? Yeah, it was okay. feeling comfortable, it wasn't what I was expecting. And, you know, it turned out okay. It's... it... it is what it is. maybe I should be thankful that it's only 10%, and I'm not 50% disabled or anything else. play it like that. you know, the medicine keeps working. I have a regular, Geriatric doctor through the VA, her name is, I don't remember her first name, but Allopathy is her last name. woman, I enjoy her a lot, I see her, I try and see her twice a year, I think that's how she has me scheduled. She gets. resume updates, and now in between her, we also have, Somebody that's in the pharmacy. area. what she prescribes, he provides, whether it's through mail order, or if there's a reason why I might be in the VA facility, which is close for me, very convenient, he'll dispense right there on the spot, so... Got it. That seems to be good.

00:05:15 Moderator: That's... yeah, that's great to hear that it's so been, you know, the after bits have been more... very conveniently located for you.

00:05:23 Moderator: I'm wondering, so when you went to this, kind of, as you said, like, office and distort mall kind of situation, was this, like, the exam to assess, you know, your facility? It was, or... It was. Okay, so did... then did you later complete a

00:05:37 Moderator: Disability Benefits Form.

00:05:39 Moderator: You might...

P05: Maybe the.

00:05:40 Moderator: Numbers 526, easy.

P05: I... I think I filled that out. I, I had a meeting with, I think her name was Ray, R-A-E, and I think her last name was Brown. And she was a representative... I don't know if she was really a representative from the VA? Because I met her at, like, a city hall, Type of building. And I think, some way or another, she was affiliated with an American Legion branch. And she was the one that initially helped me out to fill out the forms, and really to apply for the PAC. She, she helped me with, registering for that, and, Since that time, that was the only time that I saw her, but, you know, through the mail, I had seen her name on the disability forms that I took to that office. And that's really about Bennett by her.

00:06:47 Moderator: Okay, and so did you do the form after the exam, or was it vice versa, if you remember?

P05: Vice versa.

00:06:55 Moderator: Okay, okay. So you did the form, and then you went to the... okay, got it. That's great. And so how did you ultimately find out what the VA decided?

P05: Through a mailing. Okay. It would be a... to me. Again, I think, I really don't know the exact date that I went there for that. But it was, like, probably about... 3 months, maybe 4 months later. I received, U.S. mail. Got it. what they thought was, my condition, and I guess according to their guidelines, what I'm... My disability is rated at.

00:07:33 Moderator: And, did the VA, you know, if you detailed what caused your condition, did the VA agree with that?

P05: I guess so. You know, I was... I was thinking at the time that I was... Perhaps more disabled than what they classified me as? And I haven't, appealed or gone for a higher disability rating. but it is what it is. Maybe I'm just too lazy, but I'm not, per se, suffering from Per se, being disabled. I don't feel myself as... disabled other than the essential tremors or whatever. And that's being held in check with the, Pharmacy and the benefits there.

00:08:23 Moderator: Okay, and what did cause your condition?

P05: I think it might have been exposure to where I was in NAM back in, 70? I was in, just north of Saigon. I was at a big military supply base called Longbin. And I don't know if there was really Agent Orange that was stored Within miles of where we're at. facility in all of Vietnam during the war. So, and my particular literal unit was, I was at battalion headquarters, and I was a clerk typist. And it was for, a dust-off medevac, medical evacuation helicopter. that went out to the field and brought in the injured. There was two MASH hospitals, very close, even though I didn't have any Interface with them. That's... that's who my little unit supported.

00:09:27 Moderator: Okay. And I know you said that, you hadn't yet appealed or tried to get a higher increase. Is there... is that something that you've thought about, or looked into, or investigated at all?

P05: I've... I've probably looked into it, but I just haven't followed up.

00:09:43 Moderator: and is it... is it... is there a particular reason why, or just...

P05: Probably just sheer laziness.

00:09:52 Moderator: Okay, that's fine, that's fine. We know these forms can be quite a doozy, to work through.

00:09:59 Moderator: And let's see... so it does sound like that, the disability you have with VA was caused directly by something that happened while you were in service.

00:10:08 Moderator: But we also know that sometimes an injury or an illness that you've got while in service can later cause a whole different health condition. So, for example, you know, maybe you injured your knee while you were in service, and then years later, you've been overcompensating for that bad knee, and now you're starting to have back problems. So, it's like an indirect cause, but it's still because of that military service.

00:10:31 Moderator: And I was wondering if you've ever had a situation like that, or if you've heard of it.

P05: I've heard of that type of scenario. I don't know if it's really applicable to me. You know, like I said, it's outside of the occasional tremors. And that being back in 1970, what is that, 25 years ago? No. Yeah, like, like, 35 years? No. 70? 70... that's 30 years, 55 years. Yeah. So... I really can't say that something that might have happened to me back when I was in Nam, or even in Fort Benning, which is where, My initial induction happened at. And then I got an early out... well, I spent... When it was my time to leave NAM. I had 5 months left. for my, duty obligation. And at that time, President Nixon, said anybody who was getting out of NAMM with 5 months or less Could get an early discharge. So instead of being in there for 24 months, I was in there for 19 months, but... I really can't say that I can attribute Older age syndrome. to, VA-related incident.

00:12:03 Moderator: Thanks for sharing that information. And let's see, I've just got one more question before we ship... sorry, shift into the second part of our, session. I'm wondering that, you know, if you could maybe pretend that I'm a young person who's just gotten out of the military, and I've gotten a few health problems from my service, and I want to know how to get disability benefits. How would you explain it to me? Like, I don't know anything about

00:12:28 Moderator: about it at all.

P05: I would say, I would suggest that you read up on it, read up on the PAC Act. See if it might apply, or... you know, now they've even... made... more than just the pack at there. I mean, burn pits, and there's so many other ways that if you're... Disabled, even mentally disabled from your time in the service. It's something to follow up and become familiar with. as... as good as... Regular doctors are on the outside of the VA. And I have... I have a nurse practitioner, because where I go for my general, GP sort of affair. Because I'm not on a Medicaid or a Medicare Advantage plan. A real doctor won't see me. It's only a nurse practitioner. So that was probably part of the reason why I went to the VA. Let's do that, and to take advantage of something that, you know, is rightfully a benefit. I would suggest to anybody, That if you've spent time in the military, you're deserving of it. And really, to me, the easiest way is to go right into a VA facility, whether it's a clinic, hospital, whatever kind. I have never run into a rude person at my, one in Broward County. It's called the, William B. Kling, K-L-I-N-G. Outpatient clinic, or whatever. Very helpful. full of resources. Great, great facility. I'm very happy that I'm involved with them.

00:14:22 Moderator: That's excellent. That's... yeah, it's great to have a good provider. Yeah. And then, one more question on that, you know, you've told me, my first step, go to a nearby VA facility, and if... what if I had the follow-up question for you? How does, the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries?

P05: That, I don't know. I don't know... What their parameters are. My interviewer who did my assessment. was... I don't know, I wasn't expecting... What she had to ask? Not saying that there's any problem. She was of, Haitian heritage. There was a little bit of a language... and communication, Situation that was going forward. I guess I was a little bit disappointed on that. But, other than that, yeah. That's all.
