00:00:34 Moderator: So have you ever filed for disability benefits with the VA?

P06: Yes.

00:00:40 Moderator: And about how many times have you done that?

P06: One? I'm gonna say one time. Yeah.

00:00:48 Moderator: And how many disabilities has the VA approved for you?

P06: You asked me to count them?

00:00:57 Moderator: How many, like, how many different disabilities do you have that the VA has approved?

P06: I want... I would... I know, I can't say all of them, but the majority, I'm gonna say the majority, yes.

00:01:11 Moderator: Okay. So, and, can you tell me what some of those disabilities are?

P06: That I had... that I... that they approved or disapproved?

00:01:19 Moderator: That they... actually, why don't you tell me both? What are the ones they approved?

P06: They approved of my joint conditions, like my back, my knees, that... My, tinnitus... The PTSD, they approved those. And my hypertension, they approved that. So...

00:01:50 Moderator: Okay, thank you. And what's your... do you know your overall disability rating percent?

P06: I'm a hundred.

00:01:56 Moderator: You're 100%. Okay, great, thank you for sharing that.

00:02:01 Moderator: So, can you think back to the last time you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits?

P06: 2009, when I... I haven't mess with trying to file a VA disability claim for myself since then, because I didn't see any reason to. The one condition that they denied was my trigger finger. Which, had documentation of it, but they denied it, so I was just like, okay, whatever.

00:02:31 Moderator: Wasn't... that was back in 2009?

P06: Yes, because I had had surgery on the finger while I was in the military, right before I got out of the military, matter of fact.

00:02:43 Moderator: And was that the only thing that you applied for in 2009?

P06: Mmm... No, I've got service-connected coming out of the military. Right. And... and I don't know, maybe you... you might have, when I filled out the thing doing this, to do this survey, I also help veterans file claims.

Moderator: Oh, you do?

P06: Yeah, that was what I filled out on the application that I help veterans file claims. I had. No intentions of filing a claim for myself. I wasn't about to die.

00:03:17 Moderator: Okay, okay. That is great to hear, because then you can help us, figure out how we can talk about the things we're gonna look at, in a way that veterans are gonna...

00:03:28 Moderator: understand. So, let's do a pretend scenario. Pretend that I'm a young veteran, I'm just a couple years out of the military, and I have a few health problems for my service. I am totally unfamiliar with VA disability benefits, or how to get them.

00:03:48 Moderator: How would you explain the steps of the process to me?

P06: Well, first thing, I would ask them if it happened in the military, were they treated for the condition while they was in the service? And if they have record that they were treated for it, I would look at that, review that with them, and then ask them, do they currently have a diagnosis of the condition, that the condition is still going on with them. That would be how we would go about the first part, and if they have a current diagnosis, because you have to meet 3 criterias in order to get the service connection. So, they have to meet those, and if they don't have all of them, and if it's only 2 years, I can't see the VA denying them, If they have a medical record showing that the condition still exists. Yeah.

00:04:40 Moderator: Okay. When you talk veterans through...

00:04:46 Moderator: their... the disability process, as they're going through the different steps. Are there terms that are particularly confusing for people?

P06: A lot of them are confused with the computer, to be honest with you, especially the older veterans. They're not as up on the computer. It would be helpful if the VA could provide them some type of classes. Or something to help them be able to understand how they can file their own claims? I think that's the biggest confusion, and then, how to upload the documents to the VA. Well, that's a lot of the problem, and that's why they come and see us, and we help them for free, our organization does, so we don't charge the veterans for any type of service at all.

00:05:37 Moderator: So do you, for your, for your work with DAV, is that, do you work with veterans, like, full-time, or how often do you do that?

P06: I volunteer. I'm a volunteer. I volunteer 4 days a week, 2.30 to... no, 9.30 to 2. Days a week, yeah.

00:05:59 Moderator: That's great that you do that. Okay, so back to me being a young veteran, trying to figure this out.

00:06:07 Moderator: How does the VA decide how much money to give me for my disability?

P06: It goes by the severity of the condition, because they send them out for, what they call CMP exams. And it's based on the severity and the regulation.

00:06:24 Moderator: For you, personally.

00:06:28 Moderator: Have you ever, for, like, your own situation, have you ever, had a time where you disagreed with the decision that the VA made about one of your disabilities?

P06: Yes. But I didn't... I did not pursue it.

00:06:49 Moderator: Yeah, tell me... tell me about that. What was go... what were you... what was going through your head as you were trying to figure out what to do?

P06: I was like, well, I'm at 104, you know, so what even fool with it? Just continue to go to the doctor, do whatever I need to get done, for the condition, versus.

Moderator: Was this the... finger.

P06: No, I never did pursue that one at all, because even after I had the trigger finger done in the military, after I got out, two years after I got out, the opposite finger did the same thing. Exact finger on the opposite hand.

00:07:31 Moderator: So did... were you rated for the trigger finger on the first hand?

P06: No, not at all. It was like they didn't even see the condition.

00:07:46 Moderator: And so you just kind of didn't really consider pursuing it, because you were already at 100%, is that right?

P06: Correct.

00:07:56 Moderator: If you had decided to pursue that, what would your options have been?

P06: I could have either, well, we got new options now. Back then, we didn't have all the options that we have now. Only thing we had back in the... when I got out was, like, doing an appeal, but now they have, where you could go to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, or either you can do a supplemental, or you can do what they call a, Higher level review.

Moderator: As veterans.

00:08:30 Moderator: Sorry, go ahead.

P06: Go ahead. I could have did, an appeal back then, but it... to me, it wouldn't have worked it, so...

00:08:37 Moderator: So, if this had happened, you know, a couple years ago, with the new process, would... and you decided you did want to pursue it, do you know which of those things you would have tried to do first?

P06: I probably would have, I probably could have gotten it if I did a higher level review, because the record was there. And that was why it was denied.

00:09:01 Moderator: So you just needed somebody to look at it again and give it a closer look?

P06: Yeah.

00:09:08 Moderator: When you talk to veterans who have a disagreement about their claim, what do you usually advise them to do?

P06: First, I ask them if they have the evidence, and do they have a... I read why the VA denied them first thing. I read why they were denied the condition, and then if we can, overcome that denial based off of something that the VA was incorrect in doing, which sometimes they are. Incorrect, because I think that sometimes they don't read the whole record. And then... They don't look at maybe what the person did in the military to have that condition, because some... sometimes veterans are not seen for certain conditions when they're in the service, and I think sometimes the raters don't really understand that, because when I was in, you could not If going on sick call was frowned on, especially if you are a higher-ranking person. That's not something that we did, you know? We didn't teach our soldiers to do that either, you know? You did your job, you know, so... It was... It's crazy, you know, because you have people that are parachuters, never went on sick call. for jumping out of planes, and now, they have back conditions, knee problems, all of that, you know, from doing all of those constant jumps. But because there's no record. of them ever being treated in the military, it's hard for them to get those conditions. And the same thing for hearing, and the ringing in the ears. A lot of the conditions they don't look at, and they should change some of it.

Moderator: the regulation I'm talking about. Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, I've heard that a lot, actually, about people just not... just kind of suck it up and not get treated... not get looked at.

P06: If you want to stay in, guess what you would do? You would suck it up in. Especially if you want to get promoted, you're just like, okay, let me just forget it, let's go on.
