P07: It sucks.

00:00:49 Moderator: So tell me, you've filed for disability benefits, I assume.

P07: And it's been pending for 2 years.

00:00:58 Moderator: Okay, how many different times have you filed for disability benefits?

P07: Well, the people at the DVA I joined them for a while. They said, keep trying. It took one person 12 years. I says, well, I don't... I don't see it happening, but every time I check, it's still pending to go to a judge.

00:01:23 Moderator: Okay, do you have any disabilities that the VA has approved?

P07: That's what I'm waiting for. I... I... maybe I don't understand the question.

00:01:34 Moderator: Okay, that's alright. So tell me, so what is it that you're trying to get them to approve for you right now?

P07: Well, I never found out I had thyroidism. hypothyroidism, until I got home and joined the VA, which was in 19... or 2012. And then I find out I had the thyroid problem, which answers why I had all those problems and never knew about it. And that's one of my claims, and I went through the process of being interviewed by somebody, and... It's not going anyplace.

00:02:16 Moderator: Okay, and is... is that the only thing that you've tried to get from the VA, is for the hyper... the thyroidism?

P07: No, my nephew was in the Air Force, and he... he has... nail fungus, and I said, well, I'm gonna ask them if I can get a disability for that, because he gets one. So, I tried that, and that's the only two, and they're still pending.

00:02:41 Moderator: Okay, so those are the only two that you've asked for?

P07: Right.

00:02:45 Moderator: Okay, and then it sounds like you started your claim for thyroidism back in 2012, you said?

P07: No, that's when I started with... going to the VA for healthcare.

00:02:57 Moderator: Okay, so when did you first file a claim?

P07: Oh... Probably 2 years ago.

00:03:05 Moderator: Years ago? Okay. And what was going through your mind when you decided to file that claim?

P07: I just wa... I just wanted to see if it... If it worked. I'm talking to all these veterans on RallyPoint, and they don't have any... positive feedback for me. They just said, keep trying.

00:03:31 Moderator: What is RallyPoint?

P07: It's a, it's a group of veterans all over the world that talk on this app called RallyPoint.

00:03:42 Moderator: Hmm. Okay, that's interesting. And so you're... you're talking to these other veterans, and were they kind of giving you ideas about what you might do?

P07: No, the people at the DAV who are... residents of the city I live in, I bump into them every once in a while, and I says, oh, I remember you, yeah, he says, how are you doing? Did you get any place with them? I said, not yet, I'm still waiting for the judge to review.

00:04:11 Moderator: Okay, okay. So, tell me about when you, the very first, filed your claim. How did you do that?

P07: I... I'm a person who likes to investigate, and I... since this phone is sort of new, it's only... 2 years old, I've been looking up a lot of stuff and information. And filling out papers online, and... I just thought, well, this is interesting, I'm gonna pursue it. Not that I thought anything would happen, but I did everything on my phone. Did you...

00:04:50 Moderator: Do you file the claim on your phone?

P07: I couldn't. I had to send... I had to, make paper copies and fill it out and send it to Janesville, Wisconsin.

00:05:02 Moderator: Okay. And did you, so when you did that, this was about 2 years ago, you said?

P07: Yeah, the claim that's in process now, they just started in May... 2025. This is for the second time.

00:05:22 Moderator: Okay, so the first time you used your phone... sorry, go ahead.

P07: I think it was denied, that's why I wasn't getting any place, so I... I'm taking the advice of the people in the DAV. Because they're my sponsor.

00:05:40 Moderator: Okay. So, it was denied. Do you remember how you found out that it was denied?

P07: I got a VA app, and I go in there. Most of the time, it's wrong and not up-to-date, but... when I find something that, well, I guess it's possible, they have denied it, I just accept it as a... I'm done with it. And then these guys talked me into starting it all over again. And they must put in a word for me at the... headquarters down in Janesville, because these... these people are... They're probably my age, but they got more clout than I do.

00:06:19 Moderator: So are they... have you, signed up with the DAV as your, like, official representative, or...

P07: Yes.

00:06:29 Moderator: So... When was the last time that you had any interaction with the VA about your claim?

P07: I guess when they sent it to the judge. In May.

00:06:46 Moderator: In May, they sent it to the judge, and what...

00:06:50 Moderator: So you were saying that you found out on your VA app that they denied your claim. Why did they deny it?

P07: I have no idea.

00:07:03 Moderator: So then you were talking to your... some of your people you knew at the DAV, and you decided to sign up with them... for them to help you?

P07: No, I did that before. I had done that already because they needed somebody to represent you, and... I thought, well... try this one. So, I went with the DAV because they got people in the area. Okay.

Moderator: William...

P07: If you can see me and it looks weird, I'm trying to plug my phone in.

00:07:39 Moderator: Okay, so after they denied you, and the folks at the DAV convinced you to try to try again, what did they tell you about what your different options were?

00:07:54 Moderator: At that point.

P07: I... I don't know. Give me an example. Obstacle.

00:08:07 Moderator: Yeah, so, you could, when you reapply.

00:08:12 Moderator: you could give them... you could send the VA some new evidence and see if they'll reconsider. You could ask for a different person to review it. You could go to the board.

P07: Right now, they... they do not want you to send any information in. It's with this judge person. Because I was just gonna quit, because I had enough of this back and forth. But they talked to people down in Janesville, and... she... he... the guy that was from the DAV told me to call this lady, and she'll help you out, and that's about all I did, and I think somebody's mentioned something to her, and all of a sudden, it's with a judge, and I didn't have no idea why... how it got there.

00:09:06 Moderator: Okay. And did you ever meet with the judge?

P07: No. I don't know who this person is. They just... they just call him a judge.

00:09:22 Moderator: And so, you were saying that they asked you... they didn't ask you to provide any more documents or anything like that?

P07: No.

00:09:32 Moderator: So, do you know, as the DAV is representing you, what's the argument that they're making why you should get approved?

P07: They're nice guys. I don't know. I didn't even know that was in the process until... I talked to the commander of the... the one I was at, and he says. He sounded like he was pulling for me some way. But I'm not a member, and they don't... they... They said I could not be a member because I was not in combat. But... There's an argument there that they said, yes, you can, and whoever, everybody has a different opinion, and then... I didn't join because they're too... really too serious for me.

Moderator: But they're still working for you, which it sounds like they've been really helpful.

P07: Yep. Nice guy, nice guy.

00:10:44 Moderator: Okay. Can you tell me about the... you said you also applied for the nail fungus?

P07: And that I never went to get that checked out, because it sort of stopped right there after I went through the... physical, and... I had to go to Wausau, and they paid me to go to WASA to have the physical done, and have a meeting with some person, and I go, oh, they must be serious about this. And then everything else, I said... the second thing I was there for, I said, is this for the toenail fungus? They said, no. This is still for your thyroid.

00:11:29 Moderator: Okay, and did you file for the toenail fungus at a different time from the thyroid?

P07: Yes.

00:11:35 Moderator: Can you tell me about that?

P07: Not much. Just that my nephew said he did, so I said, well, I'm gonna try. Like, 6 months after I did it with the first one.

00:11:51 Moderator: Okay, and did you have the DAV do that for you, or how did you do it?

P07: I just did the paperwork online and printed it off, and sent it to Madison, or Janesville.

00:12:07 Moderator: Do you remember much about when you were filling out that form?

P07: complicated.

00:12:15 Moderator: complicated? What kind of stands out to you about what was, what was complicated about it?

P07: Gee, if I knew you were gonna ask this question, I would dig out my copy, and now I... thinking about it, I don't know where it is. Too many questions, repetitive, very personal sometimes. I was just wishing they'd call me and talk to me and get it done, but that's not the way the VA goes.

00:12:56 Moderator: Alright, so...

00:13:01 Moderator: So it sounds like, from what you're telling me, they haven't approved any disabilities, so you're not getting any disability compensation from the VA, is that correct?

P07: That's correct.
