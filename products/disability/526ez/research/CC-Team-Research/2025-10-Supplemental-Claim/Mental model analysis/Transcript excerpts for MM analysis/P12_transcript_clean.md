00:00:36 Moderator: So have you ever filed for disability benefits?

P12: Yes.

00:00:40 Moderator: And about how many times?

P12: 5?

00:00:49 Moderator: And, how many disabilities has the VA approved?

P12: They have approved. Sorry, let me...

00:01:08 Moderator: And I'm curious, are you, logging into the site, or using the VA mobile app?

P12: I'm, I'm writing, writing them down. I know I have the accurate number.

P12: Five.

00:01:33 Moderator: Okay, great. We've had folks both be like, hang on, let me go get my letter, let me go log in really quick to tell you. So thank you for, yeah, taking the time to give us an accurate number there. Can you tell us what those 5 are?

P12: Yes. PTSD. migraines. Fibromyalgia. Restless Leg, and GERD.

00:01:59 Moderator: Okay, what was that last one?

P12: a GERD.

00:02:02 Moderator: Okay And what... do you know what your overall disability percentage is?

P12: It's 100%.

00:02:09 Moderator: And now I'm curious about, your most recent experience with, when you applied for disability benefits. Could you just tell me kind of a general overview of what that was like?

P12: Sure, the last one was, the GERD. And air... actually, GERD slash IBS. So. I had to take it to the Board of Veteran Appeals, because it was denied at the local level. Although it was a Gulf War presumptive condition. And they just kept denying it, so we took it to the board, and after... 4 years, I was granted.

00:02:55 Moderator: Okay, 4 years after the, like, the appeal process, or 4 years.

P12: I just finished. application. After the appeal process. Okay. After I filed the appeal. Okay, okay. And, and it was just for that one disability, was the most recent.

P12: Yes, ma'am. Yes.

00:03:11 Moderator: And so when you got ready to apply for that disability, what was going through your mind at the time?

P12: Well, and play a dual role. Because I am a VSO as well. I know the law, I mean, I know, you know, the CFR, so I'm very familiar, but, you know, just as I help others, you know, with claims. I know that sometimes You... the local level just doesn't get it right, and it makes no sense, and you just have to go to the board and just wait.

00:03:52 Moderator: Okay, I'm gonna bookmark that you are an advise... you know, operate in advisory capacity, and just a few more questions to wrap up the, you know, this bit about your most recent... this most recent application experience. So how did you find out what the VA initially decided when you applied for the GERD?

P12: I received the decision... are you mean, from the board?

00:04:14 Moderator: Or both.

P12: Okay, from the board, I received an email saying that the decision had been made. And then I subsequently, was able to check And see that it was granted.

00:04:32 Moderator: And check by... how did you do that? Like...

P12: VBMS. Okay. That was the initial one, and then, of course, my app.

00:04:45 Moderator: And then, prior to the board, before you did the appeal process, how did you find out what VA decided when they initially denied it?

P12: Decision letter. In the mail.

00:04:58 Moderator: And do you remember what other kinds of things the letter told you?

P12: It indicated... That I was granted, what percentage I was granted. Favorable findings. List... it listed out the evidence, it listed my time in service. And the effective date.

00:05:20 Moderator: Okay. And what caused your condition?

P12: the GERD, or IBS, it was considered presumptive in Gulf War.

00:05:31 Moderator: Okay, and did the VA agree with that?

P12: Yeah, they... yeah.

00:05:37 Moderator: And then, so, a question about your, you know, advisory capacity. I'm wondering if, you know.

00:05:44 Moderator: almost like a miniature roleplay. If you were to pretend that I'm a young veteran, just a couple years out of the military, and I've got a few health problems for my service, and I'm totally unfamiliar with VA disability benefits, how would you explain the steps of that process to me?

P12: I would... well, as they initially come in. We talk about, when they served. You know, what occurred in service. Then we talk about the current conditions. then we talk about, you know, if it was war or presumptive conditions, then we'll go... I'll go over there, go over that list and ask them if they, you know, are experiencing any of those conditions. If not, we try to... I try to advise as to the best route to take if they do have evidence, or if they don't have evidence, so that we're not spinning our wheels. We want to get it right the first time. explain the whole process to them. You know, we file the claim, we, VA will automatically request copies of the medical records, if they have any pertinent records that we need to submit at that time, or shortly thereafter, you know, give them to me so I can get them uploaded quickly. Let them know that they're going to be contacted for evaluations for each of the items that we're filing for, and then also, let them know You know, when they go for the evaluations, be as honest and upfront as possible. Once those results are turned back into the VA Processing Center. And they will make a decision, and then Then they will, submit a decision letter to the veteran by mail.

00:07:42 Moderator: Okay, and when you're, you know, kind of giving an overview of this process to folks, are there particular terms that are... seem to stick out as confusing or unclear to people, or things people, things that you say that

00:07:55 Moderator: Tend to usually get, like, a follow-up question back to you, like, what does that mean, or can you explain that again?

P12: Oh, yes. Numero uno is service-connected. When they are asked. if they're service-connected, they automatically assume that... and this is... it's a lot of them, I'm not gonna say most of them. But the majority of the people assume that we're saying, are they... Have they been in the service? Not, like, do they have a VA disability rating?

00:08:28 Moderator: So are they saying what?

P12: Are you, are you receiving... are you service-connected? And they're like, oh yeah, I was in the Army and such and such. And we're like, no, do you have a VA disability rating? That's one of the number ones. A lot of times, they are extremely confused when we have already submitted. medical records to the VA. I could see that they receive them, but then they receive another letter by mail saying, hey, you know, we need you to send... send in this, and I, you know, just try to, you know. explain to them that it's their due diligence to... to allow you to submit any additional evidence before they, you know, render a decision. But it's... it's extremely confusing for them to get duplicate, Request for medical records when they've already submitted them.

00:09:23 Moderator: And do you help people with the appeals process at all, or any kinds of appeals?

P12: I initiate the appeal, but we do not do the follow-through on that. That is, handled by the, regional office.

00:09:35 Moderator: Okay, and are there any terms in... when you start bringing up, hey, like, here's maybe some appeal options to you that they're... oh, what does that mean?

P12: Oh, yes, so, a lot of times... well, if they're in the office, I will go over it with them, but if they're, you know, looking at it on their own, then they're gonna have questions about the options as far as, okay. do I choose... do I choose a decision by the judge, or do I want to go in front of the judge, or will I have to go anywhere? Will this be in person? Yeah.

00:10:10 Moderator: Okay, so almost, like, kind of logistical questions, but, like, what's expected of me?

P12: Yes, and I automatically tell them that, you know. This is not a quick turnaround. It's, on average, you know, 4 years. And as long as they're okay with that, then... then we move forward. And if they're... of course, older, then I will... Always request advanced, advanced docketing.

00:10:41 Moderator: And then shifting back to your experience, because you've also... the GERD, most recent application you mentioned, you went through an appeal process, so, you know, you disagreed with the decision the VA originally made.

00:10:56 Moderator: Let's see...

00:10:59 Moderator: and you did make a... I mean, you did consider... you'd made a formal appeal because it went to a board. Do you know... was that a higher level review?

P12: I... I did, supplemental, and then I did higher level, and then denied it higher level, like, within... 30 days. And I knew, I'm like, okay, We're going to the board.

00:11:21 Moderator: Okay, so you chased that all the way through.

P12: Yeah.

00:11:24 Moderator: Okay. And, how did you find out each of those decisions, or each of those tiers?

P12: Decision letter. Decision letter and, and, checking my app.

00:11:37 Moderator: And what kind of backup or documentation did you provide for, did you do the supplemental claim first?

P12: Supplementals first, yes.

00:11:47 Moderator: Okay, yeah, so what kind of a, like, documentation did you provide when you, completed that.

P12: I outlined, my Gulf War service. outlined the CFR with the presumptive breakdown. Those are the two things that I recall submitting, that first First time.

00:12:13 Moderator: Okay, and did you provide additional documentation as you pursued at each, like, appeal level?

P12: No, I just, indicated that I was being treated for it at the local VA. That's one of the little blocks on the supplemental form, so...

00:12:30 Moderator: And then did you... I'm curious, because you do do advisory work in this realm, were there parts of the process that were confusing or unclear for you when you personally were going through it?

P12: No ma'am.

00:12:46 Moderator: And then another similar... since you went through a supplemental claim experience, another kind of miniature role play, imagine you were talking to a buddy who maybe just found out that the VA denied their claim, and they were thinking of appealing it. How would you explain, like, what the overview of the appeal process looks like?

P12: Well, my first, my first, order of business is to... Review the decision letter. Determine why it was denied, what was missing. I look at the, the evidence section to see, make sure everything that we submitted was listed in that evidence section in case the VA missed something. And then I will... I'll look at the favorable findings. Okay, you have this, this, and this, okay, but you're missing this. So, we need to either, let's say, get a... a nexus letter to get this claim reopened, or if they're missing a diagnosis, okay. you're missing a diagnosis. If you have a diagnosis, and it's maybe a private doctor, okay, we need proof of that so we can submit this, because we just... I mean, it's really simple, you just go through what's missing, and you try to provide the VA with what's missing. And I explained to them, you know, it could take, I think, 180 days for a decision to be made, and that they may or may not be contacted for another eval. But, this is... this is the next step, you know, it... that we would take prior to going to, you know, taking it to a higher level, and I say, okay, if it's... if it's not here, and if it's denied the next go-round, then we have to go to the board.

00:14:34 Moderator: and then, is there any kind of...

00:14:38 Moderator: like, advice that you would give them? I know, you know, you overviewed a lot of, like, let's gather a lot of documentation, you know, make sure you've got... you're kind of building this case. Is there anything else that you would tell this person?

P12: Supplementals... Mmm... No, I guess maybe the biggest... sometimes, the biggest question will be. They'll say appeal, they'll say, I want to appeal this, and then I'll explain to them that, you know, there's a difference... there's... I mean, well, not say a difference, but there's steps to appealing, so we want to... we want to always try to get it granted at the local level before we go to the actual board, and so they seem to be okay with that. I explained to them, supplemental. You can, you know, submit any evidence you want. Higher level, you can't, you know, you can't submit anything. However, you do have the option, if you want to explain or go into more detail about your story, then you can, request an informal conference. Freed.

00:15:50 Moderator: And then, do you have any conditions that are rated at 0%?

P12: Yes.

00:15:57 Moderator: Okay, and how did that happen?

P12: The RLS... They just gave me a zero. I mean, they didn't do any testing or anything, they just gave me a zero, and at that point, you know, I was... I was okay with it. I didn't want to... I didn't feel like fighting it. They didn't do any type of a sleep study to test. how many times I was, you know, kicking or anything at night, they just granted a zero. So I just was like, okay, whatever.

00:16:27 Moderator: Yeah, and same thing, in your own words, how would you explain that there could be a disability rated at 0%?

P12: Oh, yeah, that's a good one. So, I... I mean, I... countless times, you know, people will get their decision letter, and then they'll call me and say, hey, they denied everything, they denied everything, and then I'll look at the decision, I'm like, no, you were granted. Zeros are good. Zeros are good. You know, zero is a grant, it just means that it's not to the degree that it's compensable for you. because we work, you know, because we... we are facilitators, and I'm an authorized signer for CalVet fee waivers. And, I'm like, I try to turn it into a puzzle, I'm like, your kid can go to college for free with a 0%. You're good. you're good, you know, so... that... then they're like, oh, oh, okay, I thought I was denied. I'm like, no, zero... zeros are good, because the condition... it... it... the VA acknowledges that the condition is because of your service. The condition can always go up. You know, you can always... you can only go up from zero. Yeah. So that kind of, you know, they... they're like, oh, okay, cool.

00:17:37 Moderator: Yeah, it's like you've got your foot in the door, basically. Right. Yeah. Okay.

00:17:40 Moderator: And then, so...

00:17:42 Moderator: it sounds like, at least some of the ones that we've talked about, that the disabilities you have with VA were caused directly by something that happened while you were in service.

P12: Yes, ma'am.

00:17:51 Moderator: And I'm wondering, you know, we know that sometimes an injury or illness you got while in service can later cause, like, a whole different health condition. So, you know, for example, maybe you injured your knee while you were in service, and years later, because you've been overcompensating for that bad knee, you're now having some back problems. So it's like an indirect cause, but it's still because of the military service.

P12: Secondaries, yeah.

00:18:13 Moderator: Okay, yep, you already know. I was gonna ask if you've had a situation like that or heard of it, but yeah. Yes, yes.

00:18:22 Moderator: And you already know how the VA refers to that situation.

P12: Yes.

00:18:28 Moderator: And then, I think one more question, before we shift into part two of the session,

00:18:34 Moderator: Again, you know, I'm fresh out of the military, you've already explained to me the disability benefits process, what that looks like, and now I'm wondering, how does the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries? What would you say?

P12: I would explain to them that. Each condition is... is rated separately. You are assigned a rating. A disability rating 0-100% for each individual disability. And, then, you know. Over... once they decide the whole claim, you'll, receive in your decision letter what's... what's called the combined disability rating. And that number is attached to the amount of compensation you'll receive. So, if you have 4 conditions and they total 50%, okay, then I show them, okay, as a single veteran, this is what you're going to receive for a 50% disability rating. Anything above 30%, if you have dependents or a spouse, then we could add your, dependents to the claim.
