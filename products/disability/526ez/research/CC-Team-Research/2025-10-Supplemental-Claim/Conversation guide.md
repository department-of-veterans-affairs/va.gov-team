* Mute your Slack notifications.  
* Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

### Starting the session

* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.  
* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked  
* Check your \[screensharing setup\] and share permissions for participants.  
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro\*

# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

My colleagues and I work on va.gov, improving the site so that Veterans can submit claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. We hope to improve the process by talking to Veterans like you.

Before we start, I have a few things to go over with you:

* This session will last about an hour and fifteen minutes - I want to confirm that that still works for you. There are opportunities for breaks if you need them, just let us know and we will also prompt you during the session for a break.
* This session is going to have **two parts**. In the first part, we want to hear about your experience getting disability benefits. In the second part, we’ll look at some designs we’re working on for part of the website and get your feedback.  
* What I hope to do today is to get a sense of how to best assist Veterans with disability benefits. What I don’t want to do is to add to any **frustration** you may have had with getting benefits. We may review things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation. However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the process in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.  
* In this session, we want to hear **your honest opinions**. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback.  
* This entire session should take about **75 minutes**. I want to be sure not to keep you over time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.  
* If you would like to **stop the session or do not want to answer a question** for any reason at any time, that's no problem, just let me know. You’ll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.  
* Observers  
  * Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?  
    * *If no:* Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
    * *If yes:* Admit observers.  
  * *When observers arrive:*  
    * Ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.  
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session.  
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, and then we destroy the recordings when we’re done with the analysis.  
  * Knowing that, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today?  
* \[Record answer here\]  
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

➡️ **Start recording**
*Tip: After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.*

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

# Explore how Veterans think of disability claims (10-15 min)

*Moderator guidance:*

* *In addition to the specific probes listed, use open probes to dig into more detail on each topic.*   
* *Mirror the words the Veteran is using rather than using ours/VA’s terms. We are trying to capture Veterans’ own words. When referring to a concept for the first time, try to use highly general language. For example: Instead of “What conditions did you claim?”, ask “What health issues did you apply for?”*

Let’s get started. I’d like to hear about your experience getting disability benefits. Since we might touch on some parts of your health situation, please know that you don’t need to talk about any topics you don’t want to. I’m most interested in hearing about your experience with the VA disability benefits process itself.

* Have you ever filed for disability benefits?  
* About how many times?  
* And how many disabilities has the VA approved?  
* Can you tell me what some of those are?  
* What’s your overall disability percent?

## Most recent experience

When was the last time you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits?

* Tell me about that

Specific probes:

* Was it for just one disability, or were there more?  
* When you got ready to actually apply for disability, what was going through your mind?  
* How did you find out what the VA decided?  
  * If you remember, what kinds of things did the letter tell you?  
* Probe about service connection. What caused your condition? Did the VA agree with that? 

## Disagreements

Has there been a time when you disagreed with a decision the VA made about your disability benefits?  
*If no:*

* What do you think might be the options if you did disagree with a VA decision?

*If yes:*

* Tell me about that.

*Specific probes:*

* What had you applied for?  
* What did the VA decide?  
* What did VA tell you about their decision?  
* Why did they decide that?  
* What did you disagree with? Why?  
* What did you do when you found out?  
* Did you consider making a formal appeal?  
* What options were available to you?  
* How did you decide what to do?  
* (If they appealed) What kind of backup or documentation did you provide?  
* What happened then?  
* What did you think about the experience?  
* What parts were confusing or unclear?

*If they went through an appeal:*

* Imagine you were talking to a buddy who just found out the VA denied their claim and they were thinking of appealing it. How would explain the process to them? What advice would you give them?

## 0% ratings

Do you have any conditions that are rated at 0%?

* How did that happen?  
* What do you think of that?

## Secondary conditions (if there’s time)

It sounds like most of the disabilities you have with VA were caused directly by something that happened while you were in service. But sometimes an injury or illness you got while in service can later cause a whole different health condition. For example, maybe you injured your knee while you were in service. And years later, you’ve been overcompensating for that bad knee and now you’re starting to have back problems.  
So it’s like an indirect cause, but it’s still because of your military service. 

* Have you ever had a situation like that? Have you ever heard of it?   
* Do you happen to know how the VA refers to this situation?

## Claims for increase (if there’s time)

Have you ever asked the VA to give you a higher rating on a disability they’d already granted?  
Tell me about that.

Great, thank you for sharing your experiences with me. One more question…

## Explain it to me (optional)

Pretend that I am a young person. I have just gotten out of the military, and I have a few health problems from my service. I want to know how to get disability benefits. Can you explain it to me, like I don’t know anything about it?

* How does VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries?

## For “advisors”

Perigean mentioned you help other Veterans with disability claims, is that right? Pretend that I’m a young Veteran, just a couple years out of the military, and I have a few health problems from my service. I’m totally unfamiliar with VA disability benefits. How would you explain the process to me?

* What terms are particularly confusing for people?


# Prototype tasks (20-25 min)

Before we get into testing the prototypes, would you like to take a brief break?

[Link to prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/P6IUm8gN00H3Yi1XzN80fj/-526ez--Condition-information-entry?page-id=6174%3A18589&node-id=6524-47192&viewport=653%2C-7741%2C0.75&t=UWlAy6DgYnnYEKOL-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=6524%3A47192&show-proto-sidebar=1)

*Moderator guidance:*

* *As participant clicks through prototype, give them time to review each screen themselves and think aloud before asking questions.*

Now let’s get into evaluating some prototypes.

We’re going to show you two prototypes for designs that we’re working on. 

* These prototypes are not the real website, and they’re only partially functional. Some parts of the prototype are clickable and some are not.   
* Because it’s just a rough prototype, we’ve put in dummy data, and it’s not connected to the real VA database. Nothing you do today will affect your VA benefits or information at all.

I’m going to put a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat. You can navigate to open that link. Once you have that open, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing.

* Wait for screen sharing to work. If needed, refer to [mobile tech assistance guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions).

For this scenario, imagine that you have a few different health conditions that you want disability benefits for, and you’ve come to the VA website today to apply. As you click through this prototype, you’ll notice there’s dummy data in here for an imaginary Veteran. This imaginary Veteran is already receiving disability benefits for a few conditions. Their data doesn’t match yours, but I’d like you to imagine that you really are this person and tell us what you would do as if this were your real situation.

As you use the prototype, please verbalize your thoughts out loud so we can understand how it’s working for you.


## Prototype 1 / Task 1 setup info

Have you heard of the PACT Act?

* *If no, provide this background first:*  
  * The PACT Act is a new law that made a bunch of new health conditions eligible for disability benefits, so that if you were exposed to burn pits or Agent Orange and you now have certain conditions, the VA will just presume that condition was caused by your military service and they’ll approve your benefits.  
* Let’s pretend you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 5 years ago, but the VA turned down your request because they didn’t think it was caused by your military service. But since the PACT Act was passed, you’ve learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition and they should give you benefits for it. 

➡️ Instruct Veteran to click on either Apple or Banana

## 🍎 Prototype Apple (10-15 min)

When you get to this screen, you’ve already logged in and started your benefits application.

### 🍎 Apple Task 1: Appeal a denied condition (Asthma)

For this first scenario, you’re going to re-apply for asthma, which the VA denied when you applied 5 years ago. Since the PACT Act became law, you think the VA should change its decision.

##### Intro screen

* What’s going through your mind as you see this screen?  
* What would you do next?  
* *(if they say “Click continue”)* What do you expect to happen next?  
* OK, go ahead and click Continue.

##### Add a condition screen

* What are you noticing about this screen?  
* What is going through your mind as you consider what to do?  
* What would you do next? Go ahead and do that.

##### Supplemental claim info screen(s)

* Take a minute to look at this screen and tell me what you’re noticing.  
* What do you think of the information here?  
* In your imaginary scenario, how does this information relate to what you’re trying to do?  
* What would you do next? Go ahead.

##### Review your conditions screen(s)

* What is going through your mind as you look at this screen?  
* What do you think about the information here?  
* Without clicking, tell me what you would do next.  
* What would you expect to happen next?

### 🍎 Apple Task 2: Request an increase (Hypertension)

##### Review your conditions screen(s) *(continued from task 1\)*

Let’s say one of the conditions you are already getting benefits for has gotten worse, and you want to ask for a rating increase on this same form. 

* How would you do that?  
* What do you expect to happen if you click Yes and then Continue?  
* OK, go ahead and click

##### Add a condition screen

Before you click on anything, I want to ask you some questions on this screen.

* \[question from walkthrough\] Where do you think this list of options came from?  
* What do you think about how they’re organized?  
* On this screen, can you tell me which things the VA is already giving you benefits for?  
* OK, back to the scenario. Imagine that you visited your doctor last month, and they told you your hypertension has gotten worse. You want to try for a higher rating. What would you do?  
* What do you expect to happen next?  
* OK, go ahead and click Continue

##### Date worsened screen

* What would you do on this screen?  
* *Instruct Veteran to click on date field to populate with October 1, 2025.*

##### Review your conditions screen(s)

* What do you think is happening on this screen now?  
* What can you tell me about what’s changed on this screen?  
* Is that what you expected?

### 🍎 Apple Task 3: Appeal a rated condition (Migraines)

##### Review your conditions screen(s) (continued from task 2\)

* I’m going to ask you to add one more thing.  
* Let’s say you want to add another health issue to this form. What would you do?

##### Add a condition screen

Before you click on anything, I want to ask you some questions on this screen.

* Is there anything you notice that has changed since the first time you saw this screen?  
* *(If they notice that some conditions have disappeared):*  
  * Why do you think that happened?  
  * What do you think about that?  
* *(If they don’t notice, explain that Asthma and Hypertension are no longer available as options.)*  
  * Why do you think that happened?  
  * What do you think about that?

Now let’s add one more condition. This scenario is a little more complicated.

Imagine that about a year ago, you filed a claim for Migraines. VA approved it and gave you a 10% rating. But you believe they should have given you a higher rating, and you want the VA to reconsider their 10% decision. You went back to your employer and got them to write a letter about how many times you had to miss work because of your migraines, going all the way back to when you filed that claim a year ago. This letter should help prove that your migraines were more severe than the VA rating percent.

* Do you have any questions about this scenario?  
* What do you think your options would be to ask the VA to reconsider their 10% rating decision?

OK, looking at the screen now, what would you do?

* What would you expect to happen next?  
* Go ahead and click Continue

##### Date worsened screen

* Is this what you expected to see?  
* What would you do on this screen?  
* What date would you enter?  
* Let’s say you first applied for migraines in November of 2024, about a year ago. And the VA made their decision in January of 2025\.  
* *Instruct Veteran to click on date field to populate with November 1, 2024.*
* Go ahead and click Continue.

##### Review your conditions screen(s)

* Is that what you expected to see?  
* What’s going through your mind as you look at the list of things here?  
* If you’ve finished adding all the conditions you want to your claim, what would you do?

Let’s say that’s everything you want to claim today. What would you do next?

### 🍎 Apple Rating

Great\! Thank you for walking through those different scenarios with me. I’d like you to rate this prototype for ease-of-use on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is not at all easy, and 4 is very easy.

## Prototype 2 (10-15 min)

OK, we’re now going to switch to the other prototype. We’ll walk through the same set of tasks, but the screens are a little bit different. Please continue to verbalize your thoughts as we go. Before we begin, would you like to take a brief break now?

*If necessary, prompt participant to click the Continue button to get to End of Prototype screen.*

➡️ Instruct Veteran to click on either Apple or Banana, selecting whichever prototype they didn't start with

## 🍌 Prototype Banana (10-15 min)

### 🍌 Banana Task 1: Appeal a denied condition (Asthma)

* Let’s say that’s everything you want to claim today. What would you do next?

### 🍌 Banana Rating

Great! Thank you for walking through those different scenarios with me. I’d like you to rate this prototype for ease-of-use on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is not at all easy, and 4 is very easy.

# Compare prototypes

Now I’d like to hear from you how the two prototypes compared to each other. 

* Did you find one of them easier to use?  
* Why was that one easier?

What other differences did you notice between them?

* Follow-up probes

# Post-Task Interview 

## Challenges and surprises

* What would you say was the most challenging part of this process?  
* Was there anything surprising or unexpected as you went through these prototypes?

## Supplemental claims

* Before this session, had you heard the term “Supplemental Claim” before?  
* Now that you’ve done this, could you explain to me in your own words what a Supplemental Claim is?

## Secondary conditions

I want to ask a couple more questions about different types of conditions. Let’s look at the main screen in \[second prototype\]. 

*Instruct participant to open Add a condition screen in prototype.* 

Earlier in the session we talked about a situation where a disability that you got while in service later caused a new, different problem. Let’s say you have this knee condition that you have a VA rating for, but lately you’ve started having a new problem \- you’re getting back pain because you’ve been overcompensating for the knee. So now you want to claim back pain as a disability. 

* What would you do on this screen?

## Wrap-up

Does anyone else on the line have questions?

Any other comments or questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks\! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!

# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). \*\*Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.\*\*

- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
