00:00:00Kim Ladin: Confirm... 00:00:02Kim Ladin: Your consent. So, recording has started. I'd like to confirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? P13: Yes, I just hit OK. 00:00:12Kim Ladin: Oh, great, thank you. Okay, awesome, thanks for going through all that, logistical stuff with us. 00:00:19Kim Ladin: So to get started, I would like to hear about your experience getting disability benefits. And since we might touch on some parts of your health situation, please know you don't need to talk about any topics you don't want to. I'm most interested in hearing about your experience with the VA disability benefits process itself. 00:00:41Kim Ladin: So, have you ever filed for disability benefits? P13: Yes, I have. 00:00:45Kim Ladin: And about how many times? P13: Once. 00:00:49Kim Ladin: Okay. Do you know how many individual disabilities you're approved for? P13: 1. 00:00:55Kim Ladin: Okay, can you tell me what that is? P13: Ptsd. 00:01:00Kim Ladin: Okay, and what's your overall disability rating? P13: 50%. 00:01:07Kim Ladin: When was the last time that you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits? P13: I think it was in... P13: It was last year. I mean, it was this year, because I got my... it was probably in March of this year, of 2025. 00:01:30Kim Ladin: Okay, can you tell me what was happening then? P13: That was when they denied my last claim. 00:01:36Kim Ladin: Okay, and so tell me about the claim that they denied. P13: Well, what can I... P13: It was, I can't remember if it was my knees, I think it was my knees. 00:01:50Kim Ladin: So... P13: That's okay. I don't know if you need to know why they... or anything. 00:02:00Kim Ladin: Go ahead, tell me what... what had you applied for, and then what happened? P13: Okay, what happened was that I was a rare P13: I made a claim, I was in the military, I got out, I married, a military officer. P13: And I was treated from the time we married until 2005 at military installations, I was, because I was a dependent spouse. 00:02:32Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: And then, but during this whole process of my P13: claims. They were... they never were able to get hold of my medical records from 1978 to 2005. P13: So the only records they had are the records from 2005 to present. P13: Got it. And it didn't show all the times I was, I... I had, like, bronchitis P13: so many. Another one was the fact that I had, bronchitis all the time. P13: And, once again, P13: They could only go back to 2005, and it didn't show all my hospital visits, it didn't show anything. So that one was denied, my knees was denied, my hearing was denied, because they could never go back. 00:03:35Kim Ladin: Wow, that sounds extremely frustrating. P13: Yes, it was, but... 00:03:40Kim Ladin: You know. P13: I got at least the 50%. The... when I was interviewed by the psychiatrist, she wanted me to go and get 100%, but I got 50. 00:03:52Kim Ladin: Okay, so it sounds like you, applied for PTSD, and you also applied for, bronchitis and your knee condition. P13: In a hearing. 00:04:05Kim Ladin: adhering. So, did you apply for all of those at the same time, or did you do it at different times? P13: At the same time. 00:04:15Kim Ladin: Okay. And when was the original, application that you did? P13: I had to submit it by August the 9th, and I submitted it, like, August the 8th. 00:04:27Kim Ladin: My brother died. P13: That week, and so it. 00:04:30Kim Ladin: Oh. P13: For me to get it, but that's another story, but I'm okay. 00:04:35Kim Ladin: Yeah, that sounds really difficult. So, August the 8th of 2020... P13: 4. 00:04:44Kim Ladin: 24, gotcha. Okay. 00:04:47Kim Ladin: So, you applied for 4 things. 00:04:50Kim Ladin: And then, when did you... oh, did you... how did you do the application? P13: I did it online, and that was another problem, because, P13: most places, they did not have... I went... I tried doing it online, and I had some problems, and so I didn't know what to do, so I went to the, DAV. P13: To see if they would help me. Well, come to find out, the office here, no one knew that you could even apply online. 00:05:24Kim Ladin: Wow. P13: So they did find somebody that, told me, you know, he had filed a couple online, because he was just starting, he had gotten training, and he had just started to learn how to file online, and so he did help me through some of the... P13: answers that I needed. 00:05:45Kim Ladin: Okay. What were some of the problems you ran into when you were filing online? P13: My problem was with the, PTSD, the sexual assault. 00:05:55Kim Ladin: And was that... you were having trouble filling that out and getting... and putting in details about that? P13: Yes, because one time I filled it out, and supposedly it got caught off halfway through my story. 00:06:07Kim Ladin: Oh, no. Ugh. 00:06:10Kim Ladin: I'm so sorry that happened. 00:06:13Kim Ladin: So it sounds like that you were eventually able to get help from the DAV to get the application filed? P13: Yes, I ended up getting it filed, correct. 00:06:25Kim Ladin: Okay. And then, what happened after that? P13: I just waited, and then, I got... I then was called in to, like, one doctor checked... well, I had an audio test to see how P13: Because I wear hearing aids now. P13: And then, I was called in to a lung special... a PA, a lung specialist, and she listened to my lungs, and then my knees was never addressed, because they said there's no evidence of me ever having knee problems. 00:07:03Kim Ladin: Hmm. P13: Then, P13: Also, my high blood pressure, because I'm on blood pressure medication, and it went down after I dealt with my PTSD. P13: And I showed that, but they said that there's really no connection. So that's why I only got 50%. 00:07:22Kim Ladin: So, yeah, so I'm curious, how did you find out what the VA decided? P13: I got a letter. As a matter of fact, it was really weird, because I didn't get a letter. I got a huge deposit, because if you filed before August the 9th, you got the year before. P13: So I got a big check in my checking account, and I'm like, this is so weird. You know, so I called my son up, because he... P13: He's the one that pushed me to file originally, because he is disabled that. P13: And so I, I looked, and he goes, look and see if it says, you know, VA on it, and I go, yeah, it did, and it's this much. He goes, well, you must have gotten about 50%. P13: And so, about... I mean, it took, like, 2 weeks later, I got a letter stating, no, he told me to go on the website, and there's a website you can go to, and it tells you what disability you have. P13: how much of a disability you have. So I then went to that site, and I... and I found that I had 50%. P13: And that was from my PTSD. 00:08:31Kim Ladin: Okay. And then after that, you got the letter? P13: Yeah, it was, like, 2 weeks later. 00:08:36Kim Ladin: That's funny. And do you remember what kinds of things the letter told you? P13: For my PTSD? No, I don't, but I've got it someplace. They only addressed it... they... at that... that letter was only... P13: addressed the PTSD. 00:08:53Kim Ladin: Okay. How did you find out what they decided about the other things, the, hearing and bronchitis and knees? P13: They sent me a thing saying that there was not enough evidence. 00:09:06Kim Ladin: Okay. And, can you tell me a little bit more about that? Like, what kind of evidence? I know you were missing your medical records. Did they, did they decide that 00:09:17Kim Ladin: it just wasn't, like, enough of a problem, or that they didn't think it was from your military service? What was their basis for decision? P13: Because of the fact, like, you have to remember when I was in... I was in the military in the 70s. P13: And, women didn't have a very positive role back then. 00:09:39Kim Ladin: Yeah. P13: Trying to be nice, okay? 00:09:42Kim Ladin: Yeah. P13: And so, when I got debriefed with the VA when I got out, because they had a VA rep there when you got out. P13: And I told them about my knees and my hearing, and I told them that was it. I didn't tell them about my bronchitis, because my bronchitis was... P13: I was only in for 2 years, so yeah, I had 2 bouts, but it could have been getting it... I was in the medical field, and so I thought just being around patients, you know. P13: And then he... and he just chewed me out. You know, how dare you even think about making a claim? We have all these Vietnam veterans, and he put the guilt trip P13: And he goes, don't you dare, I'm not writing any of this stuff down, who cares? And I go, yeah, but I wore... and I even, in my justification, I wrote the fact that, for my knees, that we wore... I was in a combat unit, we wore combat boots. P13: you know, 18 hours a day, or whatever, we had no arch support, we didn't tee in them, we... on the roads with... and I explained all that, and I still got rejected. And I don't know if they understand back then what the boots were like. They were... P13: stiff. P13: There was... it was just... so, that's... P13: And so, I did not claim it back then because of the fact that... so they said that they went through my medical, and the only thing they found was the fact that I had a panic attack one day. P13: And that was the only thing, and I was in a medical unit, so guess what? You had a cold. What did you do? You just grabbed some medical, you know, you grabbed, you know, cough syrup and stuff. So you looked at my medical records, I had no... P13: you know, nothing. I had... I think they said the only thing in my medical records was I had a panic attack. 00:11:34Kim Ladin: Yeah, well... So, did you... 00:11:40Kim Ladin: think of... did you think of trying to pursue any of those other, situations, like, to challenge the VA's decision? P13: Well, I'm afraid to, because I've been told that P13: If they want to, they can... they have up to 5 years to yank your disability from you. 00:12:03Kim Ladin: Hmm. P13: And my fear... you know, I'm happy the fact that, you know, this happened in the 70s, and here it is. You know, I got my first check in December of last year. It's... P13: you know, I'm excited the fact that I got 50%. 00:12:23Kim Ladin: Did you... yeah. 00:12:25Kim Ladin: Did you investigate, or just, or ask around about your options? P13: No, I didn't. 00:12:32Kim Ladin: Okay. Because you had just heard that it might be... you could get your rating lowered, it sounds like. P13: Yes. 00:12:39Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:12:40Kim Ladin: Okay. Have you... Ever heard of any options if you did want to disagree with your claim? 00:12:50Kim Ladin: No. With their decision? Okay. P13: No. 00:12:52Kim Ladin: Alright. 00:12:53Kim Ladin: So. 00:13:01Kim Ladin: let's... I want to do a pretend scenario with you. So, pretend that I am a young person, and I have just gotten out of the military, and I have a few health problems from my service. 00:13:13Kim Ladin: I want to know how to go about getting disability benefits. Can you explain it to me? Like, I don't know anything about it? 00:13:20Kim Ladin: In, like, in other words. P13: I actually, I did this with a 70-year-old friend. 00:13:25Kim Ladin: Perfect. P13: He hasn't done it yet, but I've gone through all the steps with him. I told him he needs to go online and to fill it out, and he is very fortunate, because he's had the same doctor for 40 years. P13: So, all of his problems are listed in his medical records. P13: And then, I told him, you know, if you want, I will sit next to you while you fill it out. P13: But I... I told them, I go, you deserve... P13: the... and he really does, because his... he does. He was on a... he was Navy, he was on a ship, the noise, and just... P13: the chemicals and everything, and I'm like, you really need to, you really need to. So, P13: But if it was somebody young getting out, I would definitely tell them to go online, and if they have any problems, I still would go to the DAV if they had problems. But also, last... over a year ago, in... P13: March or... it was either 20... 25, either March or May, I went to a meeting at the, VA Center locally, and they had a female speaker there. P13: Talking about, things that you can do. P13: She is an advocate for... P13: for it. And then I went up to her after the meeting, and, you know. P13: you can't talk to some... you know, should I re... you know, file? And that's all she said was the fact that if the psychiatrist said I needed 100%, I should think about that. 00:15:12Kim Ladin: Interesting. P13: And that's so... but I haven't pursued it because, once again. P13: I know this... my son is really upset with me, because he says I deserve the 100% if... P13: And with my knees. I mean, he's been through my life with my knees. P13: And, but, I don't know, I'm afraid to. I'm... I'm intimidated. 00:15:35Kim Ladin: Yeah, that's... that's understandable. Okay, so you're still in, stay in the mode of explaining to this young person, 00:15:45Kim Ladin: How does the VA decide Whether to give me money. P13: I feel that what they have to do is the more evidence... if you have a lot of evidence while you were on active duty, like you reported your knees, you reported... and I know this now because of my son. You report, you know, like, P13: Like, for him, he reported, P13: how his face is always broken out. And so, I would first say to the soldier, even before he got out, make sure everything wrong with you that you're going to claim on the VA, you have some evidence in your medical record. P13: So that way, you've got evidence to back it up. P13: And then I would tell them to do it online, not to do the paper. P13: Because I've... I don't know, I... P13: the online... and I tell them not to get frustrated, because when I was doing the online one, there were times when I needed to go back, and if I went back, it started me right from the beginning and everything. So, you know, and I know that that was a year and a half ago. P13: chances are it's been corrected, so I'm, you know... P13: And so, but, and I would... because I think the online, it's easier, and they don't have to worry about your writing. If you write really horrible, it's... P13: everything, and to tell your story, and to go into... you know, for my PTSD, I went into every detail. Mine was... that's why I ran out of... apparently, I ran out of room on that page, is because of the fact that P13: I went into detail, and that's just to, I'd say, put down every detail you can think of. 00:17:40Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:17:41Kim Ladin: And then, can you explain to this young person, how does the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries? P13: I know that, for hearing it's 10%, for knees, it can be up to 30%. I know that they have P13: Sleep apnea, you're supposed to report it, but it's 0%. So they have... P13: different... I think they have different percentages. 00:18:10Kim Ladin: All right, great. Thank you for sharing all of that and about your experience. 00:18:15Kim Ladin: We are going to switch to looking at some prototypes of designs that we're working on for one step in the online application. Before we get into that, would you like to take a brief break? P13: No, I'm fine, I've got my tea with me. 00:18:31Kim Ladin: Okay, excellent. P13: I don't know, I don't see myself on the screen here, so I don't know what you're saying. 00:18:39Kim Ladin: It looks like your video camera's off, but it's... no worries. P13: Oh my goodness, is it really? 00:18:46Kim Ladin: Yeah, it's. P13: Right. 00:18:47Kim Ladin: It's fine. 00:18:49Kim Ladin: Okay, so... so what we're gonna do is we... Oh, hello! Hi! Nice to see you! P13: Tell me about that. 00:18:59Kim Ladin: No worries. So, so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna give you a link to a prototype, but before I do that, I want you to share your screen, so that when you open the prototype, we can see what you're doing as you walk through it. 00:19:15Kim Ladin: So, do you know how to share your screen in Zoom? P13: Yep. Wait in a minute. P13: Oh. P13: You're not getting it, are you? 00:19:52Kim Ladin: Not yet. P13: Because, there's a button, and it says share screen. P13: And it says, this site will be able to see the contents of your screen. 00:20:10Kim Ladin: Are you on, an iPad or a computer? P13: I'm on a book. Chrome. 00:20:18Kim Ladin: A Chromebook? Okay. P13: So, I'm gonna go Chrome Tab. 00:20:24Kim Ladin: Oh, yeah, oh yes, that sounds good. P13: Okay, here we go. P13: There. 00:20:31Kim Ladin: Okay, great. So, the next thing I'm gonna do is, in the Zoom chat, so I'm gonna want you to, if you're not back in Zoom, go and... you're, you're there, good. So in the Zoom chat, I'm gonna paste... 00:20:43Kim Ladin: a big link. 00:20:46Kim Ladin: For you to click on. 00:20:53Kim Ladin: You might need to switch back to the Zoom application. P13: Oh, there we go. 00:21:10Kim Ladin: Do you see that link that I put in the chat? P13: I mean, I use Zoom all the time, I can't believe I'm having problems. It does not have... let me see, chat... I gotta... P13: Okay, I'm on it. Do you want me... you want me to click it now? 00:21:27Kim Ladin: Yeah, click the link. P13: I'm twirling. 00:21:37Kim Ladin: Excellent. 00:21:41Kim Ladin: I love that term, twirling. That's exactly what's happening. 00:21:51Kim Ladin: I think we're not looking at the right tab. I think I gave you a wrong instruction when you were sharing your screen. 00:22:03Kim Ladin: So I'm going to ask you to redo the sharing. 00:22:06Kim Ladin: Can you... is anything coming up on your tab? P13: Yes. Oh, wrong. 00:22:20Kim Ladin: You click the link. P13: When I couldn't move... 00:22:23Kim Ladin: Caleb. P13: Like, I got a thing. Oops, it disappeared. P13: It said, apple and banana. 00:22:31Kim Ladin: Okay, perfect. P13: I lost it. It disappeared. 00:22:36Kim Ladin: Okay, that's alright. I'm gonna ask you to stop sharing your screen and reshare it, and I'm gonna ask you to pick a different option. So, do you see the button to stop sharing? P13: Yes, I do. 00:22:48Kim Ladin: Okay, so let's... let's do it again. I just gave you the wrong detail on this one. So click share, and instead of sharing just a tab, I want you to share... 00:22:58Kim Ladin: An application window. 00:23:07Kim Ladin: So if you can find where the, or actually, you know what'll be easier? Just share your entire screen. 00:23:13Kim Ladin: If that's okay, and if there's anything you want to close up and hide before you do that, that's fine. P13: Is anything showing up? P13: When you look at my screen. P13: Because I don't have any tabs open. 00:23:25Kim Ladin: Yeah, nothing... well, I don't see it screen sharing yet. 00:23:38Kim Ladin: It says it started screen sharing. P13: Okay, I can see you, and I have the words, you know, Zoom big, and you're little. Do you want me... 00:23:49Kim Ladin: So now we're trying to get to the... where you have that, where you opened the link, but you might need to click the link again, maybe? P13: Yeah, I'm gonna have to, P13: What did I do before to do that? 00:24:12Kim Ladin: This is always the hardest part of the session, getting this figured out. P13: Okay, so you want me to go back to chat? 00:24:23Kim Ladin: Yeah. P13: And, and I did. 00:24:26Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: And it's loading. 00:24:30Kim Ladin: I'm not seeing it for some reason. P13: still spinning. 00:24:34Kim Ladin: Yeah, but I don't... I don't see the spinner, I'm just seeing the other window where it says Zoom, and I'm not seeing your whole screen. P13: I have a thing, and it's called... Whoops. P13: Before you join, 526EZ, is that you? 00:25:00Kim Ladin: Is that what's... P13: And I... so I'll put in my name. P13: This is what others can see when you join files, send invites, and more. 00:25:10Kim Ladin: Huh. Maddie, do you have any suggestions here? I'm not sure what that screen is that she's seeing. P13: CPF. Madeline Fritz: I think, Madeline Fritz: what we're seeing is, a specifically shared tab, rather than the screen as a whole, so I wonder, Madeline Fritz: If you... Click share... if you stop sharing, and then as, Madeline Fritz: Yeah, and so if you click share, a pop-up normally appears, and then there's several options that show up, and... Madeline Fritz: there's some that are under, like, a heading that say application window, but I believe the first option on that pop-up should say something like Entire Screen, and maybe have, like, the name of your desktop. It might just say, like, Desktop 1, or Chromebook screen, or something. Madeline Fritz: None of those popped up. Madeline Fritz: Okay. Yeah, what do you see when you click share? P13: Okay, it's... I have at the bottom of my screen. P13: I have, you know, your mic, stop video, participants for chat reactions, and then I have a share screen, and it's a green P13: And it has a black arrow pointing. Madeline Fritz: And so what happens when you click that green square with the black arrow? P13: Okay, that's what I've been hittin'. P13: And then it says, choose what to share, you're correct, with app.zoom.us. Madeline Fritz: Okay. P13: Chrome, tab, window, or entire screen. Madeline Fritz: Let's do the entire screen option. P13: Okay, when I do the... when I click on the entire screen. P13: What happens is... I wonder if I... It doesn't let me share. Madeline Fritz: Okay, what does it say? P13: It has... the tab is Chrome. P13: Window, entire screen. And then there's a picture that's built in display. P13: And then below that, there's. P13: And it says, also share system audio, and I clicked on that, so that way... Madeline Fritz: Okay. P13: Here's that. And then there's, P13: two tab... two things, buttons. One is cancel, and one is share, and the word cancel is the only one that's highlighted. Madeline Fritz: Okay, I think what we'll need to do is click on that option that says Entire Screen, because it won't let you... Yeah, but if I click on it, it just doesn't do anything. P13: It doesn't do anything. Madeline Fritz: Okay, and then if you click on, can you tell me what some of those other options were again in the pop-up you're seeing? P13: If I hit Chrome Tab, I get... this is what I get. Post attendee hyphen Zoom. Madeline Fritz: Okay, so that's... yeah, that would be showing the Zoom screen we've been seeing. P13: And then... There's window, and then it says, and then there's an email. P13: Saying, reminder, veteran user experience research. P13: Those were the... are the only tabs, and I've been hitting post-attendee Zoom. Madeline Fritz: Yeah, and that's sharing that one tab in the web browser that shows the Zoom screen. Madeline Fritz: Let's see... Maybe, let's... Madeline Fritz: You know what, let's, click the link that, so you were saying that you were able to click the link that Ken shared, and you saw the, like, little gray screen that says Prototype apple, prototype banana. P13: But I've only done that once. I've done this, like, 3 times, and the only time it did that was when I did it once. Madeline Fritz: Okay, yeah, so let's click that again. Madeline Fritz: Or, sorry, I meant click the link in the chat. Yeah, I was trying to get back there. Okay. P13: Okay, I got a black screen now, okay. Madeline Fritz: Okay. Madeline Fritz: And so this is where I think we're gonna have to do a little maneuvering, but now that you have that, Madeline Fritz: that black Figma screen is loading. I'm curious if you go back to Zoom and click share, if you'll see another option in that section that has, tabs. P13: Okay, I'm looking. Madeline Fritz: Oh, and this. 00:30:03Kim Ladin: Ow! Madeline Fritz: Since we got it. 00:30:04Kim Ladin: Got it! Madeline Fritz: This is excellent, excellent, P13. P13: But once again, I'm back. Madeline Fritz: Back to... P13: What's your name? 00:30:13Kim Ladin: Oh. Madeline Fritz: I think, I wonder if this link is... Let me... Madeline Fritz: You know what, let me send... is this forest? 00:30:29Kim Ladin: Wow. Madeline Fritz: the link here... Madeline Fritz: Show... what else? Madeline Fritz: Okay, you know what? We're gonna... I'm gonna send a link, and it's only a tiny bit. Madeline Fritz: different, Madeline Fritz: But let's... if you don't mind going back to Zoom and clicking that one, I wonder if that will bypass this, Madeline Fritz: I wonder if the first one you got was maybe an invitation link. P13: Oh, maybe. P13: Okay, here we go again. Madeline Fritz: Okay, and yeah, we'll want to share that same tab. P13: Nope. Madeline Fritz: Is it giving you that same email prompt? P13: Well, what it's given me... the tab just showed up, yeah. Madeline Fritz: Okay, you know what? I wonder... can you... sorry, can you share your screen one more time? P13: Yeah, sure. I think I've got one more, one more idea here. P13: Well, I'm going... now that I got the black screen. Madeline Fritz: Yes. P13: I am going to do share screen again. P13: And I'm gonna do... the Chrome tab again, because at least I've got the black screen. Yes. 00:32:00Kim Ladin: And if this time doesn't work, we'll just switch to another method of doing this. 00:32:05Kim Ladin: I'll just share my screen. Madeline Fritz: Okay. Madeline Fritz: Okay, and so if we were to go back to that second link... That's in Zoom. P13: Yeah, but what's happening now? P13: is, when I have your picture up. P13: It won't allow me to do chat. I have to go back to... the screen, okay? 00:32:33Kim Ladin: Let's do... You know what's do? 00:32:35Kim Ladin: Let... I'm gonna share my screen. 00:32:39Kim Ladin: And we'll... we'll walk through the prototype as if you were using it, and you can just tell me what you would do. I think that'll work fine, too, because I know this is just... 00:32:48Kim Ladin: A very challenging part of the process, so let me... let's just do it that way. P13: Sure, whatever, I'm sorry, I just... 00:32:56Kim Ladin: It's not you at all, it's this... it's just complicated to do this, and sometimes it works, and sometimes we have weird technical problems like we're having right now. So, no worries. P13: I'm going to, get rid of the chat part over here so I've got a bigger screen, okay? 00:33:16Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:33:19Kim Ladin: Alright, so let me just... I'm gonna open the prototype on my end of things. 00:33:33Kim Ladin: Loading, and now I'm gonna go to Zoom and share my screen and see if I can get this to work. 00:33:43Kim Ladin: Just a second... 00:33:50Kim Ladin: Okay, so in a minute, P13, you should see Prototype apple, prototype banana. Do you see that? Yes, I do. Okay, great. Okay. 00:33:59Kim Ladin: So, 00:34:01Kim Ladin: You can just direct me what to do with the prototype, as if I am your mouse. So let me give you the scenario. 00:34:13Kim Ladin: So, there are two prototypes that we're working on that we want to get your opinion on. They are not the real website, so they're only partially functional, like, some parts are clickable and some parts are not, and because it's a rough prototype, it's not hooked up to the VA database, so we have put dummy data in. 00:34:33Kim Ladin: So nothing you do today is going to affect your VA benefits. 00:34:38Kim Ladin: For this scenario, I want you to imagine that you have a few different health conditions that you want to get disability benefits for, and you have come to the VA website to apply, and you've gone to that online application that you used before. 00:34:55Kim Ladin: So we're... it's kind of this imaginary veteran with dummy data. They're already receiving disability benefits for a few conditions, and you'll see that their data doesn't match yours, but I'd like you to imagine that you really are this person, and tell us what you would do as if this was your real situation. 00:35:11Kim Ladin: And as you're directing me what to do with the prototype, just, if you can verbalize your thoughts out loud, so we can understand how it's working for you. P13: Okay. 00:35:22Kim Ladin: Okay, so we are gonna start with Prototype Apple. 00:35:28Kim Ladin: And so you've already logged in, you've put in some of the information into the application, and you get to... 00:35:36Kim Ladin: This step... hang on, let me get rid of this. 00:35:39Kim Ladin: There we go. 00:35:41Kim Ladin: Okay, and you can tell me to scroll up and down, but... 00:35:47Kim Ladin: If you wanted to, to apply for some health conditions, tell me what you would look at on the screen and what you would do. P13: Continue. P13: Well, is there any way you can make that bigger? 00:36:03Kim Ladin: Yes. P13: because. 00:36:04Kim Ladin: It's the small on your screen, hang on just a minute. 00:36:09Kim Ladin: How's that? P13: That's good. Isn't that weird? Because when, we were doing it originally. P13: It was for, 526EZ. P13: But it wouldn't let me, I had to enter my name and everything. 00:36:30Kim Ladin: Yeah, I don't know what was going on with that, but it was a bug, I apologize, that was our fault for setting it up incorrectly. P13: Add your disabilities and condition. P13: Okay, go, I'm down with... P13: Okay, I'm gonna continue. 00:36:53Kim Ladin: And what are you expecting to happen after you click continue? P13: It would, pull up a screen that will have, P13: See, we've already entered my name and everything. It will have a tab, and I would put down, like, lost of hearing. 00:37:18Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:37:19Kim Ladin: And then... I'm gonna click continue. 00:37:23Kim Ladin: Go back up to the top. 00:37:26Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:37:28Kim Ladin: So again, tell me when you want to scroll, let me know what you're noticing about this screen. P13: I'm... oh, it's got down how much... okay, I'm done. I mean, you can scroll. 00:37:45Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:37:49Kim Ladin: Let's stop scrolling. What is happening? Sorry, I'm trying to scroll more. Huh. It's like, oh, it's stuck. 00:37:57Kim Ladin: What's going on with this guy? 00:38:01Kim Ladin: Hang on, there's more lower down on the screen. Let me reload it real quick. 00:38:09Kim Ladin: Prototype is just giving us trouble today. 00:38:13Kim Ladin: And it doesn't know your identity. 00:38:17Kim Ladin: Let me blow this up a little bit again. 00:38:26Kim Ladin: Scroll. No, it's stopping the scrolling. Madeline Fritz: I wonder, can you scroll down while it's zoomed out and then zoom back in? 00:38:36Kim Ladin: Yeah, let me try that, good idea. 00:38:42Kim Ladin: There we go, so this is the bottom of the screen. 00:38:45Kim Ladin: Okay, so now the scrolling's sort of working. P13: Okay. 00:38:50Kim Ladin: Okay, so tell me what you're noticing. P13: It's listing all the conditions, that I got my disability for. 10%, 10%, or whatever, and then the ones that I were... the ones I were denied, and on the date that it was denied. 00:39:13Kim Ladin: So, if this were your actual data, do you have any idea what would be showing in these different places? P13: The only one it would have would be the PTSD, and it would have a current rating, 50%. P13: And then your denied conditions would be, P13: Not asthma, but, bronchitis, knees, and hearing. 00:39:41Kim Ladin: Okay, so, let's say that you are now having arthritis in your shoulder, and you think that's because of an injury that you had while in service. 00:39:52Kim Ladin: How would you, ask for disability compensation for that? P13: Well, I am hoping that what I... I'm making an assumption. Let's do knee replacement. I think what I would do is I would hit knee... oh, no, I got it for that. Alright, let's go to a one that I've been... P13: denied. Whatever one I've been denied, and I wanted to work asthma, I would then, hit that bubble. P13: And I'm hoping that it would then take me P13: To either something to have to do with the asthma part, like, maybe more space for me to add more evidence or something. 00:40:37Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: I will definitely hit the asthma, and hopefully it turns blue, or whatever. 00:40:43Kim Ladin: Okay, and what if it was something that wasn't listed here because you hadn't applied for it before, like arthritis in your shoulder, what would you do? P13: I would go back up, and... and what condition would you like to add? 00:40:58Kim Ladin: And I would. P13: add, br- I don't know. P13: Finger, injured finger, I don't know, whatever. 00:41:09Kim Ladin: How do you do that? P13: I would put a... I would hit that... a condition I haven't claimed before that bubble. 00:41:17Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:41:18Kim Ladin: Okay, great. Let me give you a different scenario. Have you heard of the PACT Act? P13: Yes, that's what I did. I had until August the 9th. 00:41:28Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:41:29Kim Ladin: So, one of the things that it did is that it said that some conditions, some certain health conditions, it made them eligible for disability benefits, that... 00:41:42Kim Ladin: So the VA would just assume that if you served in a particular place or time, that it caused this particular condition. 00:41:49Kim Ladin: So for this scenario, let's pretend you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 10 years ago, but the VA turned down your request because they didn't think it was caused by your military service. But, since the PACT Act was passed. 00:42:04Kim Ladin: you've learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition, and they should give you benefits for it. So you want to reapply for asthma. What would you do on this screen? P13: I would go back down to the one that, the asthma. 00:42:24Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: And I would hit that bubble, because it's one that was already denied. And then I'd hit, I think it's continue, the blue thing down here. 00:42:35Kim Ladin: Okay, I'm gonna zoom in and out again. P13: Yeah, because it's not an added... P13: It's one that's already on the screen, okay? 00:42:43Kim Ladin: Okay, yeah, okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and click continue. 00:42:50Kim Ladin: And then... So, take a minute to look at the screen, tell me what you're noticing. P13: that I have two options. One is I can... because of the fact that it was something that's now covered, I would... I would... P13: focus in. You'd like us to review your claim based on the new law. 00:43:27Kim Ladin: Okay, let me just see if I can scroll down a bit. So, what would you do here? P13: Let's see if you... P13: I would, hit continue. 00:43:45Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:43:46Kim Ladin: What would you expect, to happen next? P13: If... I would expect it to, once again, have a bubble to say whether it's... I... I think up here... okay. P13: I would suggest there would be, the bubble to click on, you have new evidence that suggests, or you would like to review based on the new law, because I think they're two totally different. P13: you're gonna have to come up with new evidence. The other one is, you know, you show them you have asthma, and you show them that you were in the service at that time. 00:44:28Kim Ladin: Okay, so given what I described about this situation with your asthma, which of these do you think would be related to your situation? P13: Oh, definitely the, PAC Act. 00:44:40Kim Ladin: The PACT Act 1. Okay. 00:44:42Kim Ladin: Alright, so you said you would hit continue? P13: Yes. 00:44:45Kim Ladin: Okay, I'm gonna do that. 00:44:49Kim Ladin: Scroll... 00:44:50Kim Ladin: And again, take a minute, look at the screen, tell me when you want to scroll, and tell me what's going through your mind as you look at this. P13: I would hit... I wouldn't hit delete, I'd go edit. P13: To see... 00:45:10Kim Ladin: Okay, and... P13: how I can edit what they want edited. 00:45:13Kim Ladin: Okay, and what do you want to edit here? P13: I would put down... I would put down due to the fact that the law has changed. 00:45:27Kim Ladin: All right, so this edit button isn't working yet. 00:45:32Kim Ladin: So let me scroll down a little bit more. 00:45:36Kim Ladin: And tell me about what you're seeing here and what you're noticing. P13: Do I... well, it's required. Do you have another condition to add? And, once again, it would be a condition, something that has not been addressed before. And because I'm only working on the asthma, I would put no. 00:45:57Kim Ladin: Okay, so let's say that you did want to add something else to this claim, and let's say, 00:46:06Kim Ladin: You have been granted hypertension. 00:46:10Kim Ladin: But your hypertension has recently gotten worse, and you'd like to get more, you'd like to ask for a rating increase on the same form. What would you do? P13: I would go back. Do they let me go... they like to go back. I would go back to hypertension. P13: I don't remember what the disability would be, and I would, hit that bubble. 00:46:36Kim Ladin: Okay, so you click the back button? P13: See that last time. 00:46:40Kim Ladin: I mean, when they first started the online, if you hit the back button, it messed everything up. Okay. P13: I'm making the assumption that it will let me go back to where it lists all my, disabilities and the percentages. 00:46:57Kim Ladin: Okay, I actually don't know what's gonna happen when we hit the back button, but let's try it. P13: Oh, so I'm not supposed... that's not the right answer? 00:47:04Kim Ladin: It's... there's no right or wrong answer, honestly. P13: Well, let's just continue, then. Okay. 00:47:11Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:47:12Kim Ladin: I'm gonna click continue. Oops. P13: Oh, we hit you. 00:47:15Kim Ladin: That did... that did the wrong thing. Hang on. 00:47:19Kim Ladin: Let me... I'm gonna see if I can get us back to the right screen. P13: I have to. 00:47:23Kim Ladin: a selection here, I think, because it's required. P13: required. 00:47:28Kim Ladin: So, which one would you choose? P13: See, and that is confusing. Okay. Because am I adding another condition that has not ever been P13: I've never had a claim. P13: Or am I going to be addressing another condition that I have a claim for, but I want to address maybe adding more percentage? 00:47:51Kim Ladin: Sure. P13: And so, I feel that there needs to be something to indicate what I want. 00:47:58Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:47:59Kim Ladin: So, in this case, actually, what you need to do is just click yes, so I'm going to go ahead and do that. P13: Okay. 00:48:06Kim Ladin: And then continue. P13: Oh, it brought me back. 00:48:10Kim Ladin: Yeah. 00:48:12Kim Ladin: So, so your hypertension's gotten worse. What would you do here? P13: I would hit hypertension. 00:48:18Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:48:20Kim Ladin: And before I do that, a couple of questions. Where do you think this list of options 00:48:27Kim Ladin: came from. P13: What it is, is that there is, published 142 different conditions that you can claim. P13: And I think that that's... P13: These conditions, the way they're worded and stuff, is the ones that you can claim. 00:48:46Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:48:47Kim Ladin: And in this imaginary scenario with the dummy data, how do you think this list of conditions relates to you specifically? P13: Me? Well, the hypertension, but they told me I can't prove it. P13: And then the knee. I don't need a knee replacement, but... P13: I have problems with really bad knees. 00:49:12Kim Ladin: Alright, so let's go back to the hypertension. So your hypertension has recently gotten worse. 00:49:17Kim Ladin: And you said you would click this bubble right here? P13: Yes, please. 00:49:21Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:49:22Kim Ladin: And then, what would you do? P13: I can't remember. Can you make the screen just a little bit. 00:49:29Kim Ladin: Oh yeah, I'm so sorry. P13: No, no, no. 00:49:31Kim Ladin: I blew it up so that I could scroll. P13: then I'd hit condition again. I mean, continue. 00:49:37Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: And then it should bring up hypertension. P13: when it got worse, I would put down, you know, 2 months ago, whatever, a date, a month, a date, yeah, okay. P13: And then I would hit continue. 00:49:52Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:49:55Kim Ladin: All right, I'm gonna just, zoom out for a second, and then zoom back in, so we can see the whole screen. 00:50:04Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:50:06Kim Ladin: So, let me know when you want me to zoom back in, and I'd like to hear what you think is happening on this screen. P13: the asthma was covered, so, the hypertension. P13: Oh, do you... so, once again, edit. I would edit hypertension. 00:50:27Kim Ladin: Okay, and what would you expect to happen if you clicked edit? P13: That it would bring up would, I... it would bring up a screen, and I could give them my new evidence to prove it needs to go up. 00:50:43Kim Ladin: Okay, gotcha. Okay, thank you. What do you notice has changed on this screen? 00:50:50Kim Ladin: saw it. P13: Can you bring... well, it has the asthma up. 00:50:55Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: And then, I can't read, and I... the hypertension... okay, there we go. P13: Okay, hypert denied. P13: Okay, so the asthma we've already dealt with. I'm making the assumption since that was before. Now I'm back to hypertension. P13: Claim phrases, increase, okay, and then I'd hit edit. P13: Okay. And then... P13: And I don't have, dear. P13: another condition to add, and I'd say no. 00:51:37Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:51:38Kim Ladin: So let's say you do want to add one more health issue. 00:51:42Kim Ladin: What would you do here? P13: I would have... do you have another one to add? Yes. 00:51:48Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:51:49Kim Ladin: Oops. 00:51:52Kim Ladin: Okay, I'm gonna zoom out. 00:51:54Kim Ladin: Okay, and then I'm gonna click continue. 00:51:57Kim Ladin: Okay, so, now we are going to switch to the different design to compare. But before we do that, do you want to take a break for a couple minutes? P13: Sure. 00:52:12Kim Ladin: Okay, how long would you like, to break for? P13: Just long enough to heat up my tea. 00:52:19Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: 3 minutes? 4 minutes? 00:52:22Kim Ladin: Okay, we'll just wait right here, come back whenever you're ready. Okay, thanks. 00:53:55Kim Ladin: Amy, do y'all know if there's a better way to control the zoom level on this? Madeline Fritz: If you click the little, in the top right corner, there's those, like, yeah, those little sliders, I guess. I wonder if... Madeline Fritz: If you do filth, like, if you, yeah, do some of these... Madeline Fritz: Maybe you can make it responsive, maybe? I wonder if that would change with how... if... how you actually zoom. Madeline Fritz: I wonder if that does anything. Madeline Fritz: Like, I think it'll just fill up your whole screen now. 00:54:26Kim Ladin: Yeah. Madeline Fritz: I wonder if that'll be... Madeline Fritz: better for her to see. I think you'll probably have to set it... reset it each window. 00:54:33Kim Ladin: Yeah. Madeline Fritz: Or not each window, but each prototype. Like, I think if you do it here, you won't have to do it for the rest of Banana. 00:54:38Kim Ladin: Okay, I think it's the same thing. 00:54:41Kim Ladin: Go back to... To the end of this. Yeah. Amy: Yeah, I don't have a different suggestion, unfortunately. 00:54:59Kim Ladin: Nope, that didn't do anything, okay. 00:55:08Kim Ladin: Yeah, I think I'm using my browser control to zoom. Oh, here we go. P13: Hi, I'm back. 00:57:03Kim Ladin: Alright, welcome back. So we're going to switch over to Prototype Banana. 00:57:08Kim Ladin: We're gonna go through the same scenario, so I'm gonna click on Prototype Banana, And... As it's loading... 00:57:22Kim Ladin: I'm gonna skip this intro screen. So... 00:57:26Kim Ladin: I tried to blow it up a little bit more, but not quite as much. Is this... can you... is this big enough for you to read? 00:57:35Kim Ladin: If it's not, I can blow it up more. It's fine. P13: Because what it is, is that, P13: Yeah. Just a little bit, please. 00:57:42Kim Ladin: Okay, how was that? P13: Good. 00:57:45Kim Ladin: Okay. So, 00:57:47Kim Ladin: Let me just show you the screen. So, for your first scenario, you are getting arthritis in your shoulder, and you want to get disability benefits for that. 00:57:58Kim Ladin: So let me show you the screen here. 00:58:02Kim Ladin: And again, you can direct me to scroll. What would you do to ask for disability benefits for your shoulder arthritis? P13: I would hit a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:58:17Kim Ladin: So that was the first scenario. The second one, is where you had... you asked for asthma coverage, and it was denied about 10 years ago, but since the PACT Act was passed, you think they should give you benefits, and you want to reapply. 00:58:35Kim Ladin: How would you do that? P13: I would continue to see if there was... P13: Keep on going, keep on going... P13: I would hit a condition the VA previously denied. 00:58:50Kim Ladin: Okay, and what do you expect to happen after we click this and hit continue? P13: I expect a list of all the conditions that the VA has denied. 00:59:01Kim Ladin: Okay. 00:59:02Kim Ladin: Let's do that. 00:59:05Kim Ladin: And sure enough, I'm gonna scroll through this so you can see the whole screen. 00:59:15Kim Ladin: And then... Go back up to the top. 00:59:19Kim Ladin: And let me know what's going through your head as you look at the screen. P13: Well, because of the fact that, P13: I did the other one first. Some of this is familiar. P13: And so, I wouldn't... I would keep on going. P13: Stop. P13: Have a supplement claim. 00:59:47Kim Ladin: Oh, let me scroll up a little bit. P13: I would hit asthma, that bubble. I would bubble the asthma. 00:59:54Kim Ladin: You had called out the word supplemental claim. 01:00:00Kim Ladin: What do you think this means? Do you have any idea? P13: supplement. What it is, is, added. P13: Like, you want to add to that claim. 01:00:17Kim Ladin: Have you ever heard that term before? P13: Yeah, like, supplemental vitamins. I don't know. Yeah, okay. 01:00:27Kim Ladin: It's like this very specific VA thing, so I always wonder if anyone's heard of it. P13: You know, supply, sub, you know. 01:00:37Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: Break the word apart. 01:00:39Kim Ladin: Yeah, no, I was thinking more just the idea of a supplemental claim. P13: For an additional claim. No, file to add to your... to a claim, or just add to a claim. All right, asthma. 01:00:52Kim Ladin: Asthma... Oops. 01:00:55Kim Ladin: Okay, and then, what do you expect to happen after you click continue? P13: I expect it to, bring up the asthma part of my claim I originally P13: did, or it's gonna say, is it due to the pack? P13: I would say they... because asthma is covered... once again, I'm analyzing. I used to work for the federal government. I was an analyst. P13: I would expect it to bring up asthma, and the first question would be, is it because of PAC? P13: Or... something else. P13: So I would... because asthma is covered under PAC, I would ex... P13: my expectations would be it would say, is it because of PACT? 01:01:48Kim Ladin: Okay. 01:01:49Kim Ladin: Alright, let me click continue. P13: Okay, once again, edit. 01:01:57Kim Ladin: Okay, and that's... based on what you said before, you would expect that would be where you would add more information about how you want to 01:02:04Kim Ladin: Whether it's because of new evidence or because of PACT. Okay. P13: Yep. Great. 01:02:08Kim Ladin: Thank you. So, the next scenario is where you are already... you already have hypertension, granted, but it's gotten worse. 01:02:18Kim Ladin: So you want to add that to this claim. What would you do here? P13: I would hit yes. 01:02:25Kim Ladin: Oops. P13: And continue. P13: But once again, it's only because of what we discussed on the first screen. 01:02:36Kim Ladin: Right, okay, we figured it out. P13: Yeah. 01:02:38Kim Ladin: Right? Yeah. Okay, so for hypertension, 01:02:44Kim Ladin: What would you do here to add that to your claim? P13: I would, bubble hypertension. 01:02:50Kim Ladin: Okay. And what do you think about how this screen is organized? P13: I know what they're doing. P13: If somebody had, like, a whole bunch of them, let's say, I would rather see a, once again, in alphabetical order. 01:03:12Kim Ladin: Okay, okay. P13: Rather than by percentage. 01:03:16Kim Ladin: Yeah, that makes sense. P13: Well, it's not even listed by percentages, because migraine is 10, P13: So it's... it's not even in, like, knee replacement. If it was by... I don't know how it's listed. 01:03:31Kim Ladin: Why would I... P13: either by percentages or alphabetical order. I wouldn't have it random like it is. 01:03:38Kim Ladin: Okay. 01:03:39Kim Ladin: Okay, that is actually a really good suggestion. 01:03:43Kim Ladin: Okay, and so for the hypertension, what would you do? P13: I would, bubble hypertension, and then hit continue. P13: Continue. 01:03:58Kim Ladin: Alright, so, 01:04:02Kim Ladin: Go ahead and take a look at this, let me know when you want me to scroll down, and tell me, what is going through your head as you look at this. P13: Okay, I... you can go on. I mean, go down. P13: Okay, because of the fact that you said, that you're... when we originally started, you said that it's gotten worse. P13: I'm not appealing it. I am doing it because it's gotten worse, so I would therefore bubble the first bubble. I mean, the first one. My condition has gotten worse. 01:04:57Kim Ladin: Okay, great. What do you think is the difference between these two options? P13: Well, one is your... your condition has gotten worse, which means it's, you know... and whereas the other one is, I'm appealing my previous rating, which means I could be adding... I'm going to be more argumentative. P13: on what... why... I want my rating to go up, you know. 01:05:24Kim Ladin: Okay. P13: Whereas the other one is, I'm just, you know, I'm applying for an increase, and I'm just gonna put down my doctor's notes showing the fact that I've, you know, I'm now... they've increased my medication, or whatever. Whereas this one... P13: I've got to be more... the second one, I've got to be more, argumentative in, with my facts and everything. 01:05:47Kim Ladin: Okay, great. So that was a super clear interpretation of that. I'm gonna scroll back up and... P13: I wanna... I wanna know if there's anything that's unclear or confusing on this screen. 01:06:18Kim Ladin: Anything that raises questions in your mind? P13: No, because for, P13: I think the wording... I'm kind of talking my way through this, if you don't mind. 01:06:42Kim Ladin: No, that's great. P13: Apply for an increase if the condition has gotten worse. P13: But then again, if I'm doing... if it's going to be... it's kind of like you can file a supplemental claim if there's new information to suggest our rating was incorrect. I think... P13: I don't know. I guess they're okay. My thing is, is that saying it's gotten worse is going to be the same as, supplemental information. 01:07:14Kim Ladin: Yeah. P13: Getting more information, you're going to show your doctors P13: You know, your last doctor's visit. 01:07:20Kim Ladin: Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. 01:07:25Kim Ladin: Okay, so having looked at that, 01:07:33Kim Ladin: Which... would you still choose the same option in these bubbles, or has that changed your thinking at all? P13: Well, actually, I'm doing both. 01:07:44Kim Ladin: I can do it. P13: has gotten worse. I'm applying for an increase, and I am appealing my previous rating, because I want an increase. P13: But it would be the first one. 01:07:55Kim Ladin: You picked the first one. Okay, since we are almost out of time, I am going to, 01:08:03Kim Ladin: Kind of jump to the ends. 01:08:05Kim Ladin: And ask you to compare the two different versions that you've seen. P13: Okay. 01:08:10Kim Ladin: Apple was the first one, and bananas the second one. Was either of them easier to use? 01:08:20Kim Ladin: Then the other one... P13: For some reason, I liked the first one, Apple, better. 01:08:27Kim Ladin: Okay, any idea why? P13: No, I just felt that it was, once. P13: Well, this one is ease... well... P13: I'm not sure now, I'm a little confused. P13: I don't know if this one was easier, because I had already gone through the first one, and therefore I knew what to expect, because a lot of it was the same. Whereas the first one, it was like, well, if I push back, what's going to happen? What's, you know, what is going to be on my next screen? Like, if I hit... P13: this bubble. 01:09:05Kim Ladin: Yeah. P13: Whereas, I already knew that if I hit that bubble, the next screen was going to be this. 01:09:13Kim Ladin: Right, right. P13: There's one we didn't know if I hit that bubble or that... P13: thing, what was going to be on the next screen. So, it was... it's almost like... P13: Poor banana isn't getting a chance. P13: Or Apple's not getting a chance, because B is, you know? 01:09:33Kim Ladin: That's really funny, yeah. Let me... I'm gonna show you one of the differences, hang on, I've gotta just change the size of the screen. 01:09:43Kim Ladin: In just a moment... So this screen, It's gonna show... 01:09:51Kim Ladin: I know it's gonna be a little bit hard to see. 01:09:53Kim Ladin: But this is going to show one of the differences between Apple and banana, with how this first screen looks. 01:10:01Kim Ladin: So, this is Apple on the left. 01:10:05Kim Ladin: I think I can pull it up a little bit more now. P13: A little bit. Not much. Okay. P13: Hypertension... 01:10:17Kim Ladin: So, I'm wondering how these two screens compare in your mind. P13: Well, if you... it all depends on how you are, if you're a visual person or not. The second screen, because of the fact P13: I'm trying to... P13: Let's see... I... is, I can't read the percentages on, Apple. Are they listed according to the disability, or are they, the same as this over here, where they're. 01:10:52Kim Ladin: It's the same information between the two. Yeah. P13: I actually like the looks of the second one, Banana. 01:11:01Kim Ladin: Nana. Okay. P13: is cleaner. 01:11:05Kim Ladin: It does... P13: There's separation between the conditions. 01:11:09Kim Ladin: Okay. 01:11:10Kim Ladin: So, one of the big differences between these two is that on Apple, on the left. 01:11:16Kim Ladin: Your denied conditions are listed on this screen. P13: Oh, yeah. 01:11:21Kim Ladin: But they're not on this screen. You had to go to that other... Page. P13: And I like Apple. 01:11:28Kim Ladin: Okay, so, so tell me a little about that. P13: Well, I like to... It's right there. All the information is in one spot. It's the ones that I... P13: That are rated disabilities, and the denied conditions. They're right there, so you can see P13: Because what if, you know, I don't remember, that I applied for this or that? I don't know. I like the fact that it's all in one screen. P13: Okay. One screenshot. 01:11:58Kim Ladin: Okay. 01:11:59Kim Ladin: So, we are one minute over time. P13: It's okay, I'm sorry I took a break. 01:12:07Kim Ladin: No, no, it's not the break, it was because we messed up that, the thing with the prototype where it wasn't letting you in. That was completely our fault, so I apologize for that. I want to thank you so much for your time and for your patience with the technical difficulties. 01:12:24Kim Ladin: I'm gonna stop sharing. And you gave us really, really great, I think, actionable feedback that we can use, to improve this project... this design that we're working on. P13: Okay, good. 01:12:37Kim Ladin: Yeah, I mean, honestly, this kind of feedback from veterans is just incredibly valuable, as we try to make the website and the applications easier for everyone to use, so I really appreciate your time. 01:12:50Kim Ladin: The last thing is Prejian's going to send you a thank you with a little blurb that you can share with other veterans who might want to participate in this kind of research in the future, because we're always looking for more participants to give us their input. P13: Sounds good. 01:13:05Kim Ladin: Alright, thank you so much, hope you have a wonderful day. P13: You too. Bye-bye. 01:13:09Kim Ladin: Aye.
