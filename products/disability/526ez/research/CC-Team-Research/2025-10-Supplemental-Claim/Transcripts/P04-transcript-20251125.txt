00:00:04Kim: So just to reconfirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk? Yep.00:00:10Kim: Thank you.P04: And if you… if I mute myself, it's because I'm coughing, because I got the crud.00:00:14Kim: Okay.00:00:16Kim: What's going around?P04: Okay, yep.00:00:18Kim: Okay, in this first section, I want to hear about your experience getting disability benefits, if you've done that before.00:00:25Kim: And since we might touch on some points of your health situation, please know you don't need to talk about any topics you don't want to. I'm most interested in hearing your experience about the disability benefits process itself.P04: Okay.00:00:40Kim: So have you ever filed for disability benefits?P04: I have.00:00:43Kim: Okay, and about how many times?P04: I had… okay, so I… when I first filed was when I got… I didn't let… I didn't get medically boarded out of the military, I got out regular, and then filed for disability.00:00:58Kim: twice.P04: I came pretty much out of the military an automatic 40%, because they did a back surgery and screwed it up.P04: at 25.P04: I was 25, yeah.00:01:10Kim: Very sorry to hear that.P04: And then they had to take it out a year later, and then I had to have a third back surgery.00:01:16Kim: Boy! That's what.P04: I went… I got 100%, but it… it was… I want to tell you about it, because it was so different for me, because this was 04. This is a long time ago.00:01:25Kim: Okay.P04: And I know it's waaaay different now.P04: And I got denied many times.00:01:33Kim: How many times have you actually applied for…P04: I did.P04: I… I did it and got 40%, I did it and got 60%, so after my third back surgery, I was at 60%.00:01:47Kim: Okay. So, it sounds like you applied twice?P04: Yes.00:01:52Kim: Okay. And then, how many disabilities has the VA approved for you?P04: One, because I've… I've tried to do it again recently, but I know I'm probably not doing it right.00:02:03Kim: Okay.P04: Because I've done it so long ago, so when… what ended up happening was my dad was dying, and I promised him I'd try to get 100%.00:02:11Kim: Oh.P04: And I did. But I lived in New Orleans, I worked for a hockey team, and the VA was right there, and I had gone through a lot with the VA system itself, the healthcare, and I was done. So I filed… I went to DAV, is what I did. I went to Disabled American Veterans.P04: And I was like, look, I need your help, because I don't know what I'm doing. They say they won't disable me for my back. It is not a legitimate injury to the, you know, for all this. And the guy was like, just give me some time, and he called me a week later, and he said, sit down. And I was like, what? He's like, you're 100% with back pay. And I was like, what?P04: How'd you do that?P04: I don't understand how I've been fighting, and so what he did was unemployable.P04: Which has kind of screwed me for my 21 years of disability.00:03:04Kim: I'm sorry, I missed what you said.P04: They kind of screwed me, because I can't work.00:03:09Kim: Oh, because you're on 100%.P04: penny, because I'm unemployable.00:03:13Kim: Got it. But that's what got you to 100%?P04: Yes.00:03:17Kim: Okay.P04: And I'm still at that, so that's my next journey, is trying to get off that, becauseP04: I… when I quit work and I was making more money on disability than I do now, right? So now I'm 30 years later.P04: And I'm still just making disability, because I'm unemployable. But there are jobs that I could do from my house, sitting right here.00:03:38Kim: and make money, but they won't let me, because I'll get flagged.00:03:42Kim: Got it. Okay, so just… just to… so I understand the, sort of the landscape, is your back, is that the only disability that you're getting benefits for?P04: For right now, yes.00:03:55Kim: Okay.P04: Because I have never reapplied again.00:03:58Kim: Okay.00:03:59Kim: And are there other disabilities you have that you would like to get benefits for?P04: Absolutely.00:04:05Kim: Okay, all right, that's… that's great background. Thank you for sharing that with me.P04: It's totally different now. It was so different back then.00:04:15Kim: Yeah, I want you to think back to the last time that you dealt with the VA on your disability benefits. Okay. When was that?P04: I called the 800 number.P04: Probably… A year ago, and 6 months ago.00:04:31Kim: Okay.P04: body about how to get it changed, or if I could work.00:04:36Kim: Okay. So you just… you called somebody at the VA or at the DAV?P04: At VA, at the VA.00:04:42Kim: Okay, and what did you learn from them?P04: Nothing.P04: Literally nothing. You can work, you can't work, and you might get flagged, you might not get flagged. Go through this process. And then I had a VA employee, well, no, you need to try malpractice, and I'm like.P04: That surgery is 1997 active duty, like, there's… no. That's… that's out of the question. But should I be updated? Yes. So when I called back the last time, and it was before the shutdown, I was like, I need… I don't know how to do this. Like, what I did 20 years ago is not what you do now.P04: Yeah. The internet, like, we didn't have all the stuff that we have at our fingertips now. So I was like, what do I do? And she's like, you need to fill this form out, you need to do this, you need to do that, and I was just like.P04: oh my god, are you ca- like, I can't even keep up with what you're telling me.00:05:37Kim: Yeah, I hear you.P04: I am in my right mind, right?00:05:41Kim: When was the last time that you actually got, like, a formal decision from the VA on disability?P04: That was 04.00:05:50Kim: That was back in 04, okay. I know that was a long time ago, but can you think back… do you remember how the VA notified you, what their decision was?P04: DAV did.00:06:00Kim: DAV told you, okay.P04: AB told me, and then I caught a packet in the mail, probably.P04: I would say, like, a month, a month and a half later.00:06:09Kim: Okay, and was that when you got the 100% in unemployability?P04: Yeah.00:06:13Kim: Okay.00:06:16Kim: Did… so, and what… what caused your back condition?P04: The first surgery?P04: Is that what you're asking?00:06:23Kim: Why did… why did you have surgery in the first place?P04: They never got, and I never got a real answer. I grew up playing, like, soccer, and I grew up on a lake in Louisiana, fishing shrimp and crab, and, you know, like the tomboy for my dad.00:06:38Kim: Huh.P04: played soccer and active duty, I started having bad back pain, and they ignored me for a year. No MRI, no MRI, and I finally got the doctor to do the MRI, and my disc was gone.00:06:49Kim: Oh, God.P04: I had a discogram, and I had no discs. The dye just went… It was already gone.P04: So, you know, once you start that process, it kind of just…00:06:58Kim: So did the… it sounds like the VA… so you and the DAV said, this back problem and the surgery was caused by my service?P04: Yes.00:07:08Kim: And did the VA agree with that?P04: Not at first, that's why I had to get DAV involved, because they were like, we don't, we don't…P04: we basically were not going to disable you 100% for having back pain. And I'm like, I'm not having back pain. I've had 3 back surgeries, because y'all screwed the first one up, read the records. He had to back the screws back out. I still have a metal fleck of the bone… the…P04: the thing that they do to hollow out to put the screws in, I still have a piece of that floating in my bag.00:07:37Kim: Oh, yay, yay.P04: Yeah. That was the first active duty surgery, by the way.00:07:41Kim: Unbelievable.P04: Yeah.00:07:43Kim: So when you first applied for this, you applied for it by yourself without the DAV?P04: Yes.00:07:49Kim: Okay. And then, what did the VA decide on that first one?P04: It was 40… it was just gonna be 40%, and it was basically for…P04: I'm trying to think of what the word was.P04: it's almost like spondylosis or something like that, you know? It wasn't… it was, oh, you have this back thing, and we operated on you. You know, like, they're trying to tell me it was something genetic or whatever, and it wasn't. It was because y'all ignored me for a year when I hurt myself.00:08:22Kim: So you got this decision that gave you 40%, you disagreed with it. What was going through your head when you got that decision?P04: That's interesting, because I'm so young. That's the thing, too, I was… you know what I mean? I don't haveP04: knowledge I have now, back then, I was like, oh, it's 40%, I'll be fine.P04: And then I got out of the military because I was married and he was getting out.P04: That's why I didn't let him medically board me. I was like, oh, I'll trust the VA to do what's right.00:08:51Kim: Who's medically, medically bored you, what does that mean?P04: When you're in the military and you have a medical condition that would actually require you to get out.00:09:00Kim: Okay, like a medical discharge?P04: Yes, exactly, and you have to go through a board and get approved, and I'll say, I ain't doing it. I'm not doing it. I'll let the VA do it. And that's…P04: That's what happened. So, I had the 40%, and I was working at a hospital in Seattle.P04: So, while I had that disability, I was still working.P04: And that's when it started hurting worse. Okay. And I had the second surgery, and they had to take the screws and rods out.P04: So I went a year and a half. So if you… imagine this, if you take bone graft off your hip.00:09:33Kim: Huh?P04: And stick it in your spine.00:09:36Kim: Oh my god.P04: And you put the screws and rods in there, and then you pull them out a year later.P04: And that bone has not grafted yet.00:09:45Kim: So, so after that happened, was that… how did you decide to go and try to pursue a bigger, higher rating?P04: So after that surgery, I filed again.P04: when they pulled the metal out, and I was like, see? Something's wrong, when they were like, oh, well, we'll… we'll… you're fine.P04: we're not gonna give you any rate increase, we're not gonna do any of that. And I was like, you know what? Screw it, I'm moving home.P04: So I moved back home to New Orleans, and I had a couple of job offers, and one was the hockey team, and I took it.P04: And I was working on concrete, you know, I was working… that's a hard…P04: Yeah. I'm working in an arena.00:10:24Kim: That is hard on your back.P04: It's very hard on it, and I was doing everything. You know, as a little minor league hockey team. I worked for my GM, I did everything. Accounting, website, I was that person. So, when it started hurting again, and I went to the VA,P04: That's when I got told to live with the pain.P04: And flipped them off and walked out, and went back to work, and my GM got me with our orthopedic surgeon for the team.P04: And I went to the head orthopedic surgeon at Tulane, and he was like, here's the surgery schedule, don't know how you're walking.P04: And I was like, oh, thanks, okay. So, I had that surgery, and I got better, obviously. And then my dad was dying.P04: And I decided to go for 100%.P04: Because my job was also trying to get me medically boarded to leave.00:11:12Kim: Okay. Just thinking about, like, the actual, like, the claim process during this time, that was… was that when you went to the VA?P04: Yes.00:11:22Kim: I'm sorry, the DAV?P04: AV after that last surgery.00:11:26Kim: They were gonna put me at 60%, and I was like, I can't work, y'all don't understand.P04: So it sounds like…00:11:34Kim: When you, so the first time you applied, they gave you 40%.P04: Yes.00:11:40Kim: And then it sounds like you went back and applied again by yourself?P04: Yep.00:11:45Kim: Okay, and do you know, was that… do you remember what kind of claim that was? Were you just asking them for an increase?P04: Yes. Peeling it… It was an increase. I was just asking for an increase.00:11:54Kim: Okay.P04: Never had to do an appeal.00:11:57Kim: Okay.P04: Because I was just like, oh well, I'll take it. Oh well, I'll take it.P04: I never actually fought it, I didn't know I could.00:12:06Kim: EAV do? Did they just ask for another increase, or how did… how did that work?P04: Yeah, he… yes. He… what he did was, he was like, I can't believe they're doing this to you. Like, here's all your cert… you know what I mean? Like, I had a file like this.P04: I've worked in healthcare, I have a copy of every… like, I am that person. And I just went, and he… I went and sat with him, and I was like, here.P04: here.00:12:28Kim: Yeah.P04: And he was like, oh… Okay, so because that office is right by the VA.P04: He hand-walked my file to the VA.00:12:39Kim: And sat with somebody, and said, nuh- you're disabling this girl.00:12:44Kim: Okay.P04: That's how I got it. He happened.00:12:46Kim: Okay.P04: It was the perfect storm.00:12:49Kim: So, it sounds like they didn't take you through any kind of formal appeal process, or…00:12:55Kim: Nope. I just…P04: No, I just went, okay, if that's what you say, that's what you say.00:13:01Kim: sharing all of that for background.00:13:07Kim: So, I'm gonna ask you a funny hypothetical. So, pretend that I'm a young person, I've just gotten out of the military, and I have a few health problems for my service, and I want to know how disability benefits works, what I'm supposed to do.00:13:24Kim: Can you explain it to me? Like, I don't know anything about it.P04: Yeah.P04: So you get, basically, like, a physical when you get out?P04: And that's what you leave with. That's like the documentation of, hey, you left with these issues.P04: So, to me, if they get worse, then you're supposed to…P04: listen to me and be like, hey, I got out with it at this level, but here's what it is. So for every… I tell every young person, because I live in an area with an Air Force base and a Navy base.P04: all, you know, right here, I tell people that when you get out, go straight to, like, DAV.P04: or a veteran's organization like that, and go sit down with somebody and have them explain the whole process. Because it changes… it does. To me, it changes with every political cycle, too. So I never know from one second to the next what we're gonna get. So, to me, the best thing to do is go sit down with a representative that's been trained.00:14:22Kim: So you can get the knowledge you need.00:14:24Kim: Okay.00:14:25Kim: And again, I'm this person that doesn't know anything. How does the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries?P04: percentages.00:14:33Kim: percentages.P04: Yeah, so it's 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. It goes by percentage based onP04: You know, how disabling it is, and how many different disabilities you have when you get out.00:14:48Kim: Thank you, and one… out of that scenario, one last question. Have you, are you at all familiar with the different ways that you can, like, actually appeal a VA decision?P04: Have you heard of… No clue.00:15:00Kim: Okay, alright. Great, thank you for all of that. We're gonna get into looking at the prototypes now.P04: Okay.00:15:07Kim: This is an hour and 15 minutes, do you need to take a break right now?P04: I'm fine.00:15:13Kim: Give me calm.P04: I'm gonna… look, and if you're okay with me coughing and taking an inhaler, then I'm good.00:15:18Kim: No problem.00:15:22Kim: Okay.00:15:23Kim: So we're gonna show you… there's two different prototypes. They kind of do the same thing, but the designs are a little bit different. Before we open them, I want you to know they're not the real website, they're only partially functional, they kind of jump around funny sometimes.P04: Okay.00:15:38Kim: And some parts are clickable, some parts are not clickable.00:15:41Kim: Because they are just a rough prototype, we've put in some dummy data. Okay. It's not connected to the real VA database, and nothing you do today is going to affect your VA benefits or your information at all. Okay, so I'm going to put a link to the prototype.00:15:58Kim: in the chat, and then after you open that, I want you to share your screen, so hang on. Open the Zoom chat. I'm going to paste this link in.P04: Okay.00:16:11Kim: Oh, wait a minute, I did that wrong, hang on.00:16:15Kim: I can handle the technology.P04: I don't know.00:16:19Kim: Maybe.P04: I think this is so cool!P04: And the fun part, too, is I have a little bit of a graphic design background, so this is really…00:16:28Kim: That'll be really interesting to hear your perspective.P04: Yeah, because of my logical brain, right? But then I'm trying to not think about it like that. Alright, let's see.00:16:36Kim: Yes.P04: Try to think about it as somebody that doesn't know this stuff.P04: Alright, I did the link.00:16:43Kim: Okay. So then, if you can share your screen so we can see what you're interacting with.P04: Alright, let's see… Let me get that back.P04: Alright, how do I share my screen? That's the question.00:16:59Kim: Okay, so if you go back to Zoom.P04: Guests.00:17:02Kim: So, there's a button, it's a green button with an arrow on it.P04: earnings. I got it.P04: Desktop on Firefox.P04: Hmm…00:17:19Kim: Is it asking you what you want to share?P04: Yeah…00:17:23Kim: It should show you a picture of that window with the prototype in it.P04: Yeah, it's not.00:17:28Kim: Hmm.P04: It's showing me Desktop 1, Firefox, System Preference. Let me close some stuff out. But see, I use Firefox, too. Does that matter?00:17:36Kim: It shouldn't matter.P04: Okay, cool.P04: Alright, let me close some of this stuff out first.P04: And let's see if that makes it easier.P04: Alright, so you're on… Zoom… it should be desktop 1.P04: Something with my security and privacy. Alright, let's see…P04: Share… Content background.P04: What in the world? Yeah, it's telling me to open my system preferences, so…00:18:24Kim: Okay.P04: I'm trying to see what it wants me to do here.00:18:27Kim: Yeah, it may ask you to, like, leave.P04: Oh, there we go.00:18:31Kim: Nope.P04: Alright, you will not be able to record the content of your screen until it is quit. You can choose quit. I guess it wants me to quit Zoom and go back in again.00:18:40Kim: Yeah, that's fine, just come on back.P04: Okay, alright, let me do that, and I'll be right back.00:18:45Kim: Yours!00:19:05Kim: Hey, Maddie, I'm actually gonna, since she has filed before, I'm gonna start with banana.Madeline Fritz: Okay.00:19:16Kim: The roster said something different.00:19:40Kim: Cheers.P04: Try this again.P04: Alright, let's see… Recordings…P04: Well, where the heck?P04: Gershire, okay.P04: Alright, I think we got it.00:20:14Kim: I see a desktop.P04: Alright, so… Let me go back to the chat.P04: Let's see… Can you see?00:20:26Kim: Dang!00:20:27Kim: I see the zoom… oh, there we go!P04: There we go. Alright, now we're… That's the prototype. Perfect.P04: You don't want to see my bills, do you? Alright. There we go.00:20:39Kim: All right. Okay. Okay. So, so you're kind of an imaginary veteran, and we have imaginary data in here, but, for this session, imagine that you have a few different health conditions that you want to get disability benefits for. You've come to the VA website today to apply online.00:20:58Kim: And as I mentioned, as you click through this prototype, you're going to see some dummy data for an imaginary veteran.00:21:05Kim: This imaginary veteran is already receiving disability benefits for a few different conditions. Their data is not going to match yours.00:21:12Kim: But I want you to imagine that you really are this person, and tell us what you would do as if this were your real situation.00:21:19Kim: And also, as you use the prototype, if you can kind of think out loud, so we can understand how it's working for you.P04: Right, okay, makes sense.00:21:28Kim: All right, great. So go ahead and click, Prototype Banana.P04: Okay.00:21:35Kim: And so this is gonna open eventually. Did the screen show up for you? There it goes.P04: Yeah, I was trying.00:21:44Kim: Yeah, no worries. Sometimes it starts off kind of slow.00:21:53Kim: So, you've already started this application.00:21:56Kim: And so, for the first scenario, let's say that you have started having arthritis in your shoulder that you think is because of an injury you had while in service.P04: Okay.00:22:06Kim: How would you ask for disability compensation for that? And use this screen.P04: Alright, let's see…00:22:16Kim: So you've already logged in and started the application. Okay, I'm gonna read it.P04: Decline your channel.P04: So, I would hit continue.P04: And I would think that I would then add each disability I want to add in that way.00:22:33Kim: Okay, go ahead and click continue.P04: Okay.00:22:41Kim: Oh, you know, sometimes it's weird when it gets to the bottom with those other.P04: Yeah, it's a little arrow, there we go. The arrow's kinda in the…00:22:47Kim: Scroll down a little.00:22:50Kim: On the, just over the prototype.P04: Yeah, let me move that, and then… there we go.P04: Nope, I didn't.00:22:58Kim: Go ahead and scroll down a little on the prototype.P04: Alright, let's see, I think… There you go. Okay, gotcha.00:23:06Kim: I had this problem, too.P04: Yeah.00:23:10Kim: So tell me what you're noticing as you look through this screen.P04: Add a condition, what would you like to add? Which I have to do, because it's required.P04: Choose one. We will return to the screen later. A condition I haven't claimed.P04: So, I'm already rated for these things.00:23:30Kim: For which things?P04: For knee replacement, migraine, tinnitus, hypertension, those are already my ratings.P04: Now, my shoulder hurts.00:23:39Kim: Yep.P04: And I haven't been denied, so I'd go to a condition I haven't claimed before.00:23:44Kim: Okay.P04: That's super neat.00:23:46Kim: Okay.P04: I like it.00:23:48Kim: Without clicking anything.P04: Huh.00:23:51Kim: I want to give you, a different… a new… another scenario.P04: Okay.00:23:56Kim: Okay, so this one, about 5 years ago, or actually, first, have you ever heard of the PACT Act?P04: Oh, yeah.00:24:04Kim: Okay.P04: I'm very well versed in PACT Act.00:24:07Kim: Okay, so let's pretend you applied for asthma about 5 years ago.P04: Okay.00:24:13Kim: But the VA turned down your requests because they didn't think it was caused by your military service. But, since the PACT Act was passed, you have learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition.P04: Okay. Under the PACT Act, and you think the VA should give you benefits for it.P04: Sure.00:24:30Kim: So, you are going to reapply for asthma. Tell me what you would do from this screen.P04: That's a hard one.P04: Because the VA denied it.P04: But then this is a new program, so it's technically a new condition under a different program.00:24:45Kim: Okay.P04: So I don't know, I think I would probably do…P04: I'd call, because I wouldn't know what to do.00:24:52Kim: Okay. I feel like…P04: Old is it not? I don't know what to do.00:24:56Kim: So go ahead and just kind of look through the options on the screen and talk me through, like, maybe this would work, maybe this wouldn't work.P04: So, I would want to do a condition I haven't claimed before.00:25:07Kim: Okay.P04: But for my logic, that means I'm starting a whole new process, and it's gonna take a lot longer.00:25:13Kim: Hmm.P04: And I have more to prove.P04: Whereas if I could go to a condition that they denied before, I could do that and say, but here's more information, you need to reevaluate it, without starting it all over again.00:25:28Kim: So what's going through your head as you try to decide between those two options?P04: Which one's gonna actually work and get somebody to listen?00:25:38Kim: All right. So, let's say you wanted to try to figure this out on this forum online without calling somebody. What would you actually do?P04: I would… hmm… I would do the one that they denied before.00:25:56Kim: Okay, why don't you go ahead and try that?P04: Okay.P04: What condition would you like? Okay, wait, did it… I don't think it did it.00:26:09Kim: Oh, you know what, scroll down again. It did a funny jump.P04: Oh, there we go. Okay, so I see what you're saying, it jumps, okay. Yeah. There we go. Okay, you can appeal a denied claim.P04: Through supplemental, if you have new and relevant.P04: Oh, a change in the laws made your con… oh…P04: Meaning, we presume your service caused your condition.P04: What condition would you like to file?P04: Okay.P04: So I would go asthma.00:26:38Kim: Alright, so tell me, what do you think about the information on this screen?P04: I love… this is easy.P04: This is… this is really, really easy.P04: And I like that it's got even when I… it denied me.00:26:52Kim: You mean the date?P04: Yeah, like, it's got the date of when and everything, yeah, so I don't have to be confused.00:26:57Kim: But then, the only thing that…P04: What confuses me is the change in the law.P04: Because, is that really a law?P04: the PACT Act?00:27:11Kim: Oh, interesting. Okay, so you… it's not… you're not sure if the PACT Act is actually a law, so does that… does that apply as a change in the law?P04: Okay. Right. Even though it's an act.P04: And I know it got passed through Congress, I know that, but some people might not know that.00:27:28Kim: Okay.P04: Yeah, that's a… that's a good point. I know that, because I pay attention, but younger people might not have a clue.00:27:35Kim: Okay.P04: Act as a law.00:27:36Kim: Okay.00:27:37Kim: How does… with this imaginary scenario with the asthma, how does the information on the screen relate to your scenario?P04: To me, right now.P04: Oh, this would make it a lot easier for me to know what to do to try to redo my claim.P04: to get additional… you know, to get re-rated, this would… I would never call if I had this available.00:28:02Kim: Okay.P04: It's all right there.00:28:05Kim: Okay.P04: And that was when, you know, where I was kind of confused, well then, well, you did get denied, so…P04: This makes it easy, I would just click Asma.00:28:17Kim: Okay, so, go ahead and do that. Okay.00:28:27Kim: Jumped again, sorry about that.P04: Alright.P04: You can submit a supplemental claim if you disagree.P04: And you meet one of these, or you have a new evidence.P04: You'd like us to review? Oh, based on a new law, such as a PACT Act. Here's what we mean.P04: New evidence, information we haven't considered before.P04: Me. Relevant evidence, yes.P04: You can upload evidence, okay.00:28:57Kim: So, tell me what you think about the information here.P04: I think it's awesome.P04: I mean, I don't know how it could be any clearer.P04: You submit a… you're doing a supplemental claim. You know, the only thing I would say?P04: is if somebody is reading this and doesn't know what a supplemental claim means. Okay. Is there a way to make a hyperlink to read that?00:29:18Kim: That's a good, good idea. Have you ever heard that term, supplemental claims?P04: No, I don't… I know what it means from working in hospitals, but VA-related, I do not.00:29:27Kim: Okay. Just out of curiosity, what does it mean from a working in the hospital perspective?P04: That means that somebody's putting additional evidence to try to give more… it's a supplemental info. Here's more info, because I have new documentation.00:29:42Kim: Okay, okay. So that sounds like what the VA supplemental claim is.P04: Okay.00:29:48Kim: But is that… is that from, like, a different insurance company or something, or…P04: No, that's just me working in hospitals to know that.00:29:55Kim: Okay, interesting. Okay, so which pieces of information on the screen relate to this specific scenario that we're talking about with your asthma?P04: You'd like to review your claim based on a new law, such as the PACT Act.00:30:12Kim: Wait, so what would you do next?P04: In step 4 of this form, you can upload your evidence, or identify evidence you'd like to gather for us. Okay, so…00:30:25Kim: What's going through your head as you read that?P04: I'm wondering, because I want it to be reviewed under the PACT Act.P04: then I… I'm not really doing new or relevant evidence.00:30:38Kim: So…P04: That's the first part of it.P04: I don't really see anything that shows me what to do if I'm doing backpack.00:30:46Kim: Okay, that's… yeah, yeah, I can see that.00:30:48Kim: Alright, that's, that's really good feedback on this.00:30:52Kim: So what would you do now?00:30:56Kim: I would just keep going and hoping I was doing it the right way. Okay.00:31:01Kim: What would you click on?P04: I would go to continue.00:31:06Kim: Okay, do you have any idea what you might expect to happen next?P04: I'm… I'm guessing that I'm gonna be given the opportunity to upload new stuff or fill something out with the information for the VA to get new documents.00:31:21Kim: Gotcha. Okay, so go ahead and click continue.P04: Okay.P04: Scroll down a little, there you go.P04: Alright, you were denied supplemental claim based on new or relevant evidence or change in the law, okay?P04: Do you have another condition to add? No?00:31:43Kim: What… so what do you think… tell me what you think about this screen. What's going on here?P04: It's saying that what the VA is gonna do isP04: do a supplemental claim, because I have new evidence, or a change in the law, even though I was denied in 2014.00:32:06Kim: Alright!00:32:07Kim: And what do you think about the information that it's showing you?P04: I just wonder exactly If there's something after this that's gonna tell me what that means.00:32:17Kim: Okay. And, tell you what witch means.P04: What happens with the sub, the supplemental claim? Whether it's relative or a change in the law, what's the next step in the process?00:32:29Kim: Okay.00:32:30Kim: Alright, let's say you have…00:32:33Kim: Another health condition you want to add, What would you do next?P04: I would go to yes, add a new one.00:32:40Kim: Okay, go ahead.00:32:48Kim: Alright, for this next scenario, Let's say,00:32:53Kim: Actually, before we get into that, I have some questions about this screen.00:32:58Kim: Can you scroll down just a little bit? Yep.00:33:01Kim: Where do you think this list of all the different options came from?P04: from my VA file?00:33:11Kim: And what do you think about how they're organized?P04: Well, my logical brain would like to see the higher percentage on top.00:33:26Kim: You want to see the higher percentage?P04: Yeah, I would rather see what… what I'm more disabled for, like, what's the one I might need to work on. Like, if my.00:33:34Kim: Okay.P04: is getting worse, and I'm at 0%.P04: Then I went down to the bottom and went, oh yeah, that's the least one, that's the one… yeah, I'm gonna do that one.00:33:42Kim: Okay.00:33:44Kim: And from… on this screen, which are the things that the VA is currently giving you compensation for?P04: Knee migraine hypertension.00:33:56Kim: Alright, let's go back, let's do another scenario. In this case, about 3 years ago, you got rated for hypertension, but in the last month, you feel like the hypertension's gotten worse, and you want to try to get a higher rating. What would you do?P04: Hmm.P04: So this is just to add a condition. This isn't to… Add more to a condition.00:34:30Kim: Oh, that's interesting.00:34:32Kim: What does add a condition mean to you?P04: I have a brand new one that I need.00:34:37Kim: Okay.P04: Garden.00:34:39Kim: Okay.P04: Like, to… yeah, it would be… I would…P04: I would look at these and go, oh, okay, well, I'm already rated on these.P04: So if I need to add a new one, it needs to be a new part of my body that I have a problem with.P04: Man, this… wow. I didn't realize this much went into this.00:35:01Kim: How do you mean?P04: Like, y'all have a lot… they have… those software designers, people… like, I'm one of the ones that, like, oh, the VA is so antiquated, right? Like, when you're in the hospital.00:35:13Kim: Yeah.P04: hospital and that system that they use. But now I'm sitting here going, whoa, y'all got a lot going on in the background when you're designing this stuff.00:35:21Kim: Oh, there's a lot you can do on the website now.P04: That's crazy.P04: So…P04: Yeah, I wouldn't know what to do.P04: I guess I would just do…P04: See, to me, it would be…P04: My brain thinks that it would be edit current disability, you know what I mean? Or edit current rating. If I wanted to go back to hypertension, I would want that to say that I'm trying to edit my current rating, not.00:35:56Kim: start reading.00:35:58Kim: Not adding a condition.P04: Yes. Okay. I need to work on what I already have.00:36:03Kim: If the title, instead of just saying add a condition, if it said, add a condition to your claim.00:36:10Kim: Would that mean something different?P04: No.00:36:14Kim: Okay.P04: No.P04: Cause to me, that is my claim.P04: if I'm trying to get tinnitus… if I'm trying to get my hypertension changed.P04: then… I have to start a new claim on it.00:36:30Kim: Okay. Not true.00:36:32Kim: Okay, so…00:36:35Kim: So, in this situation, you want to get a higher rating for hypertension. What would you do at this point, if this were really your situation?P04: I guess I'd pick the hypertension one and just see what it did.00:36:51Kim: Stop.P04: So yeah, that's what I would do. Because it's not a new condition.P04: Because I've already claimed it, so it's not new.P04: So yeah, I would click hypertension and just see what happened.00:37:06Kim: Go ahead and try that.P04: Alright.P04: How do you want to… you can file a claim for an increase if your condition has worsened, or file a supplemental claim if you disagree with our asset.P04: See, it all? It gets explained right there.P04: The screen before, I still wouldn't have known that it was gonna get explained to me.00:37:35Kim: Got it, okay.P04: And then my condition got worse, so I need to apply for an increase.P04: because I'm not appealing anything, I'm… it's got worse. In the last month, it's gotten worse.00:37:49Kim: Okay. Can you tell me what you think the difference between these two options is?P04: One is, I have hypertension, and y'all told me that you weren't going to disable me for it, so I need to start a new rating. But if I already have the rating, and it's getting worse, then I need to just do an increase.00:38:08Kim: Okay.P04: Which is exactly… what I had to do before.P04: Right, that's right. Yeah.00:38:14Kim: Is there anything that's unclear or confusing on the screen?P04: file a supplemental claim if you disagree with our assessment. That is… I'm appealing a previous rating and have new, relevant evidence.00:38:34Kim: Is that what you think it means?P04: No. Because to me, they're not the same thing.00:38:41Kim: Tell me more about that.P04: I think that as veterans, we get… like, even though I've been out of the military for 30 years, like, it gets embedded in us, right? Certain words?P04: So… A supplemental claim does not mean that I'm appealing previously.P04: Like, if those two sounded together more cohesive, I think that'll explain it better.00:39:11Kim: Okay, like, the appealing and the supplemental claim, putting those Together.P04: Confusing to me, yes.00:39:16Kim: Okay. Okay.00:39:18Kim: Right.P04: We know an appeal is you got a rating, and now you don't agree with it, so you're gonna appeal it.00:39:25Kim: Okay.00:39:26Kim: But then you… instead, we use the word supplemental claim, and that's not as clear, is what it sounds like. Is that right?P04: So, but a supplemental claim, let me get it right, means that I'm gonna…P04: I want you to re-rate me for this disability.P04: So… See, my generation of VA is you either get re-evaluated, or you redo your claim.P04: Instead of supplemental claim. I think that supplemental is what's… Confusing.00:39:57Kim: Yeah, that's totally understandable.P04: What does supplemental mean? I don't get supplemental anything. I'm 100% disabled. There's nothing supplemental in my life.00:40:08Kim: Okay.00:40:09Kim: So what I'm hearing from you is that the word appeal is a lot more clear than the word supplemental claim.P04: Yes.00:40:16Kim: Okay. Okay, great. That is super, super helpful.P04: I like supplemental Claim, because it sounds more like the real world.00:40:23Kim: Yeah, and that being…P04: Adding more evidence.00:40:29Kim: Okay.00:40:30Kim: Yep, yep, yep. Okay. Alright, so, which one did you say you would choose in this situation with the hypertension?P04: My condition got worse.00:40:41Kim: Okay, so go ahead, go ahead and do that.P04: Okay.P04: Hypertension. When did your condition get worse? You can share an approximate date.P04: If your back pain started in the winter of 2020.00:40:59Kim: Let's say it just got worse, like, recently, like, last month.P04: Okay.P04: So, I would put… that date.00:41:07Kim: Okay, and you can go ahead and start typing, and it's… because it's a prototype, it kind of does it by magic.P04: Okay. Let's just go… October.00:41:16Kim: I'm for you.P04: Yeah, that was easy.00:41:20Kim: Yeah.P04: So the only thing that confuses me, it does say back pain.00:41:26Kim: Okay.P04: Not.00:41:28Kim: Right, which is not your… not your condition.P04: That's right, not mine. Okay.00:41:32Kim: Yep.P04: So, let's pretend it's my condition.00:41:34Kim: Okay.P04: Alright.00:41:41Kim: So, tell me what you think is happening on this screen.P04: Oh, review conditions, it's gonna go over all my conditions.P04: Oh, I… whoa, I like this.P04: This is cool.P04: So I can see that I did a supplemental claim based on new evidence for a loss on asthma, but then hypertension, I'm getting worse, so I want y'all to claim an increase for that. That's good.P04: I like the way it differentiated that.P04: And do I…00:42:16Kim: One more… sorry, go ahead.P04: And do I have another condition to add?00:42:19Kim: One more condition to add.P04: Yep.00:42:21Kim: So… What would you do?P04: I think we've done them all, right? We did hypertension, we did asthma.00:42:30Kim: And there's… there's one more thing I want you to add to the… one more condition you have to add.P04: Okay.P04: So I'm gonna go add a condition.00:42:38Kim: Okay.P04: What can.00:42:45Kim: Okay, before you click on anything, I want to ask you a couple questions about this screen.00:42:51Kim: Go ahead and take a look. Tell me if you notice anything that's changed since the first time you saw the screen.P04: A condition I haven't cleaned.P04: It got… the ratings got switched by numerical.00:43:07Kim: Oh, they did? Oops. Okay, that is a mistake in our prototype.P04: Okay.P04: That's what I notice.00:43:14Kim: Okay, the ratings got switched, okay.P04: I was like, man, y'all are good, you did that that fast, how'd you do that?00:43:22Kim: Which rating got switched?P04: It's now in numerical order. But wait, one's missing.P04: I think.P04: Yeah.P04: Oh.P04: Oh, the two that we did are gone.00:43:38Kim: Okay.P04: That's cool, so I can't mistakenlyP04: open a claim on one I already opened a claim on. It's only giving me the options for what I already have, or to do a new one.00:43:50Kim: Okay.P04: I can't go screw those up. I can't go edit them and mess them up.00:43:53Kim: Cool. Alright, so, we're gonna add… this is the last condition we're gonna add. This scenario is a little bit more complicated, so…00:44:03Kim: Imagine that about a year ago, you filed a claim for migraines, and the VA approved it, and they gave you a 10% rating.00:44:12Kim: That you believe they should have given you a higher rating.00:44:16Kim: And now you want the VA to reconsider their 10% and see if they'll give you more. So you went back to your employer, and you got them to write a letter about how many times you had to miss work because of your migraines, going all the way back to that time when you first filed the claim a year ago.00:44:33Kim: And you think this letter is going to help prove that your migraines were more severe than the VA thought they were.P04: Okay.00:44:40Kim: Do you have any questions about that scenario? Nope.00:44:43Kim: Okay, so what do you think your options would be to ask the VA to reconsider their 10% rating decision?P04: Well, I would definitely choose Migraine headache on this screen.00:45:03Kim: Okay.P04: Because it's not a new claim.P04: And I wasn't denied, I got 10%, so I need to… I'm picking this…P04: Because again, let me go up. Adequacy, I still don't like that out of condition.P04: confuses me.P04: I'mma go to Migraine Headache, Because I want to be able to add information to it.00:45:29Kim: Okay.P04: It's just that out-of-condition thing that throws me for a loop.00:45:32Kim: Tripping you up, yeah.00:45:33Kim: If you… so once you click on migraine, what do you expect would happen next?P04: I'm expecting it's gonna give me an area to upload a document.00:45:45Kim: Go ahead and click on that.P04: Okay.00:45:48Kim: Click continue.P04: You can file a claim for an increase if you worsen or a supplemental claim if you disagree with our assessment.P04: Is that the same way that was worded before?00:46:06Kim: When you were doing, hypertension?P04: Yeah.00:46:09Kim: Yeah, yep.P04: Well, now it's starting to make a lot more sense.00:46:20Kim: Sorry about that.P04: Yeah, like, that right there makes a lot of sense. Okay, so my condition got worse, I'm applying for an increase.P04: Wait.P04: I'm appealing my previous rating, and I have new and relevant evidence.P04: It did get worse.P04: So I want to increase, but what matters here is that I have new evidence.P04: And I think that's the important thing, because they need to look at the evidence that I need to give them. So I'm… I'm appealing.00:46:51Kim: Okay. So tell me, what's kind of going through your head as you're looking at these different options?P04: Well, I already have a 10%.P04: And it got worse, so I really want to increase. But then, if I do that, is it gonna ask me forP04: Documents to prove it.P04: So, I'm thinking, no, I'm appealing it because it says I have new, relevant evidence.00:47:15Kim: What's…P04: A letter from my doctor.00:47:17Kim: Okay.00:47:19Kim: And what do you think is the difference between00:47:23Kim: If you have any idea of the difference between applying for an increase versus appealing it with new and relevant evidence.P04: So, for me, and…P04: when you're applying for a new one, the VA then has to go get all your documents from doctors.00:47:37Kim: You start it all over again. We're peeling it, and you have a new document.P04: Hey, this is my already open claim.P04: Or my claim, I got 10%, but I want to send you something new.P04: to show that it's gotten worse. So it's kind of the same thing to me.P04: Kind of the same thing.00:47:57Kim: Okay, so, what… which one would you pick in this case?P04: because it says new relevant evidence, I'd take the appeal.P04: Okay, so go ahead and do that.P04: You can file a claim.00:48:15Kim: It jumped again, back to the top.P04: You see me sitting there reading it, like.00:48:19Kim: But I know.00:48:20Kim: Yeah. Okay.P04: You can submit a supplemental claim if you disagree with our previous decision on your claim, and you meet one of these, new and relevant, or PAC Act.P04: Here's what we mean by new. Okay, so we're going back. New. Information we haven't considered relevant.P04: Proves or disclaims.P04: Step 4 of this form, you can upload evidence. Okay.P04: So, I am definitely gonna hit continue.P04: Because I want to go to step 4 to give you my document.00:48:52Kim: Okay, go ahead and do that.P04: Nope.P04: Asthma, hypertension, migraine.P04: Supplemental claim based on new relevant evidence or change in law.P04: Okay, so that's the same as the asthma.P04: Okay.00:49:18Kim: What do you think about the…00:49:20Kim: Detailed information under each of these.00:49:23Kim: conditions.P04: I like it.P04: I just wish… I wish that PAC… that PAC Act could be its own thing.00:49:34Kim: Oh, how do you mean?P04: Like, I would… if I'm looking at this right now, supplemental claim based on new, relevant evidence or a change in law.P04: it's… I would like that to say that just changing law. Like, it would be easier for me to figure out what… migraine saying the same thing is confusing, because that one's not the law.00:49:56Kim: Okay.P04: without me actually going, hey, my migraines are worse. There's no law that's gonna help me through that.00:50:02Kim: Okay. Do you have any idea why it says the same thing under asthma and migraines?P04: I don't.00:50:10Kim: Does it vote? No, I don't.P04: Because they're both nigh.00:50:17Kim: The asthma was denied, and the migraines was approved, but at 10%.P04: No, I don't.00:50:24Kim: And what about the difference between what it says under hypertension versus under migraines?P04: Hmm.P04: Golly… So, the hypertension one is… again, I got worse.P04: So I just want you to increase it.P04: But migraines is… There's new evidence. That confuses me.00:50:54Kim: Yeah, it's really… it's a very subtle difference. We're trying to figure out how to work around it, so it's…00:51:01Kim: Everyone's getting confused.P04: That's hard!00:51:04Kim: It is hard. All right, let's keep moving. Let's say this… that you've added all the conditions you want to.P04: Okay.00:51:13Kim: You're ready to move on with the rest of this form, what would you do?P04: I don't have any other conditions to add.00:51:20Kim: Okay, so go ahead and do that.00:51:23Kim: And we are going to switch to a different prototype.P04: Okay, just hit continue.00:51:28Kim: Yep.P04: Alright?00:51:32Kim: Okay, so we just did banana. We're gonna switch over to Apple. We're gonna do the same scenarios, and there's just a little… it's a little bit of a different design.P04: Okay.00:51:42Kim: So go ahead and click Prototype Apple.00:51:50Kim: So, our first scenario is that you have started getting arthritis00:51:55Kim: And your shoulder, you think is caused by an injury in service?00:52:01Kim: And you want to ask for disability compensation for that.P04: Okay.00:52:05Kim: Excuse me.P04: Alright.00:52:08Kim: Go ahead and show me what you would do.P04: Add disabilities and conditions. On the following screen, it'll ask you about discipline you're claiming.P04: After each ad… after each, we'll ask this… oh!P04: Okay.P04: I like this.00:52:24Kim: What parts do you like about it?P04: I feel like you're telling me what's about to happen, and I know what to expect.P04: I'm not going in blind, I'm like, oh, okay, you're gonna actually help me do this.00:52:35Kim: Alright, so what would you do now?P04: I'm gonna hit continue.00:52:38Kim: Go ahead.00:52:42Kim: Okay, without clicking on anything, tell me… go ahead and look at the screen.00:52:47Kim: Tell me, and you're, you're trying to… you want to claim this arthritis in your back.00:52:53Kim: How would you do that?P04: I would go…P04: I would have to do a condition I haven't claimed before, because…P04: None of those are the same.00:53:07Kim: Okay.00:53:08Kim: And what was going through your mind as you tried to figure out which one to choose?P04: Well, one, it would be new, so going to… it's not denied, because I never filed it.P04: And I already have those rated.P04: So, it is a condition I have never claimed before.00:53:30Kim: Okay. So that's good. Let's… we're not going to do that scenario, I want to move to the second one.P04: Okay.00:53:37Kim: Which is, if you remember, your asthma was denied 5 years ago, but with the PACT Act, do you think they should give it to you now?P04: Okay.00:53:45Kim: What would you do?P04: I'm going sleep ap- er, I'm going asthma. Denied asthma.00:53:51Kim: And what do you expect to happen?00:53:56Kim: After you select asthma.P04: that somehow the software knows that I haven't done it, and it's gonna help me do it properly.00:54:04Kim: Okay, go ahead and click on… go ahead and click on that.P04: Okay, asthma?P04: And…P04: You can submit a supplemental claim if you disagree with our previous decision.P04: You have new or relevant.P04: You'd like us to review it based on the PACT Act.P04: Here's what we mean by new and relevant.P04: Info we have in… information that's new. Step 4, you can upload evidence or identify evidence you'd like us to gather for… Oh, yeah, this is… I like this. This is already getting better. See that right there? Evidence that you'd like us to gather for you?P04: Changes everything, for me.P04: Sir.00:54:48Kim: Tell me, tell me why.P04: Because I…P04: the way I know the rating is, again, you get rated, or you get re-rated, or re-evaluated. So this is telling me right away thatP04: Information that proves or disapproves something in your claim.P04: And that you'd like us to review it based on a new law, like the PAC Act.00:55:14Kim: Okay.P04: and then being able to uplude the evidence, or identify evidence you'd like us to gather. That right there made me feel like I am… I am in control of it, and I wasn't before.P04: Oh, interesting. Because if…P04: I don't want to wait on… I am never gonna wait on the VA to get me documents.P04: from my doctors, because… and it's not the VA, it's doctors' offices, too, and how terrible… I don't… it's…P04: It's too long. I'd rather just get the stuff and upload it myself, and that way I know it got done right.00:55:49Kim: Okay.P04: So, I like the way this is worded, because I feel like I can… I know I'm gonna be able to do that.00:55:55Kim: Okay.00:55:57Kim: Alright, what would you do next?P04: Alright, let's see…P04: Supplemental claim if you disagree. And what I like about this is I now understand a little bit more of what a supplemental claim is.P04: telling me that if I disagree with a decision, and I meet one of these, I can do this. So I'm… okay, I got… I got asthma.P04: I want to go under the PAC Act. So this is telling me, one, what a supplemental claim is. I'm gonna go on, because I feel like it's giving me every bit I need to know.P04: I feel like that's very informative.00:56:35Kim: What do you think will happen next after you click continue?P04: I'm not… I don't know when I'm gonna get the stuff for… oh, well, this is…P04: Is this step 2? Because it says 2 up top, 2 of 6?00:56:50Kim: Is that what it looks like to you?P04: I'm wondering, because it says 2 of… yeah, I would think that step 4 would go up to number 4 up there.00:56:58Kim: Okay.P04: So as I'm clicking through, I'm going, oh, that's gonna be a 4, and that's when I'm gonna do that.00:57:03Kim: Okay. What do you think about that?P04: I like it like that, it makes it very simple.00:57:09Kim: So let's go ahead and keep moving.P04: If it said step by it, it would… if that is what it is, and it just said step by it, then yeah.00:57:17Kim: It'd be more clear.P04: Yep.00:57:19Kim: Yeah, that makes sense.P04: Alright, review your condition. You were denied…P04: Supplemental claim based on new or relative evidence, or change in law. Yes.P04: And see, that's really easy.P04: Change in law.P04: Because I didn't know what that was, PAC Act, as a young person.P04: That's gonna make more sense.P04: Alright, so review your conditions.P04: Do you have any other conditions to add? No.00:57:50Kim: So, let's add… let's say you want to get, same as you did before, an increase for your hypertension rating.P04: Okay.00:57:57Kim: What would you do here?P04: I would do another condition to add, even though it still is confusing to me, because it's not.00:58:04Kim: the word add.P04: I'm not really adding, I'm editing it, I'm adding two.P04: Okay. The claim.P04: I think that's the way…P04: If it was said to me like that, that I'm editing a current Claim or denial?P04: Then it would make more sense.00:58:28Kim: Okay. Okay.P04: We can, we can… We're gonna do another condition.00:58:34Kim: Yeah.P04: Alright, and we're doing… Do you say…00:58:42Kim: So, yeah, before you click on this.00:58:46Kim: I have some questions about this screen.00:58:50Kim: Where do you think this list of options came from?P04: My, my VA5.00:58:56Kim: Okay.00:58:57Kim: And what do you think about how this screen is organized?P04: Again, I like it.P04: Because it's showing… What you're rated for versus what you're denied.P04: But I would just, again, like to see those, hey, stop, ratings in, order.P04: number order.P04: But other than that, I like this better.00:59:28Kim: You do tell me… tell me why.P04: I like knowing what I got denied for, so I know if it's a real claim, like, if I need to start a new one.P04: Or not, because I don't know anywhere, honestly, in my VA file right now, where I know a condition I've ever been denied for. I have no clue.00:59:44Kim: Okay.P04: So to be able to see that, I'd be like, oh, okay, cool, there is something else I can try to do.00:59:52Kim: Okay.00:59:55Kim: Alright, so you want to get an increase for your hypertension, what would you do?P04: I'm gonna click hypertension and continue.01:00:03Kim: Go ahead.01:00:13Kim: It jumped up again. Just gotta scroll down to get the continue. There you go.P04: There.P04: Alright, when did it get worse? So, same thing.01:00:22Kim: Yep.P04: Alright.P04: And then I'm gonna hit continue.P04: Alright?01:00:33Kim: Right.P04: Okay.01:00:35Kim: So…01:00:36Kim: Let's, let's, because we're about out of time, let's quickly keep going, and we're gonna add one more condition.P04: Okay.01:00:45Kim: So go ahead and click yes and continue.P04: Got it.01:00:51Kim: Okay, and then this last one, if you remember, you got rated 10% for migraines about a year ago, but you think the rating should have been higher, and you got a new letter from your employer.01:01:08Kim: So you wanna… you wanna ask them to look at that rating again for migraines.P04: Because it's a condition I have claimed before, I know I have to go to my rated disability and click it.01:01:24Kim: Okay.P04: Even though i t's still confusing, but the whole out-of-condition thing still jacks me up. But if you ignore that.P04: and ignore that, and knowing what I know, I'm like, oh, I already have it for a migraine, so I have to go.P04: My rated disability.01:01:39Kim: Okay.P04: Click on that.01:01:41Kim: What do you expect to happen?01:01:43Kim: Next.P04: Tell me again if it's…P04: Did it get worse, so that's why I needed to… oh, no, I have that…01:01:59Kim: Hi!P04: script.01:02:00Kim: You think, when they originally rated you about a year ago, that they didn't evaluate it correctly, and they should have given you a higher rating back then?P04: Okay, so I'm definitely gonna have to click…P04: Migraine and hope that they're gonna ask me in some step.P04: to give my new documents or evidence, write it out, whatever. I need some kind of prompt to do that.01:02:25Kim: Okay.01:02:26Kim: So go ahead and click on migraines and continue.01:02:34Kim: Ayo.01:02:35Kim: Am I… Let me ask Maddie, am I giving the wrong direction here?Madeline Fritz: Yeah, so my… and Task 3 for Apple, this is, this is where we reroute to, Banana. We're just asking if we've noticed if anything's changed on the screen.01:02:53Kim: Oh, okay, so how do we get to… sorry, how do we get to the comparison screen?Madeline Fritz: So, if they, they can just click continue.01:03:01Kim: Okay.Madeline Fritz: From here.01:03:04Kim: Sorry.P04: Alright. Oh, there we go.01:03:06Kim: Okay, good. Thank you, Maddie, for rescuing me.01:03:09Kim: Okay, so I want to, stop here and ask you about the two different prototypes that you saw. Did you find one of them easier to use than the other?P04: Yeah, I definitely liked Apple, that was the second one, right?01:03:25Kim: Yes. Yeah, I liked Apple a lot better. Okay, and tell me why?P04: It gave me more of an idea of what was happening, instead of just assuming I knew what the heck I was doing.01:03:36Kim: Okay.01:03:37Kim: Can you click that third link that says comparison screen?01:03:43Kim: This is gonna pull up…01:03:46Kim: The main screen on each of these, so you can kind of refer to them.P04: Oh, cool.01:03:52Kim: In a moment.01:03:59Kim: Funny that this one takes a long time.P04: Yeah, it's a lot of data, I'm sure.01:04:04Kim: Actually, we've… I think we have apple is on the left, and bananas on the right.P04: Okay.P04: T.01:04:15Kim: So I'm curious what you think comparing these two screens.P04: Alright, let's see.P04: That's it, okay.P04: Well, for one, the one on the right, whichever one that is, looks so much better.P04: Like, I'm very visual because of, you know, the photography and…P04: I like neat and clean, and I can…P04: My first look at the one on the right, I'm like, oh, I can understand that better, just because it looks neater.01:04:44Kim: Okay.01:04:45Kim: So the one on the right is banana.P04: Okay.01:04:48Kim: Which was… The first one that we looked at.P04: That's right.P04: And I would like it even more if they put the denied claims underneath it.01:04:57Kim: Okay.P04: I just… visually, I like it, I don't like that it doesn't have the denied claimed. I think that is cool, because I don't think as veterans, we even know that there's that out there.01:05:08Kim: I gotcha. So you'd like to see, really, a combination of them, where… Yes. Okay.01:05:13Kim: And you like banana better, it sounds like, just because visually it seems a lot clearer.P04: Yes.01:05:19Kim: Okay.P04: Those little boxes make me go, oh, okay, on to the next one, oh, okay, on to the next one.01:05:28Kim: Any other differences between these two screens that.P04: This one is…01:05:33Kim: important to you?P04: This one, a condition the VA previously not denied.P04: Oh…P04: I just realized that that means there's other… that a condition that…P04: Previously denied is short for what was on the other screen to show it.P04: So, other than that… I don't see that much of a difference.01:06:05Kim: And what do you think about… on banana, it's just got that one option, but short for… on Apple, it lists the three out there?01:06:14Kim: the denied conditions.P04: Golly, this is hard.P04: Because now I see it being simple, Is probably easierP04: Because I literally am choosing something I haven't claimed, things that I have claimed, or something that I was denied. That…P04: It's probably better than saying, listed my denied conditions, because do I really need to see my denied conditions, or are you going to take me to a prompt to show them if I ask you for them?01:06:52Kim: And which one would work better for you?P04: I like…P04: now that we're sitting here talking about it, I like that it says a condition the VA previously denied without showing you.01:07:03Kim: Okay, and why is that?P04: Because it's not more information than what I need presently.01:07:11Kim: Okay.P04: If I need it, I'd like to have a place to get it, but I don't think that right now, I am… I want that.01:07:23Kim: Great, thank you for that. I'm gonna pause.P04: Okay.01:07:27Kim: And ask if either Maddie or Alicia, you have any follow-up questions.Madeline Fritz: None for me, none for me so far.Alicia Perry: Same, none… none here.01:07:46Kim: This is kind of on a slightly different topic, but,01:07:52Kim: There is a kind of condition, like, most disabilities are something, like, it happened in service, like, you broke your knee, and then…01:08:01Kim: that caused arthritis. You have arthritis in your knee, and you claim that disability, so it's kind of just…01:08:06Kim: It's pretty clear.01:08:08Kim: relationship there. Sometimes there's a kind of disability where, for example, maybe you hurt your knee.01:08:17Kim: And you got disability compensation for that. But, like, 10 years later, your knee is really stiff, and you start kind of, like, tweaking your shoulder because you're overcompensating, or your back, or something.01:08:28Kim: Have you ever heard of a situation like that?P04: Yes, because that's currently what I need to do disability for.01:08:41Kim: Oh.P04: That's exactly my problem. Okay. And mine is not just… like that.P04: I have… Central nervous system disorder from living in chronic pain for 30 years.01:08:58Kim: Okay.P04: Yeah, yeah. So I have… and it's… you can't just see that, right?P04: Like, that's not going, oh, my shoulder hurts now. Well, yeah, I'm… I have medical proof, for me, right now, that shows that all of this is connected.P04: But…P04: I don't even… that's my start right now, right? With what I'm doing is like, dang, how do I even start that?01:09:22Kim: Okay, so let's… let's look at these screens as if it was actually yours.P04: it'd be cool.01:09:28Kim: Because you like banana better, let's focus on banana on the right.01:09:32Kim: If this was your data, what do you think would be showing on this screen after you logged in?P04: I think it would show that I was… my current rating would be 100% for… back pain.01:09:47Kim: Okay.01:09:49Kim: And then, would there be anything else listed here?P04: I know at one point I got denied for knee pain.P04: Way back long ago, because my knees were… my knee was hurting so bad on the side of, you know, where my disc was gone in my back.P04: So I did get denied for that at one point.01:10:07Kim: Okay.01:10:08Kim: Okay, so…01:10:11Kim: Banana, it would have your back pain, and… but now you want to claim this central nervous system. Is that what you call it? Central nervous system problem? Yeah, yeah. Okay.01:10:22Kim: How would you do that on banana?P04: I would do that as a claim I haven't done before.01:10:27Kim: Okay.01:10:29Kim: Great, thank you, that was, that was super helpful.01:10:33Kim: Do you have any questions or comments for us before we wrap up?P04: This is huge. I want to wait, like, I don't want to wait… I don't even want to try to do this until y'all put all this stuff up on the website, because I'm literally stuck.P04: You know what I mean? It's… I'm going through these prompts of, you gotta fill out this book and that book, and I'm like, oh my god. Like, I have to be… I have to have a day where my head isn't hurting, you know, where I'm not super anxious, like, I have to be in the right peace of mind to sit there and even try to do it. Whereas if I had this, I'd be like, ugh.P04: Easy peasy.01:11:10Kim: Okay. Well, you should, you know, check out the website sometime, log in, take a look.P04: I'm going to, it's been a while, I need to do that.01:11:18Kim: I mean, there's definitely… this is just step two of the forum, there's, like, other steps you have to do, so…P04: Okay.01:11:24Kim: It's pretty straightforward.P04: I'm gonna… I'm gonna get on there today, actually, and start looking, and trying to figure out what I need to do.01:11:30Kim: Great! Well, I want to thank you so much for spending this time with us and sharing your thoughts, and this kind of feedback that you're giving us, like, we take it, we go back, we make changes, so it's super helpful.P04: I think.01:11:41Kim: Awesome. Yeah. And the last thing is, Perigian, the recruiting company, is gonna send you a thank you note.P04: Okay.01:11:49Kim: And they'll include a little blurb, that you can pass along to any other veterans you might know who might want to participate in this kind of study.P04: Okay.01:11:58Kim: Okay, because you're all…P04: Look, if this helps, and I look at it too, like, I'm the one, like, I have my peace of mind, right? But if there's, like, a 60-year-old PTSD guy that can't…P04: They need to have stuff streamlined, too, because sometimes people won't even file a claim, because they're just overwhelmed.P04: By the whole process. So having… this gives… this warms my heart, knowing at least the VA is trying to do something to make it a little bit better.01:12:23Kim: Oh, that's great to hear. Yeah, we're working hard on it.P04: I had no idea that y'all… that it was this much. This is cool. And I will tell other veterans, like, chill out a little bit, you know what I mean? Like, things are changing. You gotta give it time.01:12:37Kim: Awesome, that's great to hear. Well, thank you so much for your time.P04: Y'all very much.01:12:40Kim: Good rest of your day.P04: Okay, thank you!01:12:43Kim: Bye.P04: Bye!
