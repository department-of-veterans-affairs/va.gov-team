00:00:02Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:00:03Madeline - Moderator: So I've started recording, and I'd like to confirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today? P12: Yes. 00:00:10Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:00:12Madeline - Moderator: So, we are going to jump into the first part of the session. 00:00:15Madeline - Moderator: So, let's get started. I'd like to hear about your experience getting disability benefits, and since we might touch on some parts of your health situation, please know that you don't need to talk about any topics that you don't want to. What we're most interested in hearing is about your experience with the VA disability benefits process itself. P12: Okay. 00:00:36Madeline - Moderator: So have you ever filed for disability benefits? P12: Yes. 00:00:40Madeline - Moderator: And about how many times? P12: 5? 00:00:48Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:00:49Madeline - Moderator: And, how many disabilities has the VA approved? P12: They have approved. P12: Sorry, let me... 00:01:08Madeline - Moderator: And I'm curious, are you, logging into the site, or using the VA mobile app? P12: I'm, I'm writing, writing them down. 00:01:15Madeline - Moderator: Oh, okay. P12: I know I have the accurate number. 00:01:18Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay, thank you. P12: Five. 00:01:33Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. We've had folks both be like, hang on, let me go get my letter, let me go log in really quick to tell you. So thank you for, yeah, taking the time to give us an accurate number there. Can you tell us what those 5 are? P12: Yes. P12: PTSD. P12: migraines. 00:01:53Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Fibromyalgia. 00:01:55Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:01:56Madeline - Moderator: Restless Leg, and GERD. 00:01:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay, what was that last one? P12: a GERD. 00:02:02Madeline - Moderator: Okay And what... do you know what your overall disability percentage is? P12: It's 100%. 00:02:07Madeline - Moderator: 100%, okay. 00:02:09Madeline - Moderator: And now I'm curious about, your most recent experience with, when you applied for disability benefits. Could you just tell me kind of a general overview of what that was like? P12: Sure, the last one was, the GERD. P12: And air... actually, GERD slash IBS. So. 00:02:35Madeline - Moderator: I had to take it to the Board of Veteran Appeals, because it was denied at the local level. P12: Although it was a Gulf War presumptive condition. P12: And they just kept denying it, so we took it to the board, and after... P12: 4 years, I was granted. 00:02:55Madeline - Moderator: Okay, 4 years after the, like, the appeal process, or 4 years. P12: I just finished. 00:02:59Madeline - Moderator: application. After the appeal process. Okay. After I filed the appeal. Okay, okay. And, and it was just for that one disability, was the most recent. P12: Yes, ma'am. 00:03:10Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Yes. 00:03:11Madeline - Moderator: And so when you got ready to apply for that disability, what was going through your mind at the time? P12: Well, and play a dual role. P12: Because I am a VSO as well. P12: I know the law, I mean, I know, you know, the CFR, so I'm very familiar, but, you know, just as I help others, you know, with claims. P12: I know that sometimes P12: You... the local level just doesn't get it right, and it makes no sense, and you just have to go to the board and just wait. 00:03:50Madeline - Moderator: And... 00:03:52Madeline - Moderator: Okay, I'm gonna bookmark that you are an advise... you know, operate in advisory capacity, and just a few more questions to wrap up the, you know, this bit about your most recent... this most recent application experience. So how did you find out what the VA initially decided when you applied for the GERD? P12: I received the decision... are you mean, from the board? 00:04:14Madeline - Moderator: Or both. P12: Okay, from the board, I received an email saying that the decision had been made. P12: And then I subsequently, was able to check P12: And see that it was granted. 00:04:32Madeline - Moderator: And check by... how did you do that? Like... P12: VBMS. 00:04:38Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Okay. That was the initial one, and then, of course, my app. 00:04:43Madeline - Moderator: okay. 00:04:45Madeline - Moderator: And then, prior to the board, before you did the appeal process, how did you find out what VA decided when they initially denied it? P12: Decision letter. 00:04:57Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: In the mail. 00:04:58Madeline - Moderator: And do you remember what other kinds of things the letter told you? P12: It indicated... That I was granted, what percentage I was granted. 00:05:09Madeline - Moderator: Favorable findings. P12: List... it listed out the evidence, it listed my time in service. P12: And the effective date. 00:05:20Madeline - Moderator: Okay. And what caused your condition? P12: the GERD, or IBS, it was considered presumptive in Gulf War. 00:05:31Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and did the VA agree with that? P12: Yeah, they... yeah. 00:05:36Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:05:37Madeline - Moderator: And then, so, a question about your, you know, advisory capacity. I'm wondering if, you know. 00:05:44Madeline - Moderator: almost like a miniature roleplay. If you were to pretend that I'm a young veteran, just a couple years out of the military, and I've got a few health problems for my service, and I'm totally unfamiliar with VA disability benefits, how would you explain the steps of that process to me? P12: I would... well, as they initially come in. P12: We talk about, when they served. P12: You know, what occurred in service. P12: Then we talk about the current conditions. P12: then we talk about, you know, if it was war or presumptive conditions, then we'll go... I'll go over there, go over that list and ask them if they, you know, are experiencing any of those conditions. P12: If not, we try to... P12: I try to advise as to the best route to take if they do have evidence, or if they don't have evidence, so that we're not spinning our wheels. We want to get it right the first time. 00:06:48Madeline - Moderator: Hmm. P12: explain the whole process to them. You know, we file the claim, we, VA will automatically request copies of the medical records, if they have any pertinent records that we need to submit at that time, or shortly thereafter, you know, give them to me so I can get them uploaded quickly. P12: Let them know that they're going to be contacted for evaluations for each of the items that we're filing for, and then also, let them know P12: You know, when they go for the evaluations, be as honest and upfront as possible. P12: Once those results are turned back into the VA Processing Center. P12: And they will make a decision, and then P12: Then they will, submit a decision letter to the veteran by mail. 00:07:42Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and when you're, you know, kind of giving an overview of this process to folks, are there particular terms that are... seem to stick out as confusing or unclear to people, or things people, things that you say that 00:07:55Madeline - Moderator: Tend to usually get, like, a follow-up question back to you, like, what does that mean, or can you explain that again? P12: Oh, yes. 00:08:02Madeline - Moderator: Numero uno is service-connected. P12: When they are asked. P12: if they're service-connected, they automatically assume that... and this is... it's a lot of them, I'm not gonna say most of them. P12: But the majority of the people assume that we're saying, are they... P12: Have they been in the service? P12: Not, like, do they have a VA disability rating? 00:08:28Madeline - Moderator: So are they saying what? P12: Are you, are you receiving... are you service-connected? P12: And they're like, oh yeah, I was in the Army and such and such. And we're like, no, do you have a VA disability rating? P12: That's one of the number ones. A lot of times, they are extremely confused when we have already P12: submitted. P12: medical records to the VA. P12: I could see that they receive them, but then they receive another letter by mail saying, hey, you know, we need you to send... send in this, and I, you know, just try to, you know. P12: explain to them that it's their due diligence to... to allow you to submit any additional evidence before they, you know, render a decision. But it's... it's extremely confusing for them to get duplicate, P12: Request for medical records when they've already submitted them. 00:09:20Madeline - Moderator: Right, right. 00:09:22Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:09:23Madeline - Moderator: And do you help people with the appeals process at all, or any kinds of appeals? P12: I initiate the appeal, but we do not do the follow-through on that. That is, handled by the, regional office. 00:09:35Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and are there any terms in... when you start bringing up, hey, like, here's maybe some appeal options to you that they're... oh, what does that mean? P12: Oh, yes, so, a lot of times... well, if they're in the office, I will go over it with them, but if they're, you know, looking at it on their own, then they're gonna have questions about the options as far as, okay. P12: do I choose... do I choose a decision by the judge, or do I want to go in front of the judge, or will I have to go anywhere? Will this be in person? Yeah. 00:10:10Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so almost, like, kind of logistical questions, but, like, what's expected of me? P12: Yes, and I automatically tell them that, you know. P12: This is not a quick turnaround. It's, on average, you know, 4 years. P12: And as long as they're okay with that, then... then we move forward. 00:10:29Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:10:30Madeline - Moderator: And if they're... P12: of course, older, then I will... P12: Always request advanced, advanced docketing. 00:10:37Madeline - Moderator: Right, right. 00:10:38Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. Thank you for that. 00:10:41Madeline - Moderator: And then shifting back to your experience, because you've also... the GERD, most recent application you mentioned, you went through an appeal process, so, you know, you disagreed with the decision the VA originally made. 00:10:56Madeline - Moderator: Let's see... 00:10:59Madeline - Moderator: and you did make a... I mean, you did consider... you'd made a formal appeal because it went to a board. Do you know... was that a higher level review? P12: I... I did, supplemental, and then I did higher level, and then denied it higher level, like, within... P12: 30 days. P12: And I knew, I'm like, okay, We're going to the board. 00:11:21Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so you chased that all the way through. P12: Yeah. 00:11:24Madeline - Moderator: Okay. And, how did you find out each of those decisions, or each of those tiers? P12: Decision letter. 00:11:32Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. P12: Decision letter and, and, checking my app. 00:11:37Madeline - Moderator: And what kind of backup or documentation did you provide for, did you do the supplemental claim first? P12: Supplementals first, yes. 00:11:47Madeline - Moderator: Okay, yeah, so what kind of a, like, documentation did you provide when you, completed that. P12: I outlined, my Gulf War service. P12: outlined the CFR with the presumptive breakdown. P12: Those are the two things that I recall submitting, that first First time. 00:12:13Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and did you provide additional documentation as you pursued at each, like, appeal level? P12: No, I just, indicated that I was being treated for it at the local VA. 00:12:24Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. P12: That's one of the little blocks on the supplemental form, so... 00:12:30Madeline - Moderator: And then did you... I'm curious, because you do do advisory work in this realm, were there parts of the process that were confusing or unclear for you when you personally were going through it? P12: No ma'am. 00:12:44Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. 00:12:46Madeline - Moderator: And then another similar... since you went through a supplemental claim experience, another kind of miniature role play, imagine you were talking to a buddy who maybe just found out that the VA denied their claim, and they were thinking of appealing it. How would you explain, like, what the overview of the appeal process looks like? P12: Well, my first, my first, order of business is to... Review the decision letter. P12: Determine why it was denied, what was missing. P12: I look at the, the evidence section to see, make sure everything that P12: we submitted was listed in that evidence section in case the VA missed something. P12: And then I will... I'll look at the favorable findings. Okay, you have this, this, and this, okay, but you're missing this. So, we need to either, let's say, get a... a nexus letter to get this claim reopened, or if they're missing a diagnosis, okay. P12: you're missing a diagnosis. If you have a diagnosis, and it's maybe a private doctor, okay, we need proof of that so we can submit this, because we just... I mean, it's really simple, you just go through what's missing, and you try to provide the VA with what's missing. P12: And I explained to them, you know, it could take, I think, 180 days for a decision to be made, and that they may or may not be contacted for another eval. P12: But, this is... this is the next step, you know, it... P12: that we would take prior to going to, you know, taking it to a higher level, and I say, okay, if it's... if it's not here, and if it's denied the next go-round, then we have to go to the board. 00:14:34Madeline - Moderator: and then, is there any kind of... 00:14:38Madeline - Moderator: like, advice that you would give them? I know, you know, you overviewed a lot of, like, let's gather a lot of documentation, you know, make sure you've got... you're kind of building this case. Is there anything else that you would tell this person? P12: Supplementals... P12: Mmm... No, I guess maybe the biggest... sometimes, the biggest question will be. P12: They'll say appeal, they'll say, I want to appeal this, and then I'll explain to them P12: that, you know, there's a difference... there's... I mean, well, not say a difference, but there's steps to appealing, so we want to... we want to always try to get it granted at the local level before we go to the actual board, and so they seem to be okay with that. P12: I explained to them, supplemental. You can, you know, submit any evidence you want. Higher level, you can't, you know, you can't submit anything. P12: However, you do have the option, if you want to explain or go into more detail about your story, then you can, request an informal conference. 00:15:47Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Freed. 00:15:50Madeline - Moderator: And then, do you have any conditions that are rated at 0%? P12: Yes. 00:15:57Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and how did that happen? P12: The RLS... P12: They just gave me a zero. I mean, they didn't do any testing or anything, they just gave me a zero, and at that point, you know, I was... I was okay with it. I didn't want to... I didn't feel like fighting it. They didn't do any type of a sleep study to test. P12: how many times I was, you know, kicking or anything at night, they just granted a zero. So I just was like, okay, whatever. 00:16:27Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, and same thing, in your own words, how would you explain that there could be a disability rated at 0%? 00:16:34Madeline - Moderator: Oh, yeah, that's a good one. P12: So, I... I mean, I... countless times, you know, people will get their decision letter, and then they'll call me and say, hey, they denied everything, they denied everything, and then I'll look at the decision, I'm like, no, you were granted. Zeros are good. 00:16:53Madeline - Moderator: Zeros are good. You know, zero is a grant, it just means that it's not to the degree that it's compensable for you. P12: because we work, you know, because we... we are facilitators, and I'm an authorized signer for CalVet fee waivers. P12: And, I'm like, I try to turn it into a puzzle, I'm like, your kid can go to college for free with a 0%. You're good. P12: you're good, you know, so... P12: that... then they're like, oh, oh, okay, I thought I was denied. I'm like, no, zero... zeros are good, because the condition... it... it... the VA acknowledges that the condition is because of your service. The condition can always go up. You know, you can always... you can only go up from zero. Yeah. So that kind of, you know, they... they're like, oh, okay, cool. 00:17:37Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, it's like you've got your foot in the door, basically. Right. Yeah. Okay. 00:17:40Madeline - Moderator: And then, so... 00:17:42Madeline - Moderator: it sounds like, at least some of the ones that we've talked about, that the disabilities you have with VA were caused directly by something that happened while you were in service. P12: Yes, ma'am. 00:17:51Madeline - Moderator: And I'm wondering, you know, we know that sometimes an injury or illness you got while in service can later cause, like, a whole different health condition. So, you know, for example, maybe you injured your knee while you were in service, and years later, because you've been overcompensating for that bad knee, you're now having some back problems. So it's like an indirect cause, but it's still because of the military service. P12: Secondaries, yeah. 00:18:13Madeline - Moderator: Okay, yep, you already know. I was gonna ask if you've had a situation like that or heard of it, but yeah. Yes, yes. 00:18:22Madeline - Moderator: And you already know how the VA refers to that situation. P12: Yes. 00:18:26Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:18:28Madeline - Moderator: And then, I think one more question, before we shift into part two of the session, 00:18:34Madeline - Moderator: Again, you know, I'm fresh out of the military, you've already explained to me the disability benefits process, what that looks like, and now I'm wondering, how does the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries? What would you say? P12: I would explain to them that. 00:18:52Madeline - Moderator: Each condition is... is rated separately. You are assigned a rating. P12: A disability rating 0-100% for each individual disability. P12: And, then, you know. P12: Over... once they decide the whole claim, you'll, receive in your decision letter what's... what's called the combined disability rating. P12: And that number is attached to the amount of compensation you'll receive. 00:19:21Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: So, if you have 4 conditions and they total 50%, okay, then I show them, okay, as a single veteran, this is what you're going to receive for a 50% disability rating. P12: Anything above 30%, if you have dependents or a spouse, then we could add your, dependents to the claim. 00:19:42Madeline - Moderator: Okay, awesome. So, thank you for all of that. 00:19:48Madeline - Moderator: Feedback, context, everything. This is where we're going to shift into part two, and so before we get into testing to the prototypes, would you like to take a brief break? P12: Yeah, I'll get a refill. 00:19:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay, yeah, go ahead, please. Thank you. Absolutely. P12: It's funny you say, you say your, your cat is all over you, so my... my dog is like, I'm just about to step on her, she's right under my feet. P12: She's a... she's a... we call her a, they... her nickname is a, A Velcro dog. 00:21:20Madeline - Moderator: Oh, yeah. 00:21:22Madeline - Moderator: Oh, yeah. 00:21:24Madeline - Moderator: I, yeah, my, my boyfriend has a German Shepherd, and he is very attached, and is like... P12: Yes. 00:21:31Madeline - Moderator: The worst thing in the world, when he leaves for work in the morning, you know? 00:21:34Madeline - Moderator: I know. P12: I love German Shepherds, too. 00:21:37Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. Mine is like this right now, because she, I work in the same room where her... she's, like, an auto feeder, and she gets lunch at 11am, and so between 10 and 11, she's like, just in case you forget, I'm right here and I'm hungry. 00:21:52Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so... 00:21:55Madeline - Moderator: Let's get into evaluating some prototypes. So, I'm going to show you two prototypes today for two different designs that we're working on. Some disclaimers. Prototypes are not the real website, and they're only partially functional, aka you might click on something and maybe nothing will happen, or you'll click on something, and it may behave a little wonky. So, again, some parts are clickable, some are not. And it's just a rough prototype, but for the sake of this 00:22:19Madeline - Moderator: test, we've put in some dummy data, and so anything you see will not be connected to the real VA database, and nothing you do today will affect your VA benefits or information at all. P12: Okay. 00:22:29Madeline - Moderator: And so, I'm gonna put a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat, and I'm gonna send that now. And, you can navigate to open that link, and once you have that open, I'm gonna ask if you can share your screen so we can see what you're doing. P12: Okay, there it is. Okay, there's that. P12: And, let me see... go back to Zoom to share. P12: I don't think I've ever shared in Zoom. 00:23:16Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Oops. P12: Okay, let's see... Can you tell me where Cher is? 00:23:25Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, are you joining us on a desktop? P12: I am. 00:23:28Madeline - Moderator: Okay, yeah, so if you... it does disappear when you're not, like, active in the screen, but if you kind of move your mouse over where you see the pictures of us talking, you should see some buttons appear along the bottom. 00:23:40Madeline - Moderator: of the Zoom window? P12: Oh, share, duh. 00:23:52Madeline - Moderator: No, no, you're fine. P12: The big green share button, okay. Yeah. P12: Alrighty, so... 00:24:11Madeline - Moderator: Okay, perfect. P12: Shoot. 00:24:13Madeline - Moderator: No, I think, since it opened in a browser, I'm gonna guess it looks like you've got Edge active. Maybe if we navigate over to the Microsoft Edge icon? Yep. Can you see that? Yes, we can. This is excellent. 00:24:25Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:24:27Madeline - Moderator: So, we're going to start with Prototype Banana, so you can just click that link there. P12: Okay. 00:24:36Madeline - Moderator: And while this loads up, I'll place that for our scenario. So, for this first one, I'm going to ask that you, imagine that you have a few different health conditions that you want disability benefits for, and you've come to the VA website today to apply. And so, as you click through this prototype, you'll notice there's some dummy data in there for your imaginary veteran. 00:24:56Madeline - Moderator: And this imaginary veteran is already receiving some disability benefits for a few conditions. 00:25:02Madeline - Moderator: And so the data you see today, it's not going to match yours, but I'd like you to imagine that you really are this person, and then to tell us what you would do as if this were your real situation. And so as you go through the different pages of this prototype, just, you know, verbalize anything you think out loud about what you're seeing, what you're reading, and so we can understand how it's best working for you. 00:25:22Madeline - Moderator: Okay. So... P12: I'm already rated, and I'm gonna add some more conditions. Okay, add your disability, okay. P12: Kenya? 00:25:30Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:25:31Madeline - Moderator: And so for this very first one, let's say you've started having arthritis in your shoulder, and you think it's because of an injury you had while in service. How would you ask for disability compensation for that from here? P12: Okay, arthritis in my shoulder... P12: a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:25:58Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Oh, will it click, or no? 00:26:00Madeline - Moderator: This one is... this one does not click. P12: Okay. 00:26:03Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, this is more, I'm wondering, you know, if we're testing to see if that first option is visible to folks here. P12: Gotcha. 00:26:12Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, so... P12: Yeah, I'd do that one, a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:26:16Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:26:17Madeline - Moderator: So, we'll shift... that was kind of like our warm-up scenario, you could say. Our first official one is 00:26:24Madeline - Moderator: You know, before we start, I want to ask if you've heard of the PACT Act. I'm gonna assume yes, but... Yes. Okay, yeah. For this scenario, let's pretend you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 10 years ago, but the VA turned down that request, because they didn't think it was caused by your military service. But then, since the PACT Act has been passed, you've learned that asthma is now a presumptive 00:26:48Madeline - Moderator: And, you believe they should give you benefits for it. 00:26:52Madeline - Moderator: So, now you're going to reapply for asthma. 00:26:55Madeline - Moderator: And I'm wondering how you would do that on this screen here. 00:27:06Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so what's going through your mind as you're thinking about what you're doing here? P12: I... I know I was denied before. P12: So, I'm gonna go to a condition that the VA previously denied. 00:27:19Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next? P12: Then I'd go... 00:27:26Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: You have new evidence, okay, or are you like, okay, so... P12: If I didn't know about the PACT Act. P12: I would go... I mean, I would still do it. P12: Yeah. P12: New evidence. P12: Or. Okay, so it's either or. P12: And it was asthma. 00:27:56Madeline - Moderator: What's, and before we move from this create screen, what's going through your head as you look at this screen? P12: So, if I am unknowing, I don't know about the PACT Act. P12: I'm just... if I'm... usually what happens is... P12: know, they might see something, they might talk to a buddy, and they're like, oh yeah, I filed a claim, you know, in 1980-something. I'm gonna, I wanna refile that. So their whole thing is not reopening, or their thing is they're gonna file a claim. And so, by... by... P12: conversation, you know, I'm like, okay, so you have asthma. Did you file for this before? P12: oh, yeah, I think I... I think I... yeah, I did file and I was denied. Of course they're not gonna have the decision letter, so then... P12: I'm not gonna have power of attorney yet, so I'm gonna have to call the VA, find out when they were denied the. 00:28:56Madeline - Moderator: Small. P12: And then, you know, we'll... You know, they can go for a supplemental, but yeah. P12: Now... as a client. P12: They may be confused by... Supplemental. P12: Because in their mind, they're thinking they're just gonna file a claim. They, they don't... they don't know this term, supplemental. P12: Yeah. P12: They just know that they were denied before, and they were denied for asthma. P12: Okay. 00:29:30Madeline - Moderator: And so, do you think, again, from that, like, client's perspective, is there something here that you think could maybe trip somebody up, or make them think maybe they ended up in the wrong place? P12: This part here... I mean, I get it, but I don't know that they would get it. P12: I think... P12: if you... I think it needs to be dumbed down so they don't think they're making a mistake, because so many times, someone will say, yeah, I filed... I filed a claim online, and come to find out they didn't even file it. 00:30:09Madeline - Moderator: Mmm. P12: It only, it only generated an intent to file. P12: So, I'm looking for a claim to... to... You know, be, P12: I'm looking for a claim that is active, and there's no claim active, because they think they filed a claim. 00:30:25Madeline - Moderator: Hmm. P12: So, this part... Or maybe even... I mean... 00:30:34Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, when you say, like, dumbed down, or, you know, like, if you were writing this screen, what would you... what would you put, or maybe your change? P12: I would, hide the supplemental. P12: Because that... that... Throws them off. 00:30:51Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: You can appeal a denied condition. P12: I would just... I would just say, do you want to appeal a denied condition? Period. P12: And just take... take those others off the table, because it's gonna be confusing. 00:31:10Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: I mean, they will know that they got denied for something, but they're not gonna know if they have evidence, and they're not gonna know about PACT Act. 00:31:20Madeline - Moderator: Mmm, okay. P12: If that makes sense. 00:31:23Madeline - Moderator: Yes, no, that's incredibly helpful. 00:31:26Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so. P12: And this part, I mean, that's good, because P12: you know, if they, oh yeah, I just went to the doctor today, you know, for my asthma. P12: And I can... I can submit this new evidence. 00:31:40Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so keeping the evidence prompt. P12: Yeah, yeah. 00:31:43Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:31:44Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great, thank you. So, and yeah, what would you do here, now? 00:31:50Madeline - Moderator: Okay? 00:31:55Madeline - Moderator: So, what's, what's going through your mind as you look at this screen here? P12: Again, the language, I... I don't... I'm not sure if they're... P12: If they will be thrown off by Supplemental. P12: I mean... if I... if I'm, again, unknowing. P12: Okay, review your condition? Asthma? Yep, I was denied in 2014. P12: But this right here, when I continue... oh goodness, I don't... laws, and I don't know... 00:32:34Madeline - Moderator: Let me... Yeah. P12: then I'll go back and... P12: Maybe I need to delete this, because I don't want to do something I'm not supposed to. 00:32:39Madeline - Moderator: Oh, okay. P12: When you start saying lol, then they get kind of eerie. 00:32:46Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:32:48Madeline - Moderator: That's helpful. So, let's say one of the conditions you're already getting benefits for has gotten worse, and you want to ask for a rating increase on the same form. How would you do that? P12: Do you have another condition to add? P12: Okay. P12: Me knowing would say, yes. P12: But... if I'm... if I'm wanting an increase, I don't know that... A regular person would know P12: Because they're like, if they say, add another condition. P12: I'm already... I'm already rated for migraines. I don't want to add that. 00:33:31Madeline - Moderator: Hmm, okay. P12: So... I mean, and this... you don't... you're not given another option. 00:33:40Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. P12: Maybe if... do you add, or do you want an increase? P12: Because add to me means something new. 00:33:49Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Or, yeah, do you have another condition to add? Or do you have a condition that has gotten worse and you want to increase? 00:33:57Madeline - Moderator: yeah. 00:34:00Madeline - Moderator: Okay, awesome, thank you. 00:34:05Madeline - Moderator: So what would you, as you said, me. Oh, so... P12: As a regular person, I would say yes. 00:34:11Madeline - Moderator: Okay, alright. 00:34:12Madeline - Moderator: You can go ahead and do that. 00:34:19Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and then before we click on anything here, where do you think this list of options on this page comes from? P12: Well, they all... well, let's see here... P12: So, this looks like... my current conditions that I'm rated for. P12: Yeah. 00:34:52Madeline - Moderator: And what do you think about how these options are organized? P12: Let's see... Yeah, I like it. P12: Yeah. It's pretty... it's pretty self-explanatory. Yeah. 00:35:07Madeline - Moderator: Okay, is there anything in particular you like about the page? P12: I like that it lists their current rating. P12: I would assume that they would know that these are their ratings, because it's in their port... in their login. Yeah. 00:35:30Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. P12: And this gives me the option here, like, okay, like on the previous page. P12: I'm saying? Something that I haven't... P12: I haven't claimed before, okay, I know that, I've never claimed that. Oh, yeah, I remember I was denied for that, so yeah. Okay. Yep. P12: Now, maybe I would put... move this up here. P12: I'll probably move this up here with the other one. P12: So those are up at the top. P12: And then have the rated ones below that. 00:36:01Madeline - Moderator: And what will be the reasoning for that? P12: Just so they're not... They're not getting confused. P12: It's, like, right there in the front, so they can... they can either click on it or bypass it. 00:36:15Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: It's not like they have to go down it, and then they're like, oh, wait a minute, what's this one? Yeah, I think if you have both of these up here at the top. P12: it, it, it gives, it gives them less, less, what's the word I'm looking for? Less, less, P12: They can't mess it up, really. 00:36:38Madeline - Moderator: Okay, like less, cause for... or potential for error or something? P12: Exactly, yeah, thank you. 00:36:44Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: It's early in the morning. 00:36:46Madeline - Moderator: I know, when I saw you were coming from California, I was like, oof, I just relocated from LA. 00:36:52Madeline - Moderator: I get it. 00:36:53Madeline - Moderator: Okay, but back... so back to the scenario. Let's say, for this increase, it's about maybe 3 years ago you got rated for your hypertension. In the last month you feel like it's gotten a little bit worse, so you want to try for a higher rating. What would you do here? P12: I would click here. 00:37:17Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so you've selected hypertension... Clicking continue, okay. P12: Okay. P12: Okay. This is good, yeah. 00:37:38Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so what do you... yeah, what do you think's the difference between these two options? P12: It gives them... it gives them... A description of the P12: what they're trying to do. It explains it better here. 00:37:55Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Better than maybe... Better than the... Maybe... because here. P12: They're just being asked to click a condition. P12: And you're asking them to add a condition, but they don't want to add, they want to increase, so maybe if you put the P12: Increase prior to this one. P12: Yeah. P12: Maybe if you put that... that slide prior to, okay. P12: You want to request an increase for hypertension. P12: These are your options, it's gotten worse, and then you don't have to deal with the other stuff, if that makes sense. 00:38:30Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, it does. 00:38:32Madeline - Moderator: Is there anything unclear or confusing on this page? P12: Well, given the previous one, If they... if they paid attention to something being denied. P12: I'm not sure that it would be clear that they know that this is what they're doing. 00:39:05Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Yeah. 00:39:06Madeline - Moderator: Okay, this being... P12: The, appealing, the supplemental claim. 00:39:10Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay, great. And so which one would you choose on this page? 00:39:15Madeline - Moderator: Which option? 00:39:18Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:39:20Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so... and what would you do next? P12: Oh, actually, yeah, I take that back, because this... P12: I didn't go further down, so yeah, that's fine, because it tells you one or the other. P12: If something was denied, but maybe just, P12: I think they attach themselves to the word denial. 00:39:45Madeline - Moderator: Bye. P12: And so maybe if that were in here somewhere, or here, something was denied, and I want a pill or something. 00:39:53Madeline - Moderator: Oh, okay. P12: Yeah. P12: Okay, when did it get worse? Okay, this is, P12: let's say I just came from the doctor, and... P12: And I have to increase my blood pressure medication, so it'll be today's date, and okay, that makes sense. 00:40:16Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so, and this is where we'll do some, prototype magic, and you can just click on any of those date fields, and it'll. P12: Oh, okay. Yeah. P12: Okay. 00:40:27Madeline - Moderator: Yep, perfect. 00:40:30Madeline - Moderator: And so... P12: Okay. 00:40:33Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, I'm interested in what you think is happening on the screen. P12: Okay, review your conditions? Okay. P12: Asthma? P12: I was denied, yeah, and hypertension has gotten worse. P12: Okay, nope, that's good, I like that. 00:40:51Madeline - Moderator: Okay, can you tell me what's changed on the screen? P12: Hmm... No, I can't. 00:41:08Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:41:11Madeline - Moderator: It's, okay, I guess I... maybe that question wasn't worded great. What's... what do you think is... 00:41:20Madeline - Moderator: different about this screen now that you're at it for the second time. And it may be... 00:41:25Madeline - Moderator: You know, not a... it's not a trick question. P12: Okay. 00:41:30Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. P12: Well, it definitely speaks to P12: what their... their goal was when they... when they, you know, initiated it. They wanted to appeal, or they wanted to, they know that they were denied for asthma, and they want that looked at again, and they know that the hypertension's gotten worse, and so that's... these are the two actions that they were wanting to do in the first place. 00:41:52Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:41:56Madeline - Moderator: And... why do you think it says, claim for increase under hypertension? P12: Because, well, going back to the previous one. P12: Where it asked me if this... if the, if I wanted to request an increase. P12: then a claim for increase would be what I would be expecting. 00:42:23Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:42:24Madeline - Moderator: And so, were you expecting to see that here? 00:42:27Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:42:29Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so I'm going to ask you to add one more thing, and so let's say you want to add another health issue to this form, what would you do? P12: I'm gonna say yes. 00:42:37Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:42:42Madeline - Moderator: Okay. And so, this condition's a little bit more, or the scenario's a little bit more complicated. So, imagine that about a year ago, you filed a claim for migraines, and the VA approved it, and they gave you a 10% rating. 00:42:55Madeline - Moderator: But you believe they should have given you a higher rating, and so you want the VA to reconsider that 10% decision. You went back to your employer, you got them to write a letter that details how many times you had to miss work because of those migraines, going all the way back to when you filed that claim a year ago. 00:43:12Madeline - Moderator: And you're hoping that this letter should prove that your migraines were more severe than that original VA rating percent. P12: Do you have any questions about this scenario before we move forward? P12: No, I do not. 00:43:24Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and what do you think your options would be to ask the VA to reconsider that 10% rating decision? P12: Now... 00:43:39Madeline - Moderator: I may be confused here, because... P12: It's asking me to add something that I already have. 00:43:46Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: So that might confuse some people. 00:43:51Madeline - Moderator: Like, the use of the word add, when something's. P12: Yeah. 00:43:54Madeline - Moderator: Pre-existing? Okay. P12: Yes. P12: Okay, but yes, migraines, I want to increase. 00:44:02Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Okay, and there it is again. It's, it's after the fact. P12: So, yeah. P12: Yeah. 00:44:13Madeline - Moderator: And is this screen what you expected to see next? P12: Yes, 00:44:17Madeline - Moderator: And is there anything different? Any kinds of thoughts going through your head as you look at this screen again? P12: No, again, I mean, it, it. 00:44:27Madeline - Moderator: It explains... P12: in detail, better than... than just that previous screen. 00:44:35Madeline - Moderator: Hmm. P12: You know, it's telling them P12: What are... it's giving them the options, and so it's... the language is better, as far as them determining what it is they're going to do. P12: we don't want to appeal anything, so that makes sense. We won't... it's gotten worse, and this... it's gotten worse. That's... that's the... P12: Keep... keep... Components right there. 00:44:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:01Madeline - Moderator: So, which option would you choose here, and why? P12: I know that my migraines have gotten worse, so this is my only option. 00:45:12Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:13Madeline - Moderator: Alright, so, yep, we can go ahead. P12: Okay, and when did they get worse? And you said just click. 00:45:25Madeline - Moderator: Sometimes when it's, overlapping with those left and right buttons in black, you just need to scroll down a bit. P12: Oh, okay. 00:45:31Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. P12: Gotcha. 00:45:34Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:36Madeline - Moderator: So, and you expected to see this screen? P12: Yes. 00:45:39Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:41Madeline - Moderator: So, yep, we can go ahead. P12: So now I've got my asthma, hypertension, and the migraines. Okay. P12: So, this was denied, I'm... P12: And a lot of times, I will say that people start something, and then if they are not sure about it. P12: Though. P12: Call and ask the questions. P12: Before they... before they... I guess, submit, yeah. 00:46:14Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. P12: Okay, so... 00:46:17Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, what's going through your mind as you look at the list of things here? P12: I like... I like that the boxes outline P12: You know, each condition, and what it is that they're trying to achieve. P12: So that's good, yeah. 00:46:31Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:46:32Madeline - Moderator: And so, let's say that's everything you want to claim today. What would you do next? P12: I'm gonna say, nope. P12: Continue? 00:46:43Madeline - Moderator: Okay, awesome. 00:46:45Madeline - Moderator: So, now we're going to shift to our other prototype, so we can click on Prototype Apple. P12: A bullcrap. 00:47:09Madeline - Moderator: Okay. So, we're gonna go through some of these same scenarios, just different prototype this time. So let's say for this first one, you've, again, you've started having arthritis in your shoulder, and you think it's because of an injury you had while in service. How would you ask for disability compensation for that? P12: Okay, so this is going to be something that I've not claimed before. P12: Trying. P12: Is this not gonna click? P12: You muted. 00:48:10Madeline - Moderator: I'm so sorry, my cat was... she's adjusting my desk. 00:48:14Madeline - Moderator: You got me muted, she's causing a little chaos over here. The closer we get to 11, the more rambunctious she is. P12: Okay, so it won't let me click this? 00:48:24Madeline - Moderator: That, yeah, that is perfectly fine, that's expected. Again, similar to last time, we just wanted to see if this is, if that option was noticeable. So we'll shift into... that was, like, our warm-up scenario, we'll shift into our first one for this prototype Apple. This is, again, you know. 00:48:40Madeline - Moderator: You've heard of the PACT Act? So, for this scenario, let's pretend you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 10 years ago, but the VA turned down that request because they didn't think it was caused by your military service, but since the PACT Act was passed, you've learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition, and you believe they should give you benefits for it. 00:49:00Madeline - Moderator: So you're going to reapply for asthma, and how would you do that on this screen? 00:49:12Madeline - Moderator: Okay... Yep, you can go ahead. P12: I like that it... it separated the... P12: I like that it separated the rated conditions and the denied conditions. 00:49:28Madeline - Moderator: Like with the subheadings? 00:49:32Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Okay. 00:49:34Madeline - Moderator: So, yeah, take a minute to look at this screen and tell me what you're noticing here. P12: So this is telling me... that if I do not meet one of these, then... P12: I can't go any further. 00:49:58Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:50:02Madeline - Moderator: And so, what do you think of the information that's featured here? P12: I like it. 00:50:07Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: I like it. 00:50:10Madeline - Moderator: And, in your... in this imaginary scenario, how does the information that you see here relate to what you're trying to do with asthma? P12: Well, if... if I don't know about the pack... P12: I want to call someone to find out more about it. P12: Or I move forward, I think. P12: Like, wait a minute, a new law? Oh, I don't know anything about that. Let me just wait a minute until I, you know, confirm what it is. 00:50:39Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: So I'll probably... back out of it until I can confirm which route I'm supposed to take. 00:50:48Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:50:50Madeline - Moderator: And so what would you... what would you do next if you were just, you know, trying to... 00:50:57Madeline - Moderator: Maybe deal with the, you know, this task strictly with the online form. P12: I would continue. 00:51:05Madeline - Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead. 00:51:09Madeline - Moderator: I think this is another one where you might have to scroll a little bit. P12: Oh. 00:51:12Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. P12: Okay. P12: My asthma was denied, and someone claimed based on new arrangement, okay. 00:51:23Madeline - Moderator: Okay. Okay. 00:51:24Madeline - Moderator: And what do you think about the information that's featured here? P12: That's good. That's good. And I like that... Because... P12: Let's say they get stuck, and they say. P12: They need to come to a VSO, you know, to help them. P12: The first thing we're gonna ask is, okay, we don't have POA, what's the denial date? P12: And I'm glad... I'm glad that that's right there. 00:51:49Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. So you think that's, like. P12: Yeah. 00:51:53Madeline - Moderator: Worthwhile information to surface. P12: Yes, yes, because we need that, because we can't go any further without that, and then that prevents us from having to call into the VA to get the denial date. So, yeah, I like that. 00:52:05Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:52:07Madeline - Moderator: So, and let's say you, have... you have a condition you're already getting benefits for, but it's gotten worse, and so you want to ask for a rating increase on this same form. What would you do next? 00:52:22Madeline - Moderator: And before we hit continue, what do you expect to happen? P12: I expect it to take me, to the screen that says, What condition? 00:52:34Madeline - Moderator: Or it'll give me the overview of the con... oh, shoot, sorry. It'll give me the overview of the conditions. 00:52:41Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so we can go ahead and do that. P12: Okay, yeah, so these are my rated, and they're my denies, and something that is not gonna appear either here or here, so it's gonna be something brand new. 00:53:01Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and then, I know you mentioned something about, you know, kind of liking how they're grouped. Is there any other feedback you have on how this page is organized? P12: Again, the denial dates, I like that the ratings P12: are listed out because, you know, if someone has a question about this. P12: say, oh, I'm currently rated at 10%. Well, let me check and see if you even meet the criterion. P12: To request an increase. 00:53:40Madeline - Moderator: You know. P12: So, it gives us, again, if it gets stuck, and we're trying to assist, then P12: It gives us the information that we normally wouldn't have. P12: And then, also I like the fact that... P12: not dumb it down, but it gives them less room for error here, because they look at these, and then they look at these, and like, oh, no, I haven't claimed it before, so let me click this. 00:54:08Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and so, like, specifically liking that the... 00:54:13Madeline - Moderator: Is it that the denied conditions are all featured on this page? Yes. P12: For sure. 00:54:18Madeline - Moderator: Error reduction? Okay. 00:54:22Madeline - Moderator: Awesome, so back to the scenario. Let's say that, 3 years ago you got rated for hypertension, but in the last month you feel as though it's gotten worse, and so you want to try for a higher rating. What would you do? 00:54:38Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:54:41Madeline - Moderator: And what do you expect to see next? P12: I expect it to say, do I want to file for an increase? 00:54:49Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Nope, nope, it was when did it get... when did it got worse. 00:54:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so, yep, same kind of thing as you got it. We can go ahead and continue. P12: Okay, there's the claim for increase. 00:55:13Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:55:14Madeline - Moderator: Awesome. So, is... and is this screen what you expected to see? 00:55:20Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:55:21Madeline - Moderator: And then we're going to, 00:55:26Madeline - Moderator: you know, we don't have a... another condition to add for this one. This is kind of a wrap-up of Apple prototype, but we can just say, no. Or I guess you have to say yes, sorry, I forgot this one. P12: Oh, so yes. 00:55:39Madeline - Moderator: Last minute change, yes. So we'll do yes, we'll hit continue. P12: Okay? 00:55:44Madeline - Moderator: And then from here... You should be able to click continue. 00:55:50Madeline - Moderator: on the screen. 00:55:52Madeline - Moderator: Yes, okay, awesome. P12: Okay. 00:55:54Madeline - Moderator: So... 00:55:56Madeline - Moderator: That's testing the two prototypes, and now I just have some follow-up questions, about your thoughts on both of them. I, though, have to... I have to run and get a tissue, I'm so sorry. P12: No worries! 00:56:06Madeline - Moderator: I'm back. P12: Okay. 00:56:27Madeline - Moderator: Okay, I'm so sorry for that. P12: No! 00:56:31Madeline - Moderator: I've been absolutely. P12: Do you have snow outside? 00:56:34Madeline - Moderator: I do not, but it is chilly, yeah. P12: Okay. 00:56:38Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so, yeah, I'd like to hear from you how the two prototypes compare to each other. Before we open up, like, a comparison screen, just from memory, did you find one of them easier to use? P12: Yes. 00:56:53Madeline - Moderator: And which one was that? P12: I would say the second one. 00:56:56Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and why was that one easier? P12: Again, It... it. P12: It had a good explanation, and I liked the bold print. P12: You know, divided the conditions. P12: And, it seemed like it was easier on my eyes. P12: To... to hone in on what it is I was trying to accomplish. 00:57:22Madeline - Moderator: Oh, okay, okay, great. And are there any differences that you notice between them? 00:57:29Madeline - Moderator: Besides, you know, the bolded headlines and things like that. Anything else? P12: I can't recall. 00:57:37Madeline - Moderator: Okay, that's fine. P12: short-term memory sucks, I'm sorry. That is more than okay. So from here, we'll click on that comparison screen option. 00:58:04Madeline - Moderator: I don't know if you can hear that, that is the auto-feeder going off with the promised lunch. Okay, so now that we're here, yeah, take a minute to kind of scroll up and down this screen, review these images side by side. 00:58:19Madeline - Moderator: And I'm wondering, you know, what do you think about the different versions of the screen? P12: Okay, definitely, definitely like this, this one here. P12: Because, again, it, it divided... them up. P12: And I like that it gave you the option up at the top. P12: Well, I mean, I guess it's here too, but, P12: So, if none of these applies, you can go straight to this one. 00:59:05Madeline - Moderator: You know that you haven't claimed it before, so there's no reason to... P12: Even mess with these. 00:59:11Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. 00:59:12Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Now, but I do like the box version of this. P12: I like the boxes, because again, it... I don't know, something about it, it's... it's good on the eyes. It's easy on the eyes. So maybe if you could incorporate these boxes over here, that would be nice. 00:59:32Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, kind of combine them. 00:59:34Madeline - Moderator: Okay, yeah, that's, yeah, excellent feedback. 00:59:38Madeline - Moderator: And... so if this was actually your disability information, you know, is there... does that change which one of these you would prefer? P12: I'm sorry, say that one again? 00:59:49Madeline - Moderator: If this was actually your disability information, does that change which of these designs you would prefer? P12: But yeah, I would still go with this one. 00:59:57Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. 00:59:59Madeline - Moderator: And... And is that also the one that you would prefer to use? P12: Yes, this one. 01:00:06Madeline - Moderator: And is it... are there any additional reasons as to why you would prefer that, besides from what you've already told us? P12: Because it, again, it... it tells me... because there's... I can't remember anything, so the fact that it tells me when it was denied. P12: is very helpful. 01:00:24Madeline - Moderator: Okay, awesome. So now I just have a couple of post, you know, scenario interview questions. What would you say was the most challenging part of this process today? P12: Most challenging... P12: You know? P12: I guess as a... as a... P12: Non-VSO, I would say probably just understanding the verbiage. P12: And making sure that I was clicking on the right The right, P12: prompt. Is there something that maybe, let's say, if, if someone is confused while they're in the, in the portal, you know, like a little, like a... P12: question mark box. Hey, I don't know what this means. Like, on the PACDAC question mark. P12: And then, like, a little... verbiage of what the pack deck is about, blah blah blah. P12: Like, like, you know, like, if you have questions about something, it has a little question mark on some... 01:01:42Madeline - Moderator: hoops. P12: Yeah. Kind of like that. 01:01:44Madeline - Moderator: Okay, like little, like, kind of additional information bits. Okay. P12: Yep. 01:01:49Madeline - Moderator: And, in addition, is there anything in addition to PACDAC do you think would be helpful to maybe provide that additional context for? P12: Not that it pertains to this scenario, but let's say... P12: If you had sleep apnea. 01:02:05Madeline - Moderator: Animals. P12: 50%. P12: And you try to, you know, you try to add it. P12: You try to, request an increase. P12: You know, you cannot have an increase on this because you're at max... max level. 01:02:21Madeline - Moderator: Mmm, okay. P12: So, like, something built in that... and you can't get anything more than for tinnitus than a 0%. P12: Like, you click on it, it goes... 01:02:32Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. P12: You can't do it, you know. 01:02:35Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. And was there anything that was, surprising or unexpected as you went through these prototypes? P12: I was surprised, P12: My ratings will be listed out, and the percentages attached to them, and then also the denial dates. 01:02:56Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P12: Like that. 01:02:58Madeline - Moderator: What were you... why was that surprising? P12: Because in the past, it was so generic. P12: And you weren't given that information up front, you would have to click back over to your... your little disability circle to see, you know, what... what... P12: what disabilities you had, and what the rating was. I like that everything is all up front on one page. 01:03:24Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay, great. P12: As you're going through the prompts. 01:03:27Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, yeah, versus having to, like, maybe dig up that information elsewhere. Right. Okay. P12: Right. 01:03:33Madeline - Moderator: Awesome. 01:03:34Madeline - Moderator: So that is about all the questions I have for you. I am going to give, Sammy and Lisa an opportunity to come off screen and ask you any questions that they might have. P12: Okay, can I, take one second, please? 01:03:48Madeline - Moderator: Absolutely. P12: Okay, I just need to go, P12: say hello to my team. Yeah, sure. 01:03:55Madeline - Moderator: Sure. P12: Okay, thanks. P12: Alrighty. 01:05:48Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so Lisa doesn't have a question for you, but, Sami does, so go ahead, Sammy. sami: Hi, P12, thanks for going... walking us through all that. Sure. My only question has to do with that comment you made regarding having what we call a tooltip, you know, you kind of click on something. sami: a box shows up and it says, the PACT Act is... would it be better to link it to the actual... some kind of documentation regarding the PACT Act? I'm afraid that a little tooltip box is not going to be able to get sami: be enough, and we can't have... you know what I mean? Like, would that work for you, as opposed to having. P12: Yes, absolutely. sami: Okay. P12: Yeah, for sure. Links work. sami: Yes. sami: That was my only question, thanks. P12: Okay. 01:06:35Madeline - Moderator: All right. And then, P12, do you have questions for any of us, or any comments? P12: No, I just, thank you for, inviting me. I mean, I think it's... it's very important, you know, for... for... P12: Us as, you know, providers to make this as simple as possible. P12: as not to deter veterans from, you know, applying for the benefits that they're eligible for. So I always, you know, want to be a part of P12: making the change and, you know, doing what I can on my part, you know, as a veteran and as a provider to, you know, just try to make life easier for them. 01:07:17Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, and we... yeah, we... I'm gonna echo something that, Lisa shared on the side, but it's incredibly helpful to get your... both the VSO and non-VSO experience, and those perspectives. Yeah, it's really, really great and fantastic. So thank you for taking the time to chat with us this morning, and, we really appreciate you taking that time to share all your thoughts with us. All of your feedback is so helpful. 01:07:41Madeline - Moderator: Especially as we continue to work on the site and make sure that it really works for veterans. 01:07:45Madeline - Moderator: And, lastly, Perigian, that recruiting company, they'll be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know, so that if they're interested or, you know, want the chance to participate in future research studies. 01:07:59Madeline - Moderator: That blurb will have all the information they need. And I just... we want to say thank you so much again, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. P12: Well, thank you, thank you for allowing me to be a part of this. 01:08:10Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, absolutely. And I hope, yeah, have a great, great Tuesday. P12: Yes, happy holidays! 01:08:15Madeline - Moderator: Yes, thank you, so do you. sami: Happy Holiday. P12: Bye-bye.
