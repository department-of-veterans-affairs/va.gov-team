00:00:01Kim: Okay, just to reconfirm, I started recording. Do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today?P06: You do.00:00:11Kim: Excellent, thank you. All right.00:00:14Kim: So let's get started. I would like to hear about your experience getting disability benefits, and since we might touch on some parts of your health situation, please know you don't need to talk about any topics that you don't want to. I'm most interested in hearing about your experience with the VA disability benefits process itself.00:00:34Kim: So have you ever filed for disability benefits with the VA?P06: Yes.00:00:40Kim: And about how many times have you done that?P06: One? I'm gonna say one time.P06: Yeah.00:00:48Kim: And how many disabilities has the VA approved for you?P06: You asked me to count them?00:00:57Kim: How many, like, how many different disabilities do you have that the VA has approved?P06: I want... I would... I know, I can't say all of them, but the majority, I'm gonna say the majority, yes.00:01:11Kim: Okay. So, and, can you tell me what some of those disabilities are?P06: That I had... that I... that they approved or disapproved?00:01:19Kim: That they... actually, why don't you tell me both? What are the ones they approved?P06: They approved of my joint conditions, like my back, my knees, that... My, tinnitus...P06: The PTSD, they approved those.P06: And my hypertension, they approved that.P06: So...00:01:50Kim: Okay, thank you. And what's your... do you know your overall disability rating percent?P06: I'm a hundred.00:01:56Kim: You're 100%. Okay, great, thank you for sharing that.00:02:01Kim: So, can you think back to the last time you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits?P06: 2009, when I... I haven't mess with trying to file a VA disability claim for myself since then, because I didn't see any reason to. The one condition that they denied was my trigger finger.P06: Which, had documentation of it, but they denied it, so I was just like, okay, whatever.00:02:31Kim: Wasn't... that was back in 2009?P06: Yes, because I had had surgery on the finger while I was in the military, right before I got out of the military, matter of fact.00:02:43Kim: And was that the only thing that you applied for in 2009?P06: Mmm... No, I've got service-connected coming out of the military.00:02:54Kim: Okay.P06: Right. And... and I don't know, maybe you... you might have, when I filled out the thing doing this, to do this survey, I also help veterans file claims.00:03:05Kim: Oh, you do?P06: Yeah, that was what I filled out on the application that I help veterans file claims. I had.00:03:12Kim: No.P06: No intentions of filing a claim for myself.P06: I wasn't about to die.00:03:17Kim: Okay, okay. That is great to hear, because then you can help us, figure out how we can talk about the things we're gonna look at, in a way that veterans are gonna...00:03:28Kim: understand. So, let's do a pretend scenario. Pretend that I'm a young veteran, I'm just a couple years out of the military, and I have a few health problems for my service. I am totally unfamiliar with VA disability benefits, or how to get them.00:03:48Kim: How would you explain the steps of the process to me?P06: Well, first thing, I would ask them if it happened in the military, were they treated for the condition while they was in the service?P06: And if they have record that they were treated for it,P06: I would look at that, review that with them, and then ask them, do they currently have a diagnosis of the condition, that the condition is still going on with them.P06: That would be how we would go about the first part, and if they have a current diagnosis, because you have to meet 3 criterias in order to get the service connection.P06: So, they have to meet those, and if they don't have all of them, and if it's only 2 years, I can't see the VA denying them,P06: If they have a medical record showing that the condition still exists.P06: Yeah.00:04:40Kim: Okay. When you talk veterans through...00:04:46Kim: their... the disability process, as they're going through the different steps. Are there terms that are particularly confusing for people?P06: A lot of them are confused with the computer, to be honest with you, especially the older veterans. They're not as up on the computer. It would be helpful if the VA could provide them some type of classes.P06: Or something to help them be able to understand how they can file their own claims?00:05:14Kim: Okay.P06: I think that's the biggest confusion, and then, how to upload the documents to the VA.00:05:25Kim: Okay.P06: Well, that's a lot of the problem, and that's why they come and see us, and we help them for free, our organization does, so we don't charge the veterans for any type of service at all.00:05:36Kim: Okay.00:05:37Kim: So do you, for your, for your work with DAV, is that, do you work with veterans, like, full-time, or how often do you do that?P06: I volunteer. I'm a volunteer.00:05:48Kim: Oh, that's nice, yes.P06: I volunteer 4 days a week, 2.30 to... no, 9.30 to 2.00:05:57Kim: That's awesome.P06: Days a week, yeah.00:05:59Kim: That's great that you do that. Okay, so back to me being a young veteran, trying to figure this out.00:06:07Kim: How does the VA decide how much money to give me for my disability?P06: It goes by the severity of the condition, because they send them out for, what they call CMP exams.P06: And it's based on the severity and the regulation.00:06:23Kim: Okay.00:06:24Kim: For you, personally.00:06:28Kim: Have you ever, for, like, your own situation, have you ever, had a time where you disagreed with the decision that the VA made about one of your disabilities?P06: Yes.00:06:44Kim: And what.P06: But I didn't... I did not pursue it.00:06:49Kim: Yeah, tell me... tell me about that. What was go... what were you... what was going through your head as you were trying to figure out what to do?P06: I was like, well, I'm at 104, you know, so what even fool with it? Just continue to go to the doctor, do whatever I need to get done, for the condition, versus.00:07:10Kim: Was this the... finger.P06: No, I never did pursue that one at all, because even after I had the trigger finger done in the military, after I got out, two years after I got out, the opposite finger did the same thing. Exact finger on the opposite hand.00:07:31Kim: So did... were you rated for the trigger finger on the first hand?P06: No, not at all.00:07:37Kim: Okay.P06: It was like they didn't even see the condition.00:07:42Kim: So... Interesting.00:07:46Kim: And so you just kind of didn't really consider pursuing it, because you were already at 100%, is that right?P06: Correct.00:07:55Kim: Okay.00:07:56Kim: If you had decided to pursue that, what would your options have been?P06: I could have either, well, we got new options now. Back then, we didn't have all the options that we have now. Only thing we had back in the... when I got out was, like, doing an appeal, but now they have, where you could go to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, or either you can do a supplemental, or you can do what they call a,P06: Higher level review.00:08:28Kim: As veterans.00:08:30Kim: Sorry, go ahead.P06: Go ahead. I could have did, an appeal back then, but it... to me, it wouldn't have worked it, so...00:08:37Kim: So, if this had happened, you know, a couple years ago, with the new process, would... and you decided you did want to pursue it, do you know which of those things you would have tried to do first?P06: I probably would have, I probably could have gotten it if I did a higher level review, because the record was there.00:08:55Kim: Okay.P06: And that was why it was denied.00:09:01Kim: So you just needed somebody to look at it again and give it a closer look?P06: Yeah.00:09:06Kim: Yeah, okay.00:09:08Kim: When you talk to veterans who have a disagreement about their claim, what do you usually advise them to do?P06: First, I ask them if they have the evidence, and do they have a... I read why the VA denied them first thing. I read why they were denied the condition, and then if we can, overcome that denial based off of something that the VA was incorrect in doing, which sometimes they are.P06: Incorrect, because I think that sometimes they don't read the whole record. And then...P06: They don't look at maybe what the person did in the military toP06: have that condition, because some... sometimes veterans are not seen for certain conditions when they're in the service, and I think sometimes the raters don't really understand that, because when I was in, you could notP06: If going on sick call was frowned on, especially if you are a higher-ranking person.00:10:09Kim: I would... that'.P06: That's not something that we did, you know? We didn't teach our soldiers to do that either, you know? You did your job, you know, so...P06: It was... It's crazy, you know, because you have people that are parachuters, never went on sick call.00:10:27Kim: Wow.P06: for jumping out of planes, and now, they have back conditions, knee problems, all of that, you know, from doing all of those constant jumps. But because there's no record.P06: of them ever being treated in the military, it's hard for them to get those conditions. And the same thing for hearing, and the ringing in the ears.P06: A lot of the conditions they don't look at, and they should change some of it.00:10:54Kim: the regulation I'm talking about. Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, I've heard that a lot, actually, about people just not... just kind of suck it up and not get treated... not get looked at.P06: If you want to stay in, guess what you would do? You would suck it up in.P06: Especially if you want to get promoted, you're just like, okay, let me just forget it, let's go on.00:11:13Kim: Okay. All right, great. Thank you for sharing all that with me. So let's start looking at these prototypes,00:11:25Kim: So what we're going to do is I am going to give you a link to these prototypes, and then ask you to share your screen, but let me... let me tell you a little bit about them first. So these are some kind of early designs that we're working on. And have you... have you seen the... the online 52600:11:45Kim: That veterans can fill out if they go to VA.gov?P06: I have not opened it up in my own app myself, no, but I do know there is one.00:11:55Kim: Okay, okay, so we're working on that form online.00:12:00Kim: And we're working on just this one, one part of it, and we're gonna show you some rough prototypes. They're only partially functional.00:12:10Kim: And some parts are clickable, some parts are not. Sometimes it jumps around in a little weird way, because it's a rough prototype. And also, we just put in some dummy data, because it's not actually connected to the VA database.00:12:23Kim: So, you'll see some fake data in there, and nothing you do today is going to affect your VA benefits or information at all.00:12:32Kim: So let me paste this link.00:12:35Kim: And I'm gonna put it in the Zoom chat.00:12:42Kim: Okay, and then if you can click on that link.00:13:00Kim: And then as soon as that comes up in your browser, if you can go back to Zoom and then share your screen.P06: I think the shear is already on, maybe? You see it?00:13:30Kim: I'm not saying it.P06: How about now?00:13:35Kim: Nope.00:13:36Kim: It might ask you, after you click share, it's probably going to ask you what's... what you want to share, like, which window or screen.P06: That's funny.00:13:55Kim: How about now?00:13:57Kim: Yep, you got it. Excellent.00:14:00Kim: This is... this is usually the hardest part of the session, so that went really smoothly.00:14:05Kim: Okay. So, this is what we're gonna do. For this scenario, you...00:14:14Kim: you're a veteran, you've logged in to the VA.gov website, you have a few different health conditions that you want to claim.00:14:23Kim: As you click through the prototype again, you'll notice there's some dummy data for an imaginary veteran. This imaginary veteran is already receiving disability benefits for a few conditions. Their data is not going to match yours, because it's fake data.00:14:39Kim: But I want you to imagine that you really are this person, and tell us what you would do if this were your real situation.00:14:45Kim: And as you use the prototype, if you can kind of verbalize your thoughts out loud, so we can understand how it's working for you, that would be really helpful.P06: So, should I... which one you want me to start with?00:14:57Kim: Let's start with banana today.P06: Banana, okay.00:15:01Kim: Yeah.00:15:09Kim: Okay, so for the first scenario, let's say, as it's loading up, you started having arthritis in your shoulder that you think is because of an injury you had while in service.00:15:21Kim: And so you're gonna try to ask for disability compensation for that shoulder arthritis.00:15:28Kim: And so you're... you've logged in, you've already done the first step of this application, so you're kind of in the middle of this 526 application, so...00:15:37Kim: Let me know what's going through your head as you're looking at this screen.P06: Okay, so I must have didn't finish it when I started, so I need to hit the continue button.P06: What conditions would you like to add?P06: So, have I claimed a shoulder before?00:16:01Kim: No, you haven't.P06: I have not.P06: Okay, so...00:16:07Kim: What's going through your head as you look through this?P06: Well, right now, it's saying, disability benefits and asking me to add a condition. Which condition would I like to add?P06: And it's asking me to choose one, but all I see, are you able to navigate the screen, or do I... am I able to...00:16:26Kim: You can scroll, you should be able to scroll, if you, does this not allow me...P06: No, it's not scrolling.00:16:34Kim: Put your cursor over the white part and see if it'll scroll.00:16:39Kim: -Oh.P06: No. Huh.00:16:42Kim: Oh, dear. That's interesting.Madeline Fritz: Are you using a trackpad or a mouse?P06: My finger.Madeline Fritz: Okay.P06: Yeah.Madeline Fritz: Yeah, so... okay, that's... yeah, that is interesting. Normally, if you're using, yeah, like a...P06: Let me see, I got a mouse, let me see.Madeline Fritz: Okay.00:17:05Kim: It worked on the previous screen, I saw you could scroll up and down.P06: I did too, but I don't know why it's not on this one.00:17:11Kim: I don't know.P06: It'll allow me to go side to side, let's see.00:17:16Kim: Yeah, that's not gonna...P06: Explain.00:17:17Kim: Help us. Do you... are you on a computer or on your iPad?P06: No, I'm on a computer, I'm upstairs.00:17:25Kim: Do you... do you have those, up and down arrows on your, on your keyboard, maybe?P06: Yep, that's not...00:17:38Kim: working. Alright, you know what, I'm gonna... let me pull up the prototype and see if it's working for me. Maybe there's just a... a bug.00:17:45Kim: Just a second.00:17:51Kim: And why don't you try, refreshing that browser window? There's that,00:17:59Kim: Little button in the upper left that looks like a circle with an arrow on it, all the way up at the top of your browser. Yeah, hit that, see if we can get this thing to reset itself.00:18:24Kim: Alright, can you try... see if it'll scroll now?00:18:28Kim: Aha!P06: Yep, it's scrolling now, yeah.00:18:30Kim: Excellence.00:18:32Kim: Okay, it looks like it clicked something...P06: Yeah, it was already clicked, a condition the VA previously denied.00:18:40Kim: Can you hit the back button?00:18:49Kim: Yeah, that's not working. Okay, that's not working. Okay, the little...Madeline Fritz: Maybe we can click, when you're in the Figma screen, in the bottom right, there is a restart, and that just restarts the actual prototype itself. See it pop up there?P06: Maybe you just...00:19:07Kim: Oh, good. Thank you, Maddie. So go ahead and click continue again.00:19:14Kim: Okay, now we're back to the screen, it's all fresh, nothing selected. So, I was just asking what was going through your mind as you're looking at this screen, and you're thinking about adding this arthritis in your shoulder.P06: really nothing, when I look at this, but if that's what I was gonna go ahead and add, which was previously denied.00:19:45Kim: So this one, you never, you never applied for before?P06: Well, it's... well, the way the... way the question is reading, it says a condition VA previously denied. The rest of them is like, the first one, it says a condition I haven't claimed before, so that would be one... that one that I would hit, would be the first one. The other ones I have ratings for already.00:20:09Kim: Okay.P06: Okay, great.00:20:11Kim: So you, you'd click that first option?P06: Correct.00:20:15Kim: Okay. Alright, let me give you, a second scenario.00:20:21Kim: So, in this one, let's say you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 10 years ago.00:20:29Kim: But the VA turned down your request because they didn't think it was caused by your military service, but since the PACT Act was passed, you have learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition, and you think the VA should give you benefits for your asthma.00:20:42Kim: So now you're going to reapply for it. How would you do that on this screen?P06: I would hit the bottom button, a condition that the VA previously denied.00:20:52Kim: Okay, why don't you go ahead and do that?P06: Guess I wasn't seen it continue.00:21:01Kim: When those little buttons come up and they... they're over the continue button, you need to scroll down a little bit before you can click continue? Yeah, okay, now you should be able to... there you go.00:21:12Kim: And again, kind of let me know what you're noticing as you look at the screen.P06: I'm noticing that a lot of these are some of the conditions that deal with the PACT Act,P06: And then it's... let's see what it's saying. If you have new evidence, we'll ask for it later. What condition would you like to file?P06: If I was a veteran and didn't know what a supplemental claim was, that would be, Question.00:21:45Kim: Okay.00:21:46Kim: Yeah, and this is really what we're working on with this change.00:21:52Kim: So we're trying to...P06: that sometimes the VA, gives them the wrong forms. I have noticed a lot of that.00:22:02Kim: Yeah.P06: Provide the veteran with the correct form or updated forms when they're working on claims, even... even in the system sometimes that they...P06: Sando.00:22:13Kim: Right. So, can you scroll up just a little bit?00:22:20Kim: Just to the top of the screen... sorry, to the top of the... Other way. Yeah, right there.P06: Oh, okay, okay.00:22:28Kim: Okay, so I'm curious, as you look at this explanation, if you, if you, like, you were just a regular veteran, not an advisor at the DAV,00:22:38Kim: How do you think... You would interpret this.00:22:44Kim: Description up here.P06: Well,P06: I'm guessing... I'm not guessing, I'm gonna ask the question. Do y'all, feel that a lot of the veterans are up to date on,P06: the PACT Act, what the PACT Act really means, you know? .00:23:14Kim: Because we have a lot of...P06: a lot of Vietnam veterans that come in wanting to follow the conditions dealing with the PACT Act, but the PACT Act, has some conditions on it that deal with the Vietnam veterans, but most of them are dealing with the Gulf War veterans.00:23:30Kim: So we get a lot of Vietnam veterans coming in.P06: wanting to file, based off the PACT Act, their conditions. And I know they have added toxic exposure, to a lot of the different, conditions now.P06: So...P06: We still get a lot of Vietnam veterans coming in wanting to fall for sleep apnea, in other words.00:23:52Kim: Right, right, right. Even though that's not a Vietnam-related condition.P06: Right, it's more of a Gulf War, but they'd be thinking that, oh, well, the PACT Act says, you know, so...00:24:01Kim: Okay.P06: Well, they'd be confused. I'm not confused, but they are confused.00:24:06Kim: Okay.00:24:10Kim: So, which part of this do you think would be confusing to them?P06: To a Vietnam veteran?00:24:17Kim: Yeah, let's start with the Vietnam veteran, which part would be confusing to them?P06: Well, all of it, because you said, because it's saying that I can file... well, they're saying you can... well, they can file for anything, so...P06: You know, whether they're gonna get granted is a whole different story.P06: But if... by them having a lot of the breathing issues that are on there, because Vietnam was mostly, dealing with Agent Orange exposure, they have granted some of them based off of some of the other type of toxic exposure, but not many.P06: Sleep apnea is not one of them that I've seen them still able to get, so why would they put that one up there?00:25:02Kim: Okay.00:25:03Kim: So Ben, what about...P06: Same thing with the asthma, and unless they had a good nexus letter from a doctor.00:25:11Kim: Right. What about... okay, so then what about for a Gulf War veteran?00:25:15Kim: However...P06: For veterans, they're not having that problem.00:25:18Kim: Okay.P06: cousin.P06: Because of the burn pits.00:25:25Kim: Right.00:25:26Kim: So, we're trying to explain here to veterans that they can Use this form.00:25:35Kim: To file a supplemental claim.P06: Mmm.00:25:39Kim: what do you think about the way that we've explained this?00:25:44Kim: Especially for Gulf War veterans.P06: Well, let's say, indeed, you want to use... So...P06: They would have to know what the PACT Act is first thing.P06: And a lot of those, they do know. So, based off of the first one,P06: as far as new evidence, I don't...P06: The new evidence would just be the, condition itself.P06: to them.P06: That we work with, because, they already have the diagnosis in their record that they have it. So, I mean, in their VA record, because that's what they're looking at. Do you have a current diagnosis of a condition?00:26:37Kim: Okay, so if you were this veteran, and you wanted to reapply for asthma, what would you do on this screen?P06: I'm gonna click the asthma button.00:26:46Kim: Okay, I'm gonna do this.P06: based off of the OR, not the evidence, not the new evidence. It would be the OR.00:26:53Kim: Okay, the PAC... the, new law.00:26:58Kim: Before you click, what would you expect to happen next?P06: It's probably gonna ask me if this is a supplemental form, huh?P06: This is a supplemental claim.00:27:14Kim: So...P06: form that I'm filling out, or 526EZ, because it's saying 526EZ, and I wouldn't fill it out on the.00:27:22Kim: And it is a 526EZ.P06: It wouldn't go on there.P06: The denied claim wouldn't go on that form.00:27:30Kim: Right, so the VA is going to be... it's not yet, but they're planning to change the policy so that you can actually00:27:38Kim: Do a supplemental claim on this form.P06: Oh, okay.00:27:43Kim: they have this new thing, it's called the No Wrong Door Policy, because they want to stop00:27:47Kim: telling veterans they filed the wrong form, and they have to go file another form. They're trying to make it simpler for veterans.P06: That'll... that'll be great.00:27:55Kim: That would be...P06: Great, because we get that all the time, yeah.P06: I don't know if I filed the claim before, and then we get back, no, I didn't file it, and then they have filed it, and the VA telling them it's the wrong form, so you gotta file it on another form. So yeah, that would be great.00:28:11Kim: Yeah, so that's the idea, and that's why we're trying to figure out how to put this into the 526, so it makes sense to people.P06: That would be great.00:28:23Kim: So, so you said you would click asthma.00:28:28Kim: And then what would you expect to happen maybe on the next screen?00:28:32Kim: If you have any guesses.P06: If I'm looking at a 526EZ,P06: It might ask me, if I have any evidence, or...P06: Or if it's due to the PACT Act, or...P06: Why would I be filing a claim for asthma?00:28:53Kim: Okay, that makes sense. The calls then, the calls.00:28:56Kim: Alright.00:28:57Kim: So why don't you go ahead and click Asthma and then continue?00:29:10Kim: Oh, it jumped up to the top, yeah, sorry.00:29:13Kim: So go ahead and click continue.P06: Alright, so take a minute to look at the screen, tell me what you think.00:29:25Kim: It's, it is 4.P06: It's asking me if I want to claim anything else.00:29:33Kim: Any other conditions?00:29:35Kim: Okay.00:29:36Kim: So let's say you do want to add some more conditions, to this claim, to this 526, what would you do?P06: I would hit yes.00:29:46Kim: Go ahead and do that.P06: And then continue.00:29:54Kim: Yeah, and let's say,00:29:57Kim: So, actually, let's pause on the screen. Where do you think this list of options came from?00:30:07Kim: For our imaginary veteran.P06: You cut out, I'm sorry, you said options, and I didn't hear the rest.00:30:13Kim: Sorry, so for this imaginary veteran, where do you think this list of options came from?P06: It's... looking at, this list came from what I already service-connected for.P06: if I'm this same, imaginary veteran, and wanting to know if I want to ask forP06: any of these conditions I already have, or maybe a condition I haven't claimed before, or another denied claim.00:30:42Kim: Okay.00:30:43Kim: What do you think about how the screen is organized?P06: Hmm... I don't know, because, see, you have... You have the...P06: The conditions already up there that a veteran is rated for, and...P06: That might confuse them a little bit.P06: And, you know, to me, I don't know.P06: Because then they might wind up clicking on something that they shouldn't click on.P06: And they do that a lot.00:31:13Kim: Great.P06: They asked for... they asked for stuff that they didn't mean to ask for,P06: Or thinking that they should be more than what they are for something.P06: based off of their mindset, you know, because they feel bad, you know? Just because they feel bad don't mean the evidence is there for them to get it, so their lack of information.00:31:37Kim: What do you think would be confusing about this?P06: Well, look at the tinnitus, man. My ringing is still going on, but I got a zero, you know?P06: My headaches, you know, are worse than that, you know.00:31:55Kim: Yep.00:31:56Kim: Okay, so let's say for this imaginary veteran, they got rated for hypertension about 3 years ago, but they feel like it's been getting worse.00:32:05Kim: Maybe they saw their doctor, and the doctor said, oh, you know, your blood pressure's getting worse, so they want to get a higher rating. What would you do on this screen?P06: If I was a veteran, or if I was telling... gonna advise a veteran. If you were a veteran. Oh, if I was a veteran, and I think in his words, I probably would click on it, you know.P06: Not knowing any better.00:32:29Kim: Okay.P06: I would click on it.00:32:31Kim: Why do you say not knowing any better?P06: Yeah, because hypertension for 10, you're almost dead.00:32:36Kim: So I need to be having some type of heart issues or something else going on before I click that hypertension link, you know. Okay.P06: Because when I go get that exam, if my blood pressure readings aren't a certain reading, I might get reduced to zero.00:32:51Kim: Okay, right, right, I have heard about that. Yeah. Okay, let's pretend you don't know any better.P06: Okay.00:32:59Kim: If you click on hypertension and then continue, what would you expect to happen?00:33:07Kim: On the next... on the... what would you expect to happen after you click continue?P06: Will it let me click more than one condition, or just one at a time?00:33:16Kim: Oh, Beth, what do you think?00:33:18Kim: It would be easier if you could click more than one at a time.P06: on the screen.P06: If the screen is gonna look like this when the veterans are in the system.P06: If they were... are allowed to be able to click on more than one condition at a time.00:33:36Kim: Yeah, it actually doesn't work that way, you can only do it one at a time.P06: Yeah.P06: I mean, if y'all are designing the system, you know, it would be good.P06: To do that.00:33:46Kim: Okay, yeah, that's... that's good feedback. We can... I think we can look at doing that. Can you go ahead and click continue?P06: That's gonna tell me about hypertension.00:34:06Kim: Let me know what's, what you're thinking as you look through this screen.P06: I'm gonna still be concerned aboutP06: Where's that supplemental claim at? Because it still keeps on saying supplemental claim.P06: Type of, like, an appeal, you know?P06: This is still, you know, it's still referencing that, but I'm looking at the 526EZ that I'm filling out, and I know you explained it to me, but if... is there something on the front of the 526EZ that says,P06: To include supplemental or something like that?00:34:59Kim: I don't know... so in the online forum, I don't know what it's gonna say, but it's definitely gonna be in here this way.00:35:08Kim: And then the paper form, I guess it's gonna mention that also when that gets revised.P06: Hopefully, because that would be confusing to a veteran, especially one that's... that knows that there's a supplemental claim, and it's a different form.00:35:26Kim: Yeah, so what I'm hearing we might want to kind of let people know up front that this is a new thing.P06: Yeah, yeah, because that would be confusing to them. That would also be confusing to people that are working with helping them file claims as well, that...00:35:44Kim: You know, used to other things that the VA is doing.00:35:47Kim: Yeah, they'll definitely have to, like, publicize it to all the VSOs and everything.00:35:52Kim: Make sure that advisors understand that.P06: And, are they... is the veteran going to be able to hit both of those buttons?P06: Because that is confusing, because his condition... you're telling me my condition is worse, Doc, so I'm applying for an increase, but I might also be...P06: My condition might have been worse than that 10 that you already given me, so, you know.00:36:21Kim: So in this case, it just got worse recently.P06: So that would be the first one, Dan. I would hit the first button.P06: Not to appeal to a previous rating decision.00:36:33Kim: Yeah.00:36:35Kim: Okay. Do you talk to veterans about supplemental claims specifically?P06: But yes, we talked to them about that, and the higher-level reviews, all of that, and the, actually doing the 526EZ.00:36:49Kim: regional.P06: Claims and stuff like that, yeah.00:36:52Kim: Okay.00:36:55Kim: So I'm curious, again, on this one if you can kind of scroll up to the top of the text and tell me, just in your advisor capacity.00:37:04Kim: What do you think about the way that we've explained this?P06: If your condition's gotten worse, which I'm... we're saying that it has, then we're asking them to increase it. But then, when you're talking about this right here.P06: filing an appeal, that's going to kind of confuse some of the veterans, in a way, because they think that, okay, well, I disagree with my rating.P06: So, is that an increase, or I'm disagreeing with my rating that I have now, you know?00:37:36Kim: Okay. So, if you were advising a veteran about this, how would you explain00:37:42Kim: To them, the difference between these two things.P06: Your condition just recently got worse, according to your medical records, so you're not appealing the decision, you're asking for an increased rating.00:37:54Kim: Okay.00:37:58Kim: And...00:37:59Kim: What... what... like, if I were a veteran, and I were trying to decide which one I wanted to do.00:38:06Kim: what are some factors that I would use, and what...00:38:11Kim: You know, which one is better for me?P06: Filing for the increased rating is going to be better than you filing an appeal, especially if your condition just recently got worse. The process is going to be shorter.00:38:24Kim: Okay, that's interesting. So it goes, it goes quicker?P06: Yes.00:38:30Kim: How much... and from your experience, how much faster is it?P06: Just an exam is required, or just to review the veteran's, medical record.P06: be a million.00:38:42Kim: That's for breakfast00:38:43Kim: For an increase. For the increase. And what about for the supplemental claim? How does that work?P06: You're waiting for... because that's in a whole nother lane.P06: It goes to the, appeal lane, which is a little bit longer than an increase than filing a regular claim. It's the different lanes that it go in.00:39:02Kim: Okay.00:39:04Kim: Do... in your experience, do veterans ever, for one condition, apply for both the increase and the supplemental at the same time?P06: But the same condition?00:39:13Kim: Yeah.P06: No.00:39:16Kim: Okay.P06: No, I wouldn't advise them to do that.00:39:20Kim: Okay.P06: The supplemental is if you disagree with a previous decision.P06: And you're not disagreeing with the previous decision, so you're just asking that... for us to increase the rating.00:39:33Kim: So, no, I would not.00:39:36Kim: Okay, alright, great, that's good for that screen. So, back into your mindset that you're this actual veteran doing your application, what would you do now?P06: I hit my conditions worse.00:39:48Kim: Okay.P06: And... Hit to continue.P06: And then, I'm sitting here, he wanted to know when it got worse, okay, so I'm gonna have to remember when the doctor told me it got worse.00:40:05Kim: We've got this kind of...P06: Isn't...00:40:08Kim: We have this kind of faked, so you can just click on any of those fields, it'll put a date in for you.P06: A lot of them don't know that answer, I will say that.P06: Because they don't have the record in front of them.00:40:23Kim: Yep.00:40:23Kim: Yep, we hear that a lot.P06: So, a lot of times, those dates are left blank.P06: And it's up to the rater to go through the paperwork, his records, to see.00:40:34Kim: Yeah.00:40:35Kim: So go ahead and click continue.P06: So hopefully there's still that block in there that don't, remember the date.P06: Right.00:40:45Kim: Rights, right, right.P06: the...00:40:49Kim: So tell me, what do you think's going on on this screen?P06: I was denied asthma, that's telling me that, so I can edit that if I need to.P06: the condition, and the same thing for the hypertension. What, what does the edit say, do you know?00:41:08Kim: Am I able to...P06: To touch it to see?00:41:10Kim: It's actually not working in this prototype.P06: Okay.00:41:13Kim: So I'm kind of just more curious what you think about the information that's displayed here.P06: Mmm, that's... that's right.P06: Because the first one is because it was, denied, and I'm... due to the law change, so that's... that's good.P06: And then the other one is good because it's... I'm just asking for an increase, so...00:41:48Kim: Great, so I'm going to ask you to add one more, health issue to this, so what would you do?P06: I'm gonna hit yes.00:41:56Kim: Okay. Sorry it keeps jumping up like that.P06: - that's alright.00:42:01Kim: You got used to it, though, you figured it out.00:42:04Kim: Okay.P06: up.00:42:07Kim: So, before I give you the scenario, I want to ask you a couple questions about the screen. Is there anything you noticed that has changed on the screen since the first time you saw it?P06: Not at all. You're talking about the conditions are all the same, but it's asking me to...P06: to something that I want to add.00:42:29Kim: Okay. So the one thing that did change is that hypertension isn't on here anymore.P06: Oh, it is gone.P06: Sure is, huh?00:42:38Kim: Do you have any idea why that happened?P06: Because I already just claimed it for an increase, so why would it be there?00:42:46Kim: And what do you think about that?P06: This might be a good thing.P06: You know.P06: I don't have... really have no thoughts on that, but that's... that might be a good thing.00:42:59Kim: Okay. All right, now we're gonna add one more condition. So this scenario is a little more complicated. So imagine...00:43:07Kim: about a year ago, you filed a claim for migraines, VAA approved it, gave you a 10% rating, but you believe they should have given you a higher rating then. You went back to your employer, got them to write a letter about how many times you had to miss work because of your migraines, going all the way back to that time a year ago when you filed your claim.00:43:27Kim: And the letter... you think the letter is going to prove that your migraines were more severe than the VA rating percentage.00:43:35Kim: Do you have any questions about this scenario?P06: -00:43:39Kim: Okay, so what do you...P06: It's in a year, though, huh?P06: It was about a year ago, yeah.00:43:44Kim: So, what do you think your options would be?00:43:47Kim: For asking the VA to reconsider.P06: I'm gonna, do a supplemental claim.00:43:53Kim: Okay, and how would you do that on the screen?P06: I'm gonna hit the migraines.00:44:00Kim: Okay. And then, what would you expect to happen next?P06: I'm hoping that it'll come up something for me to say... Why?00:44:11Kim: Okay.P06: Yeah, so we'll see. Let's see what he's gonna say.P06: It's gonna tell me about my headaches, okay.00:44:30Kim: So what's going through your head as you look at this?P06: Mmm, I am asking for an appeal.P06: It's not for an increase, so,P06: But that's... but again, that's because I know better. Yeah.P06: So you're asking... right up there, you're saying, increase.P06: But you can't really... Imagine how a veteran is going to be thinking when they're filling out this form.P06: Yeah.00:45:05Kim: What, you know, one thing I'm wondering, there's these two bullets, one says apply for an increase, and one says Appeal's rating decision.P06: That's what I'm talking about.00:45:13Kim: Is it clear that this is... it's like an either-or?P06: It's an either-or, you know, but it... but based off of...P06: my thought process, based off of the scenario you gave me, I know that I would want to hit the appeal one, but a regular veteran wouldn't... might not know that.00:45:36Kim: Okay.P06: So... But then, now I'm looking at the two dots now that I'm finished reading all of that.P06: That's... that's a... that's still crazy, too, though, because...P06: Some of the veterans' minds are not, their understanding is not really all there.P06: You know, they be thinking that they're hitting the right thing and doing the right thing, but they don't, because...P06: I don't know, I'm not gonna say it's the comprehension, but it is.00:46:13Kim: Yeah.P06: VA claims.00:46:15Kim: Yep.00:46:16Kim: I mean, it's complicated.P06: Yeah.00:46:21Kim: Is there... do you think there's any way that we could make this content more clear?P06: Mmm...P06: Maybe say, are you disagreeing with the previous rating percentage?P06: I don't know, maybe, maybe figure something to say that.P06: Because then they would know, okay, how to answer that, maybe.00:46:59Kim: So, different wording instead of saying, like, appeal, the rating.P06: Percentage, the percentage, the rating percentage, maybe, something. I don't know. Because that's sometimes, that's what confuses them, you know, they got the condition, but you only gave me zero, and my condition is worse than that, I feel.P06: So, am I asking for any increase?P06: Or am I asking to... for you to, go back and re... review my, claim?P06: for a higher percentage, you know? Which, to them, it'd be the same, the increase in a higher percentage, but...P06: I know it's, because I disagree with what they did in the first place.00:47:42Kim: Right.00:47:43Kim: Okay.00:47:45Kim: So really emphasizing that you disagree with that original.P06: rate in pursuit.00:47:50Kim: Amazing.P06: rating percentage, because not the decision of... I would maybe... maybe say the percentage, I don't know.00:47:58Kim: Okay.00:47:59Kim: Because the other thing is that, as I understand it, you could file a supplemental claim and challenge the effective date.P06: Right. Is that right?P06: If you're doing a supplemental, and that... and you're... the boss, well, the boss alreadyP06: Did you turn that in before? Documented, showing that, your stuff was, you'd been taken off a lot?00:48:23Kim: No, I didn't turn that in. I didn't turn... you didn't turn that in before, you just went and got that from your boss.P06: So I'm not gonna... how am I gonna give you an early effective date?P06: If it's not in your record.00:48:33Kim: Right.00:48:36Kim: Okay, that, that's... this is really good feedback on this. We know we need to keep working on it. Let's keep going with the scenario. So this is your, you know, your migraines, and yeah, you're appealing.00:49:02Kim: So, why do you think you're seeing this screen?P06: Because, but that's what we were saying, that the,P06: original decision was incorrect, because I've been taken off too many days.P06: And then they're still trying to make sure that it's not a part of the PACT Act as well, so, you know...P06: So...00:49:33Kim: What do you think of the information here?P06: I got new evidence, because I got the thing for my work... from my work,P06: I meet one of them, so it's fine.00:50:04Kim: Do you think it's... is it information useful?P06: Yeah, because he was thinking it was incorrect, so yeah.00:50:13Kim: I'm sorry, because you were thinking what?P06: Because he was thinking me, I was thinking the information was correct... incorrect.00:50:21Kim: Okay, right, right, right. Because I put that one.P06: work, yeah.P06: I gotcha. Okay.00:50:25Kim: So what would you expect to happen next?P06: It's probably gonna ask me to date that it got worse, I don't know.00:50:35Kim: Alright, go ahead and click continue.P06: Oh, it's gonna show me all of those conditions again that I'm filing for. Okay.00:50:48Kim: Changed on this screen.P06: So, wants to know if I want to file another claim?P06: I want to... I'm reviewing those claims.P06: The asthma, I was previously denied, so it's a supplemental. Then the other one is just a claim for increase, so that's... that's good. And then the other one is, supplemental as well, so...P06: It looks good.00:51:24Kim: Okay.00:51:25Kim: Alright, so let's say that's everything you want to claim today. What would you do next?P06: I hit no. I don't have any other conditions I want to file for.00:51:33Kim: Alright, go ahead and do that, and that's gonna be the end of this prototype, and we're gonna look at the next one.00:51:42Kim: Okay, so let's click on Prototype Apple.00:51:48Kim: We're gonna do the same... some of the same scenarios, but you'll see the design is just a... is a little bit different.00:51:56Kim: So,00:51:59Kim: As this is loading, we're going to go back to the first scenario. You have arthritis in your shoulder that you think is because of an injury from in service.00:52:09Kim: How would you ask for disability for that?P06: On my shoulder?P06: And it happened in the military?00:52:21Kim: Yep.P06: Have I claimed it before?00:52:29Kim: Nope.P06: I would hit a condition I haven't claimed before.00:52:37Kim: Great. So without clicking that, I'm gonna give you another scenario.00:52:41Kim: This is the one where you were denied for asthma about 10 years ago, but since the PACT Act, you think you could get it approved?00:52:50Kim: What would you do for that one?P06: my... your denied conditions. I go down and click on it.00:52:57Kim: So what are you noticing about this screen compared to the one in Banana?P06: And this one has, my rated decisions, and my denied decisions.P06: All of them.P06: I think the other one did a... no, the other one, did it have it have both on it?00:53:19Kim: No.P06: Yeah, if they weren't all on the same screen like this, I do not.00:53:23Kim: That's right.P06: Yeah.00:53:25Kim: Yeah. What do you think about that?P06: I kinda like this a little bit better.P06: Yeah. I'm liking this screen better than the other one.P06: So far. So...00:53:37Kim: Okay, let's go ahead and work through it, and then when we come back to it, you can tell me more what you're thinking about it. So, so you're gonna go ahead and apply for asthma.P06: The shoulder or the asthma?00:53:49Kim: Let's do the asthma.P06: Okay.00:54:02Kim: So, as you look through this screen, tell me what you're noticing.P06: Same thing that the other one asked for.P06: Nothing different. Nothing different. Alright.00:54:22Kim: Okay, so the next one is you want to ask for an increase for hypertension.00:55:02Kim: Okay, and then last one is gonna be the asthma.P06: I already did asthma.00:55:10Kim: Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean asthma, I meant migraines.P06: Okay.00:55:15Kim: Thank you. The migraines that you thought your rating was too low when they gave it to you, and you went back and got that letter from your supervisor?P06: business.00:55:33Kim: What do you think? It's not clicking? Ugh.Madeline Fritz: This is... this is the one that we changed.00:55:40Kim: Can we change it?Madeline Fritz: Yeah, so, yeah, Apple Task 3, this is where we ask about changes in the list of conditions.00:55:48Kim: Right. Thank you so much, Maddie.00:55:52Kim: So, okay, so we're actually not going to work through that migraine one. Tell me, what have you noticed has changed on the screen since you first saw it?00:56:08Kim: If anything has changed.P06: Hmm...P06: I don't know, was that a condition I haven't claimed before there before? I can't remember.P06: Yeah, that was there. Okay, then nothing has changed on it.00:56:24Kim: Okay.00:56:25Kim: Alright, so now, let's...00:56:31Kim: Let's wrap up this prototype. Go ahead and click, click continue, I think.00:56:38Kim: There we go. Okay. So, as we are getting almost done with our time, I want to ask you to compare00:56:46Kim: these two versions.00:56:48Kim: Did you find, between Apple and banana, did you find one of them easier to use?P06: The, which Apple, to me, was a little bit better.00:56:58Kim: Okay, can you talk me through why it was a little better?P06: I had all of the conditions on that one screen, it seems like.00:57:06Kim: Okay.P06: Other than... other than that, that would have been it. You know, it had all of them.P06: I'm not denied April.00:57:16Kim: You can see both of them together if you click that link for comparison screen.P06: Let's see.00:57:21Kim: This'll show you the main screen when it comes up.00:57:31Kim: It's running slowly today.00:57:34Kim: I don't know why.00:57:37Kim: Okay, so you got apple on the left and banana on the right.00:57:45Kim: So tell me, what do you think now about the different versions of this screen? What differences do you notice?P06: Oh, wow.P06: Well...P06: You know, I like the one on the left better now that I'm looking at them.00:58:08Kim: Okay.P06: Because it's telling me the one... the ones that I already got a decision on, and the ones that I've been denied, whereas the...P06: Other one has just got the conditions on it.P06: And it's asking me about a condition previously denied.P06: So, it gives me a chance where I can look and see what I was denied, whereas before.P06: I won't have to... seems like I won't have to go through too many screens if I do this first one, versus hitting the one on the right.00:58:39Kim: Yep, yep, that makes sense.00:58:45Kim: Is there anything else? So you like that it lists out the denied conditions on Apple? Yes. Are there any other...P06: That keeps us from having to ask the veteran, okay, because sometimes they can't pull up theirP06: rated decisions, depending on where they're at, if the internet is not working, you know, they can't go into their app on their phone and pull it up, and then we have to have them go and, see if VA will give them a copy of their rating decision.P06: And so this is much better, because it's listing everything, and they don't have to go do all of that.00:59:21Kim: Right.P06: like a... One-time shop.00:59:26Kim: Yeah, okay.00:59:27Kim: Are there, besides them listing out, this one listing out the denied conditions also, are there any other, differences that matter to you on these screens?P06: The first one is really good, the one on the left that has all of your rated disabilities, your denied disabilities. It's actually telling you don't... we didn't gotta search for the date that they were denied, because they don't remember.P06: some of them don't even know if they filed a claim for the condition before, you know, so... Right. So I like that. I like that much better, now I'm looking at it, yeah.01:00:04Kim: What do you think about the... there's the subheads on the left one that say, like, your rate of disability and your denied conditions?01:00:12Kim: What do you think of those?P06: That's the one I like best.01:00:15Kim: Okay.P06: Yeah, I like that screen better than the other one.01:00:19Kim: Okay. Yeah.01:00:20Kim: One concern we had, and I want to ask you this in your, sort of, advisory capacity, we're a little bit worried about01:00:29Kim: If people keep seeing their list of denied conditions, it might be a little bit upsetting for them.01:00:37Kim: What, what.P06: I didn't think about that.P06: No.P06: No, I don't... I don't think it's gonna be upsetting to them. And the reason for that is some of them,P06: Think that they haven't filed a claim for it, you know? And it might...P06: let them know that, hey, these are some conditions they denied you. It tells us that we can go back over these conditions with them. Okay, so you was denied sleep apnea.P06: And so we can ask them why, you know, or we can ask them different questions based off of their denied issues.P06: So, yeah, I like... I'm gonna still stick with the fir... this, one on the left, not on... not on my left, not...P06: I like that better, and I think they would probably like it better.01:01:31Kim: Yeah, that's, that's really helpful. That's a really good feedback, thank you. Okay, I'm gonna pause, because we're almost out of time, and ask if Juliana or Maddie, if you guys have any follow-up questions.P06: Now, you need to fix it where they can click.P06: The circles, more than one circle per screen, because that gets tedious and...01:01:55Kim: And.P06: discouraging.01:01:58Kim: I have to keep going around.P06: Yeah.01:02:02Kim: Yeah.P06: Yeah.Madeline Fritz: I don't have any questions, but this was incredibly helpful. Thank you, P06.Juliana: I don't have any questions either, but thank you so much.01:02:13Kim: Thanks, guys.01:02:15Kim: P06, what would you say would be the most challenging part of this process for veterans, from what you've seen?P06: This maneuvering,P06: With the other one, maneuvering from page to page to page, you know, they want to just say, let's put it, like, on less...P06: less time-consuming for simplifying it, making it simple.P06: Where the average veteran can be able to... the average older veteran,P06: Can be able to understand it.P06: Okay. Because it's the... we're still dealing with a lot of the older veterans that have no idea, and I don't know if the VA isP06: it's even concerned that these older veterans have no idea. Some of them don't know how to use a computer still, okay? They're relying on a family member or somebody else to do it for them, and sometimes that's too late, you know? Or they could have been service-connected for some conditions that really...P06: That there... that really happened to him.P06: Just making this... making it a little simpler. Simpler for somebody that doesn't know how to use a computer to be able to go in here and file their own claim if they needed to.01:03:31Kim: Okay.01:03:32Kim: Yeah, I mean, that totally makes sense.01:03:35Kim: All right, I think that's everything. I really, really, really appreciate your feedback for us. This was...01:03:45Kim: It's so helpful to hear from somebody who... hear from you, since you talk to veterans all the time. That's a great perspective.01:03:53Kim: And... let's see, Peridian, the recruiting firm, is going to send you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can, pass along to any veterans that you know that might want an opportunity to do this kind of research session with us.01:04:10Kim: This is just so valuable as we try to make the website easier and easier for veterans to use.P06: Okay. Make sure that they know that they need to be able to click more than one circle.01:04:24Kim: Okay. Yeah. I will.P06: Yeah.01:04:26Kim: I will pass that along, definitely.P06: And less screens that they have to go through will have.01:04:32Kim: Problem is.P06: Well, you know, you want to make it as simple for them, you know, to be able to do it.01:04:39Kim: Yep, that's what... that's what we're working for. And I tell you what, it's a big balance, because, like, we want to make it really simple, but then the VA rules are so complicated.P06: Yeah,P06: If... I know Parisian probably has nothing to do with the... the VA could help a lot of this out if they would,P06: do nexus letters for the veterans, but they feel it's a conflict of interest, that they... even though they'll tell the veteran, yeah, this is because...P06: because of this, but they won't put it in writing for them, you know? So that's... that's... all of it is just... they should be more helpful.01:05:18Kim: Etc.01:05:19Kim: I did not know that. Okay.P06: Yeah.01:05:21Kim: Do you have any, questions about the stuff that we've been looking at?P06: nothing that we're looking at, more... VA needs to do more documentation in the veteran's records, health records, they... whoever their provider is.P06: We see that they don't document their health records, they tell the veteran something, but it's not documented in the record.01:05:45Kim: Is that... is that at the VA or the C&P exams?P06: At the VA. The CMP can only do what, based off of what the VA sends them.01:05:54Kim: Right.P06: Dom.01:05:55Kim: And they don't rate the percentage, they just rating, hey, this is what happened during this exam. Yeah, right.P06: you know, the VA has the veteran's actual health record.P06: And that doctor, whoever their doctor is, to kind of cut down on some of these C&P exams as well.01:06:17Kim: I could write more.P06: Right.01:06:19Kim: Oops!P06: So they wouldn't lead to all of the confusion.01:06:22Kim: Yeah.P06: cost, the cost that it's causing the VA.01:06:25Kim: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And also, it's a pain for the veterans to go to those exams, it seems like. Yeah.P06: All of them don't have transportation to get there, miss appointments, different things like that, so it's crazy.01:06:38Kim: Yeah, that makes sense.01:06:40Kim: Alright, well, I hope you have a good rest of your day and a great Thanksgiving.P06: Alright, you too.01:06:46Kim: Thank you.P06: Alright, thank y'all.01:06:48Kim: Bye!P06: Alright, bye.
