WEBVTT 00:00:02Kim: Okay, I've started recording. I'd like to confirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? P07: You want me to click on OK? 00:00:11Kim: Sure. P07: Sure. P07: It's gone. Okay. 00:00:17Kim: So you're okay with us recording? P07: real problem, I'm not gonna be here forever, so... nothing goes fast with the VA. 00:00:26Kim: Alright, so, 00:00:28Kim: Let's get started. I want to hear about your experience getting disability benefits, and just know, since we might touch on parts of your health situation, you don't need to talk about any topics you don't want to. I am really most interested in hearing about your experience with the benefits claims process itself. P07: It sucks. 00:00:49Kim: So tell me, you've filed for disability benefits, I assume. P07: And it's been pending for 2 years. 00:00:58Kim: Okay, how many different times have you filed for disability benefits? P07: Well, the people at the DVA P07: I joined them for a while. They said, keep trying. It took one person 12 years. I says, well, I don't... P07: I don't see it happening, but every time I check, it's still pending to go to a judge. 00:01:23Kim: Okay, do you have any disabilities that the VA has approved? P07: That's what I'm waiting for. P07: I... I... maybe I don't understand the question. 00:01:34Kim: Okay, that's alright. So tell me, so what is it that you're trying to get them to approve for you right now? P07: Well, I never found out I had thyroidism. P07: hypothyroidism, until I got home and joined the VA, which was in 19... or 2012. P07: And then I find out I had the thyroid problem, which answers why I had all those problems and never knew about it. P07: And that's one of my claims, and I went through the process of being interviewed by somebody, and... P07: It's not going anyplace. 00:02:16Kim: Okay, and is... is that the only thing that you've tried to get from the VA, is for the hyper... the thyroidism? P07: No, my nephew was in the Air Force, and he... he has... P07: nail fungus, and I said, well, I'm gonna ask them if I can get a disability for that, because he gets one. So, I tried that, and that's the only two, and they're still pending. 00:02:41Kim: Okay, so those are the only two that you've asked for? P07: Right. 00:02:45Kim: Okay, and then it sounds like you started your claim for thyroidism back in 2012, you said? P07: No, that's when I started with... going to the VA for healthcare. 00:02:57Kim: Okay, so when did you first file a claim? P07: Oh... Probably 2 years ago. 00:03:05Kim: Years ago? Okay. And what was going through your mind when you decided to file that claim? P07: I just wa... I just wanted to see if it... P07: If it worked. I'm talking to all these veterans on RallyPoint, and they don't have any... P07: positive feedback for me. They just said, keep trying. 00:03:31Kim: What is RallyPoint? P07: It's a, it's a group of veterans all over the world that talk on this app called RallyPoint. 00:03:42Kim: Hmm. Okay, that's interesting. And so you're... you're talking to these other veterans, and were they kind of giving you ideas about what you might do? P07: No, the people at the DAV who are... P07: residents of the city I live in, I bump into them every once in a while, and I says, oh, I remember you, yeah, he says, how are you doing? Did you get any place with them? I said, not yet, I'm still waiting for the judge to review. 00:04:11Kim: Okay, okay. So, tell me about when you, the very first, filed your claim. How did you do that? P07: I... I'm a person who likes to investigate, and I... since this phone is sort of new, it's only... P07: 2 years old, I've been looking up a lot of stuff and information. P07: And filling out papers online, and... P07: I just thought, well, this is interesting, I'm gonna pursue it. Not that I thought anything would happen, but I did everything on my phone. P07: Did you... 00:04:50Kim: Do you file the claim on your phone? P07: I couldn't. I had to send... I had to, make paper copies and fill it out and send it to Janesville, Wisconsin. 00:05:02Kim: Okay. And did you, so when you did that, this was about 2 years ago, you said? P07: Yeah, the claim that's in process now, they just started in May... P07: 2025. This is for the second time. 00:05:22Kim: Okay, so the first time you used your phone... sorry, go ahead. P07: I think it was denied, that's why I wasn't getting any place, so I... I'm taking the advice of the people in the DAV. P07: Because they're my sponsor. 00:05:40Kim: Okay. So, it was denied. Do you remember how you found out that it was denied? P07: I got a VA app, and I go in there. P07: Most of the time, it's wrong and not up-to-date, but... P07: when I find something that, well, I guess it's possible, they have denied it, I just accept it as a... I'm done with it. And then these guys talked me into starting it all over again. And they must put in a word for me at the... P07: headquarters down in Janesville, because these... these people are... P07: They're probably my age, but they got more clout than I do. 00:06:19Kim: So are they... have you, signed up with the DAV as your, like, official representative, or... P07: Yes. 00:06:29Kim: So... When was the last time that you had any interaction with the VA about your claim? P07: I guess when they sent it to the judge. 00:06:43Kim: Okay. P07: In May. 00:06:46Kim: In May, they sent it to the judge, and what... 00:06:50Kim: So you were saying that you found out on your VA app that they denied your claim. Why did they deny it? P07: I have no idea. 00:07:00Kim: Okay. 00:07:03Kim: So then you were talking to your... some of your people you knew at the DAV, and you decided to sign up with them... for them to help you? P07: No, I did that before. P07: I had done that already because they needed somebody to represent you, and... I thought, well... P07: try this one. So, I went with the DAV because they got people in the area. P07: Okay. 00:07:32Kim: William... P07: If you can see me and it looks weird, I'm trying to plug my phone in. 00:07:37Kim: No problem! P07: Okay, go ahead. 00:07:39Kim: Okay, so after they denied you, and the folks at the DAV convinced you to try to try again, what did they tell you about what your different options were? 00:07:54Kim: At that point. P07: I... I don't know. P07: Give me an example. Obstacle. 00:08:07Kim: Yeah, so, you could, when you reapply. 00:08:12Kim: you could give them... you could send the VA some new evidence and see if they'll reconsider. You could ask for a different person to review it. You could go to the board. P07: Right now, they... they do not want you to send any information in. P07: It's with this judge person. P07: Because I was just gonna quit, because I had enough of this back and forth. But they talked to people down in Janesville, and... P07: she... he... the guy that was from the DAV told me to call this lady, and she'll help you out, and that's about all I did, and I think somebody's mentioned something to her, and all of a sudden, it's with a judge, and I didn't have no idea why... how it got there. 00:09:06Kim: Okay. And did you ever meet with the judge? P07: No. 00:09:11Kim: I don't know who this person is. P07: They just... they just call him a judge. 00:09:17Kim: Interesting. Okay. 00:09:22Kim: And so, you were saying that they asked you... they didn't ask you to provide any more documents or anything like that? P07: No. 00:09:32Kim: So, do you know, as the DAV is representing you, what's the argument that they're making why you should get approved? P07: They're nice guys. I don't know. 00:09:47Kim: Okay. P07: I didn't even know that was in the process until... P07: I talked to the commander of the... P07: the one I was at, and he says. P07: He sounded like he was pulling for me some way. 00:10:05Kim: That's nice. P07: But I'm not a member, and they don't... they... P07: They said I could not be a member because I was not in combat. P07: But... P07: There's an argument there that they said, yes, you can, and whoever, everybody has a different opinion, and then... P07: I didn't join because they're too... really too serious for me. 00:10:34Kim: Huh. 00:10:35Kim: But they're still working for you, which it sounds like they've been really helpful. P07: Yep. P07: Nice guy, nice guy. 00:10:44Kim: Okay. Can you tell me about the... you said you also applied for the nail fungus? P07: And that I never went to get that checked out, because it sort of stopped right there after I went through the... P07: physical, and... P07: I had to go to Wausau, and they paid me to go to WASA to have the physical done, and have a meeting with some person, and I go, oh, they must be serious about this. P07: And then everything else, I said... the second thing I was there for, I said, is this for the toenail fungus? They said, no. P07: This is still for your thyroid. 00:11:29Kim: Okay, and did you file for the toenail fungus at a different time from the thyroid? P07: Yes. 00:11:35Kim: Can you tell me about that? P07: Not much. P07: Just that my nephew said he did, so I said, well, I'm gonna try. P07: Like, 6 months after I did it with the first one. 00:11:51Kim: Okay, and did you have the DAV do that for you, or how did you do it? P07: I just did the paperwork online and printed it off, and sent it to Madison, or Janesville. 00:12:05Kim: Okay. 00:12:07Kim: Do you remember much about when you were filling out that form? P07: complicated. 00:12:15Kim: complicated? What kind of stands out to you about what was, what was complicated about it? P07: Gee, if I knew you were gonna ask this question, I would dig out my copy, and now I... thinking about it, I don't know where it is. P07: Too many questions, repetitive, very personal sometimes. P07: I was just wishing they'd call me and talk to me and get it done, but that's not the way the VA goes. 00:12:54Kim: Okay. 00:12:56Kim: Alright, so... 00:13:01Kim: So it sounds like, from what you're telling me, they haven't approved any disabilities, so you're not getting any disability compensation from the VA, is that correct? P07: That's correct. 00:13:10Kim: Okay. 00:13:12Kim: So let's move to the second part, and thank you for sharing all of those details with me. 00:13:21Kim: We're gonna look at some designs that we're working on. 00:13:25Kim: So before we get into this prototype, do you need to take a break right now? P07: No, it's nice and quiet. I don't have to answer my niece right away, because she's... P07: doesn't read her. She turns her phone off and goes and does whatever she does, and... P07: She never answers me right away, so... P07: I don't need to answer her. 00:13:50Kim: That's right. Okay. 00:13:53Kim: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna show you, two prototypes for designs that we're working on. And these are... they're kind of like early design prototypes. They're gonna look like the VA website, but they are not the real website. 00:14:10Kim: They're, kind of, they're just, they're kind of fake, and they... they're only partially functional. So, some things you're going to be able to click on, and some things you're not going to be able to click on. You'll see that we've put in some dummy data. 00:14:26Kim: And it's not connected at all to the VA, the real VA database, so nothing that you do today is going to affect your VA benefits or information. P07: Okay? 00:14:38Kim: Okay, so, 00:14:42Kim: The first thing that we're gonna do is I'm gonna put a link to the prototype in the chat window in Zoom. 00:14:52Kim: So let me find my chat window. Hang on just a second. P07: Now, you're talking to a novice. If I have to do anything different, you tell me. 00:15:06Kim: Okay, no problem, we will... Figure this out. Okay. 00:15:12Kim: Kim's... P07: Through meeting group chat. 00:15:15Kim: Yeah, so go ahead and look at that, and then there's a link that you can click on. P07: I would, but it disappeared. 00:15:22Kim: Okay, in your Zoom screen. 00:15:26Kim: There should be a little icon to get to the chat. P07: No, got your name. 00:15:34Kim: Okay, hang on just a minute. And Urena and Maddie, if you guys have any, suggestions or tips... 00:15:43Kim: Go ahead and jump in. Madeline Fritz: Yeah, you should be able to tap the screen that we're chatting in, P07, and maybe see some buttons appear along the bottom. P07: Oh, you're right, I got... okay, I hit chat. Madeline Fritz: Awesome. P07: Now what do I do? Madeline Fritz: So do you... 00:16:01Kim: See that link in there? P07: Yeah? 00:16:06Kim: Okay, so if you tap on that. P07: I did. 00:16:10Kim: Okay. P07: And it went back to my home screen. 00:16:14Kim: Oh, that's interesting. Boy, it went back to your home screen. P07: But I still see you. 00:16:21Kim: Okay, can you tap on it again? P07: Something looks like it's Prototype Apple. 00:16:31Kim: There you go. That works. Okay, so that was step one. 00:16:37Kim: Step 2 is I'm going to ask you to go ahead and go back to Zoom. P07: Okay, tell me how to do that. 00:16:45Kim: You're gonna swipe... P07: Up. 00:16:49Kim: Kind of slowly... P07: Up or sideways? 00:16:56Kim: Which way is gonna work better? Before, when you went off to check your battery and then you came back to Zoom. P07: Yep. 00:17:04Kim: Do that same thing. P07: Okay, it says Prototype apple, prototype banana. 00:17:12Kim: Okay, so we want to get back to your Zoom window. P07: Well... I'll let you... 00:17:27Kim: There we go. Nope, nope. P07: You move, but nothing else happens. 00:17:32Kim: Nothing else happened? 00:17:36Kim: So, the way I do it is I put my finger at the bottom of the screen, and I swipe up slowly, but I keep my finger on there. 00:17:45Kim: And then it should bring up some cards. P07: I'm doing that right now, nothing's happening. 00:17:51Kim: Happening. 00:17:54Kim: Hmm. P07: Should I swipe down? 00:17:57Kim: No, down's not gonna work. Let's see. P07: sideways? 00:18:02Kim: Okay, start at the bottom and swipe up and to the right. 00:18:09Kim: And hold your finger there. P07: Okay, it was right on your picture. 00:18:16Kim: So you see my picture? Oh, click on my picture. P07: now you disappeared. Oh, now we're back to those things on the bottom. 00:18:28Kim: Okay, great, that's what we're looking for. P07: With two... 00:18:31Kim: So the next thing is you're gonna look for a little green button that says Share. P07: I got documents... oh, I got a little arrow above the share. 00:18:54Kim: Yes, click that. P07: Okay... Now I got a bunch of... Screen photos, share camera. 00:19:05Kim: Click on screen. P07: Green broadcast. 00:19:14Kim: Okay. P07: Click on, it says, Start Broadcast. 00:19:18Kim: Yep, click on that. P07: And it's... Winding down and starting something. 00:19:27Kim: Yep, you got it. P07: Well... 00:19:30Kim: Just a minute, that's alright, give it a second. Oh. 00:19:34Kim: Okay, so then we need to... 00:19:39Kim: go back to that link that you clicked before. So, let's see, what's our next step? P07: Even though it's still counting down? 00:19:49Kim: Yeah, that's fine. It's actually working, you got it working great. P07: Okay. 00:19:53Kim: We just need to get back to the prototype. Go ahead and click on your screen, like, maybe in the bottom beneath that box. P07: Dude. P07: Share device is on. 00:20:07Kim: Okay, that is perfect. Go ahead and try doing that slow swipe from the bottom up to the right again. P07: May... should I press the arrow that says you are sharing screen? 00:20:28Kim: Let's try that. I don't know if it'll do anything, but we can try it. P07: It went back to all those icons on the bottom. 00:20:34Kim: Yep, I see that. Okay, do that again. 00:20:40Kim: Okay, go back to the chat. Do you see the chat button on the lower left? P07: Yep. 00:20:45Kim: Okay, go ahead and click that link again. I think this'll fix it, or this'll get us where we need to be. P07: Well, I got your picture, and I went to home page. 00:20:57Kim: I think it's just loading, so give it a moment. P07: Okay. 00:21:02Kim: Now, how do we hide my picture? Because I am in the way. Madeline Fritz: We should be able to just swipe the picture kind of to the edge of the screen. P07: The picture... 00:21:12Kim: Flick... flick the picture off to the right, the picture of me. P07: It... it went to a little person. 00:21:18Kim: Fair, perfect. P07: Okay. Excellent! 00:21:23Kim: P07, you did it! This is, like, the hardest part. P07: Okay, just tell me where my fingers should go. 00:21:30Kim: Okay, so let me, before you click anything. P07: Let me tell you what we're gonna do. We're gonna do an imaginary scenario. 00:21:37Kim: And... 00:21:40Kim: Imagine that, you have a few different health conditions, and you want to apply for disability benefits. 00:21:48Kim: So, you've come to the VA website today to apply. Now, you have heard that you can fill out your disability application online. 00:21:58Kim: Instead of having to print it onto paper and fill it out, you can actually just do it on your phone. 00:22:05Kim: So, we are gonna... 00:22:08Kim: sort of jump into a part of the online application, and you're going to be an imaginary veteran, who is already receiving disability benefits for some conditions, but you want to apply for some new conditions. 00:22:22Kim: So what you're going to see, it's obviously not going to match your real situation, because it's just fake data, but I want you to imagine this is really you, and tell us what you would do as if this was your real situation. P07: Okie dokie! 00:22:35Kim: Okay, and as you click through this, just kind of, verbalize your thoughts out loud so we can understand how it's working for you. So go ahead and click on Prototype Apple. P07: I did. 00:22:47Kim: Okay. 00:22:49Kim: It'll just take a minute to... to load up. 00:22:54Kim: And as I said, this is a rough prototype, so... It's a little funky. P07: I've seen this page many times. 00:23:03Kim: Okay! 00:23:05Kim: Alright, so you should be able to scroll up and down, 00:23:12Kim: So, let's say that in this imaginary scenario, you have started having arthritis in your shoulder. 00:23:21Kim: That you think is because of an injury that you got while you were in service. 00:23:25Kim: And you want to try to claim, disability for that. 00:23:29Kim: How would you go about doing this if this was the screen that you were on? P07: I would hit continue on that one. 00:23:39Kim: Okay, go ahead and do that. P07: Add a condition. 00:23:49Kim: So tell me... yeah, tell me what you're seeing as you look at this. P07: Oh, it's giving me a whole bunch of conditions. What would you like to add? It says, add a condition I haven't claimed before. Hypertension, ringing in your ears. P07: Migraines, knee replacement, asthma, eczemia, sleep apnea, and continue. 00:24:14Kim: Okay, so what... so if you want to, ask them to give you compensation for your arthritis, what would you do on this screen? P07: It's not on this list. 00:24:25Kim: Okay. 00:24:26Kim: Can you, take a minute and think about what... if... if you... if you didn't see it on the list, do you have any other options? P07: I would hit that button that says, a condition I have not claimed before. 00:24:45Kim: Okay, and can you tell me what your thinking is about that? P07: I was hoping that it would bring up other conditions, but it did not. Then I go to the bottom, and it says, need help? And then I... if I didn't get it in a few more minutes, I'd call that 800 number, which I've called many times. 00:25:05Kim: All right, well, you actually, you picked the right option, the condition I haven't claimed before. So let me, ask you about another scenario. 00:25:19Kim: Have you heard of the... a law called the PACT Act? P07: All I heard was PACT Act, yes. 00:25:28Kim: Have you heard about it? P07: Yeah. 00:25:31Kim: Okay. P07: Oh, oh, oh, go ahead, I got some feedback to tell ya. 00:25:37Kim: Okay, go ahead, give me your feedback. P07: I was involved with radiation when I was in the States in the military, because I worked in x-ray department. 00:25:49Kim: Mmm. P07: And I was... P07: I don't know if I pursued that, but I thought that was one of the things from the PACT Act. If you were involved in ionizing radiation, you could file. P07: And so I... I thought I... P07: I can't file anything more until the first stuff gets done. 00:26:17Kim: Hmm. P07: But I worked in radiation for 40 years, so I glow in the dark. 00:26:27Kim: Oh, dear. 00:26:32Kim: So, okay, so you're familiar with the idea behind the PACT Act, that it made some new conditions presumptive, so now it's easier to get some of them covered? P07: Yeah. 00:26:42Kim: Okay, so for this next scenario. 00:26:46Kim: let's imagine that you, had applied... you have asthma, and you applied to get that covered about 10 years ago, but the VA turned you down, because they said they didn't think it was caused by your service. 00:27:03Kim: But now, with the PACT Act. 00:27:05Kim: You think that it might be covered. 00:27:09Kim: And so you want them to, 00:27:14Kim: re... reapply for asthma. How would you do that on this screen? P07: Well, there's this asthma thing with a circle on it, I would click on that. 00:27:24Kim: Okay, so you can go ahead and do that. P07: And it gave me the... Familiar screen of File for Disability, add a condition. 00:27:38Kim: I remember how I said this was a rough prototype and it's a little funky? P07: Okay. 00:27:43Kim: Sometimes it just jumps back up to the top of the screen when it's not supposed to, and it just did that, so sorry about that. P07: Continue? Should I continue on this one? 00:27:55Kim: Yeah, go ahead. P07: Okay... I don't know how you can explain this by looking at a screen and telling a non... P07: Tech person what to do. 00:28:07Kim: What do you mean? You seem like you're doing really well with it. P07: I play around and get myself in trouble, then I have to go back to CELCOM and say, get me out of trouble. P07: Okay, I got that screen that says asthma. 00:28:23Kim: Okay. P07: And on the bottom, it says, cancel adding this condition. P07: You can appeal a denied condition by filing a supplemental claim if you be... P07: Yeah, well, I was gonna try to do that, and then I was told that I couldn't because I got one in the works already. 00:28:46Kim: Oh, that's interesting. Okay, so you've heard the term supplemental claim before? P07: Oh, yeah. 00:28:52Kim: And what does it mean to you? P07: It means adding something on to the already existing disability claims that I have. P07: But... If you do that, you start the process from day one, and you lose all that time. P07: That your first part was being evaluated. 00:29:15Kim: So when you say adding something on, what kind of thing do you mean? P07: If you want me to put asthma in my disability claim. 00:29:24Kim: Okay, okay. So, for example, it would be like, you had that claim for thyroidism, and if you added the toenail fungus, is that what you mean? P07: Oh, if I added the asthma. 00:29:37Kim: Okay, okay. 00:29:39Kim: So that's a... that's what a supplemental claim is? P07: Yeah. 00:29:43Kim: Okay. 00:29:45Kim: Alright, so go ahead and keep looking at this screen. P07: I like this sentence, it says, you have P07: New evidence that suggests our original decision was incorrect, or P07: You'd like us to review your claim based on a new law such as the PACT Act, which I would, but I still think if you start things P07: Going again, you go back to day one, and it'll be 20 years before you find out. 00:30:11Kim: Yeah, I hear you. P07: Okay. 00:30:14Kim: Do you think one of these would be an option for you in this imaginary situation? P07: Yeah, I'd like to review it based on the new laws, such as the PACT Act. 00:30:25Kim: Okay, so let's just pretend you're gonna go ahead and try that, so what would you do? P07: Well, I clicked on that, does not do nothing, and I'll just hit continue. 00:30:37Kim: Okay, and, what do you... 00:30:40Kim: So, okay, so take... go ahead and take a minute and look at this screen. 00:30:49Kim: Tell me what you think is happening here. P07: It wants me to edit My claim for asthma. P07: Should I hit edit? 00:31:05Kim: What do you think would happen if you hit edit? P07: I don't know. 00:31:13Kim: Let's say that you had another thing that you wanted to... another health problem you wanted to add to this claim. P07: It says that, do I have another condition? And you answer yes or no. 00:31:28Kim: Okay, so what would you answer? P07: No. 00:31:34Kim: If you did have another condition you wanted to add, what would you do? P07: Yes. Yes. 00:31:40Kim: Okay, so let's go ahead and do that. P07: Oops. P07: I hit... I hit F and No, both lit up. 00:31:49Kim: That's interesting. Try hitting yes again... P07: I did, they both light up. 00:31:55Kim: Okay, try hitting continue. Again, this is where this thing isn't really working that well. P07: Here I go, continue. 00:32:03Kim: Oh, that's weird. Maddie, did I give a wrong direction here? Madeline Fritz: So, I think it's, if you go... if you click continue and get back to that screen we're looking at, I think this one is where it's really particular, and you need to tap on the circle next to yes instead of the word yes itself. P07: I did. I'll try this again. 00:32:26Kim: I hit... P07: With my pinky finger. 00:32:29Kim: Okay, I think that worked. Go ahead and scroll down to continue. There we go. P07: Okay, yeah, well, okay. 00:32:36Kim: Do you want me to hit continue? Yeah, go ahead. 00:32:39Kim: Sorry about that. P07: Adequately. 00:32:43Kim: So for this next scenario, Let's say that, 00:32:51Kim: Actually, let me ask you a couple questions about this screen first. So in this imaginary scenario, can you tell me... do you have any idea where some of these options are coming from? P07: What do you mean, hypertension? 00:33:06Kim: Yeah, that whole list of things... P07: Related to what you did in the service? 00:33:14Kim: Okay. 00:33:20Kim: What if... yeah, sorry, go ahead. P07: I have no idea what you're looking for. 00:33:25Kim: Just in... so you're, you're kind of this imaginary veteran, And these are... 00:33:33Kim: Where do you think this list of conditions came from? P07: What other people experienced because of their service. 00:33:40Kim: Okay. And what do you think about how the information is organized? P07: It's too simple. There's so many things between the lines, and hypertension, and ear ringing, and headaches, and knee replacement. 00:34:01Kim: Okay. 00:34:02Kim: For this imaginary veteran, can you tell if they're getting disability benefits for any of these conditions that are listed? P07: Not on this screen. 00:34:12Kim: Okay. 00:34:15Kim: Okay. 00:34:16Kim: So, back to our scenario. 00:34:19Kim: About 3 years ago, you got rated for hypertension, and you're getting benefits for that. But in the last month or two, you feel like your hypertension has gotten worse? 00:34:31Kim: And you want to try to get a higher rating. 00:34:34Kim: What would you do here? P07: Submit it again? 00:34:39Kim: Okay, and how would you do that? P07: Clicking on that circle. 00:34:44Kim: Okay, go ahead.P07: Add a condition, hypertension? P07: And hit Continue. 00:34:53Kim: Okay, go ahead. P07: And add a condition, hypertension. 00:35:01Kim: Huh. Yeah. 00:35:02Kim: Try hitting continue again. 00:35:05Kim: There we go. P07: Okay, yeah, gotcha. P07: When did it get worse, and I put the month, day, and year? 00:35:16Kim: Okay, so you can just... 00:35:18Kim: Kind of click in any of those date fields, it's going to automatically fill it in for you. 00:35:23Kim: Like a pretend date. P07: What's... What do you think about this screen? P07: They really, how can I say it? They really want you to cancel adding this conditioner, because P07: They... they highlight it. 00:35:46Kim: But, yeah. P07: They're giving them an example of, well, do you really want to call hypertension as a disability? 00:35:55Kim: Yeah, no, that's... you know what, that is a really good point. That button is really big, isn't it? P07: Yeah. 00:36:01Kim: Yeah. P07: They're fishing. 00:36:06Kim: Yep. 00:36:07Kim: We need to look at changing that, I think. 00:36:11Kim: Okay, tell me what you would do next. P07: Hit continue. P07: Should I do that? 00:36:20Kim: Yeah, go... yes, you can click that. P07: Okay, we're back to asthma now. P07: Hypertension. Do you have another one? 00:36:30Kim: So, what do you think is happening on this screen? P07: They're... they're listing all the disabilities you want to claim. 00:36:38Kim: Okay. So what changed from the last time you saw this? P07: They got 2 of them on. 00:36:46Kim: And why do you think that happened? P07: Because I continued to continue. 00:36:55Kim: What do you think about the information that it's showing you? 00:37:01Kim: Under each condition. 00:37:05Kim: Like, under the... yeah. P07: 10% for hypertension, And... They don't have... no percent, asthma was denied. P07: And they want you to delete it, because it's really bright red. 00:37:25Kim: Okay. 00:37:27Kim: Alright, let's say you want to add one more health issue to this form. What would you do? P07: Take my little finger, and hit yes. P07: And then it continued, but it didn't stay highlighted. 00:37:43Kim: Alright, let's try it again. 00:37:48Kim: Oh, okay. P07: Continue. 00:37:53Kim: Okay, great. P07: Add a condition... You want me... 00:37:58Kim: this? P07: Is this what you expected to see? P07: Yeah, because you wanted to add another one. 00:38:05Kim: Okay. So... 00:38:10Kim: I'm gonna just give you some information about this screen, and then ask you some more questions. So what's happening here is that this imaginary veteran 00:38:18Kim: is actually getting benefits, or actually has been approved by the VA for, tinnitus, migraines, knee replacement, and also hypertension. P07: Except for tinnitus is zero. 00:38:36Kim: Yeah, that's kind of a, have you ever heard of a 0% rating? P07: when I was with the DAV, they mentioned, you know, you can become a member even with zero, and I think you have zero, is what they said. 00:38:53Kim: Yeah, that's right. It's this kind of weird situation where the VA says, yes, you have this condition, and yes, it was caused by your service, but it's not actually severe enough for us to give you any money for it. P07: That is like the VA. 00:39:09Kim: They're a bunch of BS. 00:39:14Kim: So, and this... this imaginary person also had previously applied for sleep apnea and eczema and asthma also, and those have gotten denied. Right. So that... that is why you're seeing these particular conditions on this screen. P07: Okay. 00:39:32Kim: Okay, so let's see, let's... one last thing, this is... you don't have to click and do this, but, 00:39:39Kim: Let's imagine you had, recently been having, 00:39:47Kim: Problems in your, in your shoulder. 00:39:52Kim: that you think were connected to your service. What would you do on this screen if you wanted to get benefits for that? P07: Click on the condition I haven't claimed before. 00:40:09Kim: Okay, and what would you expect to happen after you clicked on that and hit continue? P07: go through all the same BS that I just did. 00:40:17Kim: Okay. 00:40:18Kim: Alright, great, that was really good feedback, and thank you for, being patient with the prototype not working all that well. 00:40:27Kim: Well... P07: This is better than the last time I did this, the last time the young lady... P07: We had too many, P07: What did you say when we... housekeeping thing problems that we had to fix before we could continue on? 00:40:47Kim: When you did one of these research sessions before? P07: Yeah. 00:40:51Kim: Okay. P07: What was new to me, and what probably was new to her, too. 00:40:56Kim: Oh, that's funny. So, I'm hearing that she spent too much time, kind of, like, doing all the housekeeping things at the beginning before you actually got into answering questions. P07: Yeah, because we would always run into something we have to do the housekeeping with. P07: Gotcha. Because I was... I was totally confused, because that was my first time I did this. 00:41:20Kim: Well, it seems you're kind of like a pro at this now. P07: Oh, yeah, right. 00:41:26Kim: Honestly, P07, you did great, like, sometimes it takes so long with that screen sharing thing to get that working, and so you got through it really well. P07: Okay, what next? 00:41:36Kim: Okay, so now we are going to look at a different prototype, so go ahead and just click the continue button at the bottom. 00:41:43Kim: Okay. So that was Prototype Apple, and now we're going to look at a different prototype, Prototype Banana. P07: You want me to click it? 00:41:52Kim: Yeah. 00:41:53Kim: And we're gonna go through the same set of tasks, but the screens are a little bit different. 00:41:58Kim: And before we keep going, do you want to take a break right now? P07: No. P07: Because in 15 minutes, the news goes on. 00:42:08Kim: Okay. 00:42:09Kim: Okay. 00:42:11Kim: So, same scenario as before. You have been having arthritis in your shoulder, and you think it's because of an injury that you got while you were serving in the military. 00:42:22Kim: And you want to ask for disability compensation. 00:42:25Kim: What would you do? P07: Hit continue, add your disability condition. 00:42:31Kim: Okay, and, what's going through your head as you look at this screen right now? P07: This is gonna take forever. My finger's getting tired. 00:42:40Kim: Okay. Alright, go ahead and click continue. P07: Add a condition, Click on a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:42:53Kim: Okay. What are you noticing about this screen? P07: It's very similar to the last one. 00:43:02Kim: Okay. 00:43:03Kim: Do you notice anything different about it from the last one? P07: They have a condition the VA previously denied. 00:43:15Kim: And how is that different from the last one? P07: They'd never asked that before. 00:43:21Kim: Okay. 00:43:22Kim: What do you think about that? P07: I think that's a good idea, because there is a lot of stuff that's been denied, and you're just gonna keep at it until they accept it. 00:43:38Kim: Okay. All right, so on this screen, if you wanted to ask for disability pay for your arthritis, what would you do? P07: I don't remember. I think it was... P07: I don't think it was denied, so I would put, I have a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:44:00Kim: Okay, so you said you don't think it was denied. P07: I can't remember if it was denied it. 00:44:07Kim: Okay. 00:44:09Kim: At this point, would you prefer to see the list of your denied conditions also here? P07: Yeah, because if it was denied, it would click something else. 00:44:23Kim: Okay, gotcha. Alrighty. So the next scenario, it's the same one we did before with asthma. So you applied about 10 years ago, they denied it, but since the PACT Act passed, you think that they should give it to you? 00:44:38Kim: What would you do? P07: Click on it, circle by a condition the VA previously denied. 00:44:46Kim: Okay, and what would you expect to happen, after you chose that? P07: Oh, they're gonna ask me a bunch of other weird questions. 00:44:54Kim: Okay, go ahead and click on that. P07: Nothing hap... nothing happened, I gotta hit continue. 00:45:04Kim: Okay. P07: Okay, previous three denied conditions. P07: You have new evidence, You'd like us to review your claim based on the new law? P07: Asthma? P07: was denied. P07: On the 14th. P07: 2014. P07: Hit continue. 00:45:44Kim: Yeah, before you do that, let me ask you a few questions. 00:45:48Kim: What do you think about the information on this screen? P07: It tells you everything was denied. 00:45:56Kim: Okay, and what about the information, a little bit higher up on the screen? P07: You'd like us to review your claim based on a new law, such as the PACT Act. That's good. 00:46:08Kim: Okay, and so that you're saying that's the one that's relevant to your... to the asthma that was denied? P07: Correct. 00:46:14Kim: Okay. 00:46:15Kim: What is most helpful to you, or most useful on this screen? P07: They want me to choose... choose one! You'll be able to return to this screen later. P07: asked me what would I like to file a supplemental claim for? P07: So I'm still pushing on asthma, so I have to click on the little circle on asthma, and then hit continue. 00:46:50Kim: And at this point, 00:46:53Kim: Are there any questions in your mind about this whole idea of a supplemental claim and refiling for asthma? P07: Why don't these people just pick up the phone and call me, and it will take less time? 00:47:06Kim: Okay. Alright. So go ahead and click on asthma. 00:47:10Kim: And click continue. P07: Okay, I did. 00:47:14Kim: Alright, you need to scroll... it should just jump back up to the top, so go ahead and scroll down. P07: Continue again. 00:47:24Kim: Okay. P07: Asthma... 00:47:29Kim: So, what do you think the purpose of the screen is? P07: Double checking that you're not lying. 00:47:36Kim: Okay. So, for our next scenario, we're gonna do the hypertension, where you already have disability benefits, but it's gotten worse. 00:47:49Kim: And you want to put that, on this form. What would you do here? P07: Click yes right here. P07: Alright, KT. 00:47:59Kim: Go ahead. What would you expect to happen after you do that? P07: Oh, it'll be the same bunch of same questions over and over. 00:48:08Kim: Okay, go ahead and do that. P07: Asthma, denied. P07: Continue... Add another condition. Hit hyper... hypertension. 00:48:26Kim: Okay. 00:48:33Kim: Before you hit continue on this one. 00:48:36Kim: Can you tell me which of the conditions listed here the VA is giving you benefits for already? P07: Migraine 10, knee 30. P07: Hypertension 10... 00:48:52Kim: Okay, great. Okay, so go ahead and click continue for your hypertension. P07: Okie dokie. P07: They want me to file a supplemental claim. P07: To prove it got worse. P07: And they talk about the PACT Act. P07: I should click on my condition has gotten worse. I'm applying for an increase. 00:49:35Kim: So tell me what's going through your head as you're looking at this screen and thinking about these choices. P07: They asked me the right question. 00:49:46Kim: When you say the right question, what do you mean? P07: I want to apply for an increase in benefits, and that's the question they asked. 00:49:56Kim: Okay. What do you think is the difference between these two options? P07: To tell you the truth, I don't know. 00:50:07Kim: Okay. P07: I'm just telling them what I want, and I... P07: And maybe both of them apply, but... P07: I'm apply... I'm appealing a previous decision, but my ti... P07: my condition has gotten worse, and I want to apply for an increase. So, more or less, both of them apply. 00:50:33Kim: Okay. 00:50:34Kim: What would help you... Understand a little bit more about these different options. 00:50:47Kim: That's what... P07: Explaining what they mean by the question. 00:50:51Kim: Okay. 00:50:53Kim: Can you scroll up a little bit? 00:50:57Kim: Yeah. P07: It tells you right there. 00:51:01Kim: So, go ahead and take a minute and look at this, and let me know if this explains anything better. P07: Both of them! It gotten worse, and also I'm refiling because it's... P07: under the PACT Act that this could be P07: an appeal because of the PACT Act. P07: So, I couldn't choose either one, but I would probably choose to apply for an increase. 00:51:41Kim: Okay. 00:51:42Kim: Alright, let's go ahead and, go ahead and make that selection. 00:51:55Kim: Okay, and you can click continue. P07: Continue again. P07: Asthma, hypertension... 00:52:13Kim: So, tell me, what do you think's going on on the screen now? P07: I'm still denied asthma, and I'm still 10% hypertension. 00:52:23Kim: Okay. 00:52:29Kim: Alright, let's, do you... let me just check in with you about the time. It's... 00:52:35Kim: Almost the top of the hour, but, do you have the 15 more minutes? P07: Oh, sure. 00:52:41Kim: Okay, great. Just wanted to double check. Okay, so let's... 00:52:46Kim: True. Let's add one more thing to your claim. You have one more health problem you want to get. What would you do here? P07: Look, yes. 00:52:56Kim: Okay, go ahead. P07: Continue. 00:53:04Kim: Okay. 00:53:11Kim: Okay. 00:53:12Kim: So, for this last scenario, this one's a little bit more complicated. 00:53:17Kim: So imagine that about a year ago, you filed a claim for migraines, and the VA approved it, they gave you a 10% rating, and so you're getting a few hundred dollars every month for that disability. 00:53:32Kim: But you believe they should have given you a higher percentage. 00:53:36Kim: And you want them to reconsider their decision to give you 10%. So, you went back to your employer. 00:53:45Kim: And you got them to write a letter about how many times you had to miss work because of your migraines, going all the way back. 00:53:52Kim: A year ago when you first filed your claim. So, you're hoping this letter from your employer is going to help prove that your migraines were actually more severe than the VA gave you credit for. 00:54:07Kim: Do you have any questions about this scenario? P07: I don't see something I could click on. P07: It's a condition I... P07: already a condition... it's not denied, I don't see anything I can click on except continue, but I... it needs me to click on one of those circles. 00:54:29Kim: Okay, so do you see one of the, 00:54:32Kim: The conditions listed here that's relevant to the scenario. P07: Yeah, migraines, 10%. 00:54:40Kim: Okay. 00:54:42Kim: So, what would you do then? P07: I would click on that circle. 00:54:48Kim: Okay, go ahead. P07: Add a condition, migraines continue. 00:54:55Kim: Okay. P07: Migraines... P07: got worse? P07: Continue. 00:55:09Kim: But continue. Tell me... Oops, can you hit the back button? 00:55:16Kim: Down, down at the bottom, right next to the continue button. P07: And you want me to click on the arrow? 00:55:27Kim: back. P07: I got, I got. 00:55:29Kim: Okay, good, just because I wanted to ask you about this screen. P07: I'm glad. 00:55:33Kim: So I'm wondering, why do you think you're seeing this screen now? P07: Because they're asking me to double-check if that's what I want to do. 00:55:45Kim: Okay, and tell me, you, you picked the first option, tell me your thinking there. 00:55:52Kim: For this migraine scenario. P07: They're thinking I'm trying to squeeze the VA for more money. 00:56:01Kim: Okay. 00:56:03Kim: If you thought not just that, like, you know, your migraines didn't just get worse recently, but you think, like, a year ago when the VA gave you 10%, they were wrong at that point. 00:56:17Kim: And so you went and you got this letter from your employer. 00:56:21Kim: To prove that they were wrong. 00:56:24Kim: Which of these options would be the best one for you? P07: Apply for an increase. 00:56:35Kim: Okay. 00:56:38Kim: Alright, go ahead and click continue. 00:56:45Kim: Is this what you expected to see for the next screen? P07: I have no idea. 00:56:54Kim: Okay, no worries. 00:56:57Kim: So let's say... Sorry, go ahead. P07: You want me to put the date in? 00:57:06Kim: Yeah, let me give you the little bit of detail here. So, let's say that you first applied for migraines. P07: In November of 2024, about a year ago. 00:57:17Kim: And then you got the VA made their decision in January of 2025. 00:57:23Kim: What date do you think you should put in here? P07: It tells me to enter December 1st, 2020. 00:57:35Kim: Why do you think it's telling you that? P07: I don't know. 00:57:40Kim: Okay. 00:57:42Kim: Alright, go ahead and click on the date fields. P07: Now, it says November 1st, 2024. 00:57:49Kim: Okay, so that was when you first applied for migraines. P07: Okay. 00:57:53Kim: Okay, so go ahead and click continue. P07: Asthma, hypertension, and migraines. 00:58:01Kim: Is this what you expected to see? P07: Yeah. 00:58:06Kim: Great. So... What do you think about the information that's under each one of these conditions? P07: It tells you what they are, and it's simple and to the point. 00:58:21Kim: Okay. 00:58:22Kim: Alright, so let's say this is it, you're done adding conditions. 00:58:27Kim: And you want to continue giving the rest of the information for this form, what would you do? P07: No. 00:58:34Kim: Okay, go ahead 00:58:42Kim: Okay. P07: Okay, now what? 00:58:44Kim: Okay, so now we're going to compare the two different prototypes that you saw. I want to hear what you think of the two different ones. Did you find one of them, either apple or banana, easier to use? P07: Banana was easier because I went through all that BS with Apple. 00:59:03Kim: Okay, so just because you did apple first, banana felt easier? P07: Yeah. 00:59:08Kim: Okay, let's say you use banana first and apple second. P07: Probably be the same answer. 00:59:17Kim: Okay. 00:59:18Kim: Did you notice any differences between them? P07: Banana seems simpler. 00:59:26Kim: Okay. 00:59:27Kim: Go ahead and click where it says Comparison Screen. 00:59:33Kim: So this is going to show you... it might be a little bit small on your phone screen, but let's try it. It's going to show you, the main screen between apples on the left and bananas on the right. P07: And where am I gonna get my magnifying glass? 00:59:50Kim: Yeah, sorry about that. You can pinch your screen in Zoom, I think? P07: No, doesn't let me unless I'm not doing... 01:00:01Kim: Sorry about that. This is just to kind of remind you what the difference is between these two screens between Apple and banana. So you've got Apple on the left, banana on the right. P07: And it looks like Apple's got a lot more questions. 01:00:16Kim: Okay. P07: Or, or symptoms, or conditions. 01:00:20Kim: Yeah. So, what do you think the difference is, 01:00:24Kim: Between what it's showing you on the two screens. P07: I don't know if I could read it, maybe I tell ya. 01:00:32Kim: Okay. P07: Let me, let me take my glasses off here. P07: Add a condition, add a condition. Require, require. Well, I think they're about the same. P07: Because I... in the highlighted area, I can't see... we... we've saved your request. P07: I think that says the same thing as the other one, so... 01:01:04Kim: Yes. P07: I don't know if there's anything different. 01:01:07Kim: Yeah, it's really... the difference is just kind of how it's showing you all the different options. P07: Oh, I would like to pick banana because it looks simpler. 01:01:18Kim: Okay. 01:01:22Kim: So, one of the differences between Apple and banana is that on Apple, it's got 01:01:29Kim: your denied conditions, and it lists them out. But on banana. 01:01:35Kim: you just have that bottom option that says a condition the VA previously denied, and then you have to click that button, and then it takes you to a separate screen that shows you your sleep apnea, your asthma, and your eczema that the VA denied. P07: Well, right now, the... on this thing that I'm squinting to see, they got your percentage of disability on the banana. P07: And Apple has it, so... if I didn't understand your question. 01:02:06Kim: So on... on Apple, you can see your denied conditions on this first screen, but on Banana. 01:02:13Kim: You can't see them, you have to go to another screen to see them. P07: Well, you got, you got... P07: What does that say? Migraines, 10% on banana, just like they have migraines on apple. 01:02:28Kim: Yep. But you see, you see asthma on Apple? P07: Yes. 01:02:36Kim: And, can you find it on Banana? P07: No. 01:02:40Kim: Okay, what do you think about that? P07: Make it simple. P07: And don't make you use your finger too much, because it gets arthritis. 01:02:52Kim: Yeah. 01:02:53Kim: So, which one... if you were... wanted to reapply for asthma, which screen would you prefer to use? P07: I would have to use Apple because it's got it mentioned right away. 01:03:05Kim: Okay. 01:03:06Kim: But otherwise, it sounds like you prefer banana because it's simpler? P07: Yes. 01:03:12Kim: Okay. 01:03:16Kim: What do you think about the difference with the boxes around the choices on banana versus not having that on Apple? P07: I like the boxes because it's... P07: It draws your eye to the word hypertension, or tinnitus, or migraines. And the other one. P07: It's more simple, banana. 01:03:40Kim: Okay. 01:03:41Kim: Thinking back about, like, the whole, the whole prototype, what would you say was the most challenging part of this process? P07: Because you have to... Click on the circle, then hit continue, then answer some more questions. P07: They should have something more direct, so this doesn't take forever to fill out. 01:04:06Kim: Okay. And was there anything surprising or unexpected as you went through these prototypes? P07: Not really. 01:04:20Kim: And I asked you before about what a supplemental claim means. Can you just give me a quick description in your own words of what a supplemental claim is? P07: Like, you have more information that would help your disability claim. 01:04:35Kim: Okay. 01:04:36Kim: And is that different from what you thought a supplemental claim was when you started the session? P07: No. 01:04:45Kim: Great. I'm gonna ask Maddie and Urena if you guys have any questions for P07 before we wrap up. P07: Okay. Yurena: Nothing on my end. Madeline Fritz: Same for me, I don't think so. 01:05:02Kim: Okay, great. P07, you gave us, like, really excellent feedback. Thank you so much, and it was really fun talking to you also. 01:05:12Kim: Do you have any other questions or comments for us before we finish up? P07: You can ask that judge to get going on my claim. 01:05:24Kim: I am so sorry, I do not know that judge. P07: I don't either. 01:05:29Kim: Well, it sounds like the DAV is really going to bat for you, so that's really good. 01:05:38Kim: I just want to say I really appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. I know the VA can be frustrating, but we are trying to make things easier, and this kind of feedback that you've given us is just so helpful as we try to make sure at least this website is working better for veterans. P07: You know what happened to me when they first came out and said everything was gonna be easier and faster, and you had to use your login, and you couldn't use this other one. P07: they wouldn't give me access to the V8 because they kept saying, I have... P07: how can I say... I had two... P07: I don't want to use the word claim, but there was two of something out there, so they couldn't give me access. They didn't know which one was true. 01:06:34Kim: So, maybe you had, like, two different, like, user accounts or logins or something? P07: Something like that. 01:06:39Kim: Yeah. P07: That took forever to... to, fix. 01:06:43Kim: Yeah, that whole, the whole login thing is so complicated. 01:06:47Kim: Sorry you went through that. 01:06:50Kim: So, last thing is Perigian, the recruiting company that scheduled you for this, is gonna, send you a thank you, and they're gonna also give you a little blurb that you can pass along to any other veterans you know to give them the chance to participate in this kind of research study if they want to. P07: Oh, I've talked to Shannon many times. 01:07:09Kim: Oh, good, okay, she's awesome. Well, thanks again. I hope you have a good rest of your day. P07: Thank you! Now what do I do? 01:07:19Kim: I'm gonna end the meeting, so you won't need to do anything. P07: Okay, thank you very much, it was fun. 01:07:24Kim: Nice talking to you. P07: You too.
