00:00:02Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so, P08, I've started recording, and I'd like to confirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today? P08: Yes, you do. 00:00:11Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great. 00:00:12Moderator - Madeline: So, we're gonna jump right into that first part of this… of the session. 00:00:18Moderator - Madeline: Excuse me. So, we're gonna get started, and we're just… I'm… 00:00:24Moderator - Madeline: Going from the top, I'd like to hear about your experience getting disability benefits. And again, you know, we might touch on some parts of your health situation, so just, you know, please know that you don't need to talk about any topics you don't want to, and we're just most interested in hearing about your experience with the VA disability benefits process itself. 00:00:41Moderator - Madeline: So, with that, I'm gonna… our observer just joined. 00:00:47Moderator - Madeline: I'm gonna admit her. 00:00:49Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and with that, have you ever filed for disability benefits? P08: Well, yes I did, but it was way back in 1995. 00:01:00Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 00:01:01Moderator - Madeline: And about how many times have you… was that the only time that you've done it, or have you done it another time since? P08: No, that was the only time. 00:01:09Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and how many, disabilities has the VA approved for you? P08: Well… oh my goodness. I would actually have to look at the letter. I'm rated at 80%. 00:01:23Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And I know it's for at least 3 separate, conditions. 00:01:29Moderator - Madeline: Okay, can you, tell me what some of those conditions are? P08: Well, one of them is related to, my left shoulder. P08: One of them was related to, some severe muscle damage that I had done in my back. 00:01:46Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And then, also part of it is related to a total hysterectomy that I had. 00:01:54Moderator - Madeline: Hmm, okay. And all… that's the combined, is the 80% of these conditions? P08: Correct. 00:02:01Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great. 00:02:04Moderator - Madeline: So, and was that 1995 experience, like, was that the last time that you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits? P08: Well, basically, yes, and to be perfectly frank. P08: I do not recall Personally, Requesting disability benefits. P08: they asked me to go to the VA hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. P08: For my, physical. 00:02:37Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: after I re… I retired from the Army. 00:02:40Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: After 21 years in service. 00:02:43Moderator - Madeline: Oh, wow. P08: And so, they… P08: sent me this letter, and I had to report at a particular date and time, and I had to undergo a complete physical. P08: And then that physician is the one who P08: Reviewed my medical records, gave me my exam, and sent P08: all of the paperwork wherever it needed to go, and I think it was, like, 3 months later? P08: I received a letter saying, this is your disability rating. 00:03:20Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And then… I don't know how it is in other states, but in the state of Wisconsin. P08: Every single county has a veteran service officer. P08: And so, you're supposed to record your DD214, P08: that veteran service officer. And so. P08: whenever I went in to do anything with the VSO, He was always on me. P08: They wanted me to try to get 100% disability. P08: And so the VSO would… P08: do… would assist you if you needed assistance. But, I never went for 100% disability because I never wanted to stop working. 00:04:13Moderator - Madeline: Oh, okay. P08: And I didn't stop working until I turned 70. 00:04:17Moderator - Madeline: Okay, okay. 00:04:18Moderator - Madeline: And so, 00:04:20Moderator - Madeline: That 1995 was… that was that when you had the exam, and kind of this ball started rolling, where you got the letter eventually that said you got the 80%. P08: Correct. 00:04:32Moderator - Madeline: Okay, okay. 00:04:34Moderator - Madeline: And, so you said you got the letter, and that was how you found out what the VA decided in terms of what your disability percentage is. Do you remember anything else that the letter might have said? P08: Hmm. P08: No. 00:04:50Moderator - Madeline: Okay, yeah, just wondering if there's any general… 00:04:52Moderator - Madeline: information in there. And what caused your condition, or any of these conditions? P08: 21 years of service in the Army. I mean… Yeah. P08: So… Well, my 21 years… was pure hell. 00:05:12Moderator - Madeline: Mmm. P08: So, and, you know, every unit P08: the vast majority of the time, I was the only woman P08: in any… I tr… I chose non-traditional, career fields. P08: So I was usually the only woman. 00:05:28Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And, I was not appreciated. P08: And my co… in fact, I have to laugh, because when people say they go to war, I was literally going to war every day, because I had some colleagues who literally went out of their way P08: to try to kill me. I mean… P08: My colleagues were my worst enemies, actually. 00:05:50Moderator - Madeline: Hmm… Yeah, wow, I'm sorry to hear that that was your experience. So… 00:05:59Moderator - Madeline: I'm wondering when you, you know, you said 00:06:02Moderator - Madeline: you spent 21 years in the Army, and you got this disability rating, that kind of almost seems like it fell into your lap a little bit after you had the physical and everything. Was there… 00:06:17Moderator - Madeline: any part of the, like, rating that you didn't agree with, or did you feel the 80% was appropriate? I know you said you weren't interested in seeking out 100%. P08: Well… I guess I did think that the 80% was appropriate. I mean, I incurred… So many injuries. 00:06:37Moderator - Madeline: Hmm. P08: During my career. Because, well, back in the day, P08: You didn't have the equipment that you have today. 00:06:49Moderator - Madeline: Stop. P08: So, like, when we were, doing physical fitness training, we didn't have athletic shoes. P08: And we were running, in formation. P08: 4 miles, 3 or 4 miles, in formation, wearing combat boots. 00:07:09Moderator - Madeline: Hmm, P08: So, you were running in combat boots, and P08: it's a contrib… I have severe arthritis as a result of P08: I mean, my… I joke the only… I only have one joint in my body that doesn't have arthritis. 00:07:26Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. P08: Because that's because while I was on active duty, an orthopedic surgeon reconstructed one of my shoulders. 00:07:36Moderator - Madeline: Mmm. P08: So, and in fact, when I was… P08: toward the end of my military career, I could no longer run, and so I was given a P08: physical profile. 00:07:51Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And when I did my physical fitness test, instead of having to run, 2 miles. P08: I had to bike 10 miles. P08: Because bicycling was… You know. P08: Not as hard on the joints as running was. 00:08:17Moderator - Madeline: Okay. And so, let's see… was there any part of the… 00:08:25Moderator - Madeline: I guess this disability notification that you got that, 00:08:31Moderator - Madeline: I know you said it felt appropriate. Is there any part of it that you maybe disagreed with in the decision? P08: Gee whiz. P08: I guess… I guess I was kind of surprised, because I think they gave me a very large percentage P08: of disability. P08: For my hysterectomy. 00:09:01Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: Which, at the time, I didn't understand. P08: However, You know, 31 years later. P08: I understand it completely, because it has affected P08: You know, as a result of getting a hysterectomy so early in my life. P08: I'm… I'm currently osteopenic. P08: So, you know, it's affected my bone density. 00:09:30Moderator - Madeline: Right. P08: So I guess I thought that was a little bit disproportionate at the time, but today I understand it. Whereas my physical injuries… P08: Were very small. P08: And I thought that The physical injuries. P08: Should… probably should have been higher. P08: Because they, they, they cause me pain. P08: And, you know, when you have to live with pain. P08: 24-7, 365, you know, that's kind of hard to deal with. 00:10:06Moderator - Madeline: Right, absolutely. 00:10:08Moderator - Madeline: I'm curious if you, you know, thinking about… we know that the overall rating, percentage is like a… 00:10:17Moderator - Madeline: you know, I know people call it, like, VA math, that each of the conditions will have maybe a different percentage associated with them, and they add up in a way to, equal the overall rating percentage. And, you know, thinking about, you know, some of these, you know, you said your physical injuries, you almost thought that those would be higher, 00:10:35Moderator - Madeline: And I know you're not interested in seeking 100%, but I'm curious, what do you think some of the options might be available to you if you, you know, were to disagree with one of these ratings and… 00:10:47Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, with any of the ratings that the VA gave you. P08: Well, at this point in time, if I disagreed with one of the ratings, I don't see how I would P08: attain any other benefits, because… so, the Madison, Wisconsin VA Hospital is classified as a VA hospital of excellence. P08: Supposedly, it's the best in the country. 00:11:14Moderator - Madeline: Wow. P08: And so… P08: my disability rating may be 80%. However, I get 100% of my medical care through the VA. 00:11:26Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: I don't have any co-pays. P08: And there isn't anything that they don't pay for. P08: And, the only thing I'm not entitled to, if I remember correctly, is dental care through the VA. 00:11:46Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: But that I can understand, because… P08: Fortunately, I never had a dental injury while I was on active duty. 00:11:54Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. P08: So, anything to do with my dental issues are either genetic or… 00:12:02Moderator - Madeline: Hmm. P08: Myself, you know, not… 00:12:04Moderator - Madeline: taking proper care of my teeth or something like that. Right. P08: But I'm even entitled to, P08: nursing home care, should I need it. 00:12:14Moderator - Madeline: Oh, okay, okay, wow. 00:12:16Moderator - Madeline: So I know you said that they, yeah, they take care of a lot of your health needs, I just want to, like, probe a little bit more, and I think you mentioned in the beginning that you've worked with a, DSO individual or office, and… 00:12:34Moderator - Madeline: you know, that you go in, they push you to, you know, work for 100%. Have they mentioned anything in regards of what that process might look like, maybe? P08: No, they never did. I mean, they just more or less said that if this is something that you ever want to pursue, come back. 00:12:52Moderator - Madeline: Okay. And we will walk you through it. Okay. Okay. P08: because, I'm in Iowa County, Wisconsin, and so, since I've been here, we've only had 2 VSOs. 00:13:09Moderator - Madeline: They go in that job and they stay there for a very long period of time. P08: And, both of them have been very hands-on. Okay. And very personable, and they want to help you in any way that they can. 00:13:24Moderator - Madeline: Okay, wow, that's great that they're so committed. 00:13:28Moderator - Madeline: And then, let's see, I've got a few more, kind of, maybe seemingly oddball questions. I'm wondering if you know if any of your conditions are rated at, 0%. 00:13:40Moderator - Madeline: No. Okay. But, but, but, you know. P08: If you would… wanted to, I could probably go dig up that letter within 2 minutes. 00:13:51Moderator - Madeline: You know what, let's, because I know we've got a long session, but depending on our time at the end, we may take you up on that. P08: Okay. 00:13:59Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, that would be great. And then, let's see… 00:14:03Moderator - Madeline: Another one I'm interested in… so, it does sound like most of these, you know, health issues you've had, or that VA recognizes were caused, as you said, directly by something that happened to you while you were in service. P08: Mmm. 00:14:16Moderator - Madeline: But sometimes we know an injury or illness you got while in service can then later cause a whole different health issue. 00:14:23Moderator - Madeline: You know, for example, you injured your knee while you're in service, and now that it's been several years, you've been overcompensating for that bad knee, and now you're starting to have back problems. So it's almost like an indirect cause, but it's still because of your military service. 00:14:37Moderator - Madeline: And I was wondering if you've ever had a situation like that, or have you ever heard of it? P08: Oh, yes, I have heard of it, and I'm sure that I'm experiencing it, because, I have, P08: In the lumbar spine. P08: L4 and L5. P08: are… are really bad. And I also have cervical spine issues, which, there's no doubt in my mind, are attributed to, my military service. And then, I'm also, P08: I volunteered for the Million Veteran Program. 00:15:16Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: So, they have my DNA and everything, and they just recently sent me the survey for the toxic substances. P08: And, of course, one of the questions was, have you ever been stationed at, Fort McClone, Alabama? P08: Which apparently has toxic water. P08: And, I was stationed at Fort McClellan, Alabama twice. P08: So I don't know if it… if that has contributed, but… so now I have… lupus. 00:15:51Moderator - Madeline: Hmm. P08: And I also have MDS, which is a form of blood cancer. 00:15:58Moderator - Madeline: Hmm. P08: And, I also have skin cancer. P08: And, of course, I was stationed in the South, and spent a lot of time in the South. 00:16:08Moderator - Madeline: fun. Yeah. P08: Yeah, and I was stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona 3 times, and spent a lot of time in the sun. And then, of course, they don't give you any P08: you don't get any sun protection from the… when I was in, you didn't get any sun protection from the military. In fact, I had a heat injury, and was hospitalized, so… 00:16:32Moderator - Madeline: Gosh. Man, yeah, your experience is something. 00:16:39Moderator - Madeline: You know, it's funny, you've had time in these hot areas, and you, you know, as you said, you were playing in the snow with your dog this morning. Hopefully that, you know, gives you some kind of reprieve. And let's see, I'm wondering, too, you know, so you said, yes, this kind of situation seemed 00:16:59Moderator - Madeline: sounds familiar, and maybe you've even, as you said, mentioned, have experienced similar situations yourself, where you've had something happen in service, and maybe now it's triggered something else that you're experiencing. Do you happen to know how the VA refers to this kind of situation? P08: Oh, no, I don't. 00:17:16Moderator - Madeline: Okay, okay, that's fine. Just curious. And… 00:17:22Moderator - Madeline: Let's see, and I've just got one more question. So, if you could pretend that I'm a young person, and I've just gone out of the military, and I've got a few health problems for my service, and I want to know how to get disability benefits, can you explain that to me like I don't know anything about it? P08: Well, if you live where I live, I would tell you one of two things. You could either go to the VSO. P08: in Iowa County, and they would definitely walk you through everything that you needed to know about it. Or, you could go to the VA hospital in Madison, and they have a patient advocate there. P08: Okay. And the patient advocate would refer you to the appropriate person who would sit down with you and walk you through the entire process. P08: And then, we're also very fortunate in that we have some very hands-on organizations here, you know, like, if people don't want to drive, so… P08: Okay, I live in an extremely rural community. P08: So, like, for me, it's 8 miles to get to the closest highway. P08: And if they didn't want to drive, most of the small communities have, either A VFW? P08: or another military organization. And every single one of these organizations They'll help you. P08: get going. 00:18:58Moderator - Madeline: Okay? P08: And then, of course, you could go online. P08: And which, you know, young people, they probably all go online. 00:19:06Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. P08: And they would probably… they would probably just Google, how do I get VA benefits? P08: Today, they would probably use AI. 00:19:15Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, yeah, I think you're right about that. How do I… how do I get VA benefits? Yeah. 00:19:22Moderator - Madeline: And then one more question I have related to that. How, again, pretending I'm this young person, I'm asking you, how does the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries? P08: Oh… That's a good question. P08: Because it seems very inconsistent. P08: just… From my personal… there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it. 00:19:49Moderator - Madeline: Anyhow. P08: I know there is a… Table out there somewhere. P08: Because I remember seeing it at one time or another. P08: And then, of course, the thing of it is, so… Like, my 80%? P08: Actually, my individual disabilities added up to more than 80%. 00:20:14Moderator - Madeline: Hi, Dana. P08: Up to more than 100%. P08: But then, you still get 80%. 00:20:21Moderator - Madeline: Right. P08: So, I have no clue how… P08: I mean, I don't understand it. 00:20:27Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, yeah, we… you are certainly not alone in that regard. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you for answering all of those questions, and now we're going to shift into that, part two of the session. But before we get into that, would you like to take a brief break or anything? P08: Oh, no, I'm good. 00:20:46Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great. So, we're going to start evaluating some prototypes. And so, we've got two prototypes, for designs that we're working on. 00:20:54Moderator - Madeline: And these prototypes are not the real website, and they're only partially functional, so some parts of the prototypes are clickable, some aren't. They might behave a little bit differently than a normal website would. 00:21:07Moderator - Madeline: And because it's just a rough prototype, we've put in some dummy data. So it's not connected to the real VA database, it's just sample data, and nothing you do today will affect your VA benefits or information at all. 00:21:20Moderator - Madeline: So, I'm gonna put a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat, and then, are you joining us on a desktop computer, or are you on mobile today? P08: I'm on an iPad. 00:21:30Moderator - Madeline: Okay, okay, great. So, that is perfectly fine. Let me grab our link for you. 00:21:38Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 00:21:40Moderator - Madeline: So, I think before I share the link, we'll, start… set up screen sharing. Have you done that in Zoom before on iPad? P08: Yes. 00:21:49Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great. So, yeah, if you could, go ahead and share your screen, and I think it'll just share the same window. P08: Oh, wait. P08: So, you want me to share my screen? 00:22:07Moderator - Madeline: It might say something like, share content, or… P08: Well, it just said share screen. Everything on your screen, including notifications, will be recorded. 00:22:14Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: So… I should click Screen Broadcast. 00:22:21Moderator - Madeline: Yep, yep. 00:22:30Moderator - Madeline: Okay, amazing. And so, I'm… I think you can tap anywhere on that blurred part of the screen, and it'll take you back to the Zoom window. 00:22:41Moderator - Madeline: Great. So I am now going to paste something in the chat. So I see those buttons along the bottom, there's one that says chat, and it'll probably highlight, yep, because I just sent something. P08: Okay. 00:22:53Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and then you can just tap that link. 00:22:56Moderator - Madeline: And it'll open up a page with our prototypes in the web browser. P08: It says Figma.com. 00:23:07Moderator - Madeline: Perfect. This is… you're killing it, P08. This is usually the hardest part of the session for almost everybody that we talk to. P08: Well, I'm still getting used to this, but I sit on, 3 boards. P08: And every now and then, I have to do… P08: A Zoom session. So, now it says prototype apple or Prototype banana. 00:23:33Moderator - Madeline: Yep, yes it does. So, before, you know what, actually, we'll just go ahead and click on, Prototype Apple. 00:23:44Moderator - Madeline: And it'll… yep, it's gonna load up a new window. And so while this loads, I'm going to, let's see, give some context. So, for this first scenario, I'd like you to imagine that you have a few different health conditions that you want disability benefits for. And so you've come to the VA website today to apply. 00:24:01Moderator - Madeline: And as you'll click through this prototype, again, you'll notice there's some dummy data in there for your imaginary veteran, the one that you're, you know, pretending to be today. And so this imaginary veteran is already receiving some disability benefits for a few conditions, and so their data in here, it's not going to match yours, but I'd like to imagine that you really are this person. 00:24:20Moderator - Madeline: And so, and tell us what you would do as if this were your real situation. 00:24:24Moderator - Madeline: And so just use the prototype as, you know, you would normally interact with a website, and we'd ask that you verbalize your thoughts out loud so we can understand how it's working for you. 00:24:35Moderator - Madeline: So. P08: Okay. 00:24:37Moderator - Madeline: For this first page, let's say, 00:24:40Moderator - Madeline: you've got, you started having arthritis in your shoulder, and you think it's because of an injury you had while in service, and we're gonna ask how you would ask for disability compensation for that. And so this screen is… you've already logged into the VA website, you've started your benefits application. 00:24:59Moderator - Madeline: And… well, yeah, so what's, going through your mind as you see this screen here? P08: Well, I'm seeing that, it says, add your disabilities and conditions. P08: So, I should click on con… I should click on continue. 00:25:18Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: You want me to do that? 00:25:21Moderator - Madeline: Yep, yep, you can go ahead and do that. P08: Okay, add a condition. What condition? Choose one. P08: Well, a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:25:35Moderator - Madeline: Okay, that's what you're… what are you noticing about that option, or what's making you… Call that out. P08: Well, it's… P08: The first one up there, and so it lists my rated disabilities already, and my denied conditions. P08: And you say that, so this is gonna be related to my shoulder. P08: and… So, I want to have that considered now, and it's not listed here anywhere. P08: Okay. Even my shoulder isn't listed. 00:26:10Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. 00:26:11Moderator - Madeline: Bye! Apparently. P08: At a knee replacement. 00:26:14Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, surprise! Okay, that's amazing. We're… there's nothing to click for that first scenario, that's more where we've been interested in how noticeable that option is up there. 00:26:28Moderator - Madeline: So, great for calling that out. So now we're gonna shift into actually interacting with the screens here. So, this is a different scenario, and before we start, have you heard of the PACT Act? P08: Yeah, that has to do with, doesn't that have to do with, the air quality and… and burning of fire pits and everything, and yeah, okay. 00:26:49Moderator - Madeline: Yep, yep. And one thing that it did in relation to those, it's, it basically identified a whole bunch of, conditions or health issues that the VA now presumes you to have, so you don't necessarily would have to, like, provide, you know, doctor's evidence or something. If your service matched up, then they're just like, okay, yes, you have this condition because of your, you know, you were exposed to burn pits or what have you. P08: Similar to the Agent Orange. 00:27:14Moderator - Madeline: Yes, yes. Agent Origin's even included in that. P08: Oh, okay. 00:27:17Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. So, for this scenario, we're going to pretend that you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 10 years ago, but the VA turned down your request because they didn't think it was caused by your military service. But now that the PACT Act has been passed, you've learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition, and they should give you benefits for it. 00:27:37Moderator - Madeline: So, you're going to reapply for asthma. So, starting here, how would you do that on this screen? P08: Well, since it says, P08: I mean, I would just click right next to where it says asthma denied by VA on March 14th, 2014. 00:27:56Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 00:27:58Moderator - Madeline: You can go ahead and do that. P08: So it lit up, so then I would click on continue. 00:28:08Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: So, you can… if you meet one of these requirements, you have new evidence. P08: Or you'd like us to review your claim. P08: If you have new evidence, we'll ask you for it later. P08: I don't want to cancel adding this condition I wanted, so I would continue. 00:28:31Moderator - Madeline: Okay, is there anything that's, anything else that's going through your mind as you look at this screen? P08: No, I don't think so, because it's giving me two different options. P08: I guess I would wonder… P08: I guess I would think that it's easier… P08: To review the claim based on the new law. P08: If I have new evidence, I'm thinking it might be more complicated. 00:29:10Moderator - Madeline: Okay, okay. 00:29:12Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so we can, so you said you would click continue here? P08: Yeah, I would click continue, and I would hope I would get an explanation. P08: How'd you do both of those things? 00:29:24Moderator - Madeline: Okay, okay, so if you can go ahead and do that. P08: Okay, review my condition. Supplemental claim based on new or relevant. P08: Edit or delete? P08: I guess I don't question… I mean, I guess I don't understand that. How would I edit it? Or why would I edit it? 00:29:52Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And why would I delete it when, on the previous screen. 00:29:58Moderator - Madeline: It gave me the opportunity to cancel that request. Okay. 00:30:05Moderator - Madeline: What else do you think about any of the information featured here? P08: Do you have another condition to add? P08: I would just say yes or no, and… which I guess at this time, I don't have another condition to add. 00:30:21Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And then… and then if… if I wanted my condition to… if I wanted this to continue, I would just click P08: No, for the… other condition, and then I would continue. 00:30:36Moderator - Madeline: Okay. So, let's say we're gonna shift now into Scenario 2. Let's say one of the conditions you're already getting benefits for has gotten worse, and so you want to ask for a rating increase on this same form. How would you do that from starting here? P08: Starting here. P08: Oh, I guess I would click yes. Do you have another condition to add? I would click yes. 00:31:10Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and before you do that, what do you expect to happen if you were to click yes and continue? P08: Well, if I… click yes and continue, I would expect to see my conditions show up again. 00:31:26Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: Along… along with maybe an opportunity to add another condition? 00:31:32Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great, so we can go ahead and do that. P08: So click yes. P08: And continue. P08: So, add a condition. What condition would you like to add? P08: Well, it's not a condition I haven't claimed before. -Oh. P08: I just lost my screen. 00:31:56Moderator - Madeline: Let's see… I wonder if you click refresh, if it'll come back, that refresh button in the browser bar. P08: I don't see a refresh button. 00:32:08Moderator - Madeline: So, in the, so where it says Figma.com with the shield in that white box, there's, like, the… yeah. I wonder if that, 00:32:18Moderator - Madeline: That circle that has, like, an arrow on it at the end of the… P08: There you go. 00:32:23Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, let's see if that takes us… 00:32:28Moderator - Madeline: Back to where we need to be. P08: Okay. P08: I got it. 00:32:32Moderator - Madeline: Great. 00:32:33Moderator - Madeline: So, 00:32:35Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, before we, click on anything here, I'm wondering, where do you think this list of options is coming from? P08: Well, the list of options… It should be coming from my previous… P08: Disability benefits that have been granted. 00:33:01Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 00:33:02Moderator - Madeline: And what do you think about how they're organized here? P08: Well, it has those that are rated, and those that were denied originally. P08: And that makes perfect sense to me. 00:33:15Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And it's showing my current ratings for each condition. P08: So, it's like, tinnitus, current rating, 0%. Oh, and I have tinnitus. P08: Which could very well be related to my… P08: military service, because I spent a lot of time on the indoor range. 00:33:39Moderator - Madeline: Mmm… And on this screen, can you tell which things the VA is already giving you benefits for? P08: Well… Yes, I mean, because everything that's been rated. 00:33:55Moderator - Madeline: Okay. And that… P08: down at the bottom, it says denied, so if I've been denied, I'm not getting any benefits for those. 00:34:02Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great. So, back to the scenario where we're going to be, you know. 00:34:08Moderator - Madeline: reapplying, or, you know, asking for a rating increase. Let's say, about 3 years ago that you got rated for hypertension, but in the last month, you feel like your hypertension's gotten worse, and you want to try for a higher rating. What would you do? P08: I would choose the hypertension. P08: under my rated disabilities, and I would click Continue. 00:34:31Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and what would you expect to happen next? P08: Well, I… I think I would want to see some type of a screen. P08: that allows me to state why I would like to have the percentage increased for my hypertension. 00:34:51Moderator - Madeline: Okay, alright, so we can go ahead and do that. P08: When did your condition get worse? You can share an approximate date. P08: Okay, so I would put in a date for when I first noticed, or my… P08: Primary care provider first noticed that my hypertension was getting worse. 00:35:22Moderator - Madeline: Okay. So this is, one of the funky prototype things. You can just click on any of those, or tap on any of those date fields, and it'll just pre-populate. P08: October 1st, 2025. 00:35:37Moderator - Madeline: Yep, there we go. 00:35:40Moderator - Madeline: And so, what would you do next? 00:35:42Moderator - Madeline: I would click continue, because I don't want to cancel it. I want more money, thank you. Okay, perfect. So yeah, we can go ahead and do that. 00:35:57Moderator - Madeline: And sometimes that… yeah, there we go. Yeah, sometimes those left and right arrows cover up the buttons, but you got there. And so, what do you think is happening on this screen, now that we're… it's… we're back here? P08: Well, it wants me to make sure… P08: to verify that this is actually what I want to do. P08: I want… P08: additional… I want my asthma and my hypertension to be reviewed. P08: And so that I can, have increased… Disability benefits. P08: And it's… and it's making sure, again, I don't know why I would edit it, but, you know, the delete is… P08: Yeah, if you made a mistake or something, and you don't want to proceed with that, then get rid of it. P08: But otherwise… 00:36:55Moderator - Madeline: Oh, go ahead. P08: Oh, otherwise I would just, P08: If I didn't have another condition, I would click no and continue. P08: If there was something else I wanted to add to that, I would click yes and continue. 00:37:07Moderator - Madeline: Okay. And, is this screen what you expected to see after the date worsened screen? P08: Well… P08: Hmm… I'd… I guess… Wouldn't they want some kind of explanation for why I want my hypertension reviewed? P08: I mean, I don't know. 00:37:30Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. P08: I guess, the way I sit here… P08: I guess I would just assume, oh, well, they know that I want my conditions to be reviewed, and I'd like my benefit to be increased, and they're gonna do that by just looking at my medical records? P08: Without any input from me. 00:37:55Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: Yeah. 00:37:58Moderator - Madeline: Alright, that is great feedback. And so, we're gonna say that you want to add one more health issue to this form, and you already verbalized what you would do, so you can go ahead and do that. P08: Okay, so I'm back to add a condition. P08: And again, it's… it can be a new condition, or it can be one of my rated disabilities, or one of my denied conditions. 00:38:36Moderator - Madeline: And do you notice anything different about this screen? P08: Well, what I notice is that, it removes. 00:38:48Moderator - Madeline: Hmm. P08: My, rated disabilities. P08: that I'm already requesting, reviews. 00:38:56Moderator - Madeline: Okay. Okay, great. So, now we're going to move to our other prototype. So, from this screen, you can just click Continue at the bottom. 00:39:12Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 00:39:21Moderator - Madeline: Let's see… 00:39:30Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so let's go back to that other, that other tab, that middle tab at the top of your tab row. 00:39:37Moderator - Madeline: We've skipped a little bit here. P08: the Figma one at the top? 00:39:43Moderator - Madeline: Actually, what you can do, so you see that black panel, or that side panel on the side? 00:39:48Moderator - Madeline: That says, like, start banana-apple comparison. You can just click banana in that list. P08: Okay, I'll click banana. 00:39:56Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. P08: There we go. 00:40:00Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great. So, this is our second prototype. 00:40:05Moderator - Madeline: And so, for this first, we're gonna… 00:40:07Moderator - Madeline: the scenarios are going to stay the same, but we've changed some things in design. So, again, for this first scenario, let's say you started having arthritis in your shoulder, and you think it's because of an injury you had while you were in service. So start, again, starting from this screen, where you're already logged in, you started your benefits application, how would you ask for disability compensation for that shoulder? P08: Add your disabilities and conditions. I would add disabilities and conditions, and click continue. 00:40:37Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: Do that? 00:40:39Moderator - Madeline: Yep, yep, you can go ahead and do that. P08: Add a condition. What condition would you like to add? P08: Choose one, you'll return to the screen later if you need to add more. P08: Oh, so this comes up right away with my… hmm… I have a choice to add a condition I haven't claimed before, and then it lists all of my currently approved conditions, and shows me the percentage P08: But if I want to see a condition that the VA previously denied. P08: then I have to do another step. 00:41:23Moderator - Madeline: So, if you wanted to ask for disability pay for your arthritis for this other screen, what would you do? P08: Hmm, so now that's a good condition, a good question, because P08: Unless I remember whether or not P08: A condition I haven't claimed before. I don't know if I've… P08: Claimed for my arthritis or not. P08: And… So I guess, you know, your memory would have to be very good. 00:41:58Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. P08: I mean, you have to know whether or not you've claimed it before. P08: And whether or not it was previously denied. P08: So… 00:42:13Moderator - Madeline: So let's say this, from your own recollection, let's say that this arthritis in the shoulder is something you've just kind of started to notice happening. P08: it would be a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:42:25Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great. But otherwise, you're saying it would… you would like to cross… tracker… P08: Yeah, I… I liked the previous… P08: First, because it showed me, immediately, those things that had been approved, and those things that were denied. P08: Because, you know, sometimes it's difficult, and especially when people are not physically… well. 00:43:02Moderator - Madeline: Or… P08: Especially if people have mental health issues. P08: Or if they're suffering from post-traumatic stress, whether it's P08: Because of sexual assault, or wartime experiences, or whatever. P08: I mean… Are you really gonna remember what you… P08: Were denied in the past, or what you even applied for in the past? 00:43:30Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. P08: So I think it's better if you can see everything, both approved and denied immediately. 00:43:39Moderator - Madeline: Okay, that is excellent feedback. P08: Well, then you don't have to do, like, any independent thinking. 00:43:46Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, I get that, I get that. 00:43:50Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so excellent. So we're gonna shift into that other scenario where you, you've applied for asthma about 10 years ago, the VA turned it down, but now that the PACT Act has been passed, you've learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition, and so that they should give you benefits for it. 00:44:08Moderator - Madeline: So you're going to reapply for asthma. 00:44:11Moderator - Madeline: And how would you do that on this screen? P08: I'd click a condition the VA previously denied and continue. 00:44:17Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and what's going through your mind as you think about doing that? P08: Well, I would hope that once I do that. 00:44:25Moderator - Madeline: My list of previously denied conditions is going to be the next screen that I see. 00:44:31Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so we can go ahead and do that. P08: Sleeping… oh, there's my… Asthma. P08: Denied March 14th, 2014. P08: So, I would click on that and click continue. 00:44:55Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and then, is there… 00:44:59Moderator - Madeline: I'm wondering if there's any information on this screen that is, you know, that you've looked at that you think is related to what you're trying to do here. P08: That… that's what to what I'm trying to do here? 00:45:12Moderator - Madeline: That's related to this scenario, for this imaginary scenario. P08: Oh. P08: What condition would you like to file a supplemental claim for? P08: I mean… That's… the only thing, really. Okay, okay. That option right there. 00:45:31Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so we can, we can go ahead and do that. As you said, you just click Asthma. P08: And then, do I have another condition to add? P08: So… P08: I mean, this looks as though it's been accepted, and that, if I don't want to have anything else reviewed, I would just click no and continue. P08: Or, if I want to add more conditions, I can. 00:46:05Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so let's say that, again, one of the conditions you're already getting benefits for has gotten worse, and so you want to ask for a rating increase. So how would you do that starting from here? P08: I'd click yes and continue. 00:46:19Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so we can go ahead and do that. 00:46:29Moderator - Madeline: So this is our, where we're doing our hypertension scenario. So this is, you know, 3 years ago, you got rated for hypertension. The last month or so, you feel like it's gotten worse, and you want to try for a higher rating. What would you do here? P08: I would click the hypertension choice and continue. 00:46:47Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so you can go ahead and do that. P08: And then it explains that I have two options. P08: for… applying, you know, I can apply for the increase if the condition got worse. P08: Or I could file a supplemental claim if there was new information. P08: So, I would just click, my condition has gotten worse, I'm applying for an increase. 00:47:29Moderator - Madeline: Okay. And what do you think is the difference between these two options here? P08: Well, the difference is… P08: One, the time has passed, and as the time has passed, my condition has gotten worse. 00:47:43Moderator - Madeline: Whereas the other one is, I'm appealing my previous rating, I'm disagreeing with… P08: the previous rating, because I think that they didn't rate me high enough to begin with. 00:47:58Moderator - Madeline: And is there anything in the content here that's unclear or confusing? P08: Ice. P08: Only in one sense, because you've… Explained that, P08: this is a result of the PACT Act, so… but you only mention the PACT Act when you're appealing the VA's rating decision. P08: So… P08: I mean… nobody really knows why a person's asthma is getting worse. I mean, is it a result? P08: of their exposure. P08: Or is it something else? P08: I guess that's the only thing… I guess I don't understand why PACT Act is only mentioned in the Peel area. P08: As opposed to also in the applying for an increase. 00:49:10Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 00:49:12Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so, and what did you… which option did you say you would choose here? P08: Well, I… you said my condition has gotten worse, so I would choose that. 00:49:24Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so we can go ahead and do that. P08: And then it asks me to list the date when my condition got worse. 00:49:40Moderator - Madeline: And so, same thing, we'll say you saw your doctor in early October, that's when you heard the hypertension had gotten worse. 00:49:47Moderator - Madeline: And, yep. 00:49:49Moderator - Madeline: There you go. P08: Click continue. 00:49:54Moderator - Madeline: Yep. P08: So now it's asking me to review my conditions, and it gives me the opportunity to add anything else I would like to. 00:50:08Moderator - Madeline: And so… Oh, go ahead. P08: I just said, or I don't have to, I can choose yes or no if I want to add other conditions. 00:50:18Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and then I have a question here. What do you think of the detailed information under each of the conditions? P08: Asthma denied, supplemental claim based on new, relevant in… well, that's okay. Hypertension? P08: Claim for increase worsened. P08: Yeah, I mean, it states specifically. P08: Why I'm… Asking to have these reviewed. 00:50:51Moderator - Madeline: And why do you think it says claim for increase under hypertension? P08: Well, just because of the fact that it's gotten worse since the original rating was provided. 00:51:11Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so I'm gonna ask you to add one more thing. And so, for starters, let's say you want to add another health issue to the form. I think you've, you know what to do here. P08: Yes? 00:51:25Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. 00:51:31Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: Would you like to add? 00:51:34Moderator - Madeline: Yes, so this scenario is a little bit more complicated. So, I'm going to ask that you imagine that about a year ago, you filed a claim for migraines, and VA approved it and gave you a 10% rating, but you believe they should have given you a higher rating, and you want the VA to reconsider that 10% decision. 00:51:52Moderator - Madeline: So, you went back to your employer, and you got them to write a letter about how many times you had to miss work because of those migraines, going all the way back to when you filed that claim a year ago. And you're hoping that this letter should help prove that your migraines were more severe than that original VA rating percent. 00:52:09Moderator - Madeline: Do you have any questions about this scenario before we move forward? P08: No. 00:52:15Moderator - Madeline: And what do you think your options would be if you were to ask the VA to reconsider their 10% rating decision? P08: Well, I think the same as what I saw on the… P08: previous page, where I want to appeal their original decision. 00:52:35Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so looking at the screen now, what would you do? P08: I'd click the migraine Headaches. P08: And, continue. 00:52:43Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and what would you expect to see next? P08: the choice of… Appealing, or… P08: You know, things have gotten worse since the last time. 00:52:55Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so you can go ahead and do that. P08: Well, what do you know? P08: any increase or a PLBA's rating position. 00:53:09Moderator - Madeline: a sharp one, P08. I think you've got us figured out. P08: So, I would choose, I am appealing my previous rating. 00:53:17Moderator - Madeline: Okay, okay, and any additional context as to why you would make that decision? I know you said a few things on the previous screen. P08: Well, no, because… and I've already gathered all these letters from my employer. P08: So that was my intent from the get-go. 00:53:37Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: Healed this rating. 00:53:39Moderator - Madeline: Okay, great. So we can go ahead and do that. P08: So, you can submit the supplemental claim if you disagree with our… P08: You have new evidence, so… and my letters would be the new evidence. 00:54:03Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And, you know, it doesn't have anything to do with, based on a new law. P08: But yeah, so I meet the requirements of my two choices, and so I would continue. 00:54:19Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so you can go ahead and do that. P08: So that's on there. Do you have another condition to add? P08: So again, I would either say, yes, I do, or no, I don't. P08: And then continue. 00:54:37Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and what do you think about how the, information on the screen is organized here? P08: Well, it makes perfect sense to me. I mean, everything is listed in the order in which I did it, and P08: It states why I'm asking to have my conditions reviewed. 00:55:03Moderator - Madeline: And it gives me the opportunity to… P08: you know, if I made a mistake. 00:55:10Moderator - Madeline: get rid of it, if I don't want to continue with it. P08: but I guess my only question would be. P08: How do I actually submit those letters for my migraine headaches? 00:55:26Moderator - Madeline: And how do you think that… 00:55:28Moderator - Madeline: How do you think you would end up doing that? P08: Well, I don't know, but I would hope that I would be able to, scan the letters P08: into the system and attach it to my request, or that I would be provided with, very specific instructions as to how to submit my, P08: relevant evidence. 00:55:57Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 00:55:59Moderator - Madeline: Great. 00:56:00Moderator - Madeline: So, and let's say that's everything you want to claim today, so what would you do here? P08: I would say, no, I don't have another condition, and continue. 00:56:12Moderator - Madeline: Okay, so we can go ahead and do that. 00:56:21Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And it says, end of… Banana. 00:56:25Moderator - Madeline: Yep, and so from here, we can click that comparison screen link, that third item in the list. 00:56:45Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 00:56:46Moderator - Madeline: So, I'd like to hear from you how you think these two prototypes compare to each other. You know, looking at these here, is there… you know, if it helps jog your memory, but the differences between Apple and banana, did you find one of them easier to use? P08: Well… I much preferred Apple. P08: I think… It just seems Apple tells you everything right up front. P08: There's no second guessing on it, and there's no additional… P08: You know, it just seems like banana makes you to go through an additional step. 00:57:35Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: Because with the Apple, I can do everything right away from the, front screen. P08: And so now, I have a question. Oh. 00:57:49Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, ask away. P08: Well, so… I guess my question comes because we always did everything one at a time. P08: But… can I just go through here and click? P08: on all of the, you know, like, if I knew I wanted to do this right away, I wanted my hypertension to be reviewed, I wanted my migraines to be reviewed, I wanted my asthma to be reviewed. Could I click all three of them at once, and then just hit continue? 00:58:19Moderator - Madeline: What do you think would, 00:58:21Moderator - Madeline: happen if we… if we did that? Or, like, what would you like to see happen? P08: Hmm… Well, if I did that, then, the next screen. P08: would show just those conditions that I selected. 00:58:44Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: and then… You could have them in a little box, like. P08: Over here on the banana thing. P08: and give me two choices. Do you want this reviewed P08: Because of appeal? Or because it got worse? 00:59:00Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And then in those little boxes, I could… P08: Click either appeal or got worse. P08: And maybe then, you know, once I've selected all my conditions, then you could move to the individual ones, because I do realize that you have to add the date that the condition got worse. 00:59:24Moderator - Madeline: Right, right. P08: So, P08: I just think it would be really nice if I could just go… You know, bam, bam, bam. 00:59:38Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, do them all in one fell swoop. 00:59:41Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, okay. Are there any other differences between these screens that you like or don't like? P08: Well… again… So… Visually, I just think apple even looks nicer than banana. 00:59:59Moderator - Madeline: Okay. I don't like those little boxes. 01:00:02Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: And so, you know, I… there's just something about having Bold print. P08: So, like, in the Apple thing, you're rated disabilities, that's in bold print. And then your denied conditions, that's in bold print. P08: there's just something about… Having everything in a little box like that? P08: my brain, stops flowing. I mean… 01:00:37Moderator - Madeline: mmm… P08: It… the boxes are… in my brain, I see the boxes as limitations. 01:00:45Moderator - Madeline: Okay. P08: It's lacking flow, let's put it. 01:00:49Moderator - Madeline: Mmm. 01:00:51Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 01:00:54Moderator - Madeline: Any other feedback on these two screens before I ask a few more kind of general questions? P08: Hmm, no. 01:01:01Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 01:01:03Moderator - Madeline: Awesome. So, I'm curious, what would you say was the most challenging part of this process? P08: The most challenging part. 01:01:12Moderator - Madeline: Of either prototype, or the whole session overall. P08: Well, I actually didn't find anything in the apple to be particularly challenging. P08: In the banana? P08: I think it requires… I think banana requires more focus. 01:01:37Moderator - Madeline: Hmm, okay. P08: It requires more… Reading. P08: it requires more attention. I feel like with the P08: banana, I really had to look at the whole thing. P08: which maybe you should read down to the end anyway, before you start clicking on stuff. P08: But, I don't know, just with the banana lack of continuity, I think. 01:02:16Moderator - Madeline: Okay. Okay. P08: And I don't know why, but for some reason or another, even when I'm looking at my current ratings. P08: Even though Banana has them in a box. P08: To me, they're easier to read. P08: the percentages, so the current 10%, 10%, 30%, whereas… in the boxes. P08: That doesn't pop out to me right away. 01:02:49Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 01:02:50Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 01:02:52Moderator - Madeline: That is all excellent, excellent feedback. 01:02:54Moderator - Madeline: And then, was there anything that was, like, surprising or unexpected as you went through either of the prototypes? P08: Surprising or no. 01:03:05Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 01:03:07Moderator - Madeline: And before this session, had you heard the term supplemental claim before? P08: Supplemental claim. P08: Hmm. No, I don't think so. 01:03:18Moderator - Madeline: Okay, and now that you… P08: You say it, it makes perfect sense. 01:03:22Moderator - Madeline: Okay, I was just gonna ask, now that you've gone through this, how would you explain in your own words what a supplemental claim is? P08: Well, I would say that a supplemental claim is a follow-on to my original submission. P08: for my disability ratings, and that I'm… a supplemental claim is a request for a change. 01:03:50Moderator - Madeline: Okay. 01:03:51Moderator - Madeline: Excellent. 01:03:54Moderator - Madeline: Let's see… and then one more I want to ask. So if we were to look at the Apple screen here on the left, so earlier in the session, we talked about a situation where the disability you got well in service later caused a new or different problem. 01:04:10Moderator - Madeline: And, you know, we talked maybe you had a knee condition, that the VA gave you a rating for, and now you've started to get back pain because you've been overcompensating, and so you want to claim that back pain, even though, again, the original disability was the knee condition. How would you claim the back pain on, 01:04:27Moderator - Madeline: the Apple screen. P08: A condition I haven't claimed before. 01:04:34Moderator - Madeline: Okay, perfect. 01:04:36Moderator - Madeline: So, before we close out, I'm gonna ask if, either Kim or Amy have any questions for P08. Kim Ladin: I do. 01:04:48Moderator - Madeline: Okay. Kim Ladin: We come back on camera. Kim Ladin: Thank you for all that amazing feedback, P08. I have to say, you, like, figured things out really fast. Kim Ladin: So, you were just talking about, what a supplemental claim means to you, and you said that, a supplemental claim is a follow-on to an original, submission from your disability ratings, and it means it's a request for change. Kim Ladin: So, if you think back to a couple of the scenarios that you put on this claim, first of all, the hypertension, where it got worse in the last month. Kim Ladin: And then the migraines, where you felt like the original VA decision was wrong, and you want to try to prove that with a letter from your employer. Kim Ladin: which… Of those conditions, if any of them do you think were a supplemental claim? P08: Well… I would think that they are both a supplemental claim, because. Kim Ladin: Okay. P08: I mean, you've already received a disability rating from the VA, so… P08: Absolutely anything that deviates from that is gonna be a change. P08: And in order to get them to look at anything new or old. P08: You're gonna have to submit a supplemental claim, because P08: You only get one original claim. Kim Ladin: Okay. Kim Ladin: Would you describe either of those situations as an appeal? P08: Well… P08: Yeah, then you're getting into semantics. And I mean, yes, the one is an appeal, because you're appealing the original decision of the migraine headache. Kim Ladin: Okay. P08: But it's still, in order to get them to look at the appeal. P08: I mean, you're, you're, you're having to submit P08: a claim. I mean, I guess… Technicalities. Kim Ladin: Yeah, I know the… the reason I'm asking, I'm not trying to test you at all. There's all this, like, very technical VA language around these things, and we're trying to figure out how to, like. Kim Ladin: Translate it so it's understandable by mere humans. P08: Well, the VA is only going to see it as an appeal. You know, for the migraine headache, they're only going to see it as an appeal. Kim Ladin: Okay. P08: Because you're questioning their original judgment. Kim Ladin: Right. P08: Whereas… P08: In the other instances, you know, it's a change, you're not questioning their judgment. Your particular situation has changed. P08: Yeah. So, in their eyes, they would see that as a supplement. Kim Ladin: Sorry, I lost you the, the hypertension one they would see as a supplement, you said? P08: Yes. Kim Ladin: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Kim Ladin: Great, thank you. I know this is really complicated. One other question. Kim Ladin: As you've gone through this part of the process, and this is just one part of the application, Kim Ladin: How confident are you Kim Ladin: As you move on to the next step of this application, that you're going to have a chance to provide the additional information that you want to about these conditions, whether it's Kim Ladin: Medical records, or documents that you want to upload, or more information that you want to provide. P08: Well… This? P08: stage of the game, not particularly confident. However, you know, just from using, P08: So, like, I file travel claims, because I'm entitled to travel pay for my medical care, and… P08: In that system, they allow you the opportunity to attach documents, so I would hope that P08: That would be added into this P08: part of the deal, so that. Kim Ladin: Okay. P08: going to file an appeal, you then get a new page where you can take a photograph of that document and upload it. Kim Ladin: Okay, great. And yeah, that is… that is what's gonna happen. It's just, like, a step or two later after this part. P08: Right. Kim Ladin: So what do you think about that? Kim Ladin: Having it a little bit later in the process. P08: Oh, well, I think it's necessary to have it later in the process. P08: However, however… P08: So you, you might want to… so, like, in that part where it says, where they're describing your condition got worse, or you're filing an appeal, or whatever, you might want to add a little statement there that says you'll be provided the opportunity to upload your, P08: Proof, or your… Whatever you want to call it. P08: Okay. You might want to put a little statement there so that people know they're going to be given the opportunity to do that. Kim Ladin: Yeah, that's a good idea. Okay, great, thank you so much. 01:10:28Moderator - Madeline: Awesome. Amy, any questions for you? Amy: No, I think… I think we covered a lot. Thanks. 01:10:38Moderator - Madeline: And P08, do you have any comments or questions for me or anyone else on the line? P08: No, I don't think so. I think I… I gave you my opinion. 01:10:47Moderator - Madeline: You don't know. P08: alienated person. Weird. 01:10:50Moderator - Madeline: We're very grateful for the opinion. I will echo what Kim said. You, yeah, were very quick on the, on the uptake on these, and 01:11:01Moderator - Madeline: Yeah, you were excellent. And, so we'll just… we'll wrap this up. We want to say, you know, we all really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. All that feedback, all the insight you provided is so helpful to us. You know, we're going to continue to work on the site, and I, you know, the goal is always to make sure that it really works for veterans. 01:11:20Moderator - Madeline: So, thank you. 01:11:22Moderator - Madeline: And, lastly, Peridium, the recruiting company, they'll be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know, so that you can provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies as well. But all that to say, we just want to say thank you again so much, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. P08: Well, thank you, I appreciate it. Actually, I enjoyed doing that. 01:11:46Moderator - Madeline: Awesome. Love to hear that. And I hope you, are able to stay warm despite the 8 inches of snow you got last night. P08: Oh, yeah, well, today's the perfect day. I'm gonna go back out and play in the snow some more with my dog. 01:11:58Moderator - Madeline: Yay! Ugh, I'm jealous. Kim Ladin: Me too. 01:12:02Moderator - Madeline: Yeah. 01:12:03Moderator - Madeline: Thank you! Thank you, P08. P08: Bye-bye. 01:12:07Moderator - Madeline: Bye.
