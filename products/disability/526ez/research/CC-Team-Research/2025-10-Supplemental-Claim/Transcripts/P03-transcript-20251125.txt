00:00:01Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so I've started recording, and I'd like to confirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today? P03: Yes. 00:00:09Maddie - Moderator: Okay, awesome. 00:00:11Maddie - Moderator: So, we're just gonna go ahead and get started. I… to start for this first part of the session, I'd like to hear about your experience getting disability benefits, and since we might touch on some parts of your health situation, please know that you don't need to talk about any topics that you don't want to. I'm most interested in hearing about your experience with the VA disability benefits process itself. 00:00:31Maddie - Moderator: So, a couple questions in that regard. Have you ever filed for disability benefits? P03: Yes. 00:00:37Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and about how many times? P03: Once. 00:00:41Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and how many disabilities has the VA approved? P03: one… I think I just have one. 00:00:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and can you tell me what that one is? P03: Yeah, I have, like, lupus nephritis. P03: Yeah, and I… actually, I think they gave me, like, hypertension also. 00:01:04Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:01:05Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and do you know what your overall disability percent is? P03: It was 100%. 00:01:09Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:01:10Maddie - Moderator: Great. 00:01:11Maddie - Moderator: And so… and I've got some questions about your most recent experience when you applied for disability benefits. Do you remember when the last time that was? P03: Yeah, it was in 2014. 00:01:24Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and is there, you know, can you tell me about that experience, what that application process was like? P03: Yeah, so, I got a military… P03: I'd been given a heads up, by my doctor, my military doctor, that I probably should go get checked out at the VA. P03: Because I was already having medical issues when I was in, P03: They, just decided that instead of medically separating me, I just asked them to let me get out, because I'd have to stay in longer. P03: To get medically separated. P03: And so, I mean, I probably should have done that in the first place, but… yeah, we don't know that now. P03: But yeah, so I went home, and I just went to the VA, and back in… I was in Oregon at the time. P03: And, it actually went pretty smoothly. I had a, like, there was a veteran service… Group… P03: That kind of just ushered me around. P03: Through all the, the different little places I had to go, they helped me get my paperwork, P03: get my records and told me which ones I needed, and they kind of led me around to each office I needed to go to. 00:02:38Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P03: And so, I actually had a fairly smooth process for… P03: Comparing it to most other people, I feel like. 00:02:47Maddie - Moderator: and so what makes you say that you feel like it was a little bit smoother? Is this, like, just from anecdotal experiences you've heard from others, or… P03: A lot of people don't get… go to medical and get things documented when they have injuries or anything like that. P03: My camera just cut out, but P03: I was just kind of… because my… I, like, my body… I had such a severe, illness, and I was forced into the hospital, so there was just, like, mountains of paperwork that… I had… there was no option of not going to medical or anything like that. 00:03:29Maddie - Moderator: Right, yeah, so the documentation was on your side, it sounds like. P03: Yeah. 00:03:33Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so when you got ready to actually apply for a disability, what was, what were some of the things that were going through your mind? P03: I really didn't know anything about disability or what it was. P03: I was just more interested in the healthcare, and… P03: Being able to, like, get my… get… visit a doctor and, like, try to get whatever is going on figured out. P03: So, that was the main thing. P03: I was focused on. 00:04:06Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And, how did you find out what the VA ultimately decided after you applied? P03: I think I got a, like, letter, and then… P03: Or maybe an e… maybe a letter or phone… I can't remember. Letter or email or something. P03: And then, they back-paid me, like, shortly after they had, like, let me know. P03: Well, then I was like, oh, I guess I have disabil- I have disability now. 00:04:35Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and do you remember what kinds of things the letter or email said? P03: Yeah, I remember it said, like. P03: You're… they said my condition, they said you're total and permanent. P03: Gave me my percentage. P03: Those kind of things. 00:04:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And, what caused your condition? P03: I don't know. P03: They never figured it out. I blame, P03: being on, Fukushima, and helping clean up with the radiation, but that's not really provable, or… P03: Anything like that, so, who knows? 00:05:15Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yeah, my follow-up question was, did the VA agree with that? But you said, it sounds like it was maybe undecided. P03: Yeah, they didn't… there was no, like… I mean, I got sick while I was deployed, and so I had to be taken to a hospital, so they… P03: I mean, it was kind of documented that it happened while I was employed and in the service, but, like, no… they did a biopsy and stuff like that, but, like, there was no, like… P03: I guess, like, concrete proof that, but I guess that what I was told is the way the VA looks at it is if P03: You were fine when you came in, and you're messed up when you get out, like, it's considered the military's fault, so… 00:05:54Maddie - Moderator: Hmm, hmm, okay. 00:05:56Maddie - Moderator: And then I'm wondering, has there ever been a time when you disagreed with a decision the VA made about your disability benefits? P03: Did you say that I disagreed with? P03: No, like… P03: We're… like, I don't know anybody that's ever gotten 100% the first time, so I didn't really have anything to disagree with, like, I was pretty messed up. P03: And so, I feel like, kind of like a little bit of a unicorn. I never had to fight with him. 00:06:26Maddie - Moderator: Mmm, okay. And so… 00:06:30Maddie - Moderator: In that scenario, what do you think might be some of the options if you did disagree with a. P03: I said, well. 00:06:36Maddie - Moderator: Maybe they didn't give you 100% the first time, or… P03: I know there's, like, you can get involved with, like, lawyers and stuff, and… P03: like, they could advocate for you on your behalf. I just, like… I know that's also, like, a minefield. There's a lot of people, like, trying to take advantage of people also. P03: and make you pay for that, and that kind of stuff, but I knew… and then I, luckily, I just got paired up with that veteran service organization. 00:07:05Maddie - Moderator: Like, very quickly, so I didn't have… P03: those issues. 00:07:10Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And then, I want to ask you about, 00:07:14Maddie - Moderator: So let's see, we know that sometimes, or it sounds like, at least in this scenario, most of the disability that you have with VA was caused directly by something that happened while you were in service, but we know that sometimes an injury or illness you got while in service can later cause a whole different health condition. So, for example, maybe you injured your knee while you were in service, and years later, you've been overcompensating for that bad knee. 00:07:37Maddie - Moderator: And now you're starting to have back problems. So it's almost like an indirect cause, but it's still because of your military service. And I was wondering if you've ever, heard of a situation like that. P03: Yeah, I kind of have one. I have, like, kind of severe bone loss in my, P03: Hip from being on steroids. P03: from, the treatments they gave me, but… P03: I mean, I haven't done anything about it, because I'm kind of, like, already at 100%, and I can get seen for anything, so I haven't, like, followed up with, like, trying to document and deal with all that. 00:08:13Maddie - Moderator: And do you… well, and I'm first sorry to hear that that's been your experience, do you… 00:08:21Maddie - Moderator: know how the VA maybe refers to that kind of situation? P03: I really don't know, like, I haven't interacted with the, like. P03: The, like, kind of claims, sort of, like, people. 00:08:34Maddie - Moderator: Hmm. P03: a long time, like, I'm just in constant contact with my doctors and, like. P03: They're doing my checkups and things like that. 00:08:43Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Well, thank you for sharing the details of those experiences with me. 00:08:49Maddie - Moderator: And then I've just got one more question before we get into part two of the session. 00:08:54Maddie - Moderator: So this one is, you know, more… I'm gonna ask for your perspective on how you would describe something, so pretend that I'm a young person, I've just gotten out of the military, and I have a few health problems for my service, and I want to know how to get disability benefits, and so how would you explain that to me? Like, I don't know anything about it, and this is the very first time I've… I'm encountering this process. P03: I would say… P03: Wait, just so I'm… you want me to explain it to you like you don't know what to do when you're trying to get benefits, right? P03: Okay, yeah, I would say… P03: Most importantly, grab all your paperwork, and I'm sure that they have electronic files now. P03: But get copies of everything. P03: go down to the VA, plan on spending a whole day there, don't, like, don't have, like, have to rush out in the middle of it or anything, like, just make that your main focus for the day. P03: Take your time, try not to get frustrated, it's like a slow process, nothing goes quickly, and just because it doesn't happen the first time, you can keep, like. P03: maybe find another angle of, like, ways to go about it, but, yeah, get all your paperwork together, go down to the VA, usually they have, like, some… they have, like, a lot of helpful people there. If there's not, like, a veteran service organization that's at the front, usually, like, there's, P03: Guys that'll, like… you could ask questions in the information desk, they'll ask you where to go, find the claims office, and start… P03: Filling out that paperwork, and all that. 00:10:32Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and then if I do more follow-up. P03: Stop screaming. 00:10:35Maddie - Moderator: I have one more follow-up question. In the same scenario, pretending that I'm someone who's never done this before, how does VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries? P03: Did you say how much money? 00:10:49Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, how much money would… how does VA decide how much they might give me for my… P03: Oh, I know they have, like, Jackson's stock. P03: I know they have, okay, buddy. P03: I know they have, P03: A list of, like, injuries and, like, things that are, like, a certain… Percentage. And so, P03: And so then, stop. P03: And so they'll calculate all those up, depending on what you have documented, and then it gives you… it gives you a certain amount of per… I think it's, like, starting off at E5 pay. 00:11:27Maddie - Moderator: Hmm. P03: And it'll give you a percentage of that. 00:11:30Maddie - Moderator: Oh, okay, okay. 00:11:32Maddie - Moderator: Great. So, this is where we're going to shift into testing the prototypes, and before we get into testing those, this is one of the opportunities where we're able to… would you like to take a brief break, if you'd like? P03: No, I'm good. 00:11:44Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:11:46Maddie - Moderator: So… 00:11:47Maddie - Moderator: I… we're gonna get into evaluating some prototypes. So, we're gonna show you two prototypes for designs that we're working on. 00:11:54Maddie - Moderator: And these prototypes are not the real website, and they're only partially functional. And so some parts of the prototypes are clickable, and some are not, and because it's just a rough prototype, we've put in dummy data, and it's not connected to a real VA database. So nothing you do today will affect your VA benefits or information at all. 00:12:12Maddie - Moderator: And so I am… P03: Fuck. 00:12:14Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so I'm going to put a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat. 00:12:18Maddie - Moderator: And, let's see, I'll do that now. 00:12:24Maddie - Moderator: And so you can navigate to open that link, and once you have that open, if you could please share your screen so we can see what you're doing. 00:12:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay, awesome. 00:12:50Maddie - Moderator: So, for this scenario, we're going to ask that, you imagine that you have a few different health conditions that you want disability benefits for. 00:12:59Maddie - Moderator: And you've come to the VA website today to apply. And so as you click through one of these prototypes, you'll notice there's dummy data in there for your imaginary veteran. And this imaginary veteran is already receiving disability benefits for a few conditions, and so their data won't match yours, but I'd like you to imagine that you really are this person, and tell us what you would do as if this were your real situation. And as you use the prototypes, we would ask that you verbalize your thoughts out loud. 00:13:24Maddie - Moderator: So we can understand how it's working for you, what you're thinking, about as you click through each screen. 00:13:31Maddie - Moderator: So, we're going to start with, Prototype Apple. 00:13:42Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and before we get started, digging through some of these scenarios, one question, have you heard of the PACT Act? P03: Yes. 00:13:53Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:13:54Maddie - Moderator: So, we're gonna say, let's pretend that you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 5 years ago, but the VA turned your request down because they didn't think it was caused by your military service. But since the PACT Act was passed, you've learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition, and they should give you benefits for it. 00:14:15Maddie - Moderator: So, you've arrived to this screen, you've already logged in, and you've started your benefits application. And so, for this first scenario, we're going to ask that you reapply for asthma, which the VA denied when you applied 5 years ago. And since the PACT Act became law, you think the VA should change this decision. 00:14:33Maddie - Moderator: So, starting from here, what's going through your mind as you see this screen? P03: It looks pretty straightforward, like, the… VA website, and then, P03: It looks like I need to push on part… doing that. I've already started the application process. P03: I'm on step 2, I need to click on the next screen to start, answering questions about my, claim. 00:15:00Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great, so you can go ahead and do that. 00:15:06Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so before we click on anything here, what are you… what are some of the things that you're noticing about this screen? P03: It's saying that I need to, I need to select a, condition. It's showing me the different, P03: Ratings for each of the conditions, and then it's also showing me P03: Ones I've been, denied for. 00:15:35Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:15:35Maddie - Moderator: What's going through your mind as you consider what to do here? P03: It was for asthma that I got denied for, so I would be, clicking on the asthma claim at the… near the bottom. 00:15:50Maddie - Moderator: Okay, you can, go ahead and do that. 00:15:56Maddie - Moderator: And so, yeah, take a minute to look at this screen and tell me what you're noticing. P03: It's saying that I can, let's see, add more evidence if I disagree with the claim. P03: And then there's a criteria that I need to meet to be able to do that. I have to have new evidence. P03: Just stop, dude. P03: You have to… And then it says Iowa… P03: have a, so, you either have to have new evidence, or it's based on the new law that's the PACT Act that's gonna, cause them to reconsider your claim. And then it explains what new evidence is and relevant evidence, or… 00:16:40Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what do you think of the information that's presented here? P03: It's, pretty good. And then it, like, it bolds, it makes the, definitions bold, which helps it stick out. P03: So it's pretty clear what they mean by the new and relevant evidence. 00:16:57Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so for this imaginary scenario, how does this information relate to what you're trying to do? P03: So… I would… P03: I mean, I don't think I would have new, evidence, because it's on a previous claim, and it looks like you probably uploaded it, but… P03: I don't know, I would just click continue. 00:17:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yeah, you can go ahead and do that. P03: And then, so, it's asking me… P03: This is the conditioner that you selected. P03: Looks like I can edit or delete it. 00:17:43Maddie - Moderator: I could add more if I needed to. 00:17:46Maddie - Moderator: Okay, what, what do you think about the information that's presented here? P03: It's, I mean, it's giving you a section that says, these are the conditions that you are adding to your, review. P03: And then it's given me the option to add or edit it, so… Seems pretty straightforward. 00:18:08Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so without clicking, if you were to, add another condition to this claim, what would you do next? P03: I would click on the yes, circle. 00:18:23Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And what would you expect to happen? P03: Maybe… a little menu to drop down when I… or something appear below, or maybe I would have to click continue, one of the two. 00:18:38Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:18:39Maddie - Moderator: So, you… we can go ahead and do that. 00:18:47Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And so, once again, before you click on anything, I've just got a few questions for you about this screen. Where do you think this list of options is coming from? P03: I think it's what it was already… so I think this person already has certain disabilities. P03: that the VA approved, and those are the ones that are the hypertension, tendonitis, migraine, and knee replacement. P03: And then, it's showing, it's showing the ones that got denied, which are sleep apnea and eczema. And then, so, like, if you were gonna add one of the ones that you got denied, or if you thought you had a new one, you could… those would be your choices to add to your, review. 00:19:32Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And what do you think about how they're organized here? P03: I feel like maybe, like, the denied conditions would be, like, first, because, like. P03: I don't know why you would be adding… P03: Things that you've already been approved for, or have a disability percentage for. 00:19:51Maddie - Moderator: Mmm, okay, okay. 00:19:53Maddie - Moderator: So can you tell me about the things the VA's already given you benefits for, according to the screen? P03: Yeah, you have, 10% for hypertension, 0 for tendonitis, which doesn't make sense, but… P03: Migraine headaches is 10%, and knee replacement for 30. 00:20:13Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Can you tell me… so what was that about the 0% reading? P03: Oh, it's just like, why did… why do you… why do they give you… why do, like, why are they saying you have a disability, but it's, like, not worth anything? I don't know. Okay. It's just me being ornery. 00:20:29Maddie - Moderator: No, no, no, that's great, that's great feedback. 00:20:32Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so back to the scenario. Let's say for this one, about 3 years ago, you got rated for hypertension, but in the last month, you feel as though your hypertension's gotten worse, and so you want to try for a higher rating. How would you do that? P03: Oh, well, then you would click on the hypertension. 00:20:50Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And what would you expect to happen next? P03: I think they would probably ask you for extra, like, evidence to, like, support your… it being worse, or how… how it's different. 00:21:04Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, you can go ahead and, as you've said, select hypertension. 00:21:12Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so… Yeah, any immediate reactions to what you're seeing here? P03: Oh, I mean, just, it wants to know when it got worse, and so you want to put in a date when you think it, like, started getting better, and when your condition changed. 00:21:28Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do on the screen? P03: I said, if you're back pain, I'd click on the date, or… Okay. 00:21:38Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, this is just one of the funky prototype things. 00:21:43Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so perfect. So let's say, for the sake of this scenario, this is around when you notice the hypertension getting worse. So you've entered in October 1st, 2025, and what would you do next? P03: Push continue. 00:21:58Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yep, you can go ahead. 00:22:02Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:22:03Maddie - Moderator: So, what do you think is happening on this screen? P03: It's showing you what the two conditions you are wanting to get reviewed again. P03: And… Double checking to see if you have anything else you want to add before you continue. 00:22:20Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And can you tell me anything about what's changed on the screen since the last time we saw it? P03: I mean, it added the hypertension. P03: Cosmo is only… er. P03: I don't remember now. One of them wasn't up there before. 00:22:37Maddie - Moderator: And can you, is, you know, now that you're seeing hypertension here, is that what you expected to see on the screen? P03: Yeah, I mean, from the last one, it's showing, like, progression, so I had one before, now I got two. 00:22:53Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. So, let's say you want to add one more health issue to this form, what would you do? P03: Click yes. 00:23:02Maddie - Moderator: So we can go ahead and do that. 00:23:06Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so we're back here, and again, before you click on anything, I want to ask you some questions on this screen. Is there anything that you've noticed that's changed since the last time you saw it? P03: The list of dis- the list of disabilities has gotten smaller, because as we added to it, it's taken away from things that we can add. 00:23:28Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what do you think about that? P03: I mean, it… it's… it's smart, you don't want to, like, have people, like, double-clicking things, or thinking it didn't add it, so now they're adding, like, you have… P03: hypertension two times on there, or anything like that. It makes it less confusing. 00:23:46Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay, that is excellent feedback, and so we're gonna, shift once more as we're gonna transition to the next topic. So if you click continue at the bottom of the screen. 00:23:57Maddie - Moderator: So, yes, great. So, we're going to switch to the other prototype now, and so we're going to walk through the exact same set of tasks, but the screens on this version are going to be a little bit different. And you've done excellent, so please continue to verbalize your thoughts as we go. And then, again, before we begin, would you like to take a brief break, or do you need one? I know the session can… it can feel long. P03: Oh, no, I'm good. 00:24:20Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great, so we are going to click on Prototype Banana. 00:24:28Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so we're back here, and so for this first scenario, you're going to reapply for asthma. This is the one that the VA denied when you applied around 5 years ago, but since the PACT Act became law, you think the VA should change its decision. So, what would you do on this screen? P03: I would push continue. 00:24:46Maddie - Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead and do that. P03: Side note, did… I don't remember now, but did the other one have, like, these links at the bottom for the VSO? 00:24:55Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, this first screen is the same across the prototy. P03: Okay, I couldn't remember seeing it. I was just… that's super helpful, so I just thought that was, like, a good idea somewhere to point veterans to. 00:25:05Maddie - Moderator: Oh, thank you, that's great feedback. 00:25:07Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what are you noticing about this screen? P03: It's asking me, P03: If any of the, it's basically the other screen, they're just not broken up in sections. P03: It was a section for new condition, the ones with your current ratings, and then it had one for… it's not showing the ones that you applied for, but were denied. 00:25:37Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what do you think of the changes here? P03: I don't like so much the f- P03: It's just less organized, and then the fact that they're kind of like… P03: Hiding ones that you had been denied before? P03: I don't know if it's bad, but it's certainly not helpful, like… P03: Maybe somebody was, like, looking for… maybe, I don't know, I was, P03: They always tell us to keep it simple, stupid. 00:26:09Maddie - Moderator: Yeah. Like… P03: I feel like you want to make stuff as, easy to find as possible. 00:26:16Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. So, what would you do next here, since we're, for this situation, we're reapplying for OSMA, which was denied by the VA 5 years ago. P03: So we're gonna click on the condition, VA denied. 00:26:32Maddie - Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead and do that. 00:26:37Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:26:42Maddie - Moderator: So what's going through your head as you look at this screen? P03: Reading it, it's telling me when and, like, kind of why I can appeal a denied Condition… P03: And then it's showing me the list of, conditions I was previously denied for. P03: The… P03: Choose… where it says choose one, and you'll be able to return the screen la- later, like, that's helpful. 00:27:11Maddie - Moderator: Because… P03: say I was trying to do two of these, I would want to be, like, able to, like, hit the little check button or whatever. P03: to, like, check multiple ones, but since I can't, that's comforting, knowing that it says I'll be able to return to the screen later. 00:27:26Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do here? P03: I would click on the asthma. 00:27:32Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yep, you can go ahead. P03: And this is just… reiterating again… P03: saying if you have new evidence, or if, based on the PACT Act, you can resubmit your claim. P03: You know, it seems kind of, I don't know. P03: It seems like… It seems like kind of a pointless page, but I don't know, maybe. 00:28:04Maddie - Moderator: Pointless in what way? P03: Well, it's ju… There's, like, nothing to do here, so you're just, like, getting people who, like… P03: I don't know, it might… like, there's nothing to, like, actively do besides just read this and click continue. Maybe, like… P03: That could be… I don't know, it just seems like it would be tied to the other… P03: other page or something, I don't know. 00:28:28Maddie - Moderator: Would you envision a different action appearing on this page, or… P03: Yeah, maybe, like, on the previous page or something, when you click asthma or something, maybe it has, like, a pop-up window showing that before you just click continue, so you don't have to, like… I don't know. P03: That's just me, though. 00:28:45Maddie - Moderator: No, no, no, this is all, as I said in the beginning, no right or wrong answers, and this is the feedback, kind of feedback we're looking for. 00:28:53Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, in your imaginary scenario with the denied asthma that you think would now be, you know, could be maybe undenied by the VA because of the PACT Act, how is some of the information you're seeing here relate to what you're trying to do? P03: It's just showing me that I can add this in… because of the, pack deck. 00:29:16Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next here? P03: I just hit continue. 00:29:20Maddie - Moderator: Okay, go ahead. 00:29:24Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:29:26Maddie - Moderator: So, what's going through your mind as you look at this screen? P03: It's listing the first claim that I just added. It's told me when it's… it was denied, and then it's kind of, P03: given me a reason, or stated reason why I'm reapplying. P03: Based on new evidence or a change in law. P03: And then it's just asking me if I have more that I want to add. 00:29:50Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:29:51Maddie - Moderator: And so, without clicking, tell me what you would do next if there was another one to add. P03: I'll just hit yes. 00:29:58Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so yep, and what do you expect to happen from here? I know this prototype has been a little bit different than the first one. P03: I would hit yes, and then continue, and then I'm guessing it's gonna give me another list of, P03: claims that I could add on to? 00:30:17Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so we can, we can go ahead and do that. 00:30:23Maddie - Moderator: Awesome. 00:30:24Maddie - Moderator: So, we're gonna say we're… this is coming back to our hypertension scenario. So this is, you know, let's say one of the conditions you're already getting benefits for has gotten worse, and so you want to ask for a rating increase. 00:30:38Maddie - Moderator: And you want to try for a higher rating for your hypertension. 00:30:44Maddie - Moderator: What would you do? P03: Click on the hypertension. 00:30:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and then before we progress, from the screen, 00:30:55Maddie - Moderator: I think we already dug in a little bit on how… your perception of how some of these options are organized, but has that changed at all? P03: Yeah, I still don't like it. I feel like they should just list your previously denied conditions. I mean, it'd be quicker. P03: To have them all right here, and easily accessible, and then clicking this, and then going to another page, or whatever. 00:31:14Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Okay, so, 00:31:18Maddie - Moderator: Yes, so for this scenario, this is the, 3 years ago, you got rated for hypertension, but in the last month, you feel so it's gotten worse, and so you want to try for a higher rating, and so what, you know, you can go ahead and do what you mentioned. P03: High retention. 00:31:37Maddie - Moderator: No worries. Okay. 00:31:41Maddie - Moderator: So… P03: And then it's, given me two options as, like, ways to, like, claim this? P03: It's saying my condition has gotten worse, so I want to increase, or I have more evidence, so I want to appeal it. 00:32:00Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P03: Yeah, I don't… what… I don't… they might be the… they seem kind of very close and similar. P03: Yeah, I don't know. Nevermind. 00:32:15Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what was the Nevermind about? P03: Cause I just had thought about it for a little bit, like, I was like, they seem, like, almost the same, but I'm forgetting that, like. P03: This is for… wait, this is for hypertension, we already have a rating. P03: If you have new, relevant evidence. P03: I don't understand what new… it just seems like if you have new relevant evidence, it's almost the same as my condition is getting worse and I'm applying for increase, because… P03: Either way, you're trying to get an increase? I don't know. It's just… 00:32:48Maddie - Moderator: Hmm. P03: I don't know, it's… seems like it's two things almost saying the same exact thing. 00:32:54Maddie - Moderator: Okay. So, and what do you… if there were a difference between these two options, what do you think it might be? P03: This one almost seems like it only applies to people who got denied, and they're trying… not people who already have, like, a… P03: who already have a rating, because it's like… P03: I don't know why you would be a pre… and this might be just me not knowing anything about the system, I don't know why you would be… P03: Never mind. I don't know. Maybe, I don't know, maybe you found some records and, like, see, I had… P03: higher blood pressures that you guys didn't find before, so I can… I guess I can see why that's… P03: Relevant. 00:33:44Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so for our hypertension scenario, which option would you choose here? P03: The condition has gotten worse because of the other… problem I'm dealing with. 00:33:57Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:33:59Maddie - Moderator: Then you can… we can go ahead and do that. P03: And then, this is… P03: Pretty similar page, it's wanting me to, like, click here and put in the month, day, and year of when it, P03: got worse. 00:34:15Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:34:19Maddie - Moderator: Awesome. So, yep, great. So what do you think is happening on the screen? P03: It's showing me the two I want… P03: my two claims that I want to get reviewed. P03: And it's showing me which one that was denied and which one has a current rating. P03: And it's telling me why I'm asking for, P03: Review on both of them, and then it's checking to see if I have any more conditions I want to add. 00:34:48Maddie - Moderator: And what do you think of the detailed information that's showing up under each of these conditions? P03: I like it, and then it, like, kind of shows if you, like, made a mistake or inputted something wrong, it gives you an option to quickly go back in and edit. 00:35:02Maddie - Moderator: Mmm. P03: Or maybe you added the wrong… maybe you clicked the wrong one. 00:35:06Maddie - Moderator: Yeah. And. P03: it. 00:35:09Maddie - Moderator: And why do you think it says claim for increase under hypertension? P03: Wait, what? 00:35:16Maddie - Moderator: Why do you think it says, claim for increase under hypertension? P03: Oh, because you… you think your hypertension is getting much worse, and so it's, like, more disabling to you. 00:35:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:35:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:35:31Maddie - Moderator: So, let's see… 00:35:33Maddie - Moderator: We have one more scenario with this prototype, so I'm going to ask you to add one more thing, and… excuse me, and let's say you want to add another health issue to this form. What would you do from here? P03: Yes. 00:35:47Maddie - Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead. 00:35:51Maddie - Moderator: And, once again, before you click on anything here, I've got a couple of questions about this screen. 00:35:57Maddie - Moderator: And first being, is there anything that you noticed that's changed since the first time you saw this screen? P03: Just less, one less options for, one less option for, P03: current ratings, because I've already added it to my list of conditions. 00:36:16Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:36:17Maddie - Moderator: And do your sentiments about what you think about that change, are those the same from the first prototype? P03: Yeah, pretty much. 00:36:25Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:36:26Maddie - Moderator: And so, let's add that last condition. This scenario is going to be a little bit more complicated. So, for this scenario, let's imagine that about a year ago, you filed a claim for migraines. 00:36:38Maddie - Moderator: VA approved it, and they gave you a 10% rating. But you believe they should have given you a higher rating, and you want the VA to reconsider that 10% decision. 00:36:47Maddie - Moderator: So you went back to your employer, and you got them to write a letter about how many times you had to miss work because of those migraines, going all the way back to when you filed that claim with the VA a year ago. And this letter should help prove that your migraines are more severe than that original VA rating percent. 00:37:06Maddie - Moderator: So before we progress, are there any questions you have about this scenario? P03: No, I think I got it. 00:37:13Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, and what do you think your options would be if you were to ask the VA to reconsider that 10% rating decision? P03: I would have to click on the, P03: migraines, and then I would have to, like, add a… P03: I don't upload doc… upload my letter or whatever from work. 00:37:32Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:37:33Maddie - Moderator: And so, you can go ahead and do that. 00:37:39Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P03: And then, on this one, I would, be selecting the bottom one, because I, like, have new evidence. 00:37:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay, very easy. P03: my work. 00:37:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Is this screen what you expected to see? P03: Yeah. 00:38:01Maddie - Moderator: And what's, what's going through your head as you look at this, you know, you've seen this screen for the second time now. P03: No, just this bottom option's making more sense to me now that, like, I have the scenario you described. 00:38:13Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Is there anything in particular that's, you know, make… as you said, it's, like, kind of a little bit clearer? P03: Mmm… P03: No, not that I could think of. 00:38:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:38:28Maddie - Moderator: And so, so you said you would choose the second option, and you mentioned the letter from work, so we can go ahead and do that. 00:38:43Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:38:45Maddie - Moderator: So, any immediate reactions to what you're seeing on the screen? P03: Yeah, it's just given me my… my… the requirements to, like, add and… Add new, documents. P03: And stuff like that. 00:39:01Maddie - Moderator: And can you tell me how what's written here relates to the migraine scenario? P03: Because I have… it says I have new, I'd be the first option, because I have new and relevant evidence to submit, and then it's also new evidence that… P03: They haven't seen before, and it's, like, my workplace somehow supporting, my claim. 00:39:25Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next from here? P03: I'll just hit continue. 00:39:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay, go ahead. 00:39:34Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so… what do you think's happening here? P03: I mean, it's showing that I've started the process of adding migraine headaches. P03: to my, P03: claim. I don't know, I would be a little confused. I'd been like, wait, where was I supposed to upload my documents? 00:39:55Maddie - Moderator: Hmm… Can you… is… Arriving to the screen, is this what you expected to see? P03: I mean, yeah, I expected to see that, I don't know, I would have thought that there was, like, another screen in between here to add my, P03: to, like, upload my document into my letter from work about the migraines. I mean, maybe it's in one of the next, like, steps. 00:40:18Maddie - Moderator: Because I can see we're only on 2 of 6, but I don't know, me, naturally, I would be like… P03: Here's my issue, here's my documents, and then on to the next one. 00:40:27Maddie - Moderator: almost like a package deal. Here's the answers to the questions, here's the documents. P03: And just everything about that condition. P03: Yeah. 00:40:37Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P03: I feel like you would probably, like, I don't know, bouncing back and forth between the three to upload all your documents could easily get confused. Jackson, stop. P03: Alright, buddy. 00:40:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:40:52Maddie - Moderator: And so what do you think of how this screen is organized? P03: I mean, it's pretty straightforward, P03: Yeah, I mean, it shows the 3 that I'm working on right now. 00:41:04Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so let's say that that's everything that you want to claim today. What would you do next? P03: I would hit no, because I don't have any more conditions, and then continue. 00:41:16Maddie - Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead. 00:41:20Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:41:22Maddie - Moderator: So, now I'd like to hear from you how these two prototypes compared to each other, and did you find one of these easier to use? P03: The first one was better. 00:41:33Maddie - Moderator: Apple. P03: Yeah. 00:41:34Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and why was that one easier? P03: Just… just as I liked the way it showed all the, P03: all of my, conditions and didn't hide the ones I've been denied for. 00:41:47Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And were there any other differences that you noticed between them? P03: That was, one big thing that stuck out to me. The rest of it was, like, Workable. 00:42:00Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. 00:42:02Maddie - Moderator: And… let's see… from here, do you see that third option, comparison screen? P03: Yes. 00:42:09Maddie - Moderator: Okay, can you click that? 00:42:16Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so this is showing you the first screen for both Apple and banana. What do you think about the different versions of this screen? P03: Yeah, I don't like the… I don't like the boxes, I don't know why, I don't like them. P03: Yeah, this breaks it down into two different, like, well, the three different categories of things you can… I mean, this looks like… the second one looks like one just big blob, I don't know. P03: The way my brain works is I, like, look… I probably, like, start sorting by, like, groups, so that's, like, easier… the first one's easier for me to define. Like, I go, oh, I need one of these three things, oh, I need to look in this area, this act… this… this second one, I have to read everything in it. 00:43:03Maddie - Moderator: Versus in the first one, are you… what are you reading first? P03: Well, the first one I can… I see a condition I haven't claimed before, then I'm going rated disabilities, and I would skip reading all that and go to denied conditions. 00:43:17Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P03: And then based on those 3 things, I'd know which group I need to go to, but that's… P03: Just the way my brain works. 00:43:24Maddie - Moderator: No, no, this is great. And so, if this was actually your disability information, what would show up here? P03: What do you mean? 00:43:33Maddie - Moderator: So envision that you were revisiting your disability claim, and you were seeing your conditions documented. 00:43:40Maddie - Moderator: would you, you know, would you see multiple conditions? Would you have, conditions in… or would you have, like, items in the Rated Disability section and a denied conditions section, or… P03: Are you talking about me personally, or, like, based on the scenario? 00:43:55Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, you personally. P03: Oh, yeah, I would just have the rated disabilities, and… In this section right here. 00:44:04Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Okay. 00:44:06Maddie - Moderator: And what would show up differently between these two screens for you? P03: I mean… It would just be… P03: it would just be… I mean… P03: funnily enough, in my specific situation, the second screen would be more applicable, because I wouldn't have any denied conditions to look at. 00:44:34Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. P03: But… 00:44:36Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so you would have nothing in that section if it were… P03: Yeah, I wouldn't have anything there, so I would just see these 3 things, or whatever. 00:44:43Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P03: these three groups. 00:44:45Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:44:46Maddie - Moderator: Great. So, now I just have some wrap-up questions. What would you say was the… and you can stop sharing if you'd like, unless there's a screen that you might want to revisit, in response to these questions. The first being, what would you say was the most challenging part of this process? 00:45:05Maddie - Moderator: For either prototype. P03: It wasn't challenging, Just the second one kinda made me a little bit more unsure. 00:45:23Maddie - Moderator: Hmm. P03: With not showing my previously denied conditions. P03: I don't know, I just like to have all my information available. P03: And that one doesn't show some of those things. 00:45:39Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:41Maddie - Moderator: Is there anything else that would be… that was… 00:45:43Maddie - Moderator: Maybe confusing or unclear throughout either of these prototypes? P03: No, just, when uploading the documents, I would expect to do that when selecting it. That was the only other thing. 00:45:57Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:58Maddie - Moderator: And was there anything surprising or unexpected as you went through either of these prototypes? P03: No, it was pretty straightforward. 00:46:08Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:46:10Maddie - Moderator: And let's see, before this session, had you heard the term supplemental claim before? P03: No. 00:46:18Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and now that you've done the, like, gone through these two prototypes, how would you explain to me in your own words what a supplemental claim is? P03: A supplemental claim, I would think, would be something… P03: That goes along with a previous or existing claim that you would be adding to your… P03: Kind of total, like, disability rating. 00:46:43Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay, great. 00:46:45Maddie - Moderator: And then, I have a couple more questions about different types of conditions. So if we focus on that, screen at left, the one from the Apple prototype, so if you remember earlier in the session, we talked about a situation where a disability that you got while in service later caused a new and different problem. 00:47:05Maddie - Moderator: And so, let's say you have this knee condition that the VA, that you have a VA rating for, but lately you're starting to have a new problem, maybe you're getting back pain because you're overcompensating for that knee, and so now you want to claim back pain as a disability. 00:47:20Maddie - Moderator: What would you do on that screen? P03: I would click a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:47:26Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:47:28Maddie - Moderator: And then, to formally wrap up the session, are there… I'm gonna ask if any of our folks on the line have, any questions for you. Kim: I have a question. Kim: And P03, your feedback and your talking us through your thinking has been great. So, one of the things we're trying to understand between these two screens… well, there's a couple things. On the one on the left, Apple. Kim: How easy was it to notice that first option? Kim: Right above where it says you're rated disabilities. P03: For me, it was easy, but I could see why some people would skip it, because there's only, like, kind of two bold P03: Sort of, like, categories? P03: But… I read it. Kim: Okay. P03: Hard for me. Kim: Okay, great. And then, if you did have some disabilities that the VA had denied. Kim: And you went through this screen a few times. Kim: Do you… is there any, like, do you have any reaction to seeing those denied disabilities a few different times? P03: Mmm… no. I mean, I might be a little irritated, but… I mean… P03: I don't know, it's also, like, obviously, if you're going to… like, you may have gotten denied because the PACT Act hadn't been introduced in… P03: I feel like it's more helpful to see that than to avoid the irritants. Kim: Yeah, I gotcha. That makes sense. Okay. Kim: That was all my questions. 00:49:22Maddie - Moderator: Sorry, I realized I was muted. Any questions for you, Scott? Scott: Yeah, P03, thank you for participating in this study, first of all. Very good feedback. I was curious, for rated disabilities on either one of these screens for both prototypes, is there any other information Scott: That you might find helpful. Scott: In regards to a rated disability other than what's provided, or do you think it's sufficient? P03: No, I mean, maybe showing their, like, complete percentage right at the moment? I don't know. But, besides that, no, everything else is straightforward and easy to understand. Scott: Okay. Scott: And then in regards to the… to the summary page, after adding a condition. Scott: That was either, for an increase, or that you had additional, evidence that you wanted to provide… you were providing. Scott: If you remember those, those cards that… that showed up on the page, and how after each, Scott: Update that you made. Scott: the additional card would be added. Is there anything… Scott: That would have been more helpful to you to… Scott: In arriving at that page after adding a condition, is there any other information on that page that might be helpful? P03: I couldn't think of any, information… At the… right now. Scott: Okay. Scott: And did it make sense to you? Scott: as you… Made new condition changes. Scott: The reason why braided conditions were not appearing in the list of things that you could select from? P03: Boy, after… are you asking, like, after I added them, why they weren't appearing in the list? Scott: Right, so, like, after you added one, and then you went through to, add another one, it made sense to you that, one you had previously added was no longer, an option for… for adding. P03: Yeah, yeah, that made sense, because, I mean, you don't want to, like, create multiple of the same by accident. Scott: Yep. Scott: Okay. Thank you, P03. 00:51:49Maddie - Moderator: Awesome. And P03, do you have any comments or questions for me or anyone else on the line? P03: No. 00:51:57Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:51:58Maddie - Moderator: Amazing. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today, and I'll echo Kim and Scott's comments that your feedback today has been so, so helpful to us, as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans. So, thank you. And lastly, Paridian will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans. 00:52:21Maddie - Moderator: You may know, so that you can provide them with a chance to participate in future research studies as well. 00:52:26Maddie - Moderator: And so, with that, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day! P03: Alrighty, thank you guys. Kim: Thank you! 00:52:34Maddie - Moderator: so much.
