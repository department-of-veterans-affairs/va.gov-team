00:00:01Maddie - Moderator: Alright, so I've started recording, and I'd like to confirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?P05: Yes.00:00:09Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. So, we're just gonna jump right into the first part of this session. In this part, we want to hear about your experiences getting disability benefits.00:00:19Maddie - Moderator: And we might touch on some parts of your health situation, so please know that you don't need to talk about any topics that you don't want to. And what we're most interested in hearing is about your experience with the VA disability benefits process itself.00:00:32Maddie - Moderator: So have you ever filed for disability benefits?P05: I did, and I believe it was probably back in 23.00:00:40Maddie - Moderator: Okay. It's when it... it's when it first came up.P05: It was at a remote site, probably about 7 miles from where I actually live.P05: Down here in South Florida.00:00:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: easy enough to find, just almost like a small strip office complex, probably, maybe around 8 different offices.P05: I really didn't understand it at first, because I, I thought...P05: Who was there was more of staff than...00:01:12Maddie - Moderator: Hmm.P05: An interviewer, or somebody to take assessments?00:01:15Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.P05: But as it turned out, the person who was there was the administrator, was the assessor, was the everything. Okay.00:01:24Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. And what's Only time that you filed?P05: Yes.00:01:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and how many... oh, go ahead.P05: Go ahead.00:01:32Maddie - Moderator: I was gonna say, how many, disabilities has the VA... did the VA approve during that, instance?P05: Just one time.00:01:39Maddie - Moderator: Okay, or just one disability as well?P05: One disability right now.00:01:42Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. And can you tell me what that is?P05: I had... a condition that is, I guess, anxiety-ridden?P05: where I would get almost like a Parkinson's sort of affair, you know, hand twitching and... and tremors, I guess is what they've,P05: classified it as. It gave me a 10% disability.P05: I was really looking for a little bit more than that. They have put me on a medicine that I've been taking, has prescribed for the last couple years, propanolinol.00:02:18Maddie - Moderator: I believe.P05: is the name of it. It's a small little blue dot-type pill.00:02:22Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: And I'm sure it's of a low dosage, I think it's either 5 or... Maybe 15 milligrams.P05: And I take that twice a day as prescribed.00:02:35Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and is that 10% your overall disability percent, do you know?P05: It is.00:02:40Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great.P05: That's... that's as much as what they... Gave me at that time.00:02:45Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:02:46Maddie - Moderator: And, let's see, you told us some great details about that experience when you most recently dealt with the VA regarding, getting that disability benefit.00:02:56Maddie - Moderator: And I'm interested, too, in knowing, like, when you did that application process, what was going through your mind?P05: Well, like I said, upon arriving at the address in question,P05: Their office wasn't that easy to find. It wasn't on, like, the front part of...P05: this strip of offices. You had to go around to the back, and then go through an alcove just to get into theirs. That's why I was...P05: kind of surprised. I'm expecting maybe not a full-blown VA facility, sort of a fair big building.P05: But I wasn't expecting something as small as, like a two-room office.P05: the testing really consisted of asking questions where I was stationed.P05: what I might have been subjected to when I was in NAM.P05: Overall time?P05: I don't know, maybe a half hour, 45 minutes?P05: And, you know, she answered all of my questions that I had. Okay.P05: Was it an okay experience? Yeah, it was okay.P05: feeling comfortable, it wasn't what I was expecting.P05: And, you know, it turned out okay. It's... it... it is what it is.P05: maybe I should be thankful that it's only 10%, and I'm not 50% disabled or anything else.00:04:21Maddie - Moderator: Right.P05: play it like that.P05: you know, the medicine keeps working. I have a regular,P05: Geriatric doctor through the VA, her name is,P05: I don't remember her first name, but Allopathy is her last name.00:04:38Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: woman, I enjoy her a lot, I see her,P05: I try and see her twice a year, I think that's how she has me scheduled.00:04:45Maddie - Moderator: She gets.P05: resume updates, and now in between her, we also have, Somebody that's in the pharmacy.P05: area.00:04:56Maddie - Moderator: Which...P05: what she prescribes, he provides, whether it's through mail order, or if there's a reason why I might be in the VA facility, which is close for me, very convenient, he'll dispense right there on the spot, so... Got it. That seems to be good.00:05:15Maddie - Moderator: That's... yeah, that's great to hear that it's so been, you know, the after bits have been more... very conveniently located for you.00:05:23Maddie - Moderator: I'm wondering, so when you went to this, kind of, as you said, like, office and distort mall kind of situation, was this, like, the exam to assess, you know, your facility? It was, or... It was. Okay, so did... then did you later complete a00:05:37Maddie - Moderator: Disability Benefits Form.00:05:39Maddie - Moderator: You might...P05: Maybe the.00:05:40Maddie - Moderator: Numbers 526, easy.P05: I... I think I filled that out.00:05:46Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: I, I had a meeting with,P05: I think her name was Ray, R-A-E, and I think her last name was Brown.P05: And she was a representative... I don't know if she was really a representative from the VA?P05: Because I met her at, like, a city hall, Type of building.00:06:07Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: And I think, some way or another, she was affiliated with an American Legion branch.P05: And she was the one that initially helped me out to fill out the forms, and really to apply for the PAC.P05: She, she helped me with, registering for that, and,P05: Since that time, that was the only time that I saw her, but, you know, through the mail,P05: I had seen her name on the disability forms that I took to that office.P05: And that's really about Bennett by her.00:06:47Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so did you do the form after the exam, or was it vice versa, if you remember?P05: Vice versa.00:06:55Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. So you did the form, and then you went to the... okay, got it. That's great. And so how did you ultimately find out what the VA decided?P05: Through a mailing. Okay. It would be a... to me.P05: Again, I think, I really don't know the exact date that I went there for that.00:07:14Maddie - Moderator: That's okay.P05: Right.00:07:15Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.P05: But it was, like, probably about...P05: 3 months, maybe 4 months later.00:07:21Maddie - Moderator: Okay. I received, U.S. mail. Got it.P05: what they thought was, my condition, and I guess according to their guidelines, what I'm...P05: My disability is rated at.00:07:33Maddie - Moderator: And, did the VA, you know, if you detailed what caused your condition, did the VA agree with that?P05: I guess so. You know, I was... I was thinking at the time that I was...P05: Perhaps more disabled than what they classified me as?P05: And I haven't, appealed or gone for a higher disability rating.00:07:59Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: but it is what it is. Maybe I'm just too lazy, but I'm not, per se, suffering fromP05: Per se, being disabled.00:08:12Maddie - Moderator: Okay. I don't feel myself as...P05: disabled other than the essential tremors or whatever. And that's being held in check with the,P05: Pharmacy and the benefits there.00:08:23Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what did cause your condition?P05: I think it might have been exposure to where I was in NAM back in, 70?P05: I was in, just north of Saigon. I was at a big military supply base called Longbin.P05: And I don't know if there was really Agent Orange that was storedP05: Within miles of where we're at.00:08:49Maddie - Moderator: It was the biggest supply.P05: facility in all of Vietnam during the war.P05: So, and my particular literal unit was,P05: I was at battalion headquarters, and I was a clerk typist.P05: And it was for, a dust-off medevac, medical evacuation helicopter.P05: that went out to the field and brought in the injured. There was two MASH hospitals, very close, even though I didn't have anyP05: Interface with them.P05: That's... that's who my little unit supported.00:09:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And I know you said that, you hadn't yet appealed or tried to get a higher increase. Is there... is that something that you've thought about, or looked into, or investigated at all?P05: I've... I've probably looked into it, but I just haven't followed up.00:09:43Maddie - Moderator: and is it... is it... is there a particular reason why, or just...P05: Probably just sheer laziness.00:09:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay, that's fine, that's fine. We know these forms can be quite a doozy, to work through.00:09:59Maddie - Moderator: And let's see... so it does sound like that, the disability you have with VA was caused directly by something that happened while you were in service.00:10:08Maddie - Moderator: But we also know that sometimes an injury or an illness that you've got while in service can later cause a whole different health condition. So, for example, you know, maybe you injured your knee while you were in service, and then years later, you've been overcompensating for that bad knee, and now you're starting to have back problems. So, it's like an indirect cause, but it's still because of that military service.00:10:31Maddie - Moderator: And I was wondering if you've ever had a situation like that, or if you've heard of it.P05: I've heard of that type of scenario.P05: I don't know if it's really applicable to me.00:10:42Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: You know, like I said, it's outside of the occasional tremors.P05: And that being back in 1970, what is that, 25 years ago?00:10:53Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.P05: Right?P05: No.00:10:56Maddie - Moderator: Something like that, a little bit more than that.P05: Yeah, like, like, 35 years? No.P05: 70?P05: 70... that's 30 years, 55 years.00:11:07Maddie - Moderator: Years, yeah.P05: Yeah.P05: So...P05: I really can't say that something that might have happened to me back when I was in Nam, or even in Fort Benning, which is where,P05: My initial induction happened at.P05: And then I got an early out... well, I spent...P05: When it was my time to leave NAM.00:11:31Maddie - Moderator: I had 5 months left.P05: for my, duty obligation. And at that time, President Nixon, said anybody who was getting out of NAMM with 5 months or lessP05: Could get an early discharge.P05: So instead of being in there for 24 months, I was in there for 19 months, but...00:11:49Maddie - Moderator: Got it.P05: I really can't say that I can attribute Older age syndrome.P05: to, VA-related incident.00:12:01Maddie - Moderator: Okay, thank you for... yeah.00:12:03Maddie - Moderator: Thanks for sharing that information. And let's see, I've just got one more question before we ship... sorry, shift into the second part of our, session. I'm wondering that, you know, if you could maybe pretend that I'm a young person who's just gotten out of the military, and I've gotten a few health problems from my service, and I want to know how to get disability benefits. How would you explain it to me? Like, I don't know anything about00:12:28Maddie - Moderator: about it at all.P05: I would say, I would suggest that you read up on it, read up on the PAC Act.P05: See if it might apply, or... you know, now they've even... made...P05: more than just the pack at there. I mean, burn pits, and there's so many other ways thatP05: if you're... Disabled, even mentally disabled from your time in the service.P05: It's something to follow up and become familiar with.P05: as... as good as... Regular doctors are on the outside of the VA.P05: And I have... I have a nurse practitioner, becauseP05: where I go for my general, GP sort of affair.P05: Because I'm not on a Medicaid or a Medicare Advantage plan.P05: A real doctor won't see me.P05: It's only a nurse practitioner. So that was probably part of the reason why I went to the VA.P05: Let's do that, and to take advantage of something that, you know, is rightfully a benefit.P05: I would suggest to anybody, That if you've spent time in the military, you're deserving of it.00:13:49Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.P05: And really, to me, the easiest way is to go right into a VA facility, whether it's a clinic, hospital, whatever kind.P05: I have never run into a rude person at my, one in Broward County. It's called the,P05: William B. Kling, K-L-I-N-G.P05: Outpatient clinic, or whatever.P05: Very helpful.P05: full of resources.P05: Great, great facility. I'm very happy that I'm involved with them.00:14:22Maddie - Moderator: That's excellent. That's... yeah, it's great to have a good provider. Yeah. And then, one more question on that, you know, you've told me, my first step, go to a nearby VA facility, and if... what if I had the follow-up question for you? How does, the VA decide how much money they might give me for my injuries?P05: That, I don't know.00:14:44Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: I don't know... What their parameters are.P05: My interviewer who did my assessment.P05: was... I don't know, I wasn't expecting... What she had to ask?P05: Not saying that there's any problem. She was of, Haitian heritage.P05: There was a little bit of a language... and communication, Situation that was going forward.P05: I guess I was a little bit disappointed on that.P05: But, other than that, yeah.P05: That's all.00:15:25Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay, great. So, now we're going to shift into that second part of the session where we're going to test a couple prototypes, and before we get into that, would you like, or do you need to take a brief break at all?P05: No, I think I'm good.00:15:37Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. So, we're gonna get into evaluating some prototypes. So, I'm gonna show you two prototypes for designs that we're working on, and some disclaimers before we get into it. So, these prototypes are not the real website, and they're only partially functional. So some parts of the prototypes are going to be clickable, and some are not.00:15:55Maddie - Moderator: And also, because it's just a rough prototype, we've put in some dummy data, so it's fake data, it's not connected to the real VA database, and nothing you do today will affect your VA benefits or information at all.00:16:09Maddie - Moderator: So, I am going to put a link... In the Zoom chat.00:16:15Maddie - Moderator: And if you could navigate to open that link, Once you.P05: And, Maddie, please understand.P05: I'm not really computer savvy, so...00:16:26Maddie - Moderator: That is okay, we will trouble... we will work through this.P05: Very good.P05: Okay, so now I should click onto...P05: What appears to be another site.P05: You're up in the corner.P05: Okay. Figma. Figma.00:16:46Maddie - Moderator: Great.P05: coming up.00:16:47Maddie - Moderator: Great. And so now that you've got that open, my next ask is that you share your screen. So we'll have to go back into Zoom, which you can probably access by tapping the picture of me that's up in the corner.P05: Okay, give me just a moment, because it hasn't finished.P05: Downloading on here.00:17:04Maddie - Moderator: Sure.P05: Prototype apple? Prototype Banana?00:17:10Maddie - Moderator: Yep, that's correct.P05: So, I should... okay, I don't wanna... Continue on with... Google, I don't need that.P05: Prototype Apple, since I'm on an iPad.00:17:22Maddie - Moderator: So first of all, before we click on one of the links, I'm gonna see if we can get your screen sharing set up.00:17:29Maddie - Moderator: So...P05: So you want me to tap on you?00:17:31Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, if you can tap on me, that'll probably open Zoom back up.P05: Yes.00:17:37Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and then there should be an option or a button that might look like a green... a green box with an arrow pointing upwards that says share.P05: I do not see that at all.00:17:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay, let's see...P05: Okay.Kim Ladin: Do you see any buttons on the top right of your Zoom screen?P05: On the top right.00:18:06Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and it might be in there.P05: Okay, I have everyone, I have new chat.P05: I have the X, which is on the left-hand side of the box to the right.P05: 2025-10 disability, and then it has, like, what I would consider to share.00:18:25Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, okay.P05: No, that's really not sharing, that's just... Shrinking down the display there.00:18:31Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: But there appears to be, like, a little menu. Show Chat Preview?00:18:36Maddie - Moderator: Okay, what else is in there?P05: That's not... Any part of that, right?00:18:41Maddie - Moderator: No, no, if there's a little...P05: I don't want to hit the... the new chat. I don't think that's gonna do anything.00:18:50Maddie - Moderator: Nope.P05: And down on the lower right.P05: You know what? Let's just do this.P05: No, that's only splitting the screen.P05: No, and then all I have is just my own, you know, contact mail settings.00:19:12Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: Dashboard down there.00:19:14Maddie - Moderator: Okay, do you see, let's see, sorry, I was looking up pictures of what.Kim Ladin: Hold on, hold on for a second.P05: Okay, and then I have a reply, copy, and quote, and a line full of emojis, so that shouldn't be it either, right?00:19:32Maddie - Moderator: Maybe... I wonder if you close the chat, since you've already got the link open, maybe if we close the chat, maybe that'll show you some additional controls.P05: It just gives me a full screener view.00:19:45Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so, and if you tap the...P05: Okay, hold on now.P05: Okay, so I have the Zoom.P05: Zoom up on the top.P05: Okay.Kim Ladin: Do you see him?P05: Center view, gallery view, center stage.P05: Hi, non-video participants.P05: That... that shouldn't be it.00:20:06Maddie - Moderator: -P05: And I'm looking to share this, right?00:20:09Maddie - Moderator: Yes, it should say share or share content.P05: Okay, all that does is turn the camera around.Kim Ladin: P05, can you find the mute button in Zoom? Do you see that anywhere?P05: You know what?P05: I'm getting a hold, you know, yes, I see the mute.Kim Ladin: Oh, you just muted yourself, you can unclick that.P05: Right, okay.P05: So now we're back.Kim Ladin: Okay, look to the right of the mute button. You should see a button that says stop video, and then maybe the share button right next to that?P05: Share.P05: Share screen.00:20:49Maddie - Moderator: Yep.P05: ain't... Screen broadcast, start broadcast.00:21:02Maddie - Moderator: Yep, we want to do start broadcast.00:21:06Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. So this, we'll wait for this to...00:21:10Maddie - Moderator: Count up a bit, let's see.00:21:13Maddie - Moderator: That's correct.00:21:17Maddie - Moderator: So, we can see your screen, and we can... can you say something so we can make sure we can still hear you?P05: Okay, screen broadcast.00:21:27Maddie - Moderator: That's true.P05: I'm 22 seconds, but it's still going around in a circle.00:21:31Maddie - Moderator: That is okay, so you know how sometimes you can, like, swipe up from the bottom and you can open up a different application that you have, already opened on your iPad?P05: Yes.00:21:42Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, so if we can do that, and then we can go to that browser window where that link opened.P05: And what do we want from down there again? Oh, break Poland.00:21:54Maddie - Moderator: Oh, this is looking... yeah, this is looking good.P05: Okay.P05: Stop sharing?00:22:00Maddie - Moderator: No, we want to keep that,00:22:03Maddie - Moderator: So, yes, let's go back to the home screen.P05: Let's go back to the home screen.00:22:10Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.P05: Yeah, that's just...00:22:11Maddie - Moderator: for...P05: Tapping on you, right?00:22:13Maddie - Moderator: I think if you swipe up from the bottom of the screen, Yes. So, I'm gonna guess...P05: So that's that... that's not what we wanted.P05: Okay.00:22:25Maddie - Moderator: Okay, you know what? We can just, while you're here, tap the screen again so we get the controls to show up at the bottom.P05: you know, This is gonna be a pain in the A.00:22:35Maddie - Moderator: It'll be okay.P05: No, no, give me a moment.00:22:39Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: You know what? Listen, I'm... I've just gotta move. I've got gardeners out over at another guy's yard.00:22:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: It's gonna be just too loud to, continue on here.00:22:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: So, I don't mean to lose you, but...00:22:54Maddie - Moderator: That is okay.P05: Let me, let me get out of here. Yeah, this guy's gonna have a big mower here.00:23:00Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: Sorry.00:23:02Maddie - Moderator: That is fine, that's just fine.P05: Got landscapers outside with mowers.P05: Down to block.00:23:22Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, mine are here... mine are here today, too.P05: Yeah.P05: Hold on.P05: Hopefully the reception will be just as good outside here.P05: Okay.00:23:45Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: Oh no, we don't want this.00:23:48Maddie - Moderator: So I think... Let's click that blue OK button so we can dismiss that notification about it being recorded.00:23:56Maddie - Moderator: Great. And so, see where it says chat along the bottom edge?00:24:01Maddie - Moderator: You might have to tap the screen again to get those controls to show up.P05: Chat, yes.00:24:06Maddie - Moderator: Yep, so we can.P05: Okay, I've got, I've got everything there.00:24:10Maddie - Moderator: This is great, so let's.P05: Click on them.00:24:11Maddie - Moderator: Yep, yep.00:24:15Maddie - Moderator: Excellent.00:24:18Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so we'll just let this screen load up, but we have got... this is the hardest part of the session, I promise.P05: It's loading up, and I.00:24:29Maddie - Moderator: Yep.P05: Where were we going?00:24:30Maddie - Moderator: Yep, this is perfect. We are all... we are set up. Okay. So, we're going to click on Prototype Apple.00:24:49Maddie - Moderator: And I'll give you some of...P05: Yep. Jamie?00:24:52Maddie - Moderator: Yep, I can see you and the screen. This is exactly what we wanted.00:24:57Maddie - Moderator: And so I'm going to give you some, background information while we wait for this to load.P05: Okay, great.00:25:01Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so for this, we're gonna... I'm gonna give you a couple different scenario prompts, and then we'll just watch you move through some of these screens within the prototype.00:25:12Maddie - Moderator: And so for this first scenario, I'm going to ask that you imagine that you've got a few different health conditions that you want disability benefits for, and you've come to the VA website today to apply.00:25:23Maddie - Moderator: And so as you click through this prototype, you'll mention, as I mentioned, or you'll notice, as I mentioned, that there's gonna be some dummy data in there for our imaginary veteran. And so this imaginary veteran is already receiving disability benefits for a few conditions. Their data won't match yours, but I would like you to imagine that you really are this person.00:25:43Maddie - Moderator: And tell us what you would do as if this were your real situation.00:25:47Maddie - Moderator: And so as you use the prototype, you know, verbalize all of your thoughts out loud so we can understand how it's working for you.P05: Okay.00:25:55Maddie - Moderator: So, we are, for this first scenario, let's say that you've started having arthritis in your shoulder.00:26:02Maddie - Moderator: That you think is because of an injury you had while in service. And so we're interested to see how you would ask for disability compensation for that.00:26:13Maddie - Moderator: So, for this screen, you've arrived here, you've already logged in, and you've started your benefits application. You can scroll up and down, and you can click on things in the screen.P05: Okay?00:26:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, as you look at the screen here, you can, like, yeah, scroll on the white part of the page, and I'm interested in what's going through your mind as you look at some of the information here.00:27:19Maddie - Moderator: Oh, if you're talking, I think we've lost... Maybe that's me.Kim Ladin: I can't hear P05 at all.00:27:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:27:35Maddie - Moderator: P05, could you say something?00:27:49Maddie - Moderator: Let's see, P05, I'm having a little bit of difficulty hearing you, if you're seeing anything.00:27:58Maddie - Moderator: I can't hear you. I wonder if...00:28:01Maddie - Moderator: Maybe the AirPods have gotten disconnected, or...00:28:11Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, I can see you're talking, I can't hear anything.00:28:20Maddie - Moderator: Let's see... can you hear me okay? Can you hear me? Can you nod if you can hear me?00:28:28Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so you can hear me. We can't hear you.00:28:31Maddie - Moderator: Let's see... I wonder... I don't see anything that suggests that you might be muted on your screen.00:28:45Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yeah, let's maybe receive the... AirPods repair, maybe?00:28:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay, stop sharing.00:29:17Maddie - Moderator: Okay, I still can't hear anything.Kim Ladin: I wonder...Kim Ladin: I can't tell, P05, did you try, turning off your earbuds and just using the regular speaker on the iPad?P05: Well...00:29:45Maddie - Moderator: Oh, we can hear you! Oh wait, no, it disappeared. When you took it out, we could hear you.00:29:52Maddie - Moderator: Yes, yes, can you say something again?P05: Okay, well then I'll leave them alone.00:29:58Maddie - Moderator: Oh, perfect, yeah, we can hear you again. Okay.P05: Okay, very good. So... so it's the pods that are in the way, and we'll take...P05: Bear those for that right now.00:30:08Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: I don't know what that's all about.P05: Okay, so let me go back and try and share this screen.00:30:17Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Okay, do you see where I'm at now?00:30:20Maddie - Moderator: Not yet. I think you'll have to go back into Zoom and share the screen again.P05: Order type apple.00:30:29Maddie - Moderator: Let's see, I think, like I said, we can't quite see the screen just yet.00:30:47Maddie - Moderator: Dee, I think you've frozen up for me.00:30:55Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:30:57Maddie - Moderator: Let's see, I'm gonna reach out to our scheduling connection and see if they can,00:31:02Maddie - Moderator: maybe reach out to you, P05, if you can still hear me, and get you restarted.Kim Ladin: Oh, dear.00:31:38Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.00:31:40Maddie - Moderator: Ugh, okay, he's trying to come back, so...Kim Ladin: Okay, awesome.00:31:49Maddie - Moderator: Hello again, P05.00:31:59Maddie - Moderator: Let's see, I'll wait and see if you can...00:32:01Maddie - Moderator: Turn your camera on, or use your microphone.00:32:05Maddie - Moderator: Okay, I see you, and it's...P05: Okay, you can hear me now?00:32:09Maddie - Moderator: Yes, I can hear you and see you. Okay, very quick. Okay.P05: So I can click off on OK, and you can send me back the link.00:32:19Maddie - Moderator: Yes, I can.00:32:22Maddie - Moderator: So...P05: Okay.00:32:24Maddie - Moderator: And you know what? Maybe we'll share the screen before we access the link, that way we won't have to go back and forth, so...00:32:32Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, let's focus on...00:32:34Maddie - Moderator: I think it was, like, along the bottom edge of the screen, when you tapped Zoom, there was that share option.P05: Okay, so there were... there was a... there's a little green button.00:32:47Maddie - Moderator: There's a little green button up on the upper right.P05: So I got that down.00:32:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: I got, like, a speaker button, a reverse camera button, and then, like, maybe a menu button?P05: Gallery review, center stage? No, that wouldn't be it.P05: So, where do I need to go? Someplace on the bottom here?00:33:07Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, I think, you know, when you tap on the screen and that bottom bar shows up with a bunch of buttons.P05: Yeah.P05: With the chat, right?00:33:14Maddie - Moderator: Yes, where the chat is founding.P05: Bill?00:33:16Maddie - Moderator: I think one of those options is share.Kim Ladin: And bought right... kind of near the mute button?P05: Would you mind closing that door? You can stay out here, I don't care. Whatever you want to do. I'm gonna be here a few minutes.P05: Okay, so, stand by for just a second.P05: Difficulty brain.P05: Goes crazy, God.P05: And we want share. That's what we want, share screen.P05: Okay, so let's see if that works.P05: Start broadcast.00:33:58Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: Sorry.00:34:02Maddie - Moderator: No, you are just fine, and we see it. Okay, so this is great.00:34:07Maddie - Moderator: And I'm going to put the link back into the chat.00:34:16Maddie - Moderator: So, I think you should be able to tap kind of anywhere else on the screen, and that will go away.P05: It has.00:34:25Maddie - Moderator: Yes, and then there's our link.P05: Okay, so tap on that.P05: And it's coming.00:34:48Maddie - Moderator: And then...P05: I'll try to apple.00:34:51Maddie - Moderator: Yep, yep, you've got it.P05: Okay.00:35:31Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so this is...P05: Okay, I think we're, back.P05: where we were.00:35:37Maddie - Moderator: Yes, yes.P05: This looks like the very first page.00:35:41Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.P05: Just scroll up here, right?00:35:43Maddie - Moderator: So yeah, so on any of these pages, you can scroll around, and, for context, this is, the00:35:49Maddie - Moderator: disability form is also available online, so that's where we're looking at testing a couple different screens that we're considering incorporating into the form. And so this is a page you would see once you've already logged in and you've started that benefits application form online.00:36:07Maddie - Moderator: So, before we click on anything on this screen, looking at some of the information here, what is some of the... what's going through your mind as you look at, look at the content?P05: Okay, and...P05: What comes to mind about looking at the content? It seems easy enough to understand. Directions look good going forward. Once you're done reading this part, it says to hit, you know, or you would think going to continue.00:36:36Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:36:38Maddie - Moderator: And what would you expect to happen if you clicked continue?P05: And again, maybe it's... Well, it should instantly.P05: instantly, readjust to the next page, and it's just taking that 3 or 4 extra seconds.00:36:56Maddie - Moderator: Before it responds back, so... with some patience.P05: You... you go with the flow, you know?00:37:03Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yeah, agree.P05: again.P05: It's now just, giving me information, and looking for a response on, you know, a condition I haven't claimed before, andP05: you know, you're denied conditions, you know, and I haven't...P05: I haven't attributed... I haven't filled out any of this, but it seems easy enough to understandP05: And what to do.P05: It's like any other survey of a situation.00:37:39Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great.P05: I should hit continue again.00:37:43Maddie - Moderator: Not... nope, not yet. So,00:37:46Maddie - Moderator: As a reminder that this is all... this is, like.P05: I like it.00:37:51Maddie - Moderator: Sorry, what did you say?P05: No, no, go, go ahead, I'm good.00:37:58Maddie - Moderator: Okay, I was gonna say as a reminder, this is, just dummy data we've put in for an imaginary veteran, so none of this is real, but we want to just pretend for this scenario that this is, representative of your own benefits disability application. So, envision in the past00:38:16Maddie - Moderator: applied, you've gotten these denied conditions, you've also received some of these rated conditions. And what I'm curious is, from this screen, if you wanted to...00:38:27Maddie - Moderator: you know, you've started to experience some arthritis in your shoulder, and it's... you think it's because of an injury you had while you were in service. What would you do here on this screen, to ask for disability compensation for that shoulder arthritis?P05: Okay, now you're talking just for a shoulder arthritis, right? if you wanted to file...P05: It does offer you the knee replacement, sleep apnea, asthma, eczema, hypertension, nothing really about a shoulder.00:38:59Maddie - Moderator: situation where.P05: Or should I continue to look for a shoulder?00:39:04Maddie - Moderator: No, we're really focused on this screen. Is there, is there anything that you're thinking? You know, I know you mentioned looking at the knee replacement. Is there any other content on the screen where you could maybe file that disability compensation for the shoulder arthritis?P05: Not that I see, no.00:39:22Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay.P05: Possibly under knee replacement?00:39:26Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what do you think would happen if you had select... if you selected knee replacement?P05: Well, if I hit knee replacement, it's probably going to take me to...P05: Maybe another survey with more options, and there, they might offer me something for the shoulder.00:39:42Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: going to the knee, I would expect to only deal with the knee, cartilage, left knee, right knee, you know, lower extremities, not anything to do with the shoulder. I wouldn't think.00:39:55Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:39:56Maddie - Moderator: Okay, that is... yeah, that's perfect feedback. So that is our... that was our first scenario, and now our second one is, this is a little bit of a different scenario, and as you... you had mentioned that you had heard of the PACT Act.00:40:10Maddie - Moderator: Do you need any additional background information on what the PACT Act is?P05: I really don't know what it does, other than maybe there's a sliding scale of disability ratings, depending uponP05: You know, how disabled you are.00:40:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. So, a little additional context that may help with this scenario is that, the PACT Act is a relatively new law, and it made a bunch of new health conditions eligible for disability benefits. So, if you were exposed to burn pits or Agent Orange, and you now have a certain condition because of that exposure, the VA will just presume that that condition was caused00:40:54Maddie - Moderator: By your military service, and they'll approve your benefits.00:40:57Maddie - Moderator: So it's a little bit of, like, an easier route to getting compensation.00:41:02Maddie - Moderator: If you, you know, your service, aligned with some of these, those specific scenarios.00:41:08Maddie - Moderator: And so, for where we are now on this screen, we're gonna pretend that you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 5 years ago, but the VA turned down your request because they didn't think it was caused by your military service. But since the PACT Act was passed, you've now learned that asthma is a presumptive condition, and that they should give you benefits for it.00:41:32Maddie - Moderator: So, I'm gonna ask you to reapply for asthma, and how you would do that, starting from this screen here.P05: From this screen that's in front of me now, I would...00:41:43Maddie - Moderator: Yes.P05: Simply tap on the asthma.00:41:47Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: area.00:41:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:41:53Maddie - Moderator: And what do you.P05: And then it takes me to another page.00:41:56Maddie - Moderator: Huh.P05: What condition would you like to...00:42:06Maddie - Moderator: So you might need to scroll down a bit. As I mentioned, there's a few funky things about the prototype, and one is that sometimes the screens will kind of jump to the top of them, so... but it looks like you've got asthma selected here.P05: I do.00:42:20Maddie - Moderator: Yes, and you know, what would you do next?P05: Hit the continue button.00:42:26Maddie - Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead and do that.P05: Okay, and I did that.00:42:32Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: Now it's... Specific on asthma.00:42:39Maddie - Moderator: So take a minute to...P05: And it tells you how you can, appeal a denied condition by Filing a supplemental claim.00:42:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:42:51Maddie - Moderator: What do you think of some of the information here?P05: It's, it's very specific.P05: You know, it does say that they still might be able to say no to it, but at least they'll review it, and especially based on the new law, such.00:43:09Maddie - Moderator: It's just the...P05: fact that...00:43:13Maddie - Moderator: So how does this, how does the.P05: and stayed.00:43:17Maddie - Moderator: Sorry, go ahead, I think there's just a little bit of a lag, so we're accidentally talking over each other.P05: Yeah, sorry.00:43:24Maddie - Moderator: That's not... no, that's.P05: Oh.P05: At this stage, I would hit the continue button.P05: To, continue on with the application.00:43:38Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so we can, we can, go ahead and do that.P05: Okay.P05: Okay, now, what I would do on this next screen that starts with review your conditions, asthma, denied by...P05: for the VA on March 14th. I would hit the edit button at this time.P05: I think that would probably open.00:44:15Maddie - Moderator: Why?P05: taste.P05: Because it would reopen the case.P05: So that I can refile.P05: Bye.P05: That's what it would do.00:44:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: And do I have another condition to add? I would put no into that, because I'm addressing asthma.00:44:35Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: So, hit the edit, and then the note. Looking at...00:44:41Maddie - Moderator: So, not yet. Before we click on anything here, is there any, you know, looking at some of the information that's in that asthma card, what are some of your thoughts on the content on this page?P05: It seems self-explanatory. I think it's sufficient.P05: you know, I'm glad that I have a helpful.P05: Helping me navigate this right now.00:45:08Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.P05: At least it is for me, to always have somebody that I can ask an underlying question instead of, per se, being by yourself.P05: And especially with a brand new site that you're not familiar with, if I was more familiar with how to apply for stuff.P05: versus not... Not, not having any experience?P05: I mean, when it's time for... medicines, or,P05: prescription renewals, I think that I'm savvy, I've done that several different times now, and I feel comfortable on that site, so I would think this would be an extension.P05: Of, like, a prescription renewal.00:45:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay00:45:54Maddie - Moderator: And let's see, I know you said initially you wouldn't click no here, or you would click no here, because we're focused on asthma, but I'm curious if...00:46:05Maddie - Moderator: We said maybe you had another condition that you're already getting benefits for, but it's gotten worse, and you want to ask for a rating increase, so maybe increase, like, a 10% to a 20%,00:46:17Maddie - Moderator: And you want to do that in the same form. What would you do next to apply for that rating increase?P05: Well, then I guess I would, hit the yes button instead of the no button.00:46:31Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what would you expect to happen if you clicked on yes, and then continue?P05: I would expect what would come up would be my whole claim.P05: And then the ability of me maybe doing some kind of edit to it.P05: stating my case, why I think it should be increased.P05: Or whatever my concern was at that time.00:46:55Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay, so we can go ahead and do that.P05: So hit the yes button.P05: Okay.00:47:12Maddie - Moderator: And then we can click Continue.P05: Okay, once I did that.P05: I would hit the continue button, After the S.P05: And we hit the continue button.00:47:28Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: Okay, and now it says, what condition would you like to add? Required? Choose one. You'll return to the screen later if you need to add more.P05: And so, just going forward...00:47:45Maddie - Moderator: So before we click on anything, I've got a few more questions about this screen. Where do you think this list of options came from?P05: I'm not sure.P05: But I guess my, my selection would be a condition I haven't claimed before, but that really wouldn't be it.P05: To add a condition.00:48:13Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, we haven't gotten into the, specifics of this scenario yet. I'm wondering, though, you've noticed that if we were thinking about that arthritis in the shoulder situation, is there an option here that maybe...P05: Yeah, go back to the knee replacement.00:48:34Maddie - Moderator: No, I'm...P05: I would think so.00:48:36Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay.00:48:37Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, let's see,00:48:41Maddie - Moderator: If we're... we'll shift gears a little bit. So, on this screen, can you tell me which things the VA is already giving you benefits for?P05: It's not telling me what it's giving me benefits for.00:49:01Maddie - Moderator: Okay. There has been nothing selected on this screen.P05: So, I couldn't answer that question for you.00:49:11Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Am I missing something? No, not at all. Like I said at the beginning, there are no right or wrong answers, and we just... any and all feedback that you're able to provide is... that's the only reason we're even, you know, we're even asking these questions, because we just want the answers, regardless of what they are.00:49:28Maddie - Moderator: I have one more question on the screen. What do you think about how some of these options are organized?P05: I guess you're okay.00:49:41Maddie - Moderator: Okay, is there any, you know, do you notice if.P05: I don't have any suggestions on how to rearrange them or anything else.00:49:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:49:49Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: You know, the, the idea of... of... of the...P05: of a condition I haven't claimed before being on the top.P05: I guess that's okay, as well as...P05: You know, if it was not on the bottom. Since we've gotten to this screen.P05: That would be, I guess, the easiest option.P05: It being on the top.00:50:15Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Versus if it were, you mean, like, elsewhere in the list, or elsewhere on the page, or...P05: Right, right.00:50:24Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:50:25Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:50:26Maddie - Moderator: So, let's say,00:50:30Maddie - Moderator: Or sorry, I've got one more question for you. What do you think that that option is for?00:50:39Maddie - Moderator: The one that's at the top.P05: I'm sorry, one more time?00:50:45Maddie - Moderator: I, I said, what do you think that option is for, the one that's at the top?00:50:57Maddie - Moderator: The one we were just talking about.P05: I might have missed your... About how it's situated?00:51:07Maddie - Moderator: No, so we were just talking about that, the condition I haven't claimed before option.00:51:17Maddie - Moderator: What do you think that option would be for, or why someone would select it?P05: To, to perhaps select another issue, another related condition.P05: You know, if you're gonna add something new to...P05: Whatever your dis... disabilities are, if you're adding something new, that's...P05: you, you would consider as maybe, VA-related?00:51:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay.00:51:53Maddie - Moderator: That's great. So, let's see...00:51:58Maddie - Moderator: Looking at some of my... some of the screens on here... okay, so let's say... let's do another imaginary scenario.00:52:06Maddie - Moderator: So let's say 3 years ago, you got rated for hypertension, but in the last month, you feel like your hypertension's gotten worse, and so you want to try to go for a higher rating.00:52:19Maddie - Moderator: What would you do from this screen?P05: I would click on to, hypertension.00:52:26Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what would you expect to happen next?P05: It would take me to a field that would deal with, hypertension exclusively.00:52:37Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And.P05: Also, offer me the ability of,P05: refiling a claim, or editing a claim, but that's what I would expect.00:52:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay, no, that's great. So we can go ahead and do that. We can select hypertension and Click continue.P05: Okay, hypert...P05: Let's get the screen to move.P05: I'm gonna go down to the... bottom.P05: When did your condition get worse? You can share an approximate date, okay? So that's all self-explanatory there.00:53:30Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: Should I fill in an update and year, or just hit, the continue button?00:53:38Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, so this is where some prototype magic happens, and you can just click on any of those date fields, and they'll automatically populate.P05: And it did. Okay, so at this stage, I would, hit the continue. Yep.00:54:03Maddie - Moderator: Yep, you can go ahead and do that.P05: Okay, now it brings me back to, review of conditions.P05: which I'm looking at asthma, and hypertension.00:54:20Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what do you think is happening on the screen?P05: And I guess at this time, what I would do is that if I'm going to, pursue anything else in hypertension, I would hit the edit button. I'm sure that would take me to another screen, which would be more detailed in my options.00:54:45Maddie - Moderator: And...P05: Should I do that?00:54:47Maddie - Moderator: Well, and so, why... why would you do that? So, you said it would give you some more detailed options. What kind of, options are you looking for?P05: Well, what I would probably be looking for is how my condition has worsened, or gotten better, or related problems with the hypertension. You know, I could be in more detail explaining my situation and why I'm looking for a filing of the claim.00:55:15Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:55:17Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And,00:55:20Maddie - Moderator: So, since you're seeing hypertension and asthma together on this screen, what do you think is, what do you think this screen is doing, or what's happening here?P05: Well, I think they're offering me... all options.P05: for the two claims that I presently have in, whether it's the asthma or the hypertension, and it would be up to me to decide which one I want to address.00:55:50Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay.00:55:52Maddie - Moderator: And is this screen where you expected?P05: put in...00:55:58Maddie - Moderator: Go ahead.P05: Yeah, I guess so.P05: Yeah.00:56:04Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: It's not too redundant, it's a little...00:56:09Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:56:11Maddie - Moderator: And... Let's see, I've got one more question for you, so we'll click Yes.00:56:18Maddie - Moderator: Because let's say we want to add one more issue to this form, and we're gonna click Continue.P05: Okay, well, let me hit the OK.P05: I got the yes button.P05: And let's just hit the continue button here.P05: And I think I hit the continue.P05: just... Hit that continue button again.00:57:07Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:57:09Maddie - Moderator: So, we're back to the...P05: It's taken me.00:57:13Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.P05: Almost like to screen once.00:57:17Maddie - Moderator: Right, and so what do you think about that?P05: It seems easy enough to navigate, to self-navigate.P05: You know, once... once you would get into a more detailed screen about one particular,P05: Condition at a time.P05: That would be interesting to, to check out.00:57:43Maddie - Moderator: And so, looking at this screen, now that we've been here a few times, is there anything you notice that's changed since the first time you saw this screen?P05: have trouble using this online form, you can give a call to the 800 number. That's very helpful as well, because I'm sure somebody at that time can finish outP05: The survey, or whatever you're trying to accomplish.00:58:11Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Is there, is there anything in the list of...00:58:17Maddie - Moderator: Options, maybe, that we're... that is standing out to you, now that we're back here?P05: Not really.00:58:42Maddie - Moderator: Okay.00:58:44Maddie - Moderator: And so... .P05: It's really pretty much self-explanatory.00:58:52Maddie - Moderator: Sorry, what'd you say there? A cut out for me.P05: Go ahead.P05: I'm sorry, go ahead.00:58:59Maddie - Moderator: Oh, I said it cut out for me, if you could just repeat what you said.P05: Well, you know, it's, it's a little frustrating because the program isn't responding as quick as what you would expect a normal interface with the iPad or your electronic device.P05: You know, it's like a staggered answer, and it's frustrating for me, that's all.00:59:25Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. Can you talk a little bit more about how it's frustrating?P05: I'm not ready to pick it up and throw it up against the wall.00:59:35Maddie - Moderator: Okay. But.P05: It's... it's frustrating when it doesn't respond... when it doesn't respond smoothly.P05: Normally, as you're scrolling up someplace, you're expected to be very reactive.P05: And the program isn't like that. You have to do it once, twice at most, almost a third time before it responds, unless you build in that extra 4 or 5 seconds for it to respond by itself.01:00:05Maddie - Moderator: Okay.01:00:09Maddie - Moderator: I, I'm noticing, too, that I'm getting a flag off to the side that one of our folks on the line has a question for you. So I'm gonna say, Ken, do you want to ask your question?Kim Ladin: Yeah, thank you. I want to go back...Kim Ladin: To the beginning of this, conversation, when you were talking about your, disability that you had claimed, and you got a 10% rating for that.Kim Ladin: And, you had... so we... we had asked if you had...Kim Ladin: disagreed with that decision, and whether you thought about doing anything further about it, which you didn't, but I'm wondering, do you have any idea, if you... if you did disagree with that 10% rating decision.Kim Ladin: Back then, when you got the decision letter, and you had wanted to try to pursue something, do you have any idea what were some of the options for you to pursue?P05: I think there was a website that was on the mail, the mailing that I got, explaining, how they came up with the 10% disability rating. I think there was also a link on that mailing.P05: To file an appeal.P05: That, I could have followed up and used.P05: I'm not too sure if there was an 800 number to call somebody, andP05: try and appeal over the phone. Perhaps it was. I don't have it in front of me, of course.P05: But, you know, I'm sure there was other ways Of making an appeal Easy enough to apply for.Kim Ladin: Okay, great, thank you. That's, really good information.Kim Ladin: Okay, that was my only follow-up question, Maddie.01:02:09Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. And let's see...01:02:13Maddie - Moderator: I did want to call out, so initially, you know, we filed a claim for asthma, we did another for hypertension, they're no longer... they are no longer options in this list.01:02:25Maddie - Moderator: And I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on why that happened.P05: I don't know,P05: Maybe I've just reached the end of the, of the survey at the time.P05: I've, I've filed what I wanted to file, andP05: I would be waiting for a future response.01:02:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay.P05: I guess.01:02:54Maddie - Moderator: Okay, what do you think about the fact that those have disappeared from this list?P05: I'm sorry, one more time?01:03:02Maddie - Moderator: What do you think about the fact that hypertension and asthma have disappeared from this list?P05: Little disappointed, maybe?P05: Because I think that's a very easy thing to,P05: say has gotten worse is hypertension, or even an asthma situation, especially as you age, so them being removed from the list.P05: That, that would be, that...P05: Maybe would convince somebody that that condition doesn't exist.P05: Where they... where they should be able to apply for it, so...P05: That's not a good idea, is to take those off the list. I think they should stay on the list.01:03:44Maddie - Moderator: Okay.01:03:45Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. And then, I just got one more question for you before we, shift into wrapping up. I'm wondering, what was the most, challenging part of this process today?P05: Other than a slow response.P05: from, either hitting the continue button, or hitting the, the selection.P05: area.P05: And then waiting for the slow response, I think it was all... Pretty easy going.01:04:21Maddie - Moderator: Okay, let's see...01:04:27Maddie - Moderator: I'm sorry, my cat is being very obnoxious, jumping on the desk. Was there anything that was surprising or unexpected for you as you went through these prototype... as you went through this prototype today?P05: No, I don't think so.01:04:41Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay.01:04:44Maddie - Moderator: And let's see...01:04:49Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and let's... I'm gonna ask if anyone else on the line has any other questions.Kim Ladin: Oh, I do have one more, sorry.01:04:58Maddie - Moderator: Okay. No, that's fine.Kim Ladin: P05, have you, before this session, had you ever heard the term, supplemental claim?P05: Not with the VA, no.Kim Ladin: But from... have you heard about it in other contexts?P05: I, I think with Social Security.P05: And Social Security benefits, or something of that nature, I believe I heard that supplemental at that time, but...P05: I don't remember hearing supplemental with a VA claim.Kim Ladin: Okay.P05: I really couldn't explain that to you, or what's that even about?Kim Ladin: Do you remember seeing the term supplemental claim on any of the screens that you clicked through today?P05: No.Kim Ladin: Okay.Kim Ladin: Thank you!Kim Ladin: And that's all my questions.P05: Was it on the screens that we looked at today?Kim Ladin: You know what? It was just in one little place, so it was really easy to miss.P05: Okay.01:06:03Maddie - Moderator: Okay, awesome. So, do you have any questions or comments for us, P05, on any parts of this process?P05: Yeah, this... This, these, these surveys that we're doing right now between us.P05: Is this something relatively new, like in the last couple of years they've been instituted and started up?01:06:27Maddie - Moderator: So,01:06:29Maddie - Moderator: they're not necessarily surveys, these are that, you know, the disability benefits form has been a paper form for a really long time, and there have been different initiatives to put it online to lower, you know, the work of processing paper applications by VA staff, and to hopefully get quicker responses to veterans. So instead of01:06:53Maddie - Moderator: You know, any kind of wait time that might exist between completing a form, mailing it in, and then waiting to hear a response.01:07:01Maddie - Moderator: There's been different initiatives to digitize the form, and...01:07:07Maddie - Moderator: So, what we're testing here, it's not necessarily a part of the disability benefits form, or that 526EZ form that exists yet. We've been testing a couple of different bits, and we're... that we're interested in potentially incorporating into that disability benefits application form. But the form itself does exist.01:07:28Maddie - Moderator: online, and so it's something that, you know, veterans can go to VI.gov, they've got an account that they can log into, and they're able to manage any and all of their benefits there and apply for them. Like, I know folks can apply for pension benefits, education benefits. The disability benefits one is certainly one of the, you know, it consumes a large part of the01:07:51Maddie - Moderator: VA's budget is that benefit, and sending it out to veterans, and so it's been a high priority for them to make sure that when it is digit, you know, as it's digitized and continues to be supported on the website, that it works really smoothly for folks.P05: Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, and it's, I'm sure it's very beneficial for people who can't get to a VA facility.P05: To get that initial assessment, or whatever it might take.P05: So, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of people that are very thankful about that.P05: no? I love it. You guys are great.01:08:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay, well, thank you, and we really appreciate you taking the time to share all of your thoughts and feedback.01:08:37Maddie - Moderator: with us today. And as I mentioned, yeah, no right or wrong answers, and all the feedback that you were able to give was really, really helpful, especially to all of us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans.01:08:51Maddie - Moderator: So thank you. And lastly, Peridian, that scheduling resource that's helped, you know, schedule this session, they'll be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know, so you can provide them with a chance to participate in future research studies like this.P05: Yeah. I think it's great.01:09:12Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great, and so with that, we just want to say thank you so much again, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.P05: Have a great Thanksgiving.01:09:20Maddie - Moderator: Yeah.Kim Ladin: Oh, Happy Thanksgiving! Thank you.Ashton: Thanksgiving.P05: It will.01:09:26Maddie - Moderator: Thank you, P05. Take care.
