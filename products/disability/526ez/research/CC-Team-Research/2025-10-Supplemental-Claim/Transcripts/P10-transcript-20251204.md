00:00:01Madeline - Moderator: Alright, so I've started recording, and P10, I'd just like to confirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? P10: Yes. 00:00:10Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. So, and sorry, this is my cat, she will probably join us intermittently throughout the session. P10: Okay. 00:00:19Madeline - Moderator: the birds are very active at our bird feeders this time of day, and it's... she loves... my office is full of windows, and she... it's, like, her favorite time of day. P10: Huh? 00:00:29Madeline - Moderator: So, we'll just go ahead and get started on that first part. So, for this one, as I mentioned, the second part will be testing the prototypes. For this first bit of the session. 00:00:37Madeline - Moderator: We'd like to hear about your experience getting disability benefits. 00:00:41Madeline - Moderator: And we might touch on some parts of your health situation, so please know that, you know, you don't need to talk about any topics that you don't want to, and what we're most interested in hearing is about your experience with that application process itself for applying for VA disability benefits. So, have you ever filed for disability benefits? P10: Yes. 00:01:02Madeline - Moderator: And about how many times? P10: Maybe 4. 00:01:09Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:01:10Madeline - Moderator: And, about how many disabilities has the VA approved? P10: I think 4? P10: Because they, like, you know, combined, combined some. 00:01:25Madeline - Moderator: and what do you mean combined, like, for your overall percentage rating? P10: Yes. 00:01:32Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and, can you tell me what your overall disability percent is? P10: 80. 00:01:38Madeline - Moderator: 80. And, so you've applied for benefits for individual times. Do you mind telling me what some of those, conditions or health issues that you claimed when you applied? P10: Eczema... P10: I applied for tinnitus. P10: Polyuria... P10: Now, you want the ones that are approved, or does it matter? 00:02:09Madeline - Moderator: Either, either, any that you can remember. P10: For low... low back pain, mechanical strain, P10: Patello... knee patella... knee patello Syndrome? P10: Something like that. 00:02:26Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:02:27Madeline - Moderator: And now I'm going to ask you a few questions about your most recent experience of these four times when you applied for benefits. When was the last time that you dealt with the VA regarding your disability benefits? P10: Actually, I've applied for an increase within the last, 2 months. 00:02:46Madeline - Moderator: Oh, okay. P10: Yeah. 00:02:48Madeline - Moderator: Can you tell me what that, process was like? P10: It was... it was okay, just... I went online and did the increase. P10: I don't... I guess I don't like that it's not as detailed, so it's kind of... you just put, like, a sentence in, I think it's, like, 140 characters, something like that, and so it's very brief, but, P10: you... I guess you get to file, upload a statement, a personal statement or something. So, I don't know, I... the... P10: It wasn't the best, but I guess it did what it was supposed to do. 00:03:30Madeline - Moderator: Have you already heard back about, P10: No, not yet, because they needed to schedule a CMP, but I'm out of the country, so I couldn't do an in-person, so I'm waiting to hear back if they're able to do a, a virtual. 00:03:47Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. And so, and you said, you know, there's something about applying for the increase that you didn't really like, like, was there anything specific, or, you know, was it confusing, or was there information that you thought, you know, maybe... P10: Is it worth? P10: maybe it wasn't as straightforward. I guess I wanted to give a little bit of an explanation, and didn't realize, like, I needed to add, I guess, an additional document or something. So, I applied for increase for two conditions, but for one of them, I... P10: didn't get to, do the personal statement, and now I don't know how to add it, so it's kind of... 00:04:30Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: Bill. 00:04:32Madeline - Moderator: And did you apply for the increase for both of these at the same time? P10: Yes. 00:04:37Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. P10: Yes. 00:04:39Madeline - Moderator: And so when you were doing this, what was kind of... what was going through your mind? P10: I don't know, I think I was just kind of, okay, let me... let me finish and do this, because I was, you know, getting ready... it was a lot going on. In the process of selling our home, we were having showings, I was trying to get it done before I left the country, so it was just, like, a lot of other things going through my mind, and so just making sure I had the right documentation, having to go to storage, and go back through my files. P10: So it was, you know, it was a little... a little tedious, so I had a lot going through my mind. 00:05:17Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, wanted to make sure all your T's are crossed, and that, you know, the VA wasn't gonna hit you with one of the, oh, we haven't received everything yet, and you need to redo it, and da-da-da-da-da. P10: Exactly. 00:05:31Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. 00:05:32Madeline - Moderator: So, thinking about the... maybe a time before the increase application, like, when you got a decision letter, 00:05:42Madeline - Moderator: How... do you remember the kinds of things the letter told you? P10: It would just state, I guess the condition I applied for, and then it would just say, P10: oh, there were favor... it was denied, but it was favorable... favorable findings, and then would just kind of list the steps that you needed to do if you wanted to file for a, I guess a supplemental or something like that, so it just gave... gave the steps and contact information. 00:06:20Madeline - Moderator: And did you receive this information in any other way besides the letter? P10: No, it was only in letter form. 00:06:28Madeline - Moderator: Okay. And, 00:06:31Madeline - Moderator: So, yeah, you shared some of the things that the letter told you. For the particular condition associated with that, disability benefits application, did you have to provide what caused your condition? P10: I don't remember if I had to, say what caused it, or when... when the onset was, so I just had to provide that information, so I would just, you know, go through my military records, and then just highlight the parts where, you know, P10: I first went to get seen for it. 00:07:11Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. And so did the VA ultimately agree with that application claim? P10: Some... some of them they did, and then after going and getting a C&P exam, they did, and then there were others, even though there was documentation of it, P10: It was denied. P10: Even though, you know, I had documentation, went to physical therapy, and all, you know, and then they requested some P10: Some other information, some other files, and I submitted all that, and then they still turned around and said no. P10: So, yeah. 00:07:50Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, man, I'm sorry that that was your experience. 00:07:55Madeline - Moderator: I... it does lend itself well to, like, some of the other questions I have are, you know, I'm interested about times that you may have disagreed with the VA decision, and... 00:08:04Madeline - Moderator: you know, so maybe... was this an instance where, you know, you're like, okay, I've provided all of my information, but... 00:08:12Madeline - Moderator: You know, where's this decision coming from? P10: Yeah, yeah, for two, for two in particular, because for one, for my knees, I... P10: I got in trouble, I guess, in basic training, and so I had to scrub the... P10: basically the squadron on my hands and knees, and so on being on concrete just kind of affected my knees, but I was... because of... because of my knee condition, they reclassified me into another, job. P10: And so, like, all that documentation, the physical therapy and stuff, but because I didn't have any more records from, you know, from the military to now, P10: they denied it, because I didn't have any other records of going to seek care. But I had outside... outside providers, so, you know, it's been over 20 years, and those providers are... have moved on, or they... P10: They've already gotten rid of their records, so there was no... P10: No way for me to get any, P10: Any other documentation for those conditions? 00:09:24Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: So that was... P10: One, one I disagreed with, and the other I disagreed with as well, was for my back. 00:09:33Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and what was that experience like? Like, how did. 00:09:36Madeline - Moderator: out, and... P10: Yeah, pretty much the same. They, because when I... when I first filed, which was back in 2000, apparently they didn't have access to my military records, so they just flat out denied everything, and they... I guess there was a letter saying that they would, once... P10: they found my records, they would re-evaluate, but they never did. So... Never 20... 00:10:03Madeline - Moderator: Sorry, I want to clarify, they never found them, or they never re-evaluated? P10: They never re-evaluated. 00:10:08Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: Yeah, so then in 2022, you know, 22 years later, I'm, you know, I've... P10: gotten approved for, for VA benefits, and then, I went to one of the people at the VA clinic, and they told me everything that, you know, the ball was dropped, and, you know, so then we resubmitted all of that stuff. P10: So, when I got the decision, it was for all of those things, at once, so it was a decision giving me, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, again, for the initial claim. 00:10:46Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so what did you do when you got that, that kind of... the result from that secondary claim? P10: I... what did I do? P10: I think I ended up... well, they did a C&P exam, and the doctor for that did agree with, you know, with the knee condition, agreed with the back condition, P10: agreed with, you know, the eczema, but then they just... they came back and said, no for the back, no for the knees, yes for eczema, but no, you know, it was 0%. And so... P10: I filed something... P10: I don't remember what the... what the difference, the different filings are called, but I... I don't know if it was an appeal or a supplemental, but I filed that for my back, and, because I eventually ended up having, on-the-job P10: work injury to my lower back. They wanted all the Department of Labor records and, all of that. 00:11:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: So, yeah, so it was... it was frustrating. They still said, you know, favorable... favorable findings, but, you know, they didn't want to, P10: Accept that. P10: So, I could've... P10: pursued it more, but I just... I was frustrated with the process, because I was in a car accident when I was in the military, so, you know, and my lower back was affected, so... P10: I had records of being seen, but, I was told I should just do a nexus. P10: you know, go to another doctor, so I would have been having to come out of pocket for stuff that I've already come out of pocket for, so I just kind of left... left it alone. 00:12:44Madeline - Moderator: And was there any other additional, like, backup documentation you were asked to provide outside of the Department of Labor records? P10: The... just any, I guess, any records that I had on my own from... from doctor visits, but because the Department of Labor, it was such a thick file, like, I was keeping documentation of everything. P10: So I had all the documentation over the years, for that one. 00:13:10Madeline - Moderator: Okay. And so, I know you said you were like, well, and then, by that point. 00:13:15Madeline - Moderator: you know, you kind of felt like you'd come out of pocket several times already. Have you pursued anything else, or, in regards to maybe getting an... I know you said you filed a kind of an appeal. 00:13:30Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, what happened then? P10: No, I haven't done anything else for my back. 00:13:34Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: And, you know, that one's probably the most... the most frustrating one, because I had been dealing with it for so many years, but that's the... that's the only one I just didn't do anything else with. I just kind of... P10: Chucked it aside and said, you know... It is what it is. 00:13:52Madeline - Moderator: And so, is the back... do you know the rating for your back, or is that one that was just flat-out denied? P10: It was just denied. 00:13:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so that's not contributing to your overall 80% rating. P10: So... 00:14:04Madeline - Moderator: Okay. And then one more question about your appeal process. Were there any particular parts of that process that were confusing or unclear? P10: I don't know, I think I just... P10: I guess because they wanted all this documentation, and I... I submitted everything, P10: I guess it was just kind of one of those things that was left in limbo that I provided everything, but I... I don't know if I needed to file a personal statement with it, which I didn't even know about the personal statements, or even, you know, the buddy letters, because my parents experienced... my experiences with this back stuff. P10: So I didn't know about any of that, so... P10: Yeah, I wish I would have known, but... Yeah. 00:14:56Madeline - Moderator: So, I'm wondering if, you know, if you could imagine that you were talking to somebody who found out that the VA denied their claim, and they were thinking of appealing it, how would you explain that appeal process to them from your perspective, and what kind of advice would you give them? P10: Hmm... And to make sure that they have P10: The proper documentation as far as being, just... P10: anything that can state or back up their claim. So, you know, letters from friends, letters from doctors, family members, anyone who can, say that they've witnessed this pain, you know, doctor statements, any x-ray, P10: what's the thing where... not the x-ray itself, but the... the letter that comes with it. I can't... the word is slipping. 00:15:51Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, I know what you mean, like, the readout, or... P10: Yeah, yeah. You know, if they have copies of that, but just to, just have everything that they need, and. P10: You know... Yeah, have everything you need, and if you're just... P10: I would say, you know, don't give up. 00:16:15Madeline - Moderator: You know. P10: if it's something you really want to fight for, but because from my personal experience, I was fighting the Department of Labor. 00:16:24Madeline - Moderator: this work. P10: workman's comp, so I... I was tired of fighting. So for me, I just said, my sanity, you know, my peace of mind. P10: far outweighed whatever I could, I guess, receive from this, so for me, I was okay to just back away, but for someone who just feels that, you know, they really... it's... it's something they really want to go for, then I would just say, don't give up, you know? 00:16:50Madeline - Moderator: No. P10: Do what you have to do to... to get the result you're looking for. 00:16:54Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, yeah. No, that's... that's great feedback. And I'm wondering, do you have any conditions that are rated at 0%? P10: Yes, one of the ones that I filed for an increase for, which is, eczema. 00:17:09Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and do you, like, how would you explain that that happened, that you got the 0% rating? P10: I don't know, I guess there was... there was evidence in my military records, of... of having a flare, and then when I had the C&P exam, she could see the... the markings, from a recent flare. P10: And they just... P10: noted it as zero, I guess, because, again, there was no other documentation showing over the years that I've been treated for the eczema, but... P10: I moved around a lot, had different doctors, so I wasn't, you know, I didn't have my records and stuff. P10: So I guess that was why they gave the zero, but I've... I've... P10: File for an increase on that one. 00:17:58Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:17:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. And just making sure... 00:18:05Madeline - Moderator: Covered everything with the first bit, but... P10: I think we're gonna go ahead and get into the prototypes here. 00:18:13Madeline - Moderator: So, before we get into testing that, before we get into Phase 2, would you like to take a brief break here? P10: Oh, okay. 00:18:22Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. So... 00:18:24Madeline - Moderator: We'll get into evaluating some prototypes. We'll show you two prototypes today for designs that we're working on, and some disclaimers here. The prototypes are not the real website, they're only partially functional, so there's gonna be elements that you might click on, and they might not interact or react the way you expected. So... 00:18:44Madeline - Moderator: They're also rough prototypes, and they've got a lot of dummy data in them, and so nothing that you're seeing today is connected to a real VA database, and nothing you do today will affect your own VA benefits or information at all. And, so I'm going to put a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat. 00:19:01Madeline - Moderator: And... 00:19:02Madeline - Moderator: You should see that there, and you can navigate to open that link, and once you have that open, if you could share your screen so we can see what you're doing. 00:19:13Madeline - Moderator: be great. P10: Sure. P10: Trying to hit, and it says select. P10: Okay. P10: I'm waiting for the site to come up. It's a little slow here. 00:19:56Madeline - Moderator: Okay, I see our Zoom window. 00:20:04Madeline - Moderator: And yeah, if we can... P10: It's... it's thinking. 00:20:18Madeline - Moderator: There it is. 00:20:19Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: Okay. P10: I was like, you saw it before I saw it. 00:20:29Madeline - Moderator: We've... we've, we've been doing these for about a week and a half now, so, it's funny, the things that my, you know, everyone who's been on this call, you know, the things that we're... we notice quickly now. P10: We're different versions of ourselves than we were two weeks ago. P10: I bet. 00:20:49Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:20:51Madeline - Moderator: So, I'll give some background context while you wait for this to load up fully. So for each... 00:20:56Madeline - Moderator: Each of the prototypes, we're going to walk through a couple of different situations, and so for all of them, though, I would like you to imagine that you've got a few different health conditions that you want disability benefits for, and so you've come to the VA website today to apply. 00:21:14Madeline - Moderator: And as... 00:21:15Madeline - Moderator: through each of these prototypes. As I mentioned, you'll notice there's some dummy data in there for an imaginary veteran, and this imaginary veteran is already receiving disability benefits for a few conditions. And so what you see in there, like, their data won't match yours. 00:21:31Madeline - Moderator: But I would like you to imagine that you really are this person, and tell us what you would do as if this were your real situations, as if this was actually you navigating through the website. P10: Okay. 00:21:41Madeline - Moderator: And as you use the prototypes, please verbalize any and all thoughts you have out loud, so we can understand what is and isn't working for you. P10: Okay. P10: Okay, and... 00:21:53Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, I wonder if it's worth clicking the link maybe one more time or refreshing the page. Sometimes it does get, like. 00:21:58Madeline - Moderator: It stalls out on this, like, last little loading bit. 00:22:05Madeline - Moderator: Let's see what happens. 00:22:28Madeline - Moderator: So you mentioned you were out of the country. Where are you? P10: I'm in, Tanzania, East Africa. 00:22:35Madeline - Moderator: Oh, wow! How's the weather there? P10: Oh, it's wonderful. It's a little hot, but at night it cools down, so once the sun goes down, then it gets a little cool and pretty windy. 00:22:50Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. P10: I'm on the, on the island, so it's very tropical here. 00:22:57Madeline - Moderator: Wow, okay, I'm jealous. I mean, I am in Eastside Atlanta, and it is... and I'm coming from the Southwest, and I am not used to winter in a while. Okay, excellent. P10: This is what we want to see. So you can... Okay. Let's click on Prototype Banana. 00:23:20Madeline - Moderator: And again, this will also take a second to load here, but for this first scenario, let's say when you... as you're this imaginary veteran, and you've started to have arthritis in your shoulder. 00:23:35Madeline - Moderator: And you think it's because of an injury you had while you were in service. And, 00:23:42Madeline - Moderator: What I'm going to be interested in is how you would ask for disability compensation for that, and so the first screen that we'll see here, when you get here, basically in your online journey, you've already logged in and you've started your benefits application. 00:23:55Madeline - Moderator: So... 00:23:56Madeline - Moderator: What's going through your mind as you see this screen? 00:24:01Madeline - Moderator: And it looks kind of familiar. Okay. P10: How for... Yeah, just, I know that I want to file for, disability, so for me. P10: I... let's move on. Continue. 00:24:20Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:24:22Madeline - Moderator: What do you expect to happen if you click continue? P10: Another screen to pop up, going through the process. 00:24:32Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so we can go ahead and do that. P10: Okay. P10: So, if it's something, that I haven't claimed before. P10: and I would, go to a condition I haven't claimed. 00:24:57Madeline - Moderator: And what's going through your mind as you consider the options that you... consider the options here? P10: I guess for the shoulder, I don't think it would be related to, you know, the knee or migraines or anything like that, so... P10: Because you didn't say it had been denied before, right? 00:25:20Madeline - Moderator: I... no, yeah, you've just started having it, arthritis in the shoulder. P10: Yeah, so just wondering if it was connected to something else. So, I don't... I mean, I'm not a doctor. P10: So, I don't know, maybe, maybe it's linked to migraines, I don't know, but I would just... P10: Consider it a new, condition. 00:25:41Madeline - Moderator: Okay, that is great feedback. So, and now we'll shift into another scenario with the same prototype. And before we start, have you heard of the PACT Act? P10: Yes. 00:25:54Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. So, for this scenario, let's pretend that you applied for disability benefits for asthma, about 10 years ago, but the VA turned down your request because they didn't think it was caused by your military service. 00:26:09Madeline - Moderator: But, now that the PACT Act has been passed, you've learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition, and they should give you benefits for it. 00:26:16Madeline - Moderator: So, now we're gonna reapply for asthma. 00:26:19Madeline - Moderator: So how would you do that on this screen? P10: On this screen, I would say a condition the VA previously denied. 00:26:28Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:26:30Madeline - Moderator: And what's going through your mind as you think through what to do here? P10: It would be the most illogical of... of the options, so, because they denied the asthma before, but now that there is this new PACT Act saying that, oh, yeah, asthma... asthma very well is, is, is a condition, that... that could have been caused by your military P10: spirit. P10: then I, you know, that would be the best options for me right now. 00:27:00Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so we can go ahead and do that. 00:27:09Madeline - Moderator: And sometimes those, yeah, the black, those black, arrows, left and right arrows, will block the buttons, and for whatever reason. P10: Yeah, when people click them. 00:27:19Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:27:20Madeline - Moderator: So what's, going through your head as you look through... take some time to look through this screen? P10: Let's see, can appeal... P10: They're giving the options, so, I... what's going through my mind is, you know, do I have new evidence? P10: Or, would I want them to review it based on, you know, a new law? And so that would be mine, because of the new law, that I want them to review my claim. 00:27:58Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:28:01Madeline - Moderator: So what, what would you do here on this screen? P10: I would tap on the, asthma. 00:28:08Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:28:09Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so we can go ahead. 00:28:15Madeline - Moderator: I know, that's gonna be one of our... one of the little quirky things about the prototype is. P10: the. 00:28:19Madeline - Moderator: Refreshing, even if you're just selecting a button. P10: Okay. P10: Denied supplemental claim based on new relevant evidence for change. P10: And as of the moment, I don't... I don't have anything else new, or another condition to add, so I would say no and continue. 00:28:47Madeline - Moderator: Okay, what do you think about some of the information, under the asthma condition. P10: I guess it's stating something that we've... we already know that it had been denied, and that the supplemental claim is based on new, relevant evidence or a change in law, which is P10: What... the reason why we're applying now is because of the change in law. 00:29:14Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:29:15Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. So, let's say that you do have another condition that you want to, 00:29:23Madeline - Moderator: Get... you know, you've got a... you've got a condition that's gotten... 00:29:26Madeline - Moderator: Sorry, I'm getting my... getting tongue-tied here. Yes, you have another condition, and let's say that this condition you are already getting benefits for, but that condition's gotten worse, and so you want to ask for a rating increase within this same form. How would you do that from here? P10: Mike, I would put yes. P10: And then continue. 00:29:52Madeline - Moderator: And what would you expect to happen if you did that? P10: I would think it would either bring up, I guess all the conditions that have already been approved, P10: And I could either click on those to apply for an increase, or, like on the previous screen where it had, you know, a new claim. P10: So I would, you know, Pick that option. 00:30:21Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so we can go ahead and do that. 00:30:32Madeline - Moderator: That's fair. P10: then it would... would be the condition I haven't claimed before. P10: Or, we said, something was worse, right? 00:30:42Madeline - Moderator: Yes, so, and before we get into that, I just have a few other questions about this screen. Where do you think this list of options is coming from? P10: The... the file, showing all the things that, you know, you've been approved for, but the ratings, showing the ratings, so I think it's just something that comes up, because P10: I know when I... when I'm filing, it brings up everything that's been, approved. 00:31:14Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:31:16Madeline - Moderator: And what do you think about how they're organized here? P10: I guess find me, because I like organization, I would prefer it to be in, like, alphabetical order. 00:31:32Madeline - Moderator: Mmm. P10: Or, in order according to the rating. 00:31:35Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: Yeah. 00:31:38Madeline - Moderator: And from the screen, can you tell me which things the VA is already giving you benefits for? P10: Hypertension, migraines, and knee replacement. 00:31:48Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:31:49Madeline - Moderator: So, for this scenario, let's say that, for this condition that's worsened, let's say about 3 years ago you got rated for the hypertension, but in the last month you feel as though it's gotten worse, and so you want to try for a higher rating. What would you do here? P10: I would click on the hypertension and, and go to continue. 00:32:14Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and what would you expect to see next? P10: Something re- regarding the hypertension? P10: Maybe, like, a screen showing, the hypertension, and maybe something to explain why I'm requesting an increase. 00:32:35Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:32:35Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great, so we can go ahead and do that. P10: So my condition has gotten worse. 00:32:58Madeline - Moderator: What do you think is the... 00:33:00Madeline - Moderator: A difference between these two options here. P10: I think... P10: the, you know, one is you're applying for increased, a higher rating, whereas in the appealing, my previous rating would be, I guess, disagreeing with the rating, but you're not disagreeing with it, you're just wanting more, so I think P10: That's just the difference. 00:33:30Madeline - Moderator: Okay. Is there anything on this page that's maybe unclear or confusing? P10: No. 00:33:40Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:33:42Madeline - Moderator: So you can, go ahead and choose the option that you were going to, and yeah, we can proceed. P10: Mmm. 00:34:02Madeline - Moderator: So, what would you do on this screen? P10: I don't know, because it's weird, because it's how do you actually pinpoint when it got worse? P10: You know, when you're... you're having medical... P10: issues, you don't necessarily say, oh, January 1st! 00:34:22Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. P10: 2012, it got worse. It's just kind of, you know, one day you have a headache, and then you have, you know, two weeks go by, you have a headache. 00:34:31Madeline - Moderator: Weeks a month. P10: So you can't say necessarily when it got worse, so you just have to kind of pinpoint. P10: So... I would just... P10: Go to a default, where just pick a month, and the first of the month, and... Put, you know... P10: the year. P10: Yeah. 00:34:55Madeline - Moderator: So, and let's say for this scenario that you saw your doctor in early October, and that's when you heard, you know, got confirmation that the hypertension had gotten worse. 00:35:06Madeline - Moderator: So, this is, yeah, this is just one of the funky prototype things that'll just magically give you a date there. 00:35:14Madeline - Moderator: Oh. 00:35:15Madeline - Moderator: But we can go ahead and click continue. P10: Alright, since I turned the light on, like, all these mosquitoes are magically appearing. 00:35:25Madeline - Moderator: I'm just like, ugh. P10: Where are you coming from? Okay. P10: Continue. P10: Okay, so we filed, for the, the asthma. P10: They're previously denied, and then we file for an increase in the hypertension. P10: So those things are correct. 00:35:52Madeline - Moderator: So what do you think is happening on this screen? P10: Just confirmation of what you've already, applied, or, you know, what you've done thus far. Just giving you confirmation of, we've done these two things. P10: Do you want to do more things, or are you done? 00:36:13Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. 00:36:14Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so I'm going to ask you to... we're gonna add one more thing here. P10: Okay. 00:36:20Madeline - Moderator: So, yep, what would you do? P10: Hit yes and continue. 00:36:26Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:36:30Madeline - Moderator: So, this scenario is a little bit more complicated. Let's say that, imagine that about a year ago, you filed a claim for migraines, and VA approved it, and they gave you a 10% rating. 00:36:42Madeline - Moderator: But you believe they should have given you a higher rating, and so you want the VA to reconsider that original 10% decision. So you went back to your employer, you got them to write a letter about how many times you had to miss work because of your migraines, going all the way back to when you filed that initial claim with the VA about a year ago. 00:37:00Madeline - Moderator: And so you're hoping that this letter should help prove that your migraines were actually more severe than that original VA rating percent. P10: Okay. 00:37:10Madeline - Moderator: Do you have any questions about this scenario before we move forward? P10: No. 00:37:14Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and what do you think your options would be, if you were to ask the VA to reconsider that 10% rating? P10: To reconsider would be, like the... the previous, where it had the option of, P10: Disagreeing with their decision. P10: So it wouldn't necessarily be, filing for an increase, but, you know, you're... you're disagreeing with their initial decision. P10: So, I believe those would be my options. 00:37:48Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: So I would, you know, tap on the migraine. 00:37:53Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: And then... and continue. 00:37:56Madeline - Moderator: Alright, yep, we can go ahead and do that. P10: And so, then you would say I'm appealing my previous decision. 00:38:11Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and would you... is this screen what you expected to see? P10: Yes. 00:38:16Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:38:17Madeline - Moderator: And is there anything different going through your head now that you're seeing this screen for a second time? P10: No. 00:38:26Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:38:27Madeline - Moderator: So we can go ahead and continue. P10: Okay, so SANE can submit this claim. P10: You dis... disagree with, the previous decision? P10: So, either I have new evidence, or again, there's been a change in the law. So if I have new evidence, then I can expect something on the next page, to provide a place for me to submit that, new information or new evidence. 00:39:05Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and so can you tell me specifically how what's written here relates to the migraine scenario? P10: How what's written here? P10: Relates, because it says the migraine headaches at the top. 00:39:23Madeline - Moderator: And about the scenario specifically, about, you know, disagreeing with the rating? P10: What's the, what's the question? 00:39:33Madeline - Moderator: I guess, is there any... 00:39:37Madeline - Moderator: Any content on this page that relates to what you're trying to do with your migraine rating? P10: Just that... I guess that I have, new evidence that their original decision was incorrect. 00:39:55Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:39:57Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next here? P10: Hit continue, if I have the new evidence. 00:40:03Madeline - Moderator: Okay, yeah, let's say that you've got it right next to ya. P10: Okay. P10: So now we have them all listed. 00:40:22Madeline - Moderator: So, what do you think's happening here? P10: Again, just confirming everything that we've done so far with this, with our claim. P10: So just giving... giving a review and giving you the option to delete it or make any changes to it before moving on to the next step. 00:40:45Madeline - Moderator: Okay. So, let's say that's everything you want to claim today. What would you do next? P10: I would hit no. 00:40:53Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: there's nothing. P10: And then, continue. 00:40:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:41:06Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. So, that's the end of our first prototype, and then we can go ahead and click on Prototype Apple. P10: Okay. 00:42:03Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so we're gonna run through the same scenarios, for this prototype, and again, the main, you know. 00:42:11Madeline - Moderator: Third difference is scattered throughout, I guess. So, for this first scenario, same thing, let's say you started having arthritis in your shoulder, and you think it's because of an injury you had while in service, so how would you ask for disability compensation for that? P10: I would file, An, initial claim. P10: For the condition. P10: So I would, hit continue. 00:42:42Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so you can go ahead. P10: And because I haven't filed for it before, then I would put a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:42:58Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:43:00Madeline - Moderator: And... What are you thinking about how, This screen's organized. P10: I like it better than... P10: I guess I hadn't, the other screen, I don't know if it showed it like this, or showed, like, the denied conditions. P10: But I like how it separates the rated from the denied. 00:43:26Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: Yeah. 00:43:28Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:43:29Madeline - Moderator: So we're gonna shift into the next scenario, and this is that one relating to the PACT Act. As a refresher, you know, let's say you applied for disability benefits for asthma about 10 years ago, but the VA turned on the request, they didn't think it was caused by your military service, but now that the PACT Act has been passed. 00:43:49Madeline - Moderator: Have you learned that asthma is now a presumptive condition, and you believe that they should give you benefits for it. 00:43:54Madeline - Moderator: So we're gonna reapply for asthma, and how would you do that on the screen? P10: I would click on underneath the denied conditions and, click on the asthma. 00:44:05Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: And then... continue. 00:44:12Madeline - Moderator: Alright. 00:44:28Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: And so, for this one, it would be, based on a new law. 00:44:37Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: I waited. P10: Hit continue. 00:44:41Madeline - Moderator: Okay, yep, go ahead. 00:44:50Madeline - Moderator: Through having any... Other thoughts or reactions seeing this screen for a second time? P10: No. 00:44:58Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:00Madeline - Moderator: Alright, so we can shift to the next scenario. So, you know, let's say you've got a condition that you're already getting benefits for, but the condition's gotten worse, so you want to ask for a rating increase on the same form. What would you do from here? P10: I would say that I have another condition to add. P10: So I would say yes, and then continue. 00:45:26Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:35Madeline - Moderator: So again, on this screen, can you tell me which things the VA is already giving you benefits for? P10: Hypertension, tinnitus, migraine headaches, and knee replacement. 00:45:47Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:45:49Madeline - Moderator: And... I know we've talked a little bit in the beginning about 0% ratings. 00:45:58Madeline - Moderator: What do you think about tinnitus being included here? P10: I guess it's fine, because it's a... it's something that's, that is... P10: I guess, even though it's 0%, it is a rated condition, so, at any point, you can file for an increase on it. P10: Yeah. 00:46:23Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. P10: But... P10: So if there weren't any other conditions with a, you know, a higher percentage, at least with the 0%, you can still get VA benefits. 00:46:37Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, they're healthcare. 00:46:39Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:46:40Madeline - Moderator: And do you have any other, reactions to how the information is organized on this screen? P10: Still, I would like either it to be in alphabetical order or, in accordance to the rating percentage. 00:46:52Madeline - Moderator: and in accordance with the rating percentage, is there a specific way you'd like to see that? Like, higher to lower, lower to higher? P10: Yeah, lower to higher. 00:47:03Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and what would be... do you have a specific reason for that? P10: Cause here it's just... it feels a little all over the place. 00:47:12Madeline - Moderator: And I just... P10: Like, some kind of order, whether it's alphabetical or, by the percentages, to have them lined up. 00:47:23Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great, thank you. So, back to the scenario, this is the one where maybe 3 years ago, you got rated for hypertension, then the last month you feel as though it's gotten worse. 00:47:34Madeline - Moderator: And so you want to try for a higher rating, what would you do? P10: I would, click on the hypertension, and then, continue. 00:47:45Madeline - Moderator: Okay, yep, we can go ahead. P10: And... We'll still go with October. 00:47:54Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, yep. P10: Okay, great. P10: Continue. P10: I'm just going over a review of... What we've done thus far. P10: Okay. 00:48:19Madeline - Moderator: And so if you... I wanted to add one more condition, what would you do here? P10: Hit yes. 00:48:24Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:48:32Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great. 00:48:34Madeline - Moderator: So, this one we're not going to the migraine scenario, we're gonna move to a different topic, so you can go ahead and click continue at the bottom of the screen. P10: Okay. 00:48:48Madeline - Moderator: And, before we collect anything here, I'd like to hear from you how, in your experience, the two prototypes compared to each other, Prototype apple and Prototype banana. 00:49:00Madeline - Moderator: Did you find one of them easier to use? P10: I liked Apple better, simply because, like I... like I said about the, P10: The rated versus the denied, how it broke those up. P10: but other than that, they looked similar. 00:49:19Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:49:20Madeline - Moderator: And was there one that, 00:49:23Madeline - Moderator: Let's see, I know you said it was... seemed like 00:49:26Madeline - Moderator: You thought it was easier because of how the options were organized on that first page? 00:49:33Madeline - Moderator: Was there any other part of the prototype that you liked more than the other? P10: No, because they... other than that, they seemed the same. 00:49:43Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:49:44Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and were there any other differences that you noticed between, 00:49:49Madeline - Moderator: Either the, like, the first pages of Prototype Apple and Banana? P10: I don't think I noticed any other difference. 00:49:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:50:00Madeline - Moderator: So we can click on that, comparison screen link, that third option in the list. P10: It could have been a sole difference, but I know the other part was, like, the most obvious. P10: difference. 00:51:01Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:51:03Madeline - Moderator: So, yeah, take a minute to look at these two, and I'm wondering what you think about the... 00:51:09Madeline - Moderator: You know, any additional thoughts you have about the different versions of this screen? P10: And yeah, I like, the one on the left more? P10: in... I guess, because it's just... everything is right there. P10: I don't have to click on something else and wait for, you know, something else to pop up. P10: You know, if I... on the right, if I say a condition the VA previously denied, then you have to wait for another page to load, whereas in here, it's just all right there on the left. 00:51:54Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. 00:51:56Madeline - Moderator: And if this was actually your disability information, what would show up here? P10: If it was mine. P10: I guess my... P10: disabilities that have been rated. I don't even like the word disability, but my, conditions that have been rated, and then, my conditions that have been denied. 00:52:21Madeline - Moderator: And... 00:52:23Madeline - Moderator: As a follow-up, is there something specific? I know you swapped from disability to condition. What is it about the word disability that you don't like? P10: I don't know, because I guess even though... P10: You know, you have these conditions. P10: that may limit you in some capacity, but at the same time, I think I look at disability as just being incapable. 00:52:50Madeline - Moderator: doing... P10: certain things, or, you know, you see someone in a wheelchair, you know that's an obvious disability. P10: But to just, you know, tinnitus. P10: I wouldn't look at it as a disability. And I think for me, I'm also the type of person who, if I have a condition, I don't claim it as my condition. I'll just say, I have this, instead of saying. P10: Not to be insensitive of anyone who's listening, but you know how, someone may have cancer, and they say, my cancer. 00:53:26Madeline - Moderator: You know, I just... I don't... P10: claims stuff is mine, so to me, disability is just kind of saying I'm incapable of certain things. P10: So I just look at it in a sense of, like, a limiting word. 00:53:43Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay. And you would think, like, like, something like condition or other similar words would maybe be more, 00:53:52Madeline - Moderator: not necessarily... Empowering, but they wouldn't be... P10: I guess, like... 00:53:59Madeline - Moderator: Like, have a different connotation for the individual looking at the screen. P10: Right. 00:54:05Madeline - Moderator: Are there other words besides commission? Oh, sorry, go ahead. P10: No, because I was going to say, like, see even here when it says you're rated disabilities, and then it says your denied conditions. 00:54:15Madeline - Moderator: Mmm. P10: I mean, if you do still have, you know, sleep apnea, are you saying because it's denied, it's only a condition and not a disability? 00:54:25Madeline - Moderator: Kind of... P10: Saying. P10: is... P10: you know, kind of making it seem like the stuff that the VA hasn't approved is just a condition and not something that's, you know, disabling you in some way. 00:54:37Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: Jesus, yeah, but no, that'll probably be the only... Word... 00:54:46Madeline - Moderator: No, that's interesting and really good feedback, too. 00:54:51Madeline - Moderator: So, and we already know which one you'd prefer. Are you still sticking with Apple, that that's your preferred screen? P10: Yeah. 00:54:59Madeline - Moderator: Okay, and then I just have some, wrap-up questions. P10: Okay. What was this? Oh, really quick. 00:55:06Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. P10: I'll say, also, the reason why I do prefer the apple, because on the banana, where it just says a condition the VA previously denied. P10: you might not even remember all of the things that you've applied for that you're now having issues with, so I think being able to see them up front, it's like, oh yeah, I have, you know. 00:55:27Madeline - Moderator: Yeah. P10: That's been an ongoing issue, let me go ahead and, you know, see what I can do there. 00:55:34Madeline - Moderator: Okay, so that's... yeah. P10: If it's not in your... in your vision... in your vision, then it's kind of... you don't think about it, so... P10: Another reason why I do like that version. 00:55:45Madeline - Moderator: Okay, great, that's, yeah, good to know. What would you say was the most challenging part of this process, and it can be for either prototype? P10: Maybe... maybe it's just that one question about the... P10: the date, when did this increase, or, you know, when did it... when did this condition worsen? To me, that would probably... probably be the most challenging, because everything else is pretty much straightforward, but just having to think of when something got worse. 00:56:23Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: And... 00:56:25Madeline - Moderator: And was there anything that was, like, particularly surprising or maybe unexpected as you went through these prototypes? P10: No. 00:56:33Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:56:35Madeline - Moderator: Okay. 00:56:36Madeline - Moderator: And then... 00:56:39Madeline - Moderator: you know, I know you had mentioned hearing the term supplemental claim before we started this session, and that... I know you've also gone through an appeal process yourself. 00:56:51Madeline - Moderator: Let's see... I'm wondering, like, now that you've gone through these two prototypes, is there... 00:56:57Madeline - Moderator: Has your perception of what a supplemental claim is changed at all? P10: No, I guess, I guess because in the prototypes, there's still some things missing that's on the actual... when you're filing an actual claim, as far as the... P10: Do you have any files to upload? 00:57:19Madeline - Moderator: Things like that. P10: that, so I think that would be the difference in the prototype versus reality. P10: what, you know, the process of going through. So, this part is, you know, it's pretty straightforward. P10: Whereas in, you know, when I've recently, filed for an increase and stuff, it does have more things that you need to pay attention to or know, or, you know, asking about the addresses of P10: of, you know, doctor's offices or VA facilities, and so things like that, but... P10: No, this... made this seem pretty straightforward. 00:57:57Madeline - Moderator: Okay, okay, good. And then I want to ask a couple more questions about a different type of condition. So, if we look at the Apple screen on the left. 00:58:08Madeline - Moderator: Earlier in the session, we talked about a situation where a disability you got while in service later caused, like, a new or different problem. And so, let's say you have a knee condition, and you've gotten a VA rating for it, but lately you've started to have a new problem. 00:58:24Madeline - Moderator: and you think you're developing some back pain because you've been overcompensating for the knee. So you want to claim back pain as a disability, and what would you do on this screen? P10: A con... I... because there's, like, a secondary. P10: condition that you can apply for. So on this screen... I think I would still... P10: I think I will put a condition I haven't claimed before. 00:58:58Madeline - Moderator: Okay. P10: and then maybe... maybe on the next screen, it would say, okay, you know, if it's related to another screen or something like that, but since I hadn't previously claimed the back pain, I would put it as a new claim. 00:59:12Madeline - Moderator: Okay. Okay, that's great. And so before we close out, I'm gonna pause and see if Anne or Amy, if they have any questions for you. 00:59:26Madeline - Moderator: Do you want me to stop sharing? Yeah, you can. Yeah, you can. P10: Okay. Amy Goldman: I have a question. Amy Goldman: One thing I'm curious about is if there's anything... Amy Goldman: in the prototypes you've seen... oh, I'll... okay, first, if you were to attempt to, submit a claim or appeal your claim for back pain. Amy Goldman: Is there anything in the prototypes you've seen that would make it easier, you think, to do that? Is there something you'd like to see in what you were working with today that would make it easier for you to submit an appeal, and, like, less of a headache? P10: I guess because... P10: I'm thinking, you know, based on what Madeline said, that it's related to the knee pain, because I've been overcompensating, at least on that screen, even though it's a claim that I haven't previously, applied for, that it's related to P10: A claim that's already been accepted. P10: So maybe something on that screen, P10: That would say it's related to another claim. P10: I guess? Amy Goldman: Cool, thank you. Amy Goldman: That's good to know. P10: Excellent. Observer | Ann: I have one question for you, P10. P10: Okay. Observer | Ann: On the... the, I believe it was Apple, the prototype that you liked more. Observer | Ann: You had a longer list of both, rated and previously denied, so I think on the screen right now, you have about maybe, 7 or so? Observer | Ann: Even though. P10: Hmm? Observer | Ann: longer, let's say there was a total of 15 distributed between those two. Observer | Ann: Do you feel like it would still be easy to navigate in that view? P10: I think so. Observer | Ann: At least... at least for me, because even though it's... P10: a longer list, it's still... it puts it all out there, and I don't have to, you know, click something and then... P10: Forget about something, P10: Yeah, so for me, I think it would just be easier just to see everything listed. Observer | Ann: Okay, thank you. P10: Or if you can have, like, a little... what do they call it? The little carrot, the little arrow that lets you expand? P10: Maybe? Observer | Ann: Okay. P10: That's helpful. Thank you. P10: You're welcome. 01:02:15Madeline - Moderator: Hey, and P10, do you have any comments or questions for any of us? P10: I guess the only thing I can say is thank you for, you know, trying to make things easier for us veterans, those of us who, you know, who've... P10: who've experienced some things in our military experience and, want to be compensated for them, so thank you for, for making things easier. 01:02:43Madeline - Moderator: Of course, that's very, very sweet of you. But yeah, that... that's the goal, and... 01:02:52Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, with that, well, we all really appreciate you, taking the time to share your thoughts with us today, and all of the feedback that you have provided is so, so helpful to us as, we continue to work on the site, and, you know, the goal, as you said, was to make sure it really works for veterans. 01:03:11Madeline - Moderator: So, thank you. And lastly, Priggy and the recruiting company, they will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb, so that you can pass... that you can pass along to other veterans you may know, so that they also have a chance to participate in future research studies like this one. P10: Okay. 01:03:28Madeline - Moderator: So thank you so much again, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your... I looked up the time in Tanzania, so I hope you enjoy the rest of your evening, I should say. P10: Yeah, cause it's 7... it's after 7 here now. 01:03:40Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, I really appreciate you doing a late, late evening call with us. P10: Sure, sure, it's my pleasure. 01:03:48Madeline - Moderator: Yeah, well, thank you, and have a great rest of your... yeah, rest of your day. P10: Thank you, you all, too. 01:03:56Madeline - Moderator: Bye, P10.
