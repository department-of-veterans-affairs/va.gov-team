00:00:02Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, P01, I've started recording, and I'd like to confirm, do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today? P01: Yes. 00:00:10Maddie - Moderator: Okay, awesome. 00:00:12Maddie - Moderator: So, just a couple quick intro questions before we get into prototype testing. We just want to hear about your experience getting disability benefits, and since we might touch on some parts of your health situation, you can let us know if you know there's any topics you don't want to talk about, and what we're most interested in hearing is about your experience with the VA disability benefits process itself. 00:00:34Maddie - Moderator: So, starting off, have you ever filed for disability benefits? P01: Yes. 00:00:39Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and about how many times? P01: Maybe about… I think I'm on my third right now. 00:00:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay. And do you have an idea of how many disabilities the VA has approved? P01: They've approved… Maybe 5? P01: I think 5, maybe more than that, but I think 5. 00:01:09Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. And do you mind telling me what some of those are? P01: Yes, so PTSD, back, right shoulder, knee… P01: Actually, maybe 4. I think that might be it right now. 00:01:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay, great. And what… do you have an idea of what your overall disability percent is? P01: I'm currently 80%. 00:01:33Maddie - Moderator: 80%, okay, great. So we are going to jump right into testing some of these design directions. 00:01:42Maddie - Moderator: And so we're going to be evaluating a couple of prototypes. So we're going to show you two prototypes for designs that we're working on. These prototypes are not the real website, they're only partially functional, and so some parts of the prototypes are going to be clickable, and some are not. And because it's just a rough prototype, we've put in dummy data, and it's not connected to the real VA database at all. So nothing you do today will affect your own VA benefits or information at all. 00:02:06Maddie - Moderator: And so I'm going to put a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat, and then you can navigate to open that link, and once you have it open, please share your screen so we can see what you're doing. Okay. So I am going to copy and paste that in the Zoom chat now. 00:02:23Maddie - Moderator: Let's see here, chat… P01: Alright… P01: Let's see P01: And… let me get to sharing my screen. 00:02:46Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:02:54Maddie - Moderator: Amazing. So, let's see. Yeah, you can close out on that sign in with Google pop-up. P01: Where is that? 00:03:02Maddie - Moderator: Oh, maybe it's something I'm just seeing on mine. P01: That's insane. 00:03:05Maddie - Moderator: I'm sitting in the top. P01: Oh, I see it. P01: One second. 00:03:10Maddie - Moderator: Awesome. So, and just to context set for this scenario, I'm going to ask that you imagine that you have a few different health conditions that you want disability benefits for, and you've come to the VA website today to apply. And so, as you'll click through this prototype, you'll notice there's dummy data in here for an imaginary veteran, and this imaginary veteran is already receiving disability benefits for a few conditions. 00:03:35Maddie - Moderator: And so their data won't match yours, but I'd like you to imagine that you really are this person, and then tell us what you would do if this were your real situation. And so, as you use the prototype, just verbalize your thoughts out loud so we can understand how it's working for you. P01: Okay. 00:03:49Maddie - Moderator: So, from here, I'm going to ask you to click on that prototype banana link. P01: Alright. Kim: Good question. I'm not seeing P01's screen. Do you see it, Maddie? 00:04:00Maddie - Moderator: I do. Kim: Okay, I wonder… What is wrong with my thing? 00:04:05Maddie - Moderator: I've noticed there's been a Zoom update, and sometimes it appears as another tab within the Zoom window. Kim: That's what it is. Thank you. 00:04:14Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, P01, we're at Prototype Banana. So for this first scenario, you're going to reapply for asthma, which the VA denied when you applied 5 years ago, and since the PACT Act became law, you think the VA should change its decision. P01: Okay. So, from this screen, what would you do next? P01: So, from this screen, I'm clicking continue. 00:04:40Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:04:44Maddie - Moderator: And so, what are you noticing about this screen? P01: So I'm adding my, looking for the condition that I'm trying to… P01: trying to claim, I guess. P01: Okay, so, I'm gonna click on the selection that says the condition that the VA previously denied. 00:05:06Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:05:08Maddie - Moderator: And so, what's going through your mind as, you're considering what to do here? P01: So it's pretty… it's pretty self-explanatory. If I'm trying to, P01: I guess, reclaim a condition that was denied before. It's… P01: it's giving me everything that I'm really looking for. It's not, you know, does it seem too difficult right now? 00:05:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:05:31Maddie - Moderator: So you've selected, a condition the VA previously denied, that bottom radio button, what would you do next? P01: And then it says, add a condition. What condition would I like to add? P01: It seems like it repeated what… adjusted. 00:05:54Maddie - Moderator: You know. 00:05:54Maddie - Moderator: This is one of the funky prototype things. It looked like the screen reset when it jumped to top, but the main thing that changed is the selection. So, envision you're on that same screen, and now you've made your selection for the condition that the VA previous denied. Okay. So now what would you do? P01: Click continue. 00:06:12Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P01: Alright, so previously denied conditions, you can appeal the denied condition through a supplemental claim. You have a new and relevant evidence, a change in a law has made your condition presumptive. P01: That your service calls your conditioner. P01: What condition would you like to file a supplemental claim for? Okay, so it gives me the three claims that were denied previously, and I'm gonna add asthma, because that's what I… P01: Want to reclaim. 00:06:47Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and then, before we progress past this screen, what do you think of the information here? P01: On this particular screen right here. P01: You can be living in that additional suffering into a claim. P01: Neither relevant evidence. We haven't considered it before. P01: Any deadlines made. P01: Pretty… seems… again, it seems pretty simple. There's nothing, P01: nothing too difficult, I mean, self-explanatory. If I want to, claim a condition that was denied before, one of the first bullets says I need to new… either have new or relevant evidence, which, P01: makes sense, and then if the law is changed, as well, which, I guess that… with the condition that… the asthma that was denied before, I don't know the, P01: The reason behind that… But… P01: if I have all the proper documents, then I could continue to P01: continue to, I guess, file this claim again. 00:08:01Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P01: It seems like it doesn't seem… again, it doesn't seem… P01: Like anything that's too difficult on here. 00:08:07Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next, now that you've selected asthma? P01: So… I will continue. 00:08:13Maddie - Moderator: Okay. Yeah, you can go ahead and do that. P01: You submit a supplemental claim if you disagree with our previous decision, which is what I'm doing. I do disagree with the previous condition, decision, so, you have a new irrelevant evidence. P01: So it's… it's… P01: saying the same thing as in, like, the previous, I guess, screens, just to make sure that I understand that, P01: if I want to, P01: Submit another claim that… Submit a claim that was previously denied, that I make sure I need to have either new or relevant evidence. P01: You'd like to review us to review. You'd like to review your claim based on a new law, such as the PAT Act. Okay, new evidence is information we haven't considered before. Relevant evidence is information that proves or disapproves something in your claim. P01: Except for the form, you can upload evidence. Okay, so this, this… they're just letting me know that, I can upload my new, or… P01: Relevant evidence, coming up. P01: On the next screen, I assume, so… This is… Again, pretty self-explanatory. 00:09:24Maddie - Moderator: It doesn't seem too difficult. 00:09:26Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next here? P01: Click continue. 00:09:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yep, go ahead. P01: Review your conditions as undeniable by the VA on March 14th, supplemental claim based on new relevant evidence or change in law. Okay. P01: Okay, so they're letting me know that what, I need to… they're just letting me know, or showing me that P01: trying to claim my asthma again, letting me know that it was denied, and that I understand that I need to have either relevant or evidence, new evidence, or if it's a change in law. If I have another condition, yes or no, but which… P01: Not right now, I'm just blaming to asthma. P01: So I would hit no. 00:10:09Maddie - Moderator: Okay, well, what, before we… P01: I'm sorry. 00:10:12Maddie - Moderator: That's okay, before we progress past this screen, what is going through your mind as you look at it, or anything about the information here? Does it feel… 00:10:23Maddie - Moderator: Yeah, I won't finish that, I'll let you. P01: No, no, yeah, yeah, so again, no, it's getting right to the point. It's not giving me any information that I don't need. It's like, look, you know, if you… if you're filing for asthma again, or whatever claim it may be, this is what you need to have, and it jumps right to the point, so it doesn't… P01: give me a whole bunch of unnecessary information, which is what I like, so… 00:10:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so we're going to say that one of the conditions that you're already getting benefits for has gotten worse, and you want to ask for a rating increase within this same form. So, without clicking, tell me what you would do next. P01: Hmm… I'll probably click… P01: Do you have another condition to add? Now, maybe edit, because maybe I misread something, or saw something that, I didn't see something that I should have clicked, but I don't see anywhere… P01: And I have not seen anywhere to where I can add P01: Or click on something that says that P01: I'm sorry, you said that I'm trying to claim something that's gotten worse. Yeah, I hadn't… I didn't see anything that says I should claim something that's gotten worse. It's all… it's only, like, new evidence or relevant evidence. 00:11:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, let's see… where… this is going to… we're thinking of this almost as, like, let's say you have another condition that you're already getting benefits for that's gotten worse. So in the same claim where you're filing a supplemental claim for asthma. P01: And then you have another condition that's gotten worse. 00:12:07Maddie - Moderator: within the. P01: Okay. 00:12:08Maddie - Moderator: How would you, how would you do that? P01: Okay, then I would click yes, and then, continue. 00:12:15Maddie - Moderator: And what would you expect to happen if you click yes and then continue? P01: I expect it to give me another, selection of what condition that I'm trying to, claim. 00:12:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so yeah, you can go ahead and do that. 00:12:34Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so before we click on anything here, I want to ask you some questions about this screen. So what do you think about how some of the content here is organized? P01: Gee… So it shows me everything that's, that I am currently, P01: getting benefits for, are things that I've claimed before. It shows me my rating, which is good. P01: Condition… P01: But I don't see… I guess if… if I… one of the… these are my only, conditions that I'm… aside of the asthma, the other conditions that I'm receiving benefits for, so if I want to increase one of these, then I would select one of, one of these, but I don't see… P01: I'm assuming these are the only conditions that I'm receiving currently. 00:13:38Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. So, we're gonna say in this scenario that it's the hypertension that's gotten worse, and so you want to ask for a rating increase. So, imagine that you visited your doctor last month, they confirmed the hypertension had gotten worse, and you want to try for a higher rating. What would you do? P01: And I will click on Hypertension. 00:13:58Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P01: Did we have to add? P01: Okay, and then… I will click continue. 00:14:10Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and before you do that, what do you expect to happen? P01: I expect the… the next screen would be something to where I could add, maybe, P01: A reason, maybe add some type of documents or something showing my reason for, wanting that increase. 00:14:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yep, so you can go ahead and click continue. P01: I was about to claim this condition. We can file a claim for increase if your condition is worsened, or file a supplemental claim to disagree with our assessment of your condition. If your condition has gotten worse, I'm applying for an increase. I'm appealing a previous waiting. Okay, so in this case, my condition has gotten worse, so I will click that one that I'm applying for an increase. 00:14:55Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so what do you think is the difference between these two options? P01: Okay, previous rating, like a new relevant item. P01: appealing. P01: Seems… to me, it seems kind of the same, but it's just worded differently. Because both of them, you're, receiving an… You're trying to get an increase. 00:15:23Maddie - Moderator: Okay, is there something that's, like, specifically unclear or confusing about the two options? P01: People's radio, and I have new relevant evidence. P01: Yeah, it's just… it's just the wordiness of, I'm appealing, but if my condition's gotten worse and I'm applying for an increase, that means I'm appealing that as well. P01: So, yeah, it seems… I honestly wouldn't know which one. P01: To click on, because… P01: if I have, relevant evidence as well, because that's what I'm expecting, because if my condition got worse and I'm applying for an increase, I'm gonna have to show some type of documentation, showing that, I, you know, I should get that increase, so if… P01: Yeah, I honestly wouldn't know which one to click on. 00:16:13Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so for this study, for, let's say, for this scenario specifically, 00:16:19Maddie - Moderator: again, we're… so imagine that you visited your doctor last month, they told you your hypertension had gotten worse, and you want to try for a higher rating. If you had to pick one of these options, which one would you pick, and why? P01: The… my condition has gotten worse, because, again, it's the wording. It's specifically what I'm trying to do. My condition has gotten worse, and I'm applying for an increase. 00:16:43Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so you can, go ahead and do that. P01: And then I'll click continue. P01: When did your condition get worse? You can share an approximate date if your back pain started in the winter of 2020, did you say? Okay, so just let them know around about when, conditions started to get worse. 00:17:10Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:17:12Maddie - Moderator: And so, what would you do on this screen? P01: So I would… Select the, I mean. P01: in my opinion, I honestly wouldn't know exactly when the month, day, and year, like, it started to get worse. Like, in my previous experience, like, I don't pay attention to the exact day. Things start to hurt or get worse. I just notice overall that things get worse, so that would be difficult for me to answer. 00:17:39Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. So for this scenario, let's say that you saw your doctor in early October, and then that's when you heard your hypertension had gotten worse. Okay. And so this is one of the funky prototype things, these fields aren't fully interactable, but you can just click on any of them, and they'll populate. P01: Okay. 00:18:00Maddie - Moderator: Okay. So, we can continue. 00:18:07Maddie - Moderator: And so, what do you think is happening on this Review Your Conditions screen? P01: It's just giving me a brief overview of the things that I'm trying to, P01: the conditions that I'm trying to add are reclaimed. P01: And… claim for increase or worsen. P01: Okay, P01: Okay, so it's showing me that my asthma was denied, and I'm trying to show them… give them the evidence that proves that I should receive that, P01: condition, as claim. And then my hypertension, it shows that my current rating, and that I'm trying to get an increase for that. 00:18:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:18:54Maddie - Moderator: And is… What… what you're seeing on the screen, what you expected to see? P01: Yes, as far as review your conditions, yes. 00:19:04Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so what do you think of the detailed information under each condition? P01: Again, it doesn't give me too much. It gives me the minimum, information, tells me exactly what I'm trying to reclaim, or, P01: claim, and then it shows me exactly what my current rating is, or if my… if I was denied, it shows me everything that I'm, looking for. It doesn't give me unnecessary information, I guess. 00:19:36Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so… and to dig into that a little bit, why do you think it says claim for increase under hypertension? P01: Cause I have a current rating for that, and I'm looking for an increase for that. 00:19:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. P01: I don't have a rating for asthma. 00:19:52Maddie - Moderator: Got it. Perfect. 00:19:54Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, and then I'm going to ask you to add one more thing. So let's say you want to add another health issue to this form, what would you do from here? P01: I would click yes to add another condition. 00:20:06Maddie - Moderator: Okay, yep, you can go ahead. P01: And I'll click continue. 00:20:17Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so again, once again, before you click on anything, there's a couple questions I've got for you on this screen. Is there anything that you notice that has changed since the first time you saw this screen? P01: Yeah, so, when I add a condition or, Yeah, and when I… P01: when I've added a condition, it takes it away, from the screen, which is good, so I… P01: don't see that again, so it shows me what I have left to… to add. 00:20:43Maddie - Moderator: Hmm, and why do you think that that happened? P01: Maybe so that, I don't make a mistake and click… try to claim the same thing that I've already claimed before, so that I know that, oh, I've already, selected that option before. 00:20:58Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what do you think about that change on the screen? P01: I like that, again, because I could forget, and say that, oh, did I click that before? Have I added that yet? You know, or something like that. So, at least it tells me, and I know that I've already added that. 00:21:14Maddie - Moderator: Okay, great. So, as I mentioned, we're going to add one more condition here, but this scenario is a little bit more complicated. So, imagine that about a year ago, you filed a claim for migraines, and VA approved it, and they gave you a 10% rating, but you believe they should have given you a higher rating, and you want the VA to reconsider their 10% decision. So, you went back to your employer, and you got them to write a letter about 00:21:39Maddie - Moderator: How many times you had to miss work because of those migraines, going all the way back to when you filed that claim a year ago. 00:21:46Maddie - Moderator: And this letter should help prove that your migraines are more severe than that original VA rating percent. 00:21:53Maddie - Moderator: So before we continue, do you have any questions about this scenario? P01: So, I understand that I'm trying to get an increase for my migraine. I have a letter proving, that my condition has worsened, essentially. And… no, so, yeah, I understand that. I have all the information that I need. 00:22:14Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what do you think your options would be to ask the VA to reconsider that 10% rating? P01: To add relevant, what, on, on, on the screen, you're asking? 00:22:28Maddie - Moderator: Or in general about this scenario, like, thinking what, you know, you've got the letter from your employer, you, you know, proving that your migraines have been more severe than maybe this 10% assessment, and you're ready to go to the VA. So what do you think some of those options might be? P01: To add the relevant document showing that I've, P01: I guess, showing that my migraines have increased. 00:22:52Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so looking at the screen now, what would you do? P01: I would click, migraine headaches. 00:22:58Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and what do you expect to happen next? P01: I expect the next screen to be, P01: Well, I would expect the next screen to show me where I can add, additional documents. 00:23:11Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay, so we can, go ahead and do that. P01: Cutting. P01: And then I'll click continue. P01: How do you want to play in disconditioning? P01: again. P01: So, this one… It's a little tricky, because… P01: my condition has gotten worse, and I would be applying for an increase, but I also have relevant evidence proving that. P01: So, I would probably click on the, I'm appealing. 00:23:49Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P01: One, just because I have the evidence, I guess. 00:23:56Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:23:57Maddie - Moderator: Is there, anything that… before we do that, is there anything that's going through your head as you look at this… see the screen for a second time? P01: I hope that's the right selection. 00:24:07Maddie - Moderator: Okay, fair enough. P01: Other than… other than that, I… yeah, because like I said, the wording is… I really wouldn't know which one to click. 00:24:14Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. So you can go ahead and, yeah, choose the option that you think is most appropriate here. P01: Okay. P01: And then I'll click continue. 00:24:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P01: You can submit a supplemental claim if you disagree or offer you for saving money. P01: And you meet one of these requirements. New, relevant evidence, okay. P01: Alright. 00:24:41Maddie - Moderator: So, what's going through your head as you look at this screen? P01: So, it only shows me this if I clicked, appealing, P01: one. However, if you click the… P01: the increase, I may have evidence for that as well. 00:24:58Maddie - Moderator: But it doesn't show me this. P01: when I click on the… The increase. P01: So, I think that's a little… I think that's misinformation. 00:25:12Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:25:14Maddie - Moderator: And so, looking at the content that's here, how do you think what's written here relates to your migraine scenario? P01: Being that I already… that I have the documents, P01: And it shows me what relevant evidence means. I think this matches perfectly with what I'm trying to do right now. 00:25:34Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so what would you do next? P01: Upload. P01: I will hit continue and expect to be able to upload my evidence on the next screen. 00:25:45Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so you can go ahead and do that. P01: MSCC? P01: Yes, ma'am. P01: Yes, he's right here. P01: I'm sorry. 00:26:10Maddie - Moderator: That's okay. P01: So… 00:26:18Maddie - Moderator: So what do you think's happening here? P01: So it's… It doesn't give me… it just jumps straight to the review. 00:26:24Maddie - Moderator: Everything that I'm trying to claim, and I'm not seeing anywhere to where I can add anything. 00:26:29Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P01: So maybe on the next screen? 00:26:33Maddie - Moderator: Okay, can you tell me what's changed on the screen? P01: Yeah, so… So, it's a couple of things that's different, P01: So, for my asthma, that was denied. P01: It says supplemental claim based on new relevant evidence of changing law. Okay. P01: But… My migraines, my current rating is 10%, and it also says supplemental claim based on new relevant evidence. P01: But my hypertension… see, that one… P01: So both of those… so my hypertension and migraine headaches both show the current rating, 10%, but one's a supplemental plane based on new relevant evidence, and one's just… P01: claim for increase. P01: I don't know why those are. P01: it's… it's just that one… that one question that really doesn't… I don't understand why it's worded the way it's worded, because I have documents showing P01: Boom. P01: are the relevant evidence showing for, I guess, all of these conditions? P01: So why is it an option? P01: Why doesn't it give me an option for… P01: I don't know why… I guess, why is that an option for the claim for increase, but not the relevant evidence? P01: If I have evidence for all of them. 00:27:53Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. 00:27:55Maddie - Moderator: Is… let's see… 00:27:59Maddie - Moderator: Is there any, additional thoughts you have on how the information on this screen is organized? P01: No, it's organized in a way that I selected, P01: The claims. I first selected asthma, then hypertension, then migraine headaches. 00:28:23Maddie - Moderator: Oh. P01: My invoice on October 1st. It shows me when my claim was working. That's what I clicked on. Denied on October… or March 14th. P01: So, if… for the migraine headache, it didn't give me an option for when That, started to… P01: Worsen as well, but it did for the hypertension. 00:28:52Maddie - Moderator: And why do you think that is? P01: Mmm… P01: Probably because I clicked on the relevant evidence one, and if I have the evidence, then I guess the evidence proved when it started, I guess? I'm not sure, because I don't have to… P01: For the hypertension, I didn't have to show any type of… P01: evidence, I guess. It just gave… gave me an option to choose when, the conditions worsen. 00:29:21Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. 00:29:22Maddie - Moderator: And, let's see, is there anything… any other commentary on the detailed information under each of these conditions? Anything you think maybe could be added, or be removed, or anything to make it more clear? P01: I think… I think that would be the biggest, P01: The biggest, thing that needed to be changed, like, the… P01: Like, do they want me to add documentation for the hypertension as well, if I'm choosing a claim for increase, or do I just have to choose… are they just going by the date that I selected? P01: versus if I have relevant evidence, I think that would be the biggest one. So, I'm not sure if I need to show proof for the hypertension, or they're just going by what I selected, or what. 00:30:15Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. No, that's great. So, let's see… And… 00:30:27Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and so when we're looking… 00:30:32Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, sorry, I had to get my bearings there. Let's say that, for the sake of this prototype, that that's everything that you wanted to claim today. What would you do next? P01: Then I would select? No, because I don't have another condition to add. 00:30:48Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P01: And then I would click continue. 00:30:51Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so you can go ahead and do that. 00:31:01Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:31:02Maddie - Moderator: So, let's see, since we were only able to do one prototype today, I do have a couple of follow-up questions. What would you say was the most challenging part of this process? P01: Just figuring out, what… P01: what… what documents are… not what documents I need, but what, claim I need to have documents for, and what claim I don't need to have documents for. That would be my biggest thing, because I'm still, like, thinking about it now. I'm still unsure if I need to provide documents for the… if my claim is worsened or not. 00:31:38Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay. And was there anything that was otherwise surprising or unexpected to you as you went through this prototype? P01: outside of that, everything else, to me, was pretty self-explanatory. It was fine. I like simple. I don't like too many words, I guess you can say, just straight to the point. 00:32:04Maddie - Moderator: And then before this session, had you heard the term supplemental claim before? P01: I have heard supplemental claims before, but, not as far as, the VA claims goes. More so, like, insurance. Okay, okay, got it. 00:32:20Maddie - Moderator: Well, let's say now that you've done this, completed this prototype, could you explain to me in your own words what you think a supplemental claim is? P01: I think supplemental claim would be, like, P01: Well, then I think about it. P01: No, not really, I guess, because it didn't really explain what the supplemental claim was. 00:32:45Maddie - Moderator: Okay. 00:32:47Maddie - Moderator: Okay. P01: just assumed that it was just, just wording, I assumed it was the same thing. P01: Just generic claims. P01: I didn't think it would be anything… P01: I guess anything different than the claim that I'm filing for. I thought maybe it was called… that's what it's called, supplemental claims, or something like that. I didn't think anything else of it. 00:33:11Maddie - Moderator: Okay, okay, great. So I know we're in our last few minutes here, so just to wrap up this session, I'm gonna ask if anyone else on the line has any questions for you. Kim: I have a quick question. P01: Okay. Kim: Yeah, P01, have you ever appealed a decision on a claim that the VA made for you in real life? P01: So I'm currently in that process now. Kim: And how are you appealing it? P01: Through a lawyer. Kim: Through a lawyer, and do you know, what type of appeal they're gonna do? P01: I honestly don't know, which is why I got the lawyer. Kim: Got it. And what… and if you don't mind, telling me, what are you appealing? P01: It claims for, dot… I guess, increase. Kim: Things that… things that were denied as well, denied, and, claiming, increase as well. Kim: Okay, so you've got, like, a condition that they just flat-out denied that you're appealing. P01: I have a couple of conditions that were denied. Kim: Okay, and then it sounds like there's another condition that they… P01: There's some increases as well. Kim: Okay, so they rated you, but you disagreed with what the rating was? P01: Yes. Kim: Okay, got it, got it. Great, thank you, that's all my questions. P01: Yeah. 00:34:40Maddie - Moderator: Okay, any other questions from our folks on the line? 00:34:46Maddie - Moderator: Okay, and P01, do you have any comments or questions for me or anyone else here? P01: No ma'am. 00:34:54Maddie - Moderator: Okay, so, we want to really, you know, we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.
