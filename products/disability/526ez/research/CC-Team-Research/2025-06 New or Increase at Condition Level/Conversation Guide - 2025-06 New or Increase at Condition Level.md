# Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

My colleagues and I work on va.gov, improving the site so that Veterans can submit claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. We hope to improve the process by talking to veterans like you.

Before we start, I have a few things to go over with you:

* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you over time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.  
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback.  
* If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem, just let me know. You’ll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.  
* Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?  
  * *If no:* Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
  * *If yes:* Admit observers.

  *When observers arrive:*

* Ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.  
* Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session.  
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, and then we destroy the recordings when we’re done with the analysis.  
  * Knowing that, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today?  
* \[Record answer here\]  
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

**➡️ Start recording.**  
*Tip: After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.*

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

\[Record answer here\]

# Warm up (5 min)

We’re going to look at a website for Veterans to file disability claims online. Before we start, I’ll ask a few background questions. I’m going to ask about your own disability claim experience. Please only share as much as you’re comfortable with. If you don’t want to talk about your specific disabilities, that’s fine. And anything you tell us today won’t affect your actual VA care or benefits in any way.

* Have you filed for disability compensation before?

  * *if yes* Did you do it online or some other way?

  * Do you have any rated disabilities now? 

    * About how many different disabilities?

    * If you’re comfortable sharing, could you tell me some of the disabilities you have?

  * When was the last claim that you filed?

    * If you’re comfortable sharing, can you tell what disabilities you filed for in that claim?

* Are you planning to file another disability claim anytime soon?

  * *if yes* If you’re comfortable sharing, can you tell me a little about why you’re planning to file a claim.

# Set up scenario (5 min)

Let’s get started with the website prototype. I’m going to show a design that we’re working on, so we can get your feedback.

* It’s not the real website. It uses fake data, not your real information.  
* Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

Before I give you the link to the prototype, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. If you have tabs you don’t want to show, you can go ahead and close those out before you share. 

*Wait for screen sharing to work (instructions for [iphone](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share) and [Android](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share) if participant is having trouble).* 

Now, I’m going to put a link to the prototype **https://staging.va.gov/user-testing/conditions** in the Zoom chat. You can click on that link. It should open in your browser.

Before you start using the prototype, I’ll set up the scenario. 

* I’d like you to fill this out as if this was your real disability claim. As you’re going through it, please voice your thoughts out loud so we can understand what you’re thinking. We’re not in a hurry, so please take as much time as you would if this was your real claim.  
* For today, we’re starting in the middle of the claim application. In this scenario, You’ve already entered your name and personal information, and now you’re moving on to the next step.  
* Let me set the scenario for you:  
  * *New condition…*  
    * *\[If we can refer to their actual conditions, pick one.\]*   
      You want to file a claim for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  
    * *\[If we can’t use their actual condition\]* You have recently started getting arthritis symptoms in your knee, which you think is from a knee injury you got while in service. You’d like to file a new claim for that.  
  * Because this is fake data, we’ve set it up so that you’ve already been rated and are getting compensation for some other conditions: Tinnitus, Sciatica, and Hypertension. 2 of these conditions have gotten worse, and you’d like to get more compensation for them.  
  * So, you’ve come to this website to file a claim. You want to file for 3 conditions: *\[new condition\]* and two that you’re already rated for.
* OK, go ahead and start, and please remember to voice your thoughts out loud. 

# Task 1 \- complete walkthrough (15 min)

*On first screen, direct user to click the link “Start your application without signing in.”*

*On the second screen, direct user to click radio button for Mango.*

*Then let user work through scenario themselves.  Remind them to verbalize their thoughts if needed.* 

* *They may need prompting to add all three conditions.*  
* *For the increase conditions, they can pick which ones they want to claim.*  
* *Note: End on the “Review your conditions” screen. Do not go to Review Application screen.*

#### Rating scale

* Now that you’ve stepped through this prototype, I’d like you to rate the prototype. For each of these statements, please give me a rating on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is Strongly **Dis**agree, and 5 is Strongly **Agree**.  
  * First statement: I am satisfied with the ease of completing the tasks in this scenario.   
    *Prompt if needed: the scale is 1 for strongly disagree, to 5 for strongly agree.*  
  * Second statement: I am satisfied with the amount of time it took to complete the tasks in this scenario  
    *Prompt if needed: the scale is 1, strongly disagree, to 5, strongly agree.*

#### Follow-up questions

Now I’ll ask some follow-up questions.

* Overall, how was that experience for you?  
* Did anything work differently from what you expected?
  * Were there any times when it asked for information that you didn't expect to be asked about?
  * Was there any information you wanted to add that there wasn't room for?  

* What part of this process was most challenging, and why?  
* What, if anything, felt unclear or confusing?
* Did you ever feel lost or unsure what to do next?

* What do you think about how long it took?  
* What do you think about the number of questions?

* _[optional depending on time]_ Let's say you were telling another Veteran about this process. How would you describe it to them?
  
# Task 2 \- Specific screen probes (15 min)

*Ask questions as time allows. Skip any questions that have already been answered above.*

I have some more specific questions on some of the screens, so let’s go through adding one more condition. 

I’m going to ask you to pause for questions about each screen. If I ask “do you remember something” or “can you explain this to me” \-- please know I am NOT testing you. I’m testing whether the design is working well.

* For this scenario, imagine that the Sciatica you got from military service is now causing your left shoulder to over-compensate, and you now have tendonitis in that shoulder. You’d like to add shoulder tendonitis to your claim. 

Go ahead and walk me through how you would add tendonitis in your shoulder.

##### Select new/increase screen

* What do you think about the options on this screen?  
* Where do you think this list of options came from?  
* When you first saw “A condition I haven’t claimed before”, what did you think that meant?  
* Did you notice that the list of options got shorter? _[If not, mention that the number of options changed from 4 to 2]_
  * Do you have any idea why that is?  
  * What do you think of that? Is that confusing at all?

##### Add new condition screen

* Was there anything unclear or confusing on this screen?  
* There are some instructions on this page.
  * Were any of these useful when you first used this page?
  * Was there any text you skipped or didn’t read?
  * Were any unclear or easy to miss?

##### Laterality  screen

* Was there anything unclear or confusing on this screen?

##### Start date page

* What did you think of this screen?  
* Do you know the specific start date for any of your conditions?  
* What would you do if you don’t know the start date?  
* Did you notice the text in gray where it says “for example”?  
* What do you think this is?  
* Was it helpful or not helpful to you?

Before you click continue, I have a couple of questions.

* What condition is this screen asking about? How can you tell?  
* The next screen will ask about what caused your condition. Do you remember what any of the options were?  
* Ok, go ahead click Continue.

##### Cause page

* What do you think the purpose of this page is?  
* How difficult or easy was it to choose the right option?  
* If a friend asked you to explain the different options, what would you say to them?

##### Cause details page (secondary condition)

* Any comments on this page?  
* Is there anything unclear?

##### Review your conditions page

* What do you think this page is for?  
* What do you think of how it’s organized?

##### Edit page

* What if you realized you put the wrong start date on the condition. What would you do?  
* What do you think of how this works?  
* What if you decided you didn’t want to claim \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. What would you do?  
* What do you think of how this works?

# Wrap-up (5  min)

Great, that’s all my questions.

Before we wrap up, do you have any other thoughts or suggestions you’d like to share about the prototypes?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks\! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!
