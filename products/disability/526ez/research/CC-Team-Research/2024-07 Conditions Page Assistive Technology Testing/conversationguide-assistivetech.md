## Intro - 5 Minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME] and \[NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, let me tell you what we will do.

My colleagues and I work on va.gov, improving the site so that Veterans can submit claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. We hope to improve the process by talking to veterans like you.  

Before we start, I want to confirm some information with you: 

- Do you use assistive technology (screen magnifier or screen reader) 

- Are you using the tech right now? 

  - What’s the type of AT and program you are using (ex. Screen reader, JAWS) 

  - What type of device and operating system  (mobile/desktop/tablet on Android/windows/mac) 

- Will you be using it for this study? \[if no to any of these questions, say “I’m sorry but unfortunately, you do not qualify for this study. Thank you for your time, but we will be ending this study. End the study] 

Great, we are good to continue. I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- We have an accessibility expert on this call in case we need any support 

- This entire session should take about 60 \[for screen magnifier] and 90 \[for screen reader] minutes. 

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback**

- If you want to stop the session for any reason or at any time, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of it we complete.
  #### Observer consent

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
   - `IF NO` use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - `IF YES:` Admit observers and ask them to turn on cameras and briefly introduce themselves, then turn cameras back off to save bandwidth

  #### Recording consent
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
   - `IF YES`: 
     - We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 
     - The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
     - Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.  
   - `IF NO`: 
      - I understand, and that's no problem. We'll just take notes for today's session.

*Start recording.*
 - **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
 - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

## Warm up:
Today we're going to be evaluating a website. 

Before we look at the website, I’d like to start with a few background questions and learn more about your experience with AT. 

#### AT user questions

- How would you rate your level of experience using a screen reader/magnifier - beginner/**i**ntermediate/advanced/expert 

- How long have you been using this AT?  

- When or how often do you use it 

- Have you encountered any specific challenges when using AT with VA websites or forms?

- Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen reader/magnifier?

Thank you for sharing that information. Next, I have a couple of questions about your experience with VA benefits.

#### VA Benefit questions

- Are you receiving any disability benefits from the VA?

`IF YES`:
- When did you apply?
- Do you recall how you filed claims in the past (online or by mail)?
- How satisfied were you with the claim filing process?
- Are you in the process of or considering filing any new disability claims in the near future?
  - If yes, how do you intend to file the claims (online or by mail)?

`IF NO`:

- Have you filed any claims previously?
- If yes:
  - What was the outcome of the claim?
  - How did you file the claims (online or by mail)?
  - How satisfied were you with the claim filing process?
- Are you in the process of or considering filing any disability claims in the near future?
  - If yes, how do you intend to file the claims (online or by mail)?

## Transition to Website
Great! Now let’s get into evaluating the website. 

Before I send you the link to the prototype, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. If you have tabs you don’t want to show, you can close them before you share. 

_Wait for screen sharing to work (instructions for_ [_iphone_](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share) _and_ [_Android_](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share) _if participant is having trouble)._ 

_SR INSTRUCTIONS: Once you’re in the share screen pop-up, we need you to tab a few times until you hear “share sound.” It’s a checkbox, and you’ll want to check that checkbox. Then, you tab until you click the “Share” button._ 

- The first thing we’ll do is open your browser and go to our demo site, which will look like an exact copy of the standard VA.gov. However, we won't be able to access anything related to your regular account and benefits. The website is <https://tinyurl.com/conditiontest123> OR <https://staging.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction> 
  
- We’ll have you sign-in with a fake ID.me account
> `Test 1: Username:` <vets.gov.user+152@gmail.com> 'PW:' Veteran1
> `Test 2: Username:` <vets.gov.user+153@gmail.com> 'PW:' Veteran2
> `Test 3: Username:` <vets.gov.user+154@gmail.com> 'PW:' Veteran3

- Okay, you should now be on the disability benefits application. We’re going to skip a few pages, I'll guide you to the correct page.

1. About midway through the page there is a header “Already know this is the right form”. Navigate there and then Click on “If you know VA Form… is right, apply now” 

2. The page is loading

3. Ok the page has loaded, now navigate to “Continue your application” button 

4. The page is loading 

5. Now you’re on the itent to file page, press continue. You do not need to read anything on this page. 

6. Ok, now we are on the right page. 

 ## Conditions Page
 Screen 2 - Enter/select condition

You have now entered the page on the disability benefits application where you input what NEW conditions you want to claim. 

I’d like you to go through this website as if this is your very first time applying for disability benefits. I’m going to ask you to think of your own situation as you move through and answer the questions. If you don’t want to do that, then I will provide a hypothetical situation instead that you can use to answer. Are you comfortable thinking about your own situation for this exercise? 

I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this page. 

Alright, whenever you're ready, please start exploring the page, and please think aloud as you go through it. Go ahead and do what the page is asking you to do, then I’ll give you a few more tasks and scenarios. 

_Have participant enter their own conditions._ 

_Mock Scenarios_ 

- _You have developed bursitis in your right knee._

- _Your doctor told you that you have Tonic-Clonic Seizures_

- _You have inflammation in your kidneys_ 

* _You had surgery to have your right hip replaced_ 

- _You have lost your appetite for the last six months_ 

Specific Tasks 

- [ ] Task 1: Add a condition (based on their own or the mock scenarios)

- [ ] Task 2: Add multiple conditions (based on their own or the mock scenarios)

- [ ] Task 3: Edit a condition: You've realized you accidentally selected the wrong condition. You have bursitis in your left knee, not your right. How would you change that? 

- [ ] Task 4: Remove a condition: You've decided not to claim for 'bursitis in knee, left' at this time. Please remove this condition from your claim.

- [ ] Task 5: Test error state: Please navigate to 'add a new condition' and then try to submit without entering anything. 

- [ ] Task 6: Scroll through suggestions: Try adding PTSD, combat-related. As you type, please scroll through the suggestions before selecting. 

  - [ ] Type P, scroll through the list, and then type T, scroll through the list, and then type S. (At this point let them select PTSD)
