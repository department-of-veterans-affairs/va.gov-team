## Trip details

- Dates: July 14-16, 2018
- Attendees: 
  - Andrea Schneider, Product Lead

## Trip Goals

- Observe veterans working with DAV to submit claims
- Learn more about how the VSO helps the veteran capture information and gather evidence
- Recruit veterans who are submitting a Claim for Increase to use the vets.gov application for this submission
- Research goals for Alex – how do people feel about going through the process (in general)
- how do VSO’s know what disabilities to identify? We’ll have access to veterans, VSOs and VHA people – get firsthand experience/perspectives
- What terms do people use when talking about claims? What words do people use when describing claims – keep this organic and listen. 
- Can we shadow a veteran through an entire process of identifying the claim, going through the DBQ process, and back to the claim submission – how does this feel for the veteran? 
- Can we follow up with these veterans to see how long it takes for claim adjudication and how successful it is? 
- Capture veteran info/recruit veterans willing to participate in future research 
- Determine/validate file size, size, format

## Communicating with Veterans

Explain that we have built an easy-to-use self service tool to help veterans in Disability Claim submissions, focusing on Claim for Increase at the moment. It is a new tool that isn’t available to the public yet, as we’re still bug hunting, but would appreciate any support by submitting their Claim for Increase through our tool. We’ll be able to track the claim to ensure that the appropriate data is captured and that the claim is routed appropriately in the VA. We’re slowly going to roll out the application, and if veterans would like to be added to an email distribution inviting them to use the tool at a later date, we can capture their email address. 

We’re not marketing the tool as the latest and greatest in self service tools quite yet, so be sure to downplay the availability of the application at the moment. 

## Engaging with VSOs

If we are able to find a veteran or two willing to submit their claim through our application, we’ll want to see if a VSO can look in VBMS to find the claim after submission. Jon had assured us this wouldn’t be a problem, but we’ll need to coordinate with VSOs working in the Claims Lab to be sure.
