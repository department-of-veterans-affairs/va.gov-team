# Research Plan for Copy of Form Submission

Disability Benefits, Core Team, September 2025

## Background üèóÔ∏è
  
We are implementing the design platform's pattern ‚Äú[keep a record of submitted information](https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/keep-a-record-of-submitted-information)" in a new Confirmation Page to enable users to access what they entered on the disability benefits form after they click "Submit." In order to make the information more scannable, we added header titles for information hierarchy. This research will validate our updates proposed improvements to this design system pattern.  
  
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`  
At the present, veterans cannot see, download, or print a copy of their completed disability application data (form 526ez, and nested forms) for their records after hitting submit. The prototype we are testing in this research, an update to the new confirmation page for the online disability benefits form, would enable users to access what they submitted on the form after they click "Submit."  
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`  
Authenticated  
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`  
Veterans may have filled out the disability application and have interacted with it in the past, but not frequently enough to have familiarity with it. This will be an iteration on an existing confirmation page, which currently does not give any copy of submission.

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md)

  
`Objective 1: VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  
  
> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.  
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.  
  

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

  

-   Starting up - Attending to health needs
-   Taking care of myself
-   Putting down roots

  

## _Research Goals ü•Ö_

  
**Goal 1: Gather feedback on the overall content of the page.**  
  
**Goal 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the formatting and visual hierarchy of submitted information within the accordion.**  
  
**Goal 3: Evaluate whether users are able to find information on ‚ÄúWhat happens next‚Äù and how to ask for help on the page**.  
  
**Goal 4: Determine if users understand how and are able to save and/or print all the content from the Confirmation Page**  
  

### Outcome

This research will give us a better understanding of claimants‚Äô experience and their understanding on the copy of submissions data in the Confirmation page. We expect to find insights on the usability, language clarity, and navigability of the accordion and the submission data attached. These insights will help ensure claimants can access a copy of their submitted data, and understand how to save a digital copy or print it. Furthermore, we will also get feedback on the overall content of the Confirmation Page.  
  

## _Research questions_

  
(Page as a whole)  
**Goal 1: Gather feedback on the overall content of the page.**  

-   Without any prompts, how do users interact with the Confirmation Page?
-   What sections of the Confirmation Page do users find the most valuable?
-   What sections of the Confirmation Page do users have questions about?
-   Do people understand they won‚Äôt be able to come back to this page once they leave it?
-   How do people expect to access a copy of their submission after they leave this page?

  
(Content inside the accordion)  
**Goal 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the formatting and visual hierarchy of submitted information within the accordion**  

-   Can a user easily interact with the accordion and find the information they submitted?
-   Can a user find specific pieces of information within the accordion? (e.g., Dates of service, conditions, etc)
-   Do users intuitively understand that the accordion only shows information they inputted (i.e., it omits sections of the 526EZ form that they skipped)?

  
**Goal 3: Evaluate whether users are able to find information on ‚ÄúWhat happens next‚Äù and how to ask for help on the page.**  

-   Can a user easily interact with the accordion and find the information they submitted?
-   From the Confirmation Page, are the users clear on the next steps of the claims process and how to reach out to VA for help?

  
**Goal 4: Determine if users understand how and are able to save and/or print all the content from the Confirmation Page.**  

-   Can a user view/save/and print their submitted information?
-   Without intervention, how would users save the content on the Confirmation Page?
-   When printing the page, what do users expect to be actually printed from the Confirmation Page?
-   Is the default browser functionality for printing (button for ‚ÄòPrint this page‚Äô) sufficient and intuitive for all users?

  

### Hypotheses

-   Most participants are able to intuitively interact with the Confirmation Page to find the info they entered in their disability benefits application.
-   Most participants will not understand that the info on this page disappears (i.e., not retrievable) after they quit/leave the page.
-   Most participants will be able to find specific pieces of information they filled out in their application within the accordion, despite its length.
-   From the Confirmation Page, most participants are able to learn what happens next in the disability claim process.
-   From the Confirmation Page, most participants will be able to locate how to ask the VA for help on their disability claim.
-   Most participants will be able to successfully save or print their submitted information.
-   Participants find the new functionality of saving and printing a copy of their submission useful.

## Methodology üõ†Ô∏è

**[Usability Testing]**  
We will be testing using a Codespace prototype that will include 3 pages for the user to interact with. The Codespace prototype will follow this [design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/zduybBnXDjVkKpJosfC6oh/526---Submission---Provide-a-Copy-Update-7.2?node-id=1248-187297&starting-point-node-id=1248%3A187297).  

-   **Page 1: Login Page**

	-   Will simulate the user logging back into their account after taking a break filling out the form.

-   **Page 2: Review and Submit Page**

	-   Will help situate the user within the form so they understand that they have finished filling out the form and are going to submit their information.

-   **Page 3: Confirmation Page**

	-   This is the page we are conducting usability testing on. This page lets the user know that they have submitted their form and that they are able to print a copy of their submission.

### Location

Remote through Zoom
