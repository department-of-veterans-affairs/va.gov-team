## Introduction \- 5 minutes

Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. My name is \[NAME\] and I  work on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov). I am part of a team that is trying to improve it so Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible.

***I'm going to start by sharing what we hope to do today*** and providing an overview of how you'll participate. Then we'll do some introductions and then get started with taking a look at the form that we'd like to get your feedback on.

\[PAUSE\] Does that sound good?

What I hope to do today is get your feedback on one part of the online Disability Benefits form (526EZ form) so we can make the process better.

\[PAUSE\] Have you filled out this form before?

Ok, great. I want you to know that today, I don‚Äôt want to add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits. As a heads up, we may take a look at disability claims experiences that may have caused frustration for you in the past, and I want you to know upfront that I don't have any contact with claims reviewers and I don't have any access to your records. However, I do want to gather your feedback in case there are things we can improve in the future. 

\[PAUSE\] Do you have any questions so far?

***Now we'll talk a little about your participation***: 

* **This entire session should take about 60 minutes**. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.  
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.  
* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary**. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.  
* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**  
  * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
  * If yes: Admit observers.

`Tip:`

* Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give **a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov**. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)  
* Also ask the participant to give a brief introduction of themselves.  
* Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

***Now, I‚Äôll talk a little bit about what you‚Äôll be testing***. We are working to improve the online disability benefits form, specifically the "Confirmation" page. We are looking to incorporate your feedback on our work in progress. To do so, we will be asking you to interact with a demo version of this page, and solicit your reactions and opinions as you accomplish various tasks from the page.

Just a heads up that you will be seeing some prefilled data as you interact with our demo. None of the data you see is real veteran data. Also, none of your actions during the demo will affect your VA information or benefits.

\[PAUSE\] Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

**Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**  
**\[Record answer here\]**

If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

‚û°Ô∏è Start recording.

`Tip: After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.`

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

\[Record answer here\]

## Warm-Up Questions \- 5 minutes

Before we look at the form, let‚Äôs start with a couple of background questions.

1. Have you applied for VA benefits before? According to the information I got from Perigean, you have applied for VA benefits before. Is that correct?  
   1. *\[IF NO\]* Why not?  
   2. *\[IF YES\]* Great, can you tell me more about your experience applying for VA benefits?   
      1. What types of VA benefits have you applied for before?  
      2. *\[If they applied for disability benefits\]* Could you share a bit about your experience completing the Disability Benefits form?  
         1. *\[If not mentioned\]*: Did you apply for your disability benefits online or on paper?  
      3. When you applied for VA benefits, did you keep a copy of the information you submitted in your application(s)?

Thank you for sharing your experience. 

We are now going to transition into testing a demo version of the Disability Benefits form.

## GUIDE FOR CODESPACES

### **Share prototype and screen sharing set-up \- 10 minutes**

I‚Äôm going to send you a link to the demo in the chat. When you pull it up, it is going to look like the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) website that you may be familiar with. I just want to reiterate that this is a demo website and none of the account information is from a real person. 

Once you open the link, please share your screen. Please do not click on anything at the moment\!

Prototype link: \[[Figma desktop link](https://www.figma.com/proto/zduybBnXDjVkKpJosfC6oh/526---Submission---Provide-a-Copy-Update-7.2?page-id=635%3A13286&node-id=1248-187297&viewport=1069%2C2016%2C0.04&t=pDGopIaHeSs9N4Bk-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=1248%3A187297&show-proto-sidebar=1);[ \[Figma mobile link\]](https://www.figma.com/proto/zduybBnXDjVkKpJosfC6oh/526---Submission---Provide-a-Copy-Update-7.2?page-id=635:13286&node-id=1247-183446&viewport=1069,2016,0.04&t=pDGopIaHeSs9N4Bk-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=1247:183446&show-proto-sidebar=1), Codespaces link to follow\]

Feel free to take a minute to hide anything, like your personal email or anything you don‚Äôt want us to see. Let me know if you need help. I am more than happy to walk you through the steps you can take to share your screen:

* For ‚Äúmobile‚Äú participants:  
  * Do you have an iPhone or an Android phone?  
    * iPhone:  
      * [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)  
    * Android:  
      * [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)  
  * If they are a ‚Äúmobile‚Äù participant but joined on their desktop (and if asking them to rejoin on their phone is too time-consuming):  
    * Please feel free to access the link on your computer.  
* For ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù participants:  
  * On the bottom of your Zoom screen, there should be a ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button in the middle (it should be in green). Please click on that.  
  * Please make sure ‚ÄúDesktop‚Äù is selected/highlighted.  
  * Please click ‚ÄúShare‚Äù again at the bottom.  
* For ‚Äútablet‚Äù participants:  
  * Instructions should be similar to ‚Äúmobile‚Äù  
  * If you are on an iPad or Tablet, the button is hidden in the bottom of your screen. Tap anywhere on your screen, a ‚Äútool bar‚Äù will show up at the bottom of the screen, and the share button should be within the tool bar (you may need to drag the tool bar to the left to see it). should show up until you hover over them\!

Awesome\! Now that I can see your screen, **I would like you to:** Imagine that you are a veteran named Leslie Jackson. (Just to clarify, Leslie is not a real person, we are using a demo account.) Earlier this week, you spent time filling out the Disability Benefits form, but got interrupted so you were logged out right before hitting the submit button.

Now you are interested in actually submitting your Disability Benefits form. To do so, you need to first enter your email and password, as Leslie, on this **Login page**. Go ahead and click ‚ÄúSubmit.‚Äù

Now that you are logged back in, you are brought to the **Review and Submit page**. This is where you left off before you were interrupted. This page lets you know that you've answered all the questions on the form. Each of the sections listed here are the sections within the form. Imagine that you have reviewed the information on this page and are ready to submit.

Go ahead and type your ‚ÄùFull name‚Äú as ‚ÄùLeslie Jackson‚Äú and click on ‚ÄùSubmit Application.‚Äú

**We are now on what we call the Confirmation Page.** This is the page that we‚Äôd like your feedback on. The data on this page is not real, but we‚Äôd like to ask you to pretend that this is your data as Leslie.

## Research Questions

### **First Task \- Goal 1: Gather feedback on the overall content of the page. (5 minutes)**

Okay first, we would like you to review the content on this page. As you review what is on this page, please share everything that you are thinking out loud with us so that we can understand your impressions of the page. This might look like, ‚ÄúI am seeing this box here and it is making me think X.‚Äù This might feel funny, but it is a great way for us to gather your feedback. 

I just want to reiterate: In this session we are testing this demo page, not you. We want to hear exactly what you think so please don‚Äôt worry that you are going to hurt our feelings.

Go ahead and take a moment to review the page. Feel free to scroll up and down, please do not click on anything.

\[PAUSE\] Can you share with us what you are thinking?

**\*If the participant is quiet as they are reviewing the page, encourage the think-aloud process by asking ‚ÄúCan you share what you‚Äôre thinking right now?‚Äù and then move into the probing questions below.** 

1. When you first landed on this page, what did you notice first?  
2. What is the most important piece of information on this page for you right now? Why?  
3. What else did you notice on this page?  
4. \[*If they didn‚Äôt notice the gray box*\] Do you see anything on this page that might show you a copy of your answers to the questions in the application?  
5. \[*Once they noticed the gray box*\] Let's talk about the gray box labeled \[information you submitted on this form\]. What can you tell me about this box?  
   1. Without clicking on it, what do you think happens when you click on it?   
   2. \[Once opened\] What can you tell me about the information in it?  
6. Having looked at this page, what would you do next?  
7. Do you have questions about the content of this page?  
   1. Is there anything that is confusing or unclear?  
   2. Is there anything missing?

### **Second Task \- Goal 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the formatting and visual hierarchy of submitted information within the accordion (5 minutes)**

Thank you for reviewing the page. Now I want to get your feedback on something else. 

1. Without clicking on anything yet, let's say you wanted to double check the dates you submitted for your military service. How would you find the information?  
   1. (After they complete the task): Tell me about your experience finding that specific information.  
2. Now let‚Äôs say on your form, you selected that you were exposed to Asbestos and Radiation during your service. Walk us through how you would review/find the information you submitted on this page.  
   1. What kind of information was provided for the radiation exposure that is listed in this claim?  
   2. (After they complete the task): How was your experience finding that information on this page?  
3. Let‚Äôs say that on the form, you submitted 2 conditions for the claim. Where would you go to find this information?  
   1. (After they complete the task): Tell me about your experience finding that specific information.  
4. Pretend that you (as Leslie) had skipped an optional question that asked ‚ÄúWhat was your gross income over the past 12 months?‚Äù while filling out the online form. Would you expect to see it here?

### **Third Task \- Goal 3: Evaluate whether users are able to find information on ‚ÄúWhat happens next‚Äù and how to ask for help on the page. (5 minutes)**

Ok, now we will move into our third task. 

1. Now that you've submitted your claim, where would you find the information on what happens next?  
   1. (If they find the relevant sections) Tell me about your thought process. Why did you think to look there?  
   2. (If they don't find it) Where would you expect to find that information?  
2. Where would you find how to ask for help or how to contact the VA if you have questions?  
3. If you were to change the order of anything on this page, how would you do so?

### **Fourth Task \- Goal 4: Determine if users understand how and are able to save and/or print all the content from the Confirmation Page. (5 minutes)**

Now we will move into our fourth and final task. 

1. Now that we have a sense of what is on this Confirmation Page, what would you do next as Leslie?  
2. From this screen, can you show me how you would save this information for your personal records? Talk me through what you‚Äôre doing, so I can better understand your thought process.  
   1. (Observe if they look for a 'Print' button or immediately go for the browser's print function. Also if they expand the accordion before printing. Or do something else entirely\!)  
3. \[IF THEY DIDN‚ÄôT PRINT TO SAVE\] Now can you show me how you would print a copy of this information?  
   1. Where would you click on first from this screen? Please share what you are thinking as you try to work through this task. And I‚Äôll make sure to stop you before you actually print the information from your printer\!  
   2. What do you expect to be printed once you go through all of these steps?

4. \[If the participant has applied for disability benefits before\] You told us earlier that you applied for disability compensation before ‚Äì   
   1. \[If they saved a copy\] You mentioned that you had saved a copy of your filled-out application at the time. **What was your reason behind that decision?**  
   2. \[If they didn‚Äôt save a copy\] You mentioned that you did not save a copy of your filled-out application at the time. **Was there a time later when you wished you had saved a copy?**  
5. \[If the participant has never applied for disability benefits / or don‚Äôt remember\] As Leslie, do you think it‚Äôs worth saving the information on this page? Why or why not? Tell me more about your thoughts here.

### **Post-Task Interview \- 5 Minutes**

Those were all of the tasks. Now we have a few follow up questions.

1. How would you expect to access a copy of your form submission after you leave this page?  
2. What information about your submission is most important for you to know?  
3. If you were to keep a copy of what you submitted on your form, why would you keep it?  
   1. What would you do with that copy?  
   2. What would you do with the information?  
4. If you had a magic wand and could change anything about what you've reviewed today, what would it be?  
5. Do you have any questions for me before we end the session?
