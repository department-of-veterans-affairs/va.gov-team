# **Non-Assistive Tech - Toxic Exposure Evaluative Research Study Plan** 

## Disability Benefits Team 1, November 2024

## **Background**

Disability compensation is often the first VA "service" that Veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their future experiences. 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. 

Following the PACT Act, new questions were added to the paper version of the 526ez. In October 2024, DBEX added a toxic exposure section to the VA.gov version, bringing the digital form into parity with the paper form. 

The TE design was first tested in July 2023 and updated following research and collaboration with VBA and OCTO. We are now evaluating the revised designs to see if the improvements reduce pain points identified during 2023 research: Miscomprehension and cognitive fatigue due to section length and mental recall of military service history. 

We are also testing an alert that appears on the review and submit page for Veterans who have an In Progress Form that was started before the rollout. The alert informs Veterans that new questions about toxic exposure have been added and provides a link to the TE questions for Veterans interested in completing the section.

### **OCTO Priorities**

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

* Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products has increased by 5 points.

Quarterly OCTO Goal: 100% of Veterans using the digitized disability form will use the most up-to-date version of the form including toxic exposure information, a better reflection of 5103 requirements, and the platform digital signature component. DBEX-TREX will finish rolling out the new Toxic Exposure form  and deprecate old form version and submission endpoints.

### 

### **Veteran Journey**

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

* Managing primary care and chronic health issues

* Engaging VA to access benefits and services

* Saving for my retirement

  ## 

  ## **Research Goals**

* Evaluate the usability of the toxic exposure flow.

* Determine if Veterans understand that the form has changed and that they can navigate to and add data for TE. 

* Assess how confident Veterans feel about their answers to toxic exposure questions. 

  ### 

  ### **Outcome**

  The research will drive post-MVP enhancements of the toxic exposure feature so we can continue to improve clarity and flow while reducing screen fatigue. The study will also provide insight into the efficacy of the yet-untested IPF alert; these learnings will be relevant to other teams using the component for releases in the future. 

  In relation to OCTO goals, this study will help us move toward making our digital experience the best way to access VA benefits (Priority \#1) by increasing Veteran satisfaction with the digital 526ez (Key result \#1). 


## **Research questions**

**Research Goal 1**: Evaluate the usability of the toxic exposure flow.

* Is the flow of the questions logical and clear to users? 

* Which questions or terminology are confusing to users or hard to answer? 

* Do users with a higher screen count experience greater fatigue than users with a shorter flow? 

* Do the users in the study experience any difficulties updating responses from the summary screen?


**Research Goal 2:** Determine if Veterans understand that the form has changed and that they can navigate to and add data for TE. 

* Do Veterans with an In Progress Form understand that the form has changed and that they have the opportunity to answer new questions?

* To what extent do users opt in to respond to the toxic exposure questions?”In what cases do users opt out? 

**‘Research Goal 3:** Assess how confident Veterans feel about their answers to toxic exposure questions. 

* Overall, how do Veterans feel about the experience? 

* What will users do when they are unsure of specific dates or locations? How does this uncertainty impact their confidence in the accuracy of their responses overall?

* Do Veterans understand that date fields are optional? If so, how do they feel about skipping over optional fields?

* How do users interact with the “I’m not sure” check box? Does the “comfort choice” increase confidence in their response? 

  ### 

  ## **Hypothesis**

  See [research findings from the 2023 usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-07-Toxic-Exposure/Form%20526%20Toxic%20Exposure%20Usability%20Research%20Summary%202023.pdf) and [design documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/toxic-exposure.md) for more context on these hypotheses. 

* Plain language and supplemental definitions will make the majority of questions easy for Veterans to answer.

* The flow is logically sequenced, starting with the earliest date screen and moving forward chronologically.

* Users may be confused by the location of the toxic exposure questions and the connection between exposures and conditions.

* Users may express uncertainty around what counts as toxic exposure, resulting in a lack of confidence in their answers.

* The “I’m not sure” check box will offer relief to users who are unsure but don’t want to select “none.”

* Veterans will understand that date fields are optional. 

* Users will be able to navigate back and correct errors from the summary screen.

  ## 

  ## **Methodology**

  We plan on conducting 60-minute moderated usability sessions with non-AT users. A separate study running in parallel will evaluate the flow with AT users.

### 

  ### **Location**

      Remote on Zoom

### 

### **Research materials**

For moderated usability tests:

* Link to prototype- We will be testing in staging; Toxic exposure is already in production. 

  ## **Recruitment**

  ### **Recruitment approach**

  We will work alongside Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research. We request that Perigean:

* Shares a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey for this study, so we can review it before it goes out to participants

* Call participants one day in advance to remind them about the session and confirm they plan on using the AT they indicated during the session. 

  ###

  Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

  ### **Prepare**

  When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it’s ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

  A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

* Date and time of pilot session: TBD

  ### **Research sessions**

* 12/2-5

  ### **Length of sessions**

* Session length: 60 minutes

* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)

* Maximum Sessions per day: 2 per day
