## **Introduction \- 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today\!  My name is \[FACILITATOR\] and \[NOTETAKER\] is taking notes. I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. 

* **Today, we will be looking at the disability compensation form on VA.gov.** This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to respect your time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic so we finish promptly. 

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

* **​​In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.  
    
* **Whenever you can, talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.

* **We may look at things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation.** However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the website in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.

* **That was a lot of information.** Are you comfortable proceeding with the agenda I’ve proposed for today’s session? 

* **Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in.** Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?  
* *If no***:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

* *If yes:* Admit observers.

* Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name. Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

* **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

  * *If yes:* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

* I have started recording. I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions \- 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

* Have you filed for disability compensation in the past, yes or no? If so, how did you file the claim? (online, on paper, with VSO, etc)  
  * Have you been granted compensation for any of the conditions you filed for?  
* Are you considering filing any new claims in the future? \[Use this to prompt the TE opt-in screen if needed\]  
* What do you know about the Pact Act, if anything?  
  * Do you think you are eligible? Why or why not?  
* The questions we are looking at today are related to your military service history. If you’re comfortable sharing, it would be helpful to know when you served, and in which branch. 

## **Technology screenshare set-up \- 5 minutes**

Thanks for sharing your experience with me. We’re going to shift gears and move into looking at a mock version of the VA.gov website. It looks identical to VA.gov, but none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. 

**Link:** [https://staging.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction)

Now, I am going to send you a username and a password. We’ll have you sign-in with a fake ID.me account. The email is \[pick one\]:

1. [vets.gov](http://vets.gov/).user+54@gmail.com  
   2. [vets.gov](http://vets.gov/).user+56@gmail.com  
      3. [vets.gov](http://vets.gov/).user+229@gmail.com  
   * Great. Now, your password is: Veteran1

Next, I’d like you to share your screen for the remainder of the session. If you need help figuring out how to share your screen I am happy to troubleshoot\! 

\[Troubleshooting guide for mobile: [https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-mobile-sessions) 

General troubleshooting: [https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr) \]

**Before reaching review/submit:**  
That was a lot to get through, thanks for your patience. Now we are ready to begin our first task. 

For today’s session, imagine you are filing for disability benefits on VA.gov with the goal of getting compensation for new conditions. You have already filled out a majority of the form. This includes your personal information, the conditions you’re filing for, supporting evidence, etc. This screen we are on now is at **the very end of the form** where you can review information and submit your claim.

We filled out the form with fake data– none of the information listed is yours and will not impact your benefits in any way. 

---

## **First Task: \[Review and Submit alert\] \- 10 minutes**

**Take a moment to review this page. When you’re ready, talk me through what you would expect to do before pressing submit.** *Please do not press the submit button or leave the page at this time– but tell me verbally if there is an action you would like to take.* 

* Is there any action left for you to take on this screen? *\[Mark task as a success if the user asks to review toxic exposure questions here\]*  
* In your own words, what is the content in the blue box trying to communicate?   
  * What does the phrase “toxic exposure” mean to you?  
* Is any of the content in this box confusing or missing information?

*Look out for: Misunderstanding or missing the alert content, understanding of eligibility, rationale for opting in or out*  
---

## **Second Task: \[Navigate from alert to TE questions\] \- 5 minutes**

Navigate the new questions that were added to the form.

**Post-Task Questions**

* Can you explain what happened when you clicked the link?  
  * Where on VA.gov did the link take you?  
* How would you expect to get back to the last screen to submit your form, if you decided against answering the questions?

*Look out for: Issues finding the link, confusion around location in the form*  
---

## **Third Task: \[Complete Toxic Exposure Flow\] \- 20-25 minutes**

Thanks for all of your feedback\! On this screen, which is in step 2 of the disability compensation form, you will notice that we have added 5 fake conditions to this screen. They are not yours and will not impact your benefits. For the rest of the session, you can use your personal military service history to answer the questions. Are you comfortable doing this? 

\[If scenario is preferred\] Imagine that you were exposed to burn pits and/or Agent Orange during your many years of service overseas. 

Complete the form as if your asthma and bronchitis came from toxic exposure during your service.

Please talk out loud as you go; I may pause you to ask questions at various points. 

**\[Checkbox conditions screen\]**   
\[After participant checks boxes\]

* What do you think was the purpose of this screen?  
* \[If viewed TE hint text or new tab\] How useful did you find the additional information about toxic exposure?

We can use these strategies to prepare for difficult situations. Credit to Tyler Gindraux\! 

### **If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

### **If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.  
If they choose to continue...  
Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### **If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?  
If they choose to take a break and come back...  
Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### **If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.  
If they seem distressed...  
Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### 

### **If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't**

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...  
Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
