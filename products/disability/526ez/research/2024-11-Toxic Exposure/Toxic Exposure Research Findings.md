# Research Goals

**Our research had 3 primary goals**:

1. To evaluate the usability of the toxic exposure flow within Step 2 of  the digital 526EZ form.  
2. To determine if Veterans understood that the form had changed, and that they could navigate to and add data for Toxic Exposure.  
3. To assess Veterans confidence levels when answering the added toxic exposure questions.

Initially, we considered conducting a single study with one test plan that included both **veterans who do not use Assistive Technology (Non-AT)** and **those who do (AT)**. However, we quickly determined that the most effective approach would be to create two separate test plans, allowing us to tailor the goals specifically for our AT cohort. The plans are still fairly similar, but there are some nuances.

For example, “*Are location checkbox pages (especially those with many locations) overwhelming for screen readers?*” is an important consideration for Veterans using assistive technology.

# Research Overview

## Problem Statement

Veterans exposed to toxic chemicals during their military service face significant challenges filing disability claims for presumptive conditions online, delaying access to the compensation benefits essential for managing their health needs.

## Solution

Incorporate questions related to toxic exposures into the 21-526EZ paper and online form, enabling Veterans to claim toxic exposures while filing for disability compensation.

## Desired Outcomes

**Key result 1: The online form has parity with the updated paper form**  
100% of Veterans using the digitized disability form will use the most up-to-date version of the form, including toxic exposure information. 

**Key result 2: Veterans with in-progress forms are alerted to Toxic Exposure updates**  
Veterans with in-progress forms understand the toxic exposure questions have been updated and return to that section to provide additional information around toxic exposures.

**Key result 3: Reduce the risk of the Toxic Exposure releases**  
Gather feedback and identify issues with the Toxic Exposure release through quantitative data monitoring activities, followed up by qualitative feedback from Veterans. 

**Key result 4: Validate the Veteran experience is inclusive**  
Test the usability of the toxic exposure questionnaire through moderated tests with Veterans using assistive technologies.

# Research Questions

| Goals | Non-AT Veterans who do not use assistive technology | AT Veterans who use assistive technology |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Goal 1 | **To evaluate the usability of the toxic exposure flow.**  <br><br> Is the flow of the questions logical and clear to users?  Which questions or terminology are confusing to users or hard to answer?  Do users with a higher screen count experience greater fatigue than users with a shorter flow?  Do the users in the study experience any difficulties updating responses from the summary screen?  | **To assess the usability of the toxic exposure flow, identifying barriers for Veterans who use assistive technology.**  <br><br> Do AT users perceive errors and can they fix them? Are location checkbox pages (especially those with a lot of locations) overwhelming to screen readers? Do Veterans who use assistive technology understand that date fields are optional? On summary pages, can users edit their service dates successfully? Which questions or terminology are confusing to users or hard to answer? Are any headers, labels, or links lacking description or clarity? |
| Goal 2 | **To determine if Veterans understand that the form has changed and that they can navigate to and add data for TE.**  <br><br> Do Veterans with an In Progress Form understand that the form has changed and that they have the opportunity to answer new questions? To what extent do users opt in to respond to the toxic exposure questions? In what cases do users opt out? | **To determine if Veterans who use assistive technology understand that the form has changed and that they can navigate to and add data for TE.**  <br><br> Are Veterans using assistive technology able to understand from the alert that the form has changed? Can users navigate to the toxic exposure questions from the review and submit screen? If they click on the link to answer new questions, do they understand they are going back so many pages? Do users experience problems closing the alert? If they close the blue box do they lose focus? To what extent do users opt in to respond to the toxic exposure questions? In what cases do users opt out? |
| Goal 3 | **To assess how confident Veterans feel about their answers to toxic exposure questions.**  <br><br> Overall, how do Veterans feel about the experience? What will users do when they are unsure of specific dates or locations? How does this uncertainty impact their confidence in the accuracy of their responses overall? Do Veterans understand that date fields are optional? If so, how do they feel about skipping over optional fields? How do users interact with the “I’m not sure” check box? Does the “comfort choice” increase confidence in their response? | **To assess Veterans who use assistive technology confidence about their answers to toxic exposure questions.**  <br><br> Do AT users feel confident about the accuracy of their answers? How would they go back and check them, if they weren’t sure? Do Veterans know if they are eligible to complete TE questions? How do they know? What will users do when they are unsure of specific dates or locations? How does this uncertainty impact their confidence in the accuracy of their responses overall? Do Veterans feel comfortable skipping over optional fields? How do users interact with the “I’m not sure” check box? Does the “comfort choice” increase confidence in their response? |

# Methodology

We conducted 1-1.5 hour long remote moderated evaluative mixed methods testing sessions via Zoom on December 2–17, 2024\. We tested the new Toxic Exposure flow in a staging environment with 11 participants, segmented into two cohorts:

* **Non-AT Cohort:** Veterans who do not rely on assistive technology (AT) to navigate online.  
* **AT Cohort:** Veterans who routinely use assistive technology to access digital platforms.

## Pre-Test Setup

* The 526EZ form was prefilled with mock data to simulate an in-progress claim.  
* An In Progress Form (IPF) alert was configured to display at the top of the Review and Submit page, guiding users to the new toxic exposure questions in Section 2\.

## Task Flow

1. Participants were asked to log into Staging \- VA.gov and access the 526EZ form.  
2. Starting on the Review and Submit page, participants were instructed to navigate to the toxic exposure questions in Section 2 of the form.  
3. Once located, participants were tasked with completing the toxic exposure section.

By simulating a real-world interaction with the updated flow, we aimed to evaluate the usability, comprehension and accessibility of the new toxic exposure design for both AT and Non-AT users.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

See [research findings from the 2023 usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-07-Toxic-Exposure/Form%20526%20Toxic%20Exposure%20Usability%20Research%20Summary%202023.pdf) and [design documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/toxic-exposure.md) for more context on these hypotheses. After analyzing the research, we realized that many of our original hypotheses were proven false or potentially false. Additional AT Hypotheses and Conclusions

|  | Hypothesis | Conclusion |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Plain language and supplemental definitions will make the majority of questions easy for Veterans to answer. | **FALSE** \- Additional supplemental definitions are needed for clarity. Also, consider moving the ‘hidden’ toxic exposure information from the additional information design system component so that  screen readers will read the information. Only 2 of 9 users clicked on the Toxic Exposure additional information link. |
| 2 | The flow is logically sequenced, starting with the earliest date screen and moving forward chronologically. | **MAYBE FALSE** \- 2 users were confused about the placement of the Agent Orange screens, after the Gulf War and 9/11 screens. |
| 3 | Users may be confused by the location of the toxic exposure questions and the connection between exposures and conditions. | **MAYBE TRUE** \- One user stated \- “‘Are any of your new conditions related to toxic exposure during your military service?’ I don't know how I'd be able to answer that \[question\] unless I had expertise telling me so. If I had a cough, and went to a doctor \- how would I relate that to my military exposure?” \-P11AT |
| 4 | Users may express uncertainty around what counts as toxic exposure, resulting in a lack of confidence in their answers. | **FALSE** \- Most participants in the study seemed to understand what toxic exposure was. |
| 5 | The “I’m not sure” check box will offer relief to users who are unsure but don’t want to select “none.” | **FALSE** \- The majority of participants selected “I’m not sure”, but offering the selection as a comfort choice didn’t seem to ease the user’s fear of entering incorrect dates. |
| 6 | Users will understand that date fields are optional. | **FALSE** \- 11 out of 11 users did not understand that the date fields were optional. |
| 7 | Users are able to edit date ranges and feel confident in their answers. | **TRUE** \- Users were very confident in their answers, even if they were not able to correctly edit the date ranges. |
| 8 | Users will be able to navigate back and correct errors from the summary screen. | **TRUE** \- 5 of 9 users stated that the Summary screens were helpful, however several participants were initially lost in trying to do so. |

## Additional AT Hypotheses and Conclusions

|  | Hypothesis | Conclusion |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 1 | Veterans who use assistive technology will be able to perceive and correct for errors. | **MAYBE TRUE** \- 2 of 4 AT users (who got to that point in the usability study) were successful in editing previously entered data, so it can be concluded that if given time others would be successful as well. |
| 2 | Location pages with lots of checkboxes will be verbose for screen reader users, who might find it overwhelming. | **MAYBE TRUE** \-  Specific pages, like the Gulf War page (lists 19 checkbox  items), were verbose and caused 2 out of 4  AT users to be overwhelmed as the screen reader read through each item. |
| 3 | Only some AT users will understand that date fields are optional. | **FALSE** \- 4 out of 4 AT users did not understand that the date fields were optional. |

# Key Findings

1. A majority of Veterans did not appear to notice the blue informational In Progress Form (IPF) Alert and the Toxic Exposure (TE) questions were hard to find.  
2. Premature error validation and an unclear date format expectation made date ranges difficult for screen readers to complete.  
3. Users frequently got lost or confused while navigating back through the list and loops to edit responses (Task 4).  
4. The requirement to authenticate to preview the form and to enter dates into required fields to progress through the pages created a less inclusive user experience.  
5. When participants navigated to the new questions from the IPF alert, they expected they would be able to easily return to the Review and Submit page.  
6. Veterans struggled to orient themselves within the form and did not understand how long the TE flow would be.  
7. Location pages- especially the Gulf War page \- was burdensome for AT users to review and complete.  
8. Veterans felt concerned about providing VA with inexact dates- but did not see “I’m not sure” as a viable alternative to concrete date ranges.  
9. Veterans were unclear about what specific date ranges VA was requesting on detail screens.  
10. Veterans pointed out terminology they were unfamiliar with and would like to see better defined.

# Details of Findings

|  | Finding | Priority | Severity | Frequency | Impact to User |
| ----- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1** | A majority of Veterans did not appear to notice the In Progress Form (IPF) alert at the top of the Review and Submit page. | High | Critical | 6  of 9 did not notice the IPF alert. | If veterans don’t notice the IPF Alert and click the TE link, they risk forfeiting benefits that they may be entitled to. |
| **2** | Premature error validation and an unclear date format expectation made date ranges difficult for screen readers to complete. (AT users) | High | Critical | 2 of 4 AT users stated that errors on date range pages were disruptive. | AT Users might struggle with the ability to enter dates, adding to frustration of completing the form. |
| **3** | Veterans frequently got lost or confused while navigating back through the list and loops to edit their responses (Task 4). | High | High | 4 of 9 users got lost trying to go back to the date screens to edit previously entered dates. | There is a risk of users entering dates incorrectly, adding to frustration of completing the form. EG: a Veteran could mistakenly edit dates on a Gulf War page instead of post 9/11 without realizing the error. |
| **4** | The requirement to authenticate to preview the form and to enter dates into required fields to progress through the pages creates a less inclusive user experience. | High | Medium | 3 of 4 AT users had issues with logging in to complete the study tasks. | AT Users need to be able to navigate freely between form pages to understand the structure before interacting with the content; restrictive error-handling protocols prevented users from doing this. |
| **5** | When participants navigated to the new questions from the In Progress Form (IPF) alert, they expected they would be able to easily return to the Review and Submit page. | Medium | High | 8 of 9  Users expected to be able to navigate back to the review and submit page quickly (in one click | Users may feel lost and frustrated at the inability to get back to where they were. |
| **6** | Veterans struggled to orient themselves within the form and did not understand how long the TE flow would be. | Medium | High | 2 of 9 Users understood where they landed in the form | Users may feel lost and frustrated at the inability to get back to where they were. |
| **7** | Location pages – especially the Gulf War page – were burdensome for AT users to review and complete. | Medium | Medium | 3 of 4 AT users mentioned length of flow as a pain point. | Users may feel overwhelmed at the amount of choices on the Gulf War page. AT users were most likely to experience this issue. |
| **8** | Veterans felt concerned about providing VA with inexact dates-- but did not see "I'm not sure" as a viable alternative to entering concrete date ranges. | Medium | Medium | 7 of 9 users selected the “I’m not sure” checkbox. | Veterans were concerned about inaccurately representing their service history. |
| **9** | Participants were unclear about what specific date ranges VA was requesting on detail screens. | Medium | Medium | 2 of 9 users were confused between ‘service start and end dates’ and service dates for their tour of duty/toxic exposure  date ranges. | Veterans were concerned about inaccurately representing their service history. |
| **10** | Veterans pointed out terminology they were unfamiliar with and would like to see better defined. | Medium | Low | 2 of 9 users were unclear about the terms MOS and SHAD and wanted to see additional definitions of both terms. | Users were unclear of the terminology used. |

## Finding 1: Alert and TE questions hard to find on IPFs

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE:  PACT ACT, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, Accessibility DSC: Alert boxes, SFTW: Screenreader, SPG: Blind/Visually Impaired, SPG: Toxic Exposure

**Priority**: **High**

**Brief description:**  
A majority of Veterans did not appear to notice the In Progress Form (IPF) alert at the top of the Review and Submit page.

* **6 out of 9** participants did not mention the alert at the top of the Review and Submit page and **would have submitted the application without clicking the TE link.** One clicked on it before viewing the rest of the page.  
* **Content hierarchy:** Sighted users see the blue box alert, but **screen readers don't announce it as an important message on page load**, making it harder for blind or low vision users to notice. Users expect these messages to be instantly accessible after an action or page update.  
* **User comprehension:** When prompted to review the In Progress Form alert, participants accurately comprehended the content.  
* **6 out of 9 participants** understood that the alert was informing them of **new questions** added to the form.

**Quotes**  
*"That the VA updated the online form. There are new questions about TE. Possibly when this form was started the questions weren't available. I would look at that, but I don't think I'm eligible for that."* \-P2

*“\[The information\] Tells me that there are more things to be answered... \[Toxic exposure means\] chemicals and things I have come across as my duties in the military."* \-P5 AT

## Finding 2: Dates \- A11y issues and poor error handling

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE: PACT Act, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, Accessibility, DSC: Form \- Date input, DSP: Ask users for dates, SFTW: Screenreader

**Priority**: **High**

**Brief description:**  
Premature error validation and an unclear date format expectation made date ranges difficult for screen readers to complete.

* Error handling: As soon as a user begins to enter data, the date range component announces an error message, confusing 2 out of 5 AT users.  
  * In addition to being disruptive, this error message contributed to participants believing the fields were required, not optional.  
* Unclear date format for screen readers: 2 participants were unclear on the format of the date, expecting the year to be "YY" instead of "YYYY."  
* Both CAIA pilots noted issues with the date error handling:  
  * Error handling for dates and locations was confusing. Announcements of errors are disruptive.  
  * Blind users relying on their screen reader to provide all the information needed to perform a task, the format expectation for the date (“Month and Year”) might not be clear enough.

## Finding 3: Flow strained recall and lacked context

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE: PACT Act, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Comprehension testing, RESRCH: Usability Testing  
**Priority**: **High**

**Brief description:**  
Veterans users frequently got lost or confused while navigating through the list and loops to edit their responses from the summary screens (Task 4).

* For Task 4, participants were asked to make a series of changes to their responses from the section summary screens.  
* Missing mental model: While 5 out of 7 users successfully made edits from the summary screen, a majority did not understand how to navigate through the list and loops and find the page they needed with ease. As a result, Veterans could mistakenly alter data without realizing their error while distractedly looking for a different screen.  
* Using the “Edit exposures and dates” link: Participants who clicked the link on the summary page did not have a mental model were sent back to a location/exposure page but did not know how to find the date pages.  
* Using the back button: Participants who used the back button in the form, instead, had to click through date range pages in order to find the location/exposure page. Sometimes they pressed back too many times and could not easily locate the screen they were looking for.  
  * "When I am on the prior page, I don’t know what’s on the next page, if I click continue I would have seen it and the dates are there… maybe it’s just me, I don’t move forward until I know the prior one is correct." \-P4  
* We suspect headings did not offer enough guidance to orient participants to the flow.

## Finding 4: AT-users face too many barriers

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE: PACT Act, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Comprehension testing, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, Accessibility, DSC: Form \- Date input, DSP: Help users to sign in, SFTW: Screenreader

**Priority**: **High**

**Brief description:**  
The requirement to authenticate to preview the form and to enter dates into required fields to progress through the pages creates a less inclusive user experience.

**Challenges with Assistive Technology**

* Participants using assistive technology faced significant barriers when attempting to view and navigate the 526EZ form.  
* Experienced screen reader users could authenticate and move past the login screen with relative ease.  
* Less experienced screen reader users struggled, with some taking over 20 minutes to log into VA.gov.

**Difficulties Within the 526EZ Form**

* Assistive technology users found it challenging to orient themselves within the form.  
* They wanted the ability to navigate freely between form pages—both backward and forward—to understand the structure before engaging with content.  
* Restrictive error-handling protocols blocked navigation to subsequent pages if required fields on the current page were incomplete, exacerbating usability issues.

**Priority**: **Medium**

**Brief description:**  
Participants expected to be able to easily return to the Review and Submit page after navigating to the TE flow from the IPF alert.

When participants navigated to the new questions from the In Progress Form (IPF) alert, they expected they would be able to use the back button within the application to return to the Review and Submit page.

* 2 screen reader users failed Task 2, needing assistance to click the link to navigate to the TE questions.  
* 6 out of 9 participants assumed that pressing the back button on the TE conditions page would function like a browser back button, sending them back to the Review and Submit page rather than within the 526ez form flow.  
* 2 Non-AT participants expected that checking the box "I am not claiming any conditions related to toxic exposure" would direct them back to the Review and Submit page.  
* CAIA Note: The navigation path to return to the summary before submission is unclear. Users find it cumbersome to navigate through an extraneous number of pages just to return to the page.

## Finding 6: Flow navigation is unclear

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE:  PACT ACT, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, Accessibility, DSC: Progress bars, SPG: Toxic Exposure

**Priority**: **Medium**

**Brief description:**  
Veterans struggled to orient themselves within the form and did not understand how long the TE flow would be.

Veterans struggled to orient themselves in the flow or set expectations for the filing experience.

* All 4 Veterans using AT were surprised when the progress indicator ("2 of 5") did not change as they navigated through the TE flow.  
* 1 Non-AT participant explicitly noted with surprise that they were still on "2 of 5" as they navigated through the form.  
  * Selects Saudi Arabia. "It still says 2 of 5 conditions, even though it's a different page. It might be only 5 pages \- should have changed to 3\. I don't know how long this would be, I'm on section 2, so now I know its sections and not pages like a paper form." \-P4 AT  
* One AT user in particular wanted to be able to ‘preview the whole form’ prior to entering personal data to help him build a mental model of what the form was asking.  
  * “It's very hard to understand the government forms at times. It's great if I can read the whole thing first, or if I know what I'm coming into. The continue buttons \- you can't go from one field to the next until you complete the prior task. Everything worked well. It just takes being familiar with it.” \- P11AT  
* CAIA Note: Progress Bar \- Staying in "Step 2 of 5" for multiple screens can be confusing to users.  
* CAIA Note: The back button is located near the bottom. Users will be required to navigate through all fields to return to the previous screen. Not all users are proficient enough to use native gestures to return to the previous screen.

**Priority**: **Medium**

**Brief description:**  
Location pages – especially the Gulf War page – were burdensome for AT users to review and complete.

* AT user (P5) selected 7 locations on the Gulf War page. As she continued to move through the form, she regretted selecting so many locations, stating it would take her months to collect the relevant dates.  
* Although we only have P5 as a data point, we assume the filing experience becomes increasingly difficult with more locations/exposures. We do not have the data for average number of locations or exposures a Veteran might expect to file for in the TE flow. In the usability testing, a majority of Veterans checked under 5 boxes throughout the flow.  
* 3 out of 4 AT users (2 screen readers and 1 alternative navigation) shared that the Gulf War page in particular was laborious. 2 of these participants didn't expect to complete the page given their own military service.  
* Participants were confused about why they were asked questions about wars they hadn't served in.

**Quotes**  
When P5 (using TalkBack) first started reviewing the Gulf War post-1990 page, she remarked, *“Oh my goodness... a lot words."*

On Location 1 of 7 screen: *"Oh my gosh"- "that means I selected 7 locations and.. by golly I can't remember those. I could probably pull it up in my service records \[but it would take months\]."*

## Finding 8: Concern that approximate dates may impact claim

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE:  PACT ACT, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, DSC: Form \- Date input, DSP: Ask users for dates, SPG: Toxic Exposure

**Priority**: **Medium**

**Brief description:**  
Veterans felt concerned about providing VA with inexact dates-- but did not see "I'm not sure" as a viable alternative to entering concrete date ranges.

* Date recall: 6 out of 9 participants struggled with recalling exact dates and locations.  
* Month and Year: Multiple Veterans could confidently share a month and year. However, due to the error validation, Veterans could not provide "approximate" dates, as the form language suggests. And the "approximate" date example is exact.  
* User comprehension of “I’m not sure” varied: Some saw it as  grounds for disqualification or road to a slower adjudication. At least 2 users who used "I'm not sure" during a task shared that they would find a way to provide dates before submitting, relying on military papers or a Google search for when memorable events happened.

**Quotes**  
*"It says you can approximate \- if I put just a year, will it accept it? The example is MM DD YYYY. So I would assume that you have to have something in there. I could guess if I'm not close it looks bad on me, so I'd have to go look up the information or you get denied. You get denied very easily. If you get it wrong... that's why I ended up getting someone to help me. They can pull up my information from a computer."* \-P5 AT

*"I don't recall the exact dates... I'd have to check. I'm not sure of the dates I was exposed to this hazard. I'd google when \[event\] happened and find a date 60 days after that and use those dates. I would get the date and add 60 days. I'd go online and look it up."* \-P1

P4 AT, a new screen reader user, noted that JAWS does not read "I'm not sure of dates" until after they've completed the date component. Consider moving the "I'm not sure" to the top of the page.

## Finding 9: Service Dates vs. Deployment Dates confusion

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE: PACT Act, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, DSC: Form \- Date input, DSP: Ask users for dates, DSP: Ask users for service history

**Priority**: **Medium**

**Brief description:**  
Participants were unclear about what specific date ranges VA was requesting on detail screens.

* 3 users were confused by the "service start date" label above the date component on detail pages. They did not know if VA wanted the dates they were in the location, or their tour dates overall.

**Quotes**  
*“Is it asking when I first entered the service or the dates I was overseas? When it says service start date \- when I first joined and when I got out. I'm just gonna put the dates I was in \[location\].”*\-P5

## Finding 10: Lack of definition for key exposure terms

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE:  PACT ACT, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Toxic Exposure

**Priority**: **Medium**

**Brief description:**  
Veterans pointed out terminology they were unfamiliar with and would like to see better defined.

On the "Other Exposures" screen, participants wanted examples or definitions of the following exposures:

* Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD)  
* Military Occupational Specialty (MOS)- related toxin

On the Agent Orange screen, 2 participants wondered if they should count contact with a C-123 if they weren't in the Air Force.

**Quotes**  
*“I'm thinking about the item about C-123 airplanes. I wasn't in the Air Force, but I was in the Marine Corp. If it didn't say Air Force, I would have checked that box.”* \- P4

*“MOS-Related Toxin \- I'm not sure what those would be. A link to examples of what MOS-Related Toxins are might be helpful.”* \-P2

*“SHAD doesn't mean anything to me.”* \- P4

## Finding 11: Optional fields mistaken for required

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE: PACT Act, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, DSC: Form \- Date input

**Priority**: **Low**

**Brief description:**  
Participants did not know that fields were optional-- but likely would have felt pressure to fill them out either way.

* Pressure to provide information: Veterans did not know certain fields were optional in the TE flow and shared that failing to provide dates would be unacceptable and could impact the success of their claim.  
* Confusing error handling: Error handling on the date component led AT users to believe the fields were required.  
* P5 (AT) assumed that the form wouldn't let her move on without answering anything to the first.  
* CAIA Note: “\* Required” should be announced and tied to the group to inform the user that information is required.  
* CAIA Note: Are timeframes necessary to complete the form? There’s no error when timeframe fields are left empty. The form only errors only when the date is left incomplete.

**Quotes**  
*"Most forms won't let you go to the next one without answering everything on the form..."* \-P5

**Priority**: **Low**

**Brief description:**  
Additional information sprinkled throughout the TE flow was rarely read by Veterans.

* 2 out of 7 Veterans viewed "What is toxic exposure?"  
* One AT participant, when prompted, looked at the TE information in a new window and struggled to return to the form from the new tab.  
* Only 1 Veteran viewed "What if I have more than one date range?" although multiple Veterans wondered how to account for multiple date ranges.

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE: PACT Act, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Agent Orange

**Priority**: **Low**

**Brief description:**  
Some participants who served in Vietnam expected to see the Agent Orange appear earlier in the flow.

* 2 participants expected the Vietnam era to come first (AO screen)- not totally chronological.  
* P1 expected to see Agent Orange listed as a toxic exposure on the Conditions page, while P4 expected the Agent Orange Exposure screen to come before post-1990.

**Quotes**  
*"Agent Orange isn't listed here. That's new in the last couple of years. I would expect to see that listed here. It's definitely a toxic exposure."* \-P1

## Finding 14: Low support to determine eligibility

**Labels**: AUD: Veterans, Alert Boxes, INTIVE: PACT Act, INTIVE: Toxic exposure, PRDT: Form 526 EZ, RESRCH: Remote, RESRCH: Usability Testing, SPG: Agent Orange, SPG: Burn Pit, SPG: Toxic Exposure

**Priority**: **Low**

**Brief description:**  
Most Veterans were familiar with the PACT Act; however, some were uncertain about their eligibility requirements. Others were unsure how to link toxic exposure conditions to their service history without medical guidance. Additionally, some Veterans did not know where to navigate on VA.gov to file a claim.

9 out of the 11 participants asked stated that they knew what the Pact Act was. When asked to describe the legislation….

* 5 participants specifically mentioned burn pits and the Middle East  
* 3 participants specifically mentioned Agent Orange

Of those who had heard of the Pact Act, 2 didn’t think they’d be eligible; 2 didn’t answer; 5 thought that they had experienced toxic exposure that would qualify them.

* P2 recommended that the IPF alert state whether or not the toxic exposure questions were required before submitting. They did not expect to qualify.

# Recommendations

## High/Medium Priority Items

1. Veterans did not appear to notice the IPF Alert and the TE questions were hard to find.  
  * Possibly switch the alert component from the blue informational alert to the yellow warning alert.  
  * For screen readers, announce that the form update is an alert/ important information.
  * Consider making it required for Veterans to acknowledge the alert.  
2. Premature error validation and an unclear date format expectation made date ranges difficult for screen readers to complete.  
  * Consider allowing users to enter date information before displaying the error (move field validation to the end of page).  
  * Set clear format expectations for the date, including \# of digits for year.  
3. Users frequently got lost or confused while navigating back through the list and loops to edit responses (Task 4).  
  * Update custom ‘checkbox and loop’ components to v3 components.  
  * Make headings more prominent for Veterans.
  * Move focus for AT to the H3.  
4. The requirement to authenticate to preview the form and to enter dates into required fields to progress through the pages created a less inclusive user experience.  
  * Explore opportunities to allow veterans to preview the form without authenticating (ex: delaying the need to authenticate until a veteran tries to submit a claim at the end of the flow.)  
  * Implement less restrictive error handling, so that veterans can navigate through the form without entering data into required fields.  
5. When participants navigated to the new questions from the IPF alert, they expected they would be able to easily return to the Review and Submit page.  
  * For Veterans with an IPF, add an off ramp from the toxic exposure flow back to the Review and Submit page.  
  * Clarify where the link is taking Veterans in the descriptive link text “Answer our new questions.”  
6. Veterans struggled to orient themselves within the form and did not understand how long the TE flow would be.  
  * Update and test the copy in the H3 and H4 page headings.  
  * Change the focus for screen readers from the progress stepper “ex: 2 of 5 Conditions” to the H3 heading “ex: location/condition.”  
  * Add an intro page that sets Veteran expectations for the TE flow.  
7. Location pages- especially the Gulf War page \- was burdensome for AT users to review and complete.  
  * Limit the number of controls to max 7 per page.  
  * Break long lists across multiple pages.  
  * Collaborate with VBA to discuss how many locations are required to adjudicate claims.  
8. Veterans felt concerned about providing VA with inexact dates- but did not see “I’m not sure” as a viable alternative to concrete date ranges.  
  * Switch MM/DD/YYYY date component to MM/YYYY component.  
  * As an immediate improvement, consider changing the example date to remove the specific day. From "For example: January 19, 2000" to "For example: January 2000".  
  * Consider moving the “I’m not sure checkbox” above the date entry fields to assist AT users, and to provide a level of comfort to all users that approximate dates are acceptable.  
9. Veterans were unclear about what specific date ranges VA was requesting on detail screens.  
  * Clarify “service start date” so Veterans understand what date range is expected.  
  * Add hint text to clarify what dates are needed.  
10. Veterans pointed out terminology they were unfamiliar with and would like to see better defined.
  * Add hint text or links to definitions to clarify lesser known terms.

## Low Priority Items

11. Participants did not know that fields were optional-- but likely would have felt pressure to fill them out either way.  
   * Propose visual optimizations and A11y improvements to clarify which fields are required.   
   * Audit existing optional fields and determine if they are necessary for adjudication.   
12. Additional information sprinkled through the TE flow was rarely read by Veterans.   
   * Expose additional info on the page to make it more visible.   
   * Consider A11y improvements to increase engagement with AT-users.   
13. Some participants who served in Vietnam expected to see Agent Orange appear earlier in the flow.   
   * In the future, consider personalizing the flow to match the Veteran’s service history.   
14. A majority of Veterans were already familiar with the Pact Act, but some were unsure if they met eligibility requirements. Some were unsure on how to connect  toxic exposure conditions with their service history without medical advice. Some were unsure where to go to on VA.gov to file.   
   * Provide in-app support to help Veterans determine eligibility.   
   * Add links to toxic exposure eligibility to Disability dropdown menu, Disability Hub, the eligibility page, and embedded in the toxic exposure flow in the 526ez.   
   * Update VA PACT Act marketing and web pages to drive veterans to file on 526ez.

# Further Research Needed

Our participant demographics lacked racial and gender diversity. In future tests, we aim to recruit a more diverse group of participants.

## Task Methodology and Completion

We asked all participants to complete 4 tasks:

### Non-AT Cohort

**In Task 1** we asked the participants to review the In Progress Form informational alert (blue box). On the Review and Submit page, we asked participants, "Talk me through what you would expect to do before pressing submit" and then asked "Is there any action left for you to take on this screen?".

* Only 1 Veteran perceived the IPF alert and independently clicked on the link to answer the Toxic Exposure questions.  
* The other 4 did not click on the TE Link, despite comprehending the IPF content.

**Task 2** was to navigate to the Toxic Exposure questions.

* All 5 Veterans were able to click on the TE link to get to the questions  
* However, none of the participants understood where they landed in the form.  
* All 5 participants expected to be able to navigate back to the Review and Submit page in one click.

**Task 3** was to see if the Veteran could fill out the Toxic Exposure form to complete all the screens in the flow.

* Only 1 of 5 clicked on the TE Additional Information link.  
* All 5 Veterans used the “I’m not sure” checkbox in regards to entering Service Start/End Dates.  
* None of the 5 users understood that entering date ranges was optional.  
* 4 of 5 Veterans expressed difficulty with date recall/accuracy.  
* 3 of 5 participants stated that the Summary screen was helpful.

**Task 4** was to be able to go back and edit information previously entered.

* 4 of 5 Veterans were able to change a previously entered date.  
* 4 of 5 Veterans were able to add a new location.  
* 4 of 4 Veterans were able to add an unknown date range.

### AT Cohort

In the Assistive Technology cohort, 2 of our Veterans experienced significant Staging and Login issues. Of the 4 Veterans who were able to complete tasks, we observed the following:

**In Task 1** we asked the participants to review the IPF alert (blue box). Stating… "Talk me through what you would expect to do before pressing submit" and then "Is there any action left for you to take on this screen?".

* 2 of 4 Veterans perceived the IPF alert and independently clicked on the link to answer the Toxic Exposure questions.  
* Only 2 participants comprehended the IPF content.  
* Note: P4AT, P11AT, and P5AT used Screen Readers, which read the IPF alert aloud.

**Task 2** was to navigate to the Toxic Exposure questions.

* All 4 Veterans were able to click on the TE link to get to the questions, but only 2 did it on their own, without direction.  
* 2 of the 4 participants understood where they landed in the form.  
* 3 of the 4 participants expected to be able to navigate back to the Review and Submit page in one click.

**Task 3** was to see if the Veteran could fill out the Toxic Exposure form to complete all the screens in the flow.

* 2 of 4 were able to complete the TE form, 1 was unable to finish in the time allotted, and 1 user failed to complete the form.  
* 1 of 4 users independently clicked on the TE Additional Information link, and one other did not click on the Additional Information independently, but reviewed it when asked. Both found the information useful.  
* 2 of 4  Veterans used the “I’m not sure” checkbox in regards to entering Service Start/End Dates, however 1 of them only used it to move past date range screens to complete the task.  
* None of the 4 AT users understood that entering date ranges was optional.  
* 3 of 4 Veterans expressed that the form was too long.  
* 2 of 4 Veterans expressed difficulty with date recall/accuracy.  
* 2 of 4 Veterans stated that the errors on the date range pages were disruptive. (These were being read aloud.)  
* 2 of 4 participants stated that the Summary screen was helpful.

**Task 4** was to be able to go back and edit information previously entered. Only 2 of 4 of our AT participants got this far.

* 2 of 2 Veterans were able to change a previously entered date.  
* 2 of 2 Veterans were able to add a new location.  
* 2 of 2  Veterans were able to add an unknown date range. (P5AT skipped this task, but demonstrated the ability to do so during Task 3.)

## Tools used for Synthesis

We captured notes from sessions in Mural and facilitated three cross-functional interactive workshops with our scrum team to debrief after each cohort, to synthesize insights, prioritize issues,  and brainstorm recommendations. We used affinity mapping to identity key themes in Veteran’s feedback across both cohorts.

* We used **Figma** to create a clickable prototype of the toxic exposure flow to raise stakeholder awareness, as the VBA is more familiar with the paper version of the 526EZ than the digital one.  
* All research artifacts were documented in **GitHub**, the VA’s system of record: [Toxic Exposure Research on GitHub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-11-Toxic%20Exposure) [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-11-Toxic%20Exposure](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-11-Toxic%20Exposure)  
* For document drafting and collaboration, we used **Google Suite**.  
* Our findings were presented to stakeholders via **MS Teams**.  
* To capture notes and facilitate workshops with our scrum team, we used **Mural** for synthesizing results.  
* Session records were securely stored in **SharePoint**, the VA’s system of record, to protect PII.  
* We used **Slack** for session planning and real-time communication among team members.  
* Finally, **Zoom** was used to conduct and record live sessions with Veteran participants.

### 

## Research Background

The **Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act**, signed into law in August 2022, expands health care and benefits for veterans exposed to these toxic substances. More info on the **PACT Act (Opens in a new tab)**: [https://staging.va.gov/pact-act-eligibility/introduction](https://staging.va.gov/pact-act-eligibility/introduction)

**How the PACT Act Helps**

* **Expanded Presumptive Conditions:** Adds conditions (e.g., cancers, respiratory issues) presumed to be service-connected due to toxic exposure.  
* **Eligibility for Benefits:** Extends VA health care eligibility to more veterans, including those previously ineligible.  
* **Streamlined Claims Process:** Simplifies proving exposure and connecting conditions to service.

**Disability Compensation Overview**

* Disability compensation is often the first VA service Veterans engage with, setting expectations for their future interactions.  
* The **21-526EZ** (Disability Compensation Claim form) is one of the **most-used and longest forms** on VA.gov.

**Toxic Exposure updates to the 526EZ Form**

* Following the **PACT ACT**, new questions were added to the paper version of the 526EZ.  
* In October 2024, the DBEX team added a **Toxic Exposure (TE)** section to the VA.gov version, achieving parity with the paper form.  
* More information on **Toxic Exposures (Opens in a new tab):** [https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/](https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/hazardous-materials-exposure/)

**Design and Testing of the TE Section**  
The TE design was first tested in **July 2023** and updated based on research and collaboration with VBA and OCTO. Post-release, the revised TE design is being evaluated in a **staging environment** to address **previously identified pain points**:

* **Miscomprehension** due to section length  
* **Cognitive fatigue** from the need to recall military service history

**Informational Alert for In Progress Forms (IPF)**

* An informational alert is displayed at the top of the Review and Submit page for Veterans with an **In Progress Form (IPF)**—a form started before the rollout.  
* The alert notifies Veterans of new toxic exposure questions and includes a **link to the updated TE section** for those interested in completing it.  
* The In Progress Form (IPF) is a **commonly used design pattern across the VA Benefits portfolio**, as many teams face challenges in providing an intuitive user experience for Veterans returning to forms that have been updated since their last login to VA.gov.

## Research Lessons Learned

Accessibility issues with the study impacted how effectively assistive tech users were able to participate in sessions.

### Research Issues

#### Logging Into Staging Difficult

Logging onto staging was time-consuming and frustrating for participants.

* Walking participants through the login process was the most difficult part of every session. The process took up to 45 minutes, blocking 2 participants and preventing 2 others from completing the full session.  
* Dictating and zoom chatting the staging website URL and login criteria was slow and error-prone, despite participant focus and positive attitude.  
* Recruitment emails from Perigean do not use accessible links (lacking descriptive link text; too much text).  
* We worked with the Conditions team to try to implement a login workaround similar to their prototype, but based on the need for pre-fill information, it just wasn't viable for this study. In the future, we will ensure our timeline allows for time to build an accessible prototype and work with Perigean to streamline emails.

#### 526ez and Siri

The 526ez is not accessible for Siri-users.

* We learned from our accessibility expert at the start of the study that the digital 526ez cannot be navigated by Siri.  
* As a result, we cancelled one session in advance and were forced to end a screen reader session early when we learned that P9 struggled to type (letter-by-letter data entry).  
* In the future, we will explore what it takes to make our form accessible to Siri users.

#### AT Participants may need support

Nearly half of AT users shared that they often ask for help from others in a real life scenario.

* For our AT recruitment, we required that all participants report daily use of their AT and (a majority) had 5+ years of experience.  
* P1, P8, and P9 shared that, typically, they would ask a loved one for help to complete the form.  
* In the future, we will consider asking on the screener if participants would expect the support of a caregiver/loved one. Then, we could include them in order to observe a more realistic environment for the AT user.
