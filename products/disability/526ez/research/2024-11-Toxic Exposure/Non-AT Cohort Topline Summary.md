This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**

- To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings  
- To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data  
- To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Prioritization of Initial Findings

We’ve categorized each finding as high, medium, or low priority, based on the severity, frequency, and impact to the user experience. 

**High priority**: **Fix issues that block key tasks or frustrate most users.**

* Severity: The issue severely disrupts user tasks, causing users to abandon tasks, leading to frustration, or blocking critical functionality.  
* Frequency: The problem occurs frequently across sessions, impacting many users.  
* User Impact: It affects core functionality or important user goals. The user experience is degraded.


**Medium priority: Address issues that affect the experience but don't fundamentally stop user goals.**

* Severity: The issue affects the user experience but doesn’t completely block critical tasks.  
* Frequency: The problem occurs occasionally or only with certain user groups or conditions.  
* User Impact: It creates mild frustration or confusion but doesn't drastically impact user success or satisfaction.

**Low priority: Tackle minor issues when there is time or during minor design refreshes.**

* Severity: The issue has minimal impact on task completion and doesn’t affect user satisfaction in a meaningful way.  
* Frequency: The problem is rare, occurring only in edge cases or for a small group of users.  
* User Impact: Users can complete their tasks with minimal disruption.

## Detail of Initial Findings

**High Priority: Participants frequently got lost or confused while navigating through the list and loops to edit their responses in Task 4\.**

- Issues with navigation occurred when we asked participants to change a date range, location, or exposure from a summary screen. While 3 out of 4 participants completed the task, all participants appeared or expressed confusion.  
  - H3 headings did not appear to help to orient participants to the flow.  
  - Participants who used the "Edit exposures and dates" link did not know to hit "continue" to see the date ranges and struggled to find the right page.  
  - Those who used the back button in the form, instead, were confused to encounter date screens when they were looking for locations.

**High Priority: A majority of participants did not expect to click on the form update alert on the Review and Submit page prior to submitting.** 

- On the Review and Submit page, we asked participants, " **Talk me through what you would expect to do before pressing submit"** and then asked "**Is there any action left for you to take on this screen?**".   
- 3 out of 4 participants did not mention the alert at the top of the page, but one clicked on it before viewing the rest of the page.  
- **Note:** We are unsure if this task created a realistic enough scenario. We started the session with this task, and some participants have never used VA.gov before.

**Medium Priority: Participants were unclear about what specific date ranges VA was requesting on the detail screens.**

- Two users were confused by the "service start date (approximate)" label above the date component on detail pages. They did not know if VA wanted the dates they were in the location, or their tour dates overall.   
    
  - *"Is it asking when I first entered the service or the dates I was overseas? When it says service start date \- when I first joined and when I got out. I'm just gonna put the dates I was in \[location\]. \-P5*

**Medium Priority: Veterans pointed out terminology they were unfamiliar with and would like to see better defined.**

- On the "Other Exposures" screen, participants wanted examples or definitions of the following exposures:  
  - Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD)  
  - Military Occupational Specialty (MOS)- related toxin  
- On the Agent Orange screen, one participant wondered if they should count contact with a C-123 if they weren't in the Air Force. 

**Medium priority: When participants navigated to the new questions from the IPF alert, they expected they would be able to easily return to the Review and Submit page.**

- 2 participants assumed that pressing the back button on the TE conditions page would function like a browser back button, sending them back to the Review and Submit page rather than within the 526ez form flow.  
- 2 participants expected that checking the box "I am not claiming any conditions related to toxic exposure" would direct them back to the Review and Submit page.

**Medium Priority: Participants opted for "I'm not sure" when they didn't know a date range, but did not have confidence that this answer would be accurate enough for VA.** 

- 3 out of 4 participants who used the "I'm not sure" checkbox assumed that not providing dates would be unacceptable and could impact the success of their claim.  
- Half of the participants shared that they would find a way to provide dates where they selected "I'm not sure" before submitting, relying on military papers or a Google search for when memorable events happened.  
- 2 participants knew the exact Month and Year, but were unsure of the day. They were comfortable with this.  
- None of the 4 participants left optional fields blank, or stated that they knew they could.  
  - *"It's not clear if there's an issue with not entering dates. I'm not sure if that would have an effect on the claim, like if the claim would be denied if you didn't have the exact dates, you should get a box that says you can put these at a later date or your claim might not be approved." \-P2*

**Low Priority: Vietnam-era Veterans expected to see the Agent Orange appear earlier in the flow.**

- P1 expected to see Agent Orange listed as a toxic exposure on the Conditions page, while P4 expected the Agent Orange Exposure screen to come before post-1990.  
  - *"Agent Orange isn't listed here. That's new in the last couple of years. I would expect to see that listed here. It's definitely a toxic exposure." \-P1*

  - *"There were a lot of guys who were exposed to \[Agent Orange\] in Vietnam and Agent Orange has been put on the back burner." \-P4 on why the Agent Orange page wasn't earlier in the flow.*

**A majority of Veterans were already familiar with the PACT Act and had a guess at their personal eligibility.** 

- 3 out of 4 participants described the Pact Act; 1 participant didn't think they would be eligible.   
- We will continue to track this in AT sessions; it is possible that incomplete understanding of the Pact Act could dissuade eligible participants from applying.   
- P2 recommended that the IPF alert state whether or not the toxic exposure questions were required before submitting. They did not expect to qualify.

**Participants accurately comprehended the content of the IPF alert.**

- Participants understood that the alert was informing them of new questions added to the form.  
  - "That the VA updated the online form. There are new questions about TE. Possibly when this form was started the questions weren't available. I would look at that, but I don't think I'm eligible for that." \-P2  
- One participant immediately clicked on the alert link without reading.
