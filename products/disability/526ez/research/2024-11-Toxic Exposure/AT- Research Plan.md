# **Assistive Tech [AT]- Toxic Exposure Evaluative Study Research Plan** 

## Disability Benefits Team 1, November 2024

## **Background**

Disability compensation is often the first VA "service" that Veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their future experiences. 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. 

Following the PACT Act, new questions were added to the paper version of the 526ez. In October 2024, DBEX added a toxic exposure section to the VA.gov version, bringing the digital form into parity with the paper form. 

The TE design was first tested in July 2023 and updated following research and collaboration with VBA and OCTO. We are now evaluating the new designs with AT users to see if the improvements reduce pain points identified during 2023 research: Miscomprehension and cognitive fatigue due to section length and mental recall of military service history. 

We are also testing an alert that appears on the review and submit page for Veterans who have an In Progress Form that was started before the rollout. The alert informs Veterans that new questions about toxic exposure have been added and provides a link to the TE questions for Veterans interested in completing the section. 

To date, these designs have not been tested with Veterans who use assistive technology– adding to the importance of the study.

### **OCTO Priorities**

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

* Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products has increased by 5 points.

Quarterly OCTO Goal: 100% of Veterans using the digitized disability form will use the most up-to-date version of the form including toxic exposure information, a better reflection of 5103 requirements, and the platform digital signature component. DBEX-TREX will finish rolling out the new Toxic Exposure form  and deprecate old form version and submission endpoints.

### 

### **Veteran Journey**

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

* Managing primary care and chronic health issues

* Engaging VA to access benefits and services

* Saving for my retirement

  ## 

## **Research Goals**

  Note: These goals match those in the non-AT study, but emphasize the experience of using assistive technology. 

1. Assess the usability of the toxic exposure flow, identifying barriers for Veterans who use assistive technology.
  
2. Determine if Veterans who use assistive technology understand that the form has changed and that they can navigate to and add data for TE.

3. Assess how confident Veterans who use assistive technology feel about their answers to toxic exposure questions. 

### **Outcome**

   Research will help us prioritize changes to the toxic exposure flow that will make our form more accessible to a variety of AT users. Insights gathered will inform post-MVP enhancements to the feature. The study will also provide insight into the accessibility and efficacy of the IPF alert, which has not been tested. These learnings will be relevant to other teams using the component for releases in the future. 

   In relation to OCTO goals, this study will help us move toward making our digital experience the best way to access VA benefits (Priority \#1) by increasing Veteran satisfaction with the digital 526ez (Key result \#1). 

   

## **Research questions**

**Research Goal 1:** Assess the usability of the toxic exposure flow, identifying barriers for Veterans who use assistive technology.

* Do AT users perceive errors and can they fix them?

* Are location checkbox pages (especially those with a lot of locations) overwhelming to screen readers?

* Do Veterans who use assistive technology understand that date fields are optional?

* On summary pages, can users edit their service dates successfully? 

* Which questions or terminology are confusing to users or hard to answer? 

* Are any headers, labels, or links lacking description or clarity? 


**Research Goal 2:** Determine if Veterans who use assistive technology understand that the form has changed and that they can navigate to and add data for TE.

* Are Veterans using assistive technology able to understand from the alert that the form has changed?  
* Can users navigate to the toxic exposure questions from the review and submit screen?

  * If they click on the link to answer new questions, do they understand they are going back so many pages?

* Do users experience problems closing the alert? If they close the blue box do they lose focus?

* To what extent do users opt in to respond to the toxic exposure questions?”In what cases do users opt out? 


**Research Goal 3:** Assess how confident Veterans who use assistive technology feel about their answers to toxic exposure questions. 

* Do AT users feel confident about the accuracy of their answers? How would they go back and check them, if they weren’t sure?

* Do Veterans know if they are eligible to complete TE questions? How do they know?

* What will users do when they are unsure of specific dates or locations? How does this uncertainty impact their confidence in the accuracy of their responses overall?

* Do Veterans feel comfortable skipping over optional fields?

* How do users interact with the “I’m not sure” check box? Does the “comfort choice” increase confidence in their response? 

  ## **Hypothesis**

  See [research findings from the 2023 usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-07-Toxic-Exposure/Form%20526%20Toxic%20Exposure%20Usability%20Research%20Summary%202023.pdf) and [design documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/toxic-exposure.md) for more context on these hypotheses. 

* Veterans who use assistive technology will be able to perceive and correct for errors.

* Location pages with lots of checkboxes will be verbose for screen reader users, who might find it overwhelming. 

* Users are able edit date ranges and feel confident in their answers.

* Plain language and supplemental definitions will make the majority of questions easy for Veterans to answer.

* The flow is logically sequenced, starting with the earliest date screen and moving forward chronologically.

* The “I’m not sure” check box will offer relief to users who are unsure but don’t want to select “none.”

* Only some users will understand that date fields are optional. 

* Users will be able to navigate back and correct errors from the toxic exposure summary screen.

## **Recruitment**

### **Recruitment approach**

We will work alongside Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research. We request that Perigean:

* Shares a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey for this study, so we can review it before it goes out to participants

* Call participants one day in advance to remind them about the session and confirm they plan on using the AT they indicated during the session.
