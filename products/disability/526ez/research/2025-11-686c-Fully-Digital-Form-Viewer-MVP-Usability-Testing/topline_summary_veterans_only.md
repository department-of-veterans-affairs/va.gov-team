# Topline summary - 2025-11 686c-Fully-Digital-Form-Viewer-MVP-Usability-Testing (Veterans only)

This document’s purpose is to collect the team’s initial top takeaways throughout the week as research sessions are conducted. These are not set in stone findings and will be validated through synthesis post-research. Subsequent, more detailed analysis will analyze if there are specific patterns that correlate to the device type (mobile vs. desktop).


## Participant breakdown 

- 8 total participants 

- 4 desktop (P1, 2, 3, 9) and 4 mobile (P4, 6, 8, 10)

  - Note: 1 mobile participant was unable to share their screen due to technical difficulties so the moderator shared while the participant guided them through the prototype 

- All participants had an even split between starting either on the BAM Maximal or VADS Minimal design to reduce order bias 

- There was a mix of participants from both urban and rural communities 

- Ages ranged between 41 - 80 years old 

- 4 participants identified as having a cognitive disability 


## The takeaways based on hypotheses  

### ✅ Hypothesis validated: Some will download and/or print the copy of submission for record-keeping and contingency purposes. Others will not do so, expecting the ability to access the copy at another time.

- In general, 5 participants have an existing habit of saving their copies of form submissions because they served as receipts, and they would mostly refer to it if the VA found issues with their applications (e.g., the VA didn’t receive it; discrepancies in their answers).

  - P4 and P8 have had to refer to their previous form submissions in the past -

    - In addition to using their copies of submission as a receipt, P4 actually referred to their copies of submission before to help them remove their stepson as a dependent.  

    - P8, working with someone from the DAV, actually used their copies of submission to file an appeal for their claim, and it was used to prove that the VA had made a mistake with their application. 

  - On the other hand, P3 and P9 admitted that they have mostly never had to go back to their saved copies of submissions.

- When interacting with our prototypes, 4 out of 8 participants mentioned they would likely save a confirmation of the form’s submission or the form itself. 

  - P2 and P4 mentioned that they have either taken a screenshot of or printed out out the confirmation page.

  - P1, P3, and P10 mentioned that they would not download a copy of their form because they haven’t needed to refer back to that information after submission. 

  - P1 and P9 expected that if they needed to refer to their form submission later they’d be able to access it again on [VA.gov](http://va.gov). 


### ✅ Hypothesis validated: Some participants did not find the form output useful because they believed they could access it from their authenticated account (MyVA) if accessed at a time beside immediately post-submission.

- P1 and P10 did not find value in saving a copy of their VA applications, and would not have engaged with our form output prototype if they were really submitting an application.

- P6 also was not interested in clicking on the “Download or print the information you submitted” link from the confirmation page.

  - Potentially due to their prior experience of scanning and uploading legacy paper forms for submission, P6 does have a habit of saving everything they submitted, even though they admitted that they never had to look at these saved copies of submission.

  - When looking to save a copy of their submission, P6 would like to save the legacy paper version of their application instead of the digital output that was presented to them during this study. 

- All three participants have articulated a strong belief in the VA system - once it's submitted, the VA is able to retrieve it.

- All three also believed if they wanted to retrieve their copies of submission at a later date, they could do so by logging back into their [VA.gov](http://va.gov) accounts.

  - Given study constraints, we weren’t able to explore where in [VA.gov](http://va.gov) they believe they could retrieve their copies of submission.


### ✅ Hypothesis validated: Most participants will comment on the "clean" look (e.g., visual hierarchy, reduction of visual elements like a grid) that makes it easy to read.

- When presented with the baseline design variations without interactive elements, multiple participants (P1, P3, P9) mentioned that finding information requires a lot of scrolling

  - When shown the interactive VADS Minimal version that includes the interactive “On this page” component, many (P1, P2, P4, P9, P10) mentioned that they thought it was convenient that it would quickly take them to a specific section of the page rather than having to scroll 

- Half of the participants (P3, P6, P9, P10) struggled with the smaller font size in the BAM Minimal design and preferred the larger font size in the VADs Minimal version 

- P1, P2, P3, and P4  preferred the question responses being bold rather than the questions themselves


### ✅ Hypothesis validated: All participants intuitively understood how to engage with the [“on this page” navigation component](https://design.va.gov/components/on-this-page), but it wasn’t something they found necessary when interacting with the form output right after submitting their applications.

- All participants (8 out of 8) knew intuitively how to engage with the “on this page navigation” component.

- However, some participants (P3, P6) expressed mixed feelings about the usefulness of the component -

  - If they were engaging with the form output immediately after submitting, at least one participant admitted that they already reviewed their answers before submitting so there really isn’t a need to do a detailed review right after submitting.

  - At least one participant mentioned that if they are reviewing their copy of submission right after submitting, they would like to do a comprehensive review so they would be more inclined to scroll through the whole page instead of jumping to particular sections.


### ❌ Hypothesis invalidated: A few Veterans will probably desire the ability to edit their responses from the form viewer, which is an interaction that is not feasible since the submission is already complete.

- Nearly all participants understood that the information being displayed was their submitted form data 

  - P9 was the only participant that mentioned they thought that the answers within the form viewer would be editable after submission 

- P2 did mention that if they were updating their dependent information as part of this form submission they’d expect to see the previously submitted information as well


### ✅ Hypothesis validated: Most participants will appreciate the simplified, yet comprehensive nature of the form output.

- When presented with the VADS minimal version of our prototype, all participants appreciated that the content was comprehensive and captured all of a Veteran’s answers on the form.

  - All of the content seemed appropriate to our participants, and there was nothing they’d like to see de-emphasized or removed from the form output.


### ✅ Hypothesis validated: Some Veterans may be confused when presented with sections and questions that are not related to what they filled out themselves online.

- When presented with the BAM maximal version of our prototype, some participants (at least 5 out of 8 participants; this wasn’t investigated with some participants) were confused by the sections and questions that were left blank.

  - When it was explained to them that the sections and questions were left blank because our demo person either skipped them or it wasn’t shown to them, all of our participants wanted to see this displayed in a different manner - 

    - Some participants (P1, P8, P10) weren’t interested in seeing the optional/skipped questions and sections displayed at all, especially if they do not apply to them.

    - Other participants (P2, P4) would like to see the optional/skipped sections, but with an explicit indication that these sections did not apply to them.
