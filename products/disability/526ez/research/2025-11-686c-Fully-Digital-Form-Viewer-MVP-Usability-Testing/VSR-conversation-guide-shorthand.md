# VSR Conversation Guide for 686c Fully Digital Form Viewer MVP Usability Testing - Moderator Shorthand
_This is the shorthand version of the conversation guide for moderator use. Some language is removed for easier scanability while moderating. Please refer to the [complete conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2025-11-686c-Fully-Digital-Form-Viewer-MVP-Usability-Testing/VSR-conversation-guide.md) for more context._

## Introduction - 2 minutes (start @ :00)

Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. My name is [NAME] and I work on VA.gov. I am part of a team that is trying to improve the form submission experience so that Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible.

What I hope to do today is get your feedback on how we digitally display a filled out "Add or remove a dependent on VA Benefits" form (VA Form 21-686C) that you might see in your VBMS work queue.
Do you have any questions so far?

_Now we'll talk a little about your participation:_

* 60 minutes
* honest opinions; no right or wrong answers; not testing; won't be offended
* voluntary participation
* observers: intro first name and position
* [To the participant] Would you mind telling us what your role is and how long you've been with the VA?

`Tip: Observers turn off cameras to "save bandwidth"`

Now, I’ll talk a little bit about what you’ll be testing: We have a prototype of the digitized and completed 686 form. We are looking to incorporate your feedback on our work in progress. To do so, we will be asking you to interact with a prototype, and solicit your reactions and opinions as you accomplish various tasks from the page.

Just a heads up that you will be seeing some **prefilled data** as you interact with our prototype. None of the data you see is real Veteran data. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

**Permission to record** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

* Knowing that, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? [Record answer here]

➡️ Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? [Record answer here]


### Warm-up questions -  2 minutes (start @ :02)

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a couple of background questions.

* **Experience adjudicating*** or reviewing VA form 686c (the Add or remove a dependent form)?
    * other types of forms

### Setting up screenshare - 3 minutes (start @ :04)

Thank you for sharing your experience. We are now going to transition into testing a prototype version 686c form output on VBMS.
I’m going to send you a link in the chat. 

* [Desktop](https://www.figma.com/proto/EoYnokGp9aSgy5JrDVqp5L/686c---Form-data-viewer---Fully-Digital-Forms?node-id=4670-16703&t=BdjweiRXqUS7XhzL-8&scaling=scale-down-width&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=4670%3A14022&starting-point-node-id=4670%3A16703&show-proto-sidebar=1&hide-ui=1)
    * Backup tinyurl if the participant cannot get to the chat: [https://tinyurl.com/FDFVSR](https://tinyurl.com/FDFVSR)

* Have you interacted with a Figma prototype link before?
    * [If not] This link will open an online program called Figma, which allows us to visually represent potential VBMS webdesigns. It should let you scroll and click on some of the buttons and links, but some of the functionality will be limited and may not work.

**Before we screenshare > hide anything**

Once you open the link, please share your screen. Please **do not click** on anything at the moment! Awesome! Now I can see your screen.

`If prototype does not fit width/ fill the screen: press z`


## Setting up context- 2 minutes (start @ :07)

For the remainder of the session, I'd like you to imagine that you have a new 686c application you need to review. For this variation, we will not be covering topics that relate to form 674 (Request for Approval of School Attendance).

* Please click on 'Enter'

Here's the the VBMS Claim Evidence page (eFolder for VBMS) for Veteran Jamie Smith Brooks. (Just to clarify, Jamie isn't a real person, we are using fake data.) Help us set the scene. 

* Taking a step back, what's your desk and technology set up?
    * [Probe qty of monitors (and in what orientation), mouse paired with keyboard]
    * What's your window setup when processing a claim that involves 686c?
* [NTH] Without doing so yet, what do you think will happen if you click the link that says "VA Form 21-686c"?
    * What will you see?
    * [Gauge if they predict new tab or new page/ window or navigate page behavior]

We'll be mostly focusing on the content that follows the link. 
[Answer any questions to help clarify the context and set the scene.]

* Go ahead and click the link.


### Current PDF workflow - 3 minutes (start @ :09)

This is the current file view with the current 686c PDF form. You might be familiar with this form.

* What are your **goals** when reviewing 686c?
    * How does this information help achieve those goals?
* Are you typically looking for **specific information**?
    * keyword search vs skip specific sections
    * pieces or whole
    * [Probe copying info into other locations in VBMS]
* Do you need the **instructional information** at the beginning of the form?
    * other forms


## 1st minimal - 10 mins (start @ :12)
_Instruct participant to click on the "Edit Properties" button at the top left, which will bring them to the variations screen._

Now we're going to show you a variation of what you've seen so far. Two things to note: 
1. These concepts contain future header designs for VBMS Home. We won't focus on these headers and top navigation bar today but wanted to set that context.
2. We will assume a scenario in which Jamie's 686c form was submitted online via VA.gov.

Like a **cooking show**, I want you to describe what you're seeing, thinking, and doing. If you're scrolling, using the keyboard, or repositioning the window, I'd like you to narrate your actions. Before we proceed, do you have any questions?

Please click on 'Enter Orange/Mango'. 

Just like PDF form, imagine that this is what you would see if you were to click on the "VA Form 21-686c" link from Jamie's eFolder. 

Please skim through the sections, questions, and answers until you get to the bottom of the page. We **don't expect you to read everything**, but we want you to get a feel for the type of the information and how it's being displayed. Please **think aloud** as you review the page.

`Observe navigation methods (e.g., scrolling, tabbing)`

* What are your initial thoughts of this page?

⬆️ If you may scroll to the top of the page please.
### TASK: Could you show us **how many children** are being added as dependents? And what are their names?

[Answer: 2, Andrew and Anna]

* On a scale from 1-5: How easy was it to find the answer?


### [NTH] Skipped sections & questions

I'd like us to look at a specific section on this page. Could you scroll to the end of Section 3? Note that sections 4-7 are not in document. These sections were not applicable to Veteran Jamie and so they were skipped.

* How do you feel about that?
* What's your preference - to include or not include skipped sections?
* Where would you expect to find documentation of all the sections and questions?


### VA Form 21-686c link (opens blank version of current PDF)

* What do you think will happen if you click on the "VA Form 21-686c" link?
* Would you use this?
    * In what scenarios?


### Numbering

* Do you find the numbering helpful? Why?
    * [Probe question numbering, section numbering is NTH]
    * How would you use it?
* Is it important for the numbering of the sections and questions to be consistent from one Veteran's 686c to another's 686c?
    * [Example scenario is different quantity and types of address fields for US vs international addresses in Q78-85]
    * [NTH] What are your thoughts about the numbering not being the same as the current PDF version of the 686c?



## 2nd minimal - 3 minutes (start @ :22)
`Change concept`
Just like the last page, imagine that this is what you would see if you were to click on the "VA Form 21-686c" link from Jamie's eFolder. Please go ahead and take a moment to review the page.

* What are your initial thoughts of this page?

⬆️ If you may scroll to the top of the page please.
### TASK: Can you show us what the birthplaces are for the 2 children that are being added to Jamie's VA benefits?

[Answer: San Mateo CA and San Francisco CA]

* On a scale from 1-5: How easy was it to find the answer?


## Comparison of the minimals - 3 minutes (start @ :25)
Now we're going to show you the two concepts side-by-side.
`Change concept`


* Do you see any **difference between the two** concepts, orange and mango? If so, what?

What do you think about the:
* Text styling (headers, bold text, **size**, capitalization [title vs sentence case])
    * Legibility
    * Scan-ability
* Q&A layout and **spacing** (two column, side-by-side vs stacked)
* Can you easily **distinguish one section** from another? How?
    * [Probe about visual elements like divider, typography, spacing]
* **What is your preference?**
* [NTH] How does this compare to what you're used to in VBMS?

## Evaluating Apple  (Extra Features) -  15 minutes (start @ :28)
`Change concept`
The form output content remains the same as what we've just reviewed, but now there are a bit more features that are on the page. Let's go through each of the additional features one-by-one:

`Observe navigation methods (e.g., scrolling, tabbing)`

⬆️ If you may scroll to the top of the page please.
### TASK: Can you show us when Jamie got married to their current spouse?

[Answer: 09/15/2023]

* What do you think this feature does?
    * Without doing so yet, what happens if you click on it?


#### TASK: Please navigate to the information that states whether or not Child 1, Andrew, has a disability.  
[Answer: Yes]
Observe navigation methods (e.g., scrolling vs sidenav)

* [If they used the side-nav] How was the experience using the side navigation?
    * [Probe on speed, ease of use, acts as expected]
* [If they didn't use the link]
    * Why didn't you use the side-navigation?
    * Have them do the task again but using it. Ask questions above.
* Is this useful to you? 
    * How would you use it? 
    * How often and in what scenarios?
    * How does it compare to your previous method of navigating?
 

### Syntax (online vs PDF)
* What do you think about the wording being used in the headers, questions and answers?
If you may go to question 63 (child's disability status question).

The order and wording of the questions and answers here reflect the Q&A that Veteran was shown when filling out the form on VA.gov, rather than what is shown on the 686c PDF/ paper.

* What are your thoughts on how the online questions slightly differ from the paper/ PDF version?
    * Which Q&A syntax do you **prefer**? The online version or the paper/ PDF version? Why?

* [NTH] address (block vs broken out)
    * Looking at question 4, what are your thoughts on the the country field preceding the rest of the address?


### [If not asked earlier] Skipped sections & questions

I'd like us to look at a specific section on this page. Could you scroll to Section 4: Remove a divorced spouse?

* What do you think is going on here?

This section was not required to be filled out, so our demo Veteran, Jamie, didn't fill it out in their application.

* How do you feel about having the skipped questions displayed like this?
    * **Would you like to see** the skipped sections and questions?
    * What are you thoughts on the **"Not applicable" text** beside the section names?
* Is it helpful to know the questions even when the **Veteran isn't asked them**?
* Is it helpful to know when a Veteran is asked an optional question, but they do not provide an answer?
    * [Clarifying note: The Veteran should not be able to submit the form online if the question is required.]

### Download button (opens "save-as" dialog box)

    * [NTH] address (block vs broken out)
        * Looking at question 4, what are your thoughts on the the country field preceding the rest of the address?
* Accordions: What do you think the arrows at the top left of each section box do?
    * Is this useful to you? Frequency?
    * Go to Section 4: Removed a divorced spouse, the box is collapsed. 
        * How do you feel about that?
        * [If not asked yet] What are you thoughts on the **"Not applicable"** text?
        * Would you want the default for all skipped sections to be collapsed? Included at all?

### Closing Apple

## Conclusion - 1 minute (start @ :59)

Thank you! These are all the questions that we have for you today. 
Before we end, I'd like to ask if we can have your permission to use a clip of our session with you to help our colleagues understand your experiences? One of the ways that we **share findings with our partners across the VA** is by showing short video clips of research sessions. In these video clips, we **blur** out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time.

* Knowing this, do I have your permission if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand your experiences?
    [Record answer here]

Great! Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on making sure our Veterans can get their benefits as quickly as possible.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency exit plan

* Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
* Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
