### Introduction - 2 minutes (start @ :00)

Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. My name is [NAME] and I work on VA.gov. I am part of a team that is trying to improve the form submission experience so that Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible.

What I hope to do today is get your feedback on how we digitally display a filled out "Add or remove a dependent on VA Benefits" form (VA Form 21-686C) that you might see in your VBMS work queue.
Do you have any questions so far?

_Now we'll talk a little about your participation:_

* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you over that time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
* [To the notetaker and observers] I'd like us to do a round of intros for [Participant] first. Let's start with [notetaker] 
    * [Ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov]
* [To the participant] Would you mind telling us what your role is and how long you've been with the VA?

`Tip: If it hasn't been done, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.`

Now, I’ll talk a little bit about what you’ll be testing: We have a prototype of the digitized and completed 686 form. We are looking to incorporate your feedback on our work in progress. To do so, we will be asking you to interact with a prototype, and solicit your reactions and opinions as you accomplish various tasks from the page.

Just a heads up that you will be seeing some prefilled data as you interact with our prototype. None of the data you see is real Veteran data. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
Before we start, I was wondering if I could have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

* Knowing that, do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? [Record answer here]

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that I have your permission to record this session once more.

➡️ Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today? [Record answer here]

### Warm-up questions -  2 minutes (start @ :02)

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a couple of background questions.

* How much experience do you have adjudicating or reviewing VA form 686c (the Add or remove a dependent form)?
    * What other types of forms or claims do you adjudicate? How much experience do you have with those?

Thank you for sharing your experience.

---

### Setting up screenshare - 3 minutes (start @ :04)

Thank you for sharing your experience. We are now going to transition into testing a prototype version 686c form output on VBMS.
I’m going to send you a link in the chat. 

* Have you interacted with a Figma prototype link before?
    * [If not] This link will open an online program called Figma, which allows us to visually represent potential VBMS webdesigns. It should let you scroll and click on some of the buttons and links, but some of the functionality will be limited and may not work.

**Prototypes**

* [Desktop](https://www.figma.com/proto/CVpC4IQI7IpVZeypPoCI8x/D2D-Solutioning-V2?node-id=3801-37940&t=4F0Y5cF4SnzUjpUE-8&scaling=contain&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=3197%3A2003&starting-point-node-id=3801%3A37940&show-proto-sidebar=1&hide-ui=1)
    * Backup tinyurl if the participant cannot get to the chat: https://tinyurl.com/vsr2026fdf

Feel free to take a minute to hide anything, like your email or anything you don’t want us to see. Let me know if you need help. I am more than happy to walk you through the steps you can take to share your screen:

* At the top right of your Teams window, there should be a “Share” button (it should be in purple). Please click on that.
* Please make sure the entire screen or window is selected/highlighted.

Once you open the link, please share your screen. Please do not click on anything at the moment! Awesome! Now I can see your screen.
[If prototype does not fit width/ fill the screen] May you press the letter "z" on your keyboard to change the size of the prototype?

---

### Setting up context- 2 minutes (start @ :07)

```The participant will encounter the prototypes in the following order:
- Current PDF
- Orange: Baseline Minimal (uses online questions)
- Grape: Digital PDF (uses PDF questions)
- Apple: Extra Features (uses online questions)
```

For the remainder of the session, I'd like you to imagine that you have a new 686c application you need to review. For this variation, we will not be covering topics that relate to form 674 (Request for Approval of School Attendance).

* Please click on 'Enter'

Here's the the VBMS Claim Evidence page (eFolder for VBMS) for Veteran Jamie Smith Brooks. (Just to clarify, Jamie isn't a real person, we are using fake data.) Help us set the scene. 

* Taking a step back, what's your desk and technology set up?
    * [Probe qty of monitors (and in what orientation), mouse paired with keyboard]
    * What's your window setup when processing a claim that involves 686c?
        * [NTH] Is this different if you were to process non-dependent-related claims?
* Without doing so yet, what do you think will happen if you click the link that says "VA Form 21-686c"?
    * What will you see?
    * [Gauge if they predict new tab or new page/ window or navigate page behavior]

We'll be mostly focusing on the content that follows the link. 
[Answer any questions to help clarify the context and set the scene.]

* Go ahead and click the link.

---

### Entry points, workflow (understanding current PDF workflow) - 5 minutes (start @ :09)

This is the current file view with the current 686c PDF form. You might be familiar with this form.

        * How often and how long does it typically take until the problem is resolved?
* [NTH] Beyond opening this page, do you typically do any other tasks while you're reviewing form 686c?
    * Would you do the same tasks with other forms or just 686c?
* [NTH] Are there other scenarios that would require you to view this form output?
    * When and how would you use or encounter this form output?
* [NTH] Off the top of your head, is there anything you wish could be improved about this form? Why? [max 2 mins]

### Evaluating Orange (Baseline Minimal) - 10 mins (start @ :20)
_Instruct participant to click on the "Edit Properties" button at the top left, which will bring them to the variations screen._

Now we're going to show you a variation of what you've seen so far. Like a cooking show, I want you to describe what you're seeing, thinking, and doing. If you're scrolling, using the keyboard, or repositioning the window, I'd like you to narrate your actions. Before we proceed, do you have any questions?
Please click on 'Enter Orange'. Just like PDF form, imagine that this is what you would see if you were to click on the "VA Form 21-686c" link from Jamie's eFolder. Please skim through the sections, questions, and answers until you get to the bottom of the page. We don't expect you to read everything, but we want you to get a feel for the type of the information and how it's being displayed. Please think aloud as you review the page.

`Observe navigation methods (e.g., scrolling, tabbing)`

* What are your initial thoughts of this page?

#### TASK: Could you show us how many children are being added as dependents? And what are their names?

[Answer: 2, Andrew and Anna]

* Is there anything you'd change to improve how the children's info is displayed?
* On a scale from 1-5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy... How easy was it to find the answer?
    * Why?
    * [If low score] What would make it more easier?

#### TASK: Can you find the filenames of the supporting documents that were uploaded with the claim?

[Answer: "other_evidence", "disability_evidence", "adoption_papers"]

* How easy was that on a scale from 1-5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy. Why?

#### Content and Formatting

* What do you think about the:
    * Text styling (headers, bold text, size, capitalization [title vs sentence case])
        * Legibility
        * Scan-ability
    * Q&A layout (two column, side-by-side vs stacked, form cells)
    * Sections and subsections
        * How do you feel about the section numbering?
        * Is there anything you'd change to improve it?

    * Which Q&A syntax do you prefer? The online version or the paper/ PDF version? Why?
        * What are the pros and cons?
* [NTH] Do you want to see full SSNs? Or censored versions that reveal only the last 4 digits.
* [NTH] Which format for names do you prefer? All in one line or broken out in separate lines for first, middle, and last name?
* [NTH] Which format for addresses do you prefer? Broken out in separate fields or condensed in postal format?

    * Is it useful for you? How would you use it?
* Is it important for the numbering of the sections and questions to be consistent from one Veteran's 686c to another's 686c?
    * [Example scenario is different quantity and types of address fields for US vs international addresses in Q78-85]
    * What are your thoughts about the numbering not being the same as the current PDF version of the 686c?


#### [NTH] Skipped sections & questions

I'd like us to look at a specific section on this page. Could you scroll to the end of Section 3? Note that sections 4-7 are not in document. These sections were not applicable to Veteran Jamie and so they were skipped.

* How do you feel about that?
* What's your preference - to include or not include skipped sections?
* Where would you expect to find documentation of all the sections and questions?


#### VA Form 21-686c link (opens blank version of current PDF)

* What do you think will happen if you click on the "VA Form 21-686c" link?
* Would you use this?
    * In what scenarios?

    * [If low score] What would make it more easier?



#### TASK: Where does it show that Jamie has certified the accuracy of their information on the form they just submitted?

* On a scale from 1-5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy... How easy was it to find the answer?
    * Why?
    * [If low score] What would make it more easier?

#### Content and Formatting

    * [Probe scrolling, tabbing]


#### [NTH] Online vs. PDF

This variation uses the numbering and question wording of the current PDF version of 686c. Therefore, the order and verbiage is slightly different than what is displayed and asked of Veteran Jamie, who filled out the form online on VA.gov.

* How do you feel about that?
    * What version of wording would you prefer? Why?
---

### Concept comparisons (Digital PDF vs Minimal)  - 5 minutes (start @ :30)

* Now that you had a chance to interact with this version of the form output, what are the major differences between what you see here and the previous variation you looked at earlier?
* In either of the variations, is there information that's missing that you'd like to see?
    * Is there information that should be emphasized?
    * Is there too much information? What would you like to remove or de-emphasize?

This section was not required to be filled out, so our demo Veteran, Jamie, didn't fill it out in their application.

* How do you feel about having the skipped questions displayed like this?
    * Would you like to see the skipped sections and questions?
    * What are you thoughts on the "Not applicable" text beside the section names?

    * Would you say most of your coworkers would agree with you?

---

### Conclusion - 2 minutes (start @ :58)

Thank you! These are all the questions that we have for you today. 
Before we end, I'd like to ask if we can have your permission to use a clip of our session with you to help our colleagues understand your experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of research sessions. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time.

* Knowing this, do I have your permission if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand your experiences?
    [Record answer here]

Great! Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on making sure our Veterans can get their benefits as quickly as possible.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

### Emergency exit plan

* Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
* Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
