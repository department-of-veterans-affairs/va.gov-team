- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. Your feedback is helping us improve the language on these pages so its a better experience for veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will be compensated regardless of whether you complete the session or answer all of the questions.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
    - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with [VA.gov](http://va.gov/). (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
    - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes, and I just click on the button.

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- Are you currently a veteran or active duty?
- Can you remind me where you are based?
- Can you remind me of whether you have applied for any VA benefits before? (for determining which scenario to present)
- What is your experience with VA.gov, if any? I do use it. The single sign on is much better than it uses to be with 4 different logins. It is slowly going onto one website so that is good. That is what I like about it.
Have you ever applied for any benefit? Yes.
Did you apply online? That was in person through a VSO, and we had to write it down on paper, make copies, and send it in. At least 10 years ago.

## First Task: [intro & TE alert] - 5 minutes


###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand the intro and what language they find clear/confusing 

- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* 
- Take a moment to look over the page. What is the first thing you would do after arriving on this page? [emphasize more after first few interviews] Once getting to this page I would read it. I saw the sign in button, but I don’t want to start the application until I know what this is all about. I just want to read and see if this is something I want to apply for and work through.
- Read everything on this page up until the “Sign in” button at your own pace. You can read aloud or to yourself. Try to look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. If questions come up for you as your e reading feel free to say them out loud.  Let me know when you are finished, and then I will ask you a few questions.
- Do you think the information here could be clearer? how so?
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all useful, and 10 being very useful, how useful or not was the information in this section of the page?
    - Why did you choose that number?
-  Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you’ve read here, what is your understanding of who qualifies for benefits under the PACT act?
       alt: if you had to explain the new PACT act to someone else, how would you put it ?      

## Second Task: [STEP 1] Is this the form for you - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- Same as before: Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario to participant*
- MOBILE: Without clicking on anything just yet, look at the steps listed here. What do they tell you about the process for claiming disability comp. if anything?
- From what you have seen so far, what are some actions you think you can take on this page? 

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 1?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section 1 of the form 

- Read Step 1 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. Let me know when you have finished. Feel free to read out loud or to yourself.  If questions come up for you as your e reading feel free to say them out loud

- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful or not was the information in this section? I would drop it in between 6-7 because it gives people information. It is just very specific information. There is no hyperlink to explain what is the law and what does it include?
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you? I have not been exposed to Agent Orange nor burn pits, but our mortar rounds contain black powder so when we would launch them *disconnected* they have little yellow donuts that contain black powder so we would have 100s of these after various fire missions and all we would do is dig a hole and drop them in there. Break a few open and have a line of black powder a few feet and light it on fire to the pit of hundreds and hundreds of donuts. We would do this all the time, every day. I don’t know if that applies to this situation. It is not very inclusive, just a general statement. Does the burning of powder from live fire exercises count?

You would want to see more information here? Yes. What about mold from living in old barracks. The water at Camp Lejeune. What are other toxic exposures? 
Did you notice the link that states click here to learn more? Did you expect it to be helpful? No because when it is talking about the presumptive it is talking about the medical/mental statements of the substances. They have stated they cannot prove that it is related to the exposure. They just assume that it was related/the cause of the issues.  What are the exposure items.

- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- From what you read, what is your understanding of who is eligible for disability benefits?
   - ALT: If you had to explain to someone else this information about who is eligible for disability benefits, what would you phrase it?
- From what you read here, what is your understanding of a supplemental claim form?
     - ALT: If you had to explain to someone what a supplemental claim is, how would you phrase it?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE ALERT UI/ INFO

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why?
- Is this the information you expected to see here? why or why not?
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, IF ANY?
- What is your understanding of the information about veterans who have been granted benefits in the past?

### Things to watch for:

- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Third Task: [STEP 2] Decide how to apply - 3 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see when you open section 2? 
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section two
- Imagine you are here to *insert pertinent scenario,* read step 2 on this page at your own pace and look for any information relevant to your situation. If questions come up for you as you're reading, feel free to ask them. 
What is your first impression of the text? For this text it is okay. It is very specific on one of these have to be true to qualify, if one of these is true you have to qualify with these other two statements. That is self-explanatory. This helps explain the questions that I have had about the first paragraph.
What does this answer for you? Let’s just say I have never had seasonal allergies prior to joining the military and then joining I started getting seasonal allergies and getting out they still exist that that could because of exposure to toxic substances. So, this could be for me.
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer, if any? Sometimes the language used can be slightly confusing. For some people, even for me, how would I know if I had a disability that didn’t appear until after my service ended. How would I know if that is related to my service without having to go through a physical or a disability board. You should break it down Barney style, how is anybody supposed to know that if they have not previously applied for benefits. They may have an idea, but this is saying that it has already been identified. Many people I have served with think we didn’t go to medical, in the Marine Corps we have the mentality that we just suck it up and drive on, so when you get out you don’t have medical proof because you were never seen. It could possibly give a sour taste for the VA  because you didn’t have medical proof of injury in the military.

How would you word it? If you have a medical issue that you think is related to your military service, apply.

Do you think any of the other phrases could be clearer? The fourth one is confusing. I would venture to say that there are a number of people that are aware that one injury has caused another injury. A bad ankle could cause a knee problem and so on. Now you are sitting there not being able to sleep because you are in constant pain. 
So, you are saying a Veteran may not know where it started? Yes, exactly. Where did the problem initially start?
So, we could make it clearer that they already have a service-connected injury? Yes. I think that sentence is just a little complicated even though it is a short sentence. After causing a new injury, using the word caused denotes fact because it may not be. Just apply and we will figure that out with a medical exam.
Did you see the part for the supplemental claim? That is if the VA has previously declined a claim. Somebody put in a claim, and it was denied and now the PACT Act states you may qualify and now all of a sudden now we can change the denial into an approved claim.
How did you know you had to be denied first? Right here it states that you know you have to submit proof to get approval, so for me it meant you have been previously denied and based on your new information you could be approved. I have had friends who have applied for claims that have been denied and now they have been approved. I just didn’t know it was called a supplemental claim. 

Is this what you expected to see when clicking on this? I was expecting to see something just not this. It is said there are different levels to PTSD, as an individual what is their level they have to deal with. How bad is it for them?

Are you saying the severity of the disability should affect the rating? Yes. You could file a supplemental claim to increase from a 10% to 20%.

Is it clear that a supplemental claim is different from a claim to increase? I had no idea. Maybe having a hyperlink takes you to a definition of both claims so you can know which claim you would want to file. I thought it was just filing a claim to increase it. In reading this section I thought they were the same, but they are the same. 
Any unclear of confusing here? I didn’t know VSO was Veteran Service Officer, I thought it was Veteran Service Office. I don’t have any confusion in section two.

Is there a difference between condition and disability? Yes, a condition does not mean for the purpose of the VA that it is a compensative disability. You may have a condition that does not afford you protection under the Disability Act. 
### Things to watch for:

- How do vets/service members react to mentions of form completion time?
- Are certain words/language tripping up veterans/active members?
- Are there places that veterans need to reread or ask for clarity about?
- Are there things that veterans misunderstand after reading about them
- Is there information veterans seem to skim/skip over / miss
- How much time approximately do veterans take to read this section 

## Fourth Task: [Step 3] Gather information - 10 minutes

###Task goal: gauge whether or how much vets understand step 1 and what language they find clear/confusing + 
gauging expandable sections UX on mobile + gauge expandable alert interaction 

- IF ON MOBILE: What do you expect to see when you expand section 3?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section three
- As before, read through this section at your own pace. Let me know once you’re finished. look for any information relevant to your situation as a *insert scenario*. 
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section? One thing I don’t like when opening these things up when I click and expand it takes me back to the top and I have to scroll down. This in my opinion is easy. It is just stating they will be looking at any and all medical records they have and any that you submit including supporting statements. I think this would have to be sworn in front of someone.
Why do you say that? When you can have someone write whatever they want so you would want to have them swear in front of someone that what you are saying is true. This way if what they stated is false, they could be in trouble. There are people who would take advantage of the system if there were no punishment for submitting false information.
Anything else stick out to you in this section? No, I mean. In my mind well what if it was someone like me who got out 25 years ago. You have your buddies, what if they don’t remember. Going back to you don’t go to medical if you get injuries. How the heck do you do that? That is just something that popped up in my head. I can barely remember what I wore three days ago, how am I supposed to know when someone started having random nose bleeds? How as a friend make that connection and write a statement?
How likely do you think the VA would collect documents? Honestly, I think it is hit or missed. I think it depends on who is reviewing your documentation. I have some buddies who have been rated 100% with nothing wrong with them, and I have some that have broken bodies and have been fighting the VA for years. I think sometimes the raters don’t hold the data to the same standards.
Do you think it is on the Veteran to build the best case? In every situation it is on the Veteran to build the best case. I think it is a catch 22. You want to be a good Marine, you want to be a strong Marine, so you don’t go to the medical. Years later your back hurts, they Xray your back and you have a spinal compression, but how do I say it was due to my military service, but I never went to medical. I can’t prove that my injury was due to service because there is no proof  that would prove it is related into me getting some sort of compensation for it. 
Can you read the yellow alert? That would have been nice to know when I got out. That is good for current and future Veterans. What a bunch of jerks. Just kidding. 
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
    - Is there information here that you feel is not useful to you? 
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Was any of this information confusing or unclear?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about how disability compensation is determined?
    ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone else how disability compensation is determined? How would you explain it?
- What is your understanding of the information you read about what documents are needed to support a claim for disability benefits?
    - ALT: Imagine you needed to explain to someone this information about the types of documentation needed to support a claim for benefits. How would you explain it to them?
  
**CHECK TIME**

- Was anything confusing about the information pertaining to authorizing the VA to receive and review your medical records?
- Was anything confusing about the information concerning where to submit forms for claiming PTSD or unemployability?

QUESTIONS CONCERNING EXPANDABLE UI/INFO - BDD

- Do you think the alert will contain information relevant to your situation of *insert scenario*? why or why not?
- Before you opened this section, was this the information you expected to see here? Why or why not?
- Which parts of this section do you think they could make clearer, if any?
- In your own words, what is your understanding of the benefits delivery at discharge program?
    - If you had to explain the Benefits Delivery at Discharge program to someone else, how 
        would you do that?

## Fifth Task: [Step 4] Apply - 8 minutes

- IF ON MOBILE: what do you expect to see in this section?
- IF ON MOBILE: expand section four
- Read through section at your own pace…
- In your own words, what is the gist of the information in this section? 3-4 months, that is a laugh. That is way too short. Hell no. I have had friends who waited 18 months, and some longer but almost all longer then 4 months. 

Do you think it would be better to not have a timeframe listed? I would just say to double that because I don’t think any of my friends have gotten a response within 4 months. Nothing else on here. Sign in to create an account to create it. You have a year to finish it. 
Having read through this, how prepared do you feel you are to complete this application? I would call it, reading this, I don’t really know how to rate it because I could begin and not submit it if I don’t have all my supporting documents. It could take me weeks to gather all this information. It could take me 25 minutes if I have all the supporting documents.
- On a scale of 1 to 10 ,1 being not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful was the information in this section?
    - Why did you choose that number?
- Is there any information missing from this section that you personally would want to know?
- Which parts of this section do you think could be clearer?
- If you had to explain "intent to file" to someone else, how would you put it?
- What did you think when you read the text about the length of time the VA takes to make a decision?
   - Did you find that information useful or not useful?

**If not mentioned before and within the allotted time:**

- What is your understanding of the information regarding additional forms like those for dependents and aid?

SENTIMENT AND TRUST TESTING 

- In your opinion, is there a difference between the words “condition” and “disability”?
- On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not at all prepared and 10 being extremely prepared, how prepared or not do you feel to begin the 526 form after reading this page?
- How likely or unlikely would you be to reach out to a VSO for help  completing the form?
- Now that you have read through this page, is there any information missing from this page that you feel is needed to equip veterans to begin the form on their own?
- If we needed to shorten this page, is there any information you think we could take out? 
- From what you have seen here, how long do you think completing the form digitally would take you?


**ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DEPENDING ON TIME:**

- Personally, why do you think the VA asks for evidence when applying for disability benefits?
- Do you agree or disagree that the VA expects a reasonable amount of documentation to support a claim for benefits/compensation. Why so?
    - ALT: Do you believe it is necessary for the VA to collect "evidence” from you to support your claim for benefits/compensation? why or why not?
- How would you describe the overall tone of the text on this page? E.G. corporate, warm, cold, etc.

## 

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

If participant becomes nervous , anxious, or irritated -

how are you feeling? do you want to take a few minutes to yourself?

You have already helped us a lot and given us some good information, it’s ok to take a break or even end now if you need to

We’ve been talking a lot, do you want to take a break before we start again?
