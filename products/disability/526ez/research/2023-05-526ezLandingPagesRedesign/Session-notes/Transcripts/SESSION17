I try to do these, these surveys for you guys like, um, cause one of my um, family members, she works for your company and so I'm always like trying to help and stuff like that. Cause she says she needs like some people to like do some surveys and stuff and it's whenever I try to do one, you know, it's the little ones know, right, right. And

Moderator: Yeah, well listen, if you, yeah, just let us know you need to attend. You can go on mute and, and totally, um, you know, do what she needs. She, you know, her needs is always gonna come first, so, you know,

Observer: Hi there, I'm Lydia. Um, I work on, uh, Nyantee's
 team. 
Um, Uh, VA and looking forward to hearing what you have to share today. Thank you for letting us sit in. Just, just gonna be sitting here listening. 
Participant 12: Okay. It was nice meeting you.
Moderator: Yeah. One more person.
Observer: Hi, I can quickly say hello. My name's 
Julie. I'm also a researcher working with the va. Thanks so much for letting us sit in. 
Participant 12: You're welcome. 
Moderator: Thank you both. Um, okay, so we can jump in. Um, first of all, Jessica, can you just remind me, uh, where you're based? 
Participant 12: Uh, Malmstrom Air Force Base. 
Moderator: Okay. And. Where is it?
Participant 12: Montana. 
Moderator: Okay. Thank you for clarifying. I, I'm in New York, so my geography gets a little shaky there, so that, thank you. Um, and you said you have some familiarity with the 5 26, um, form. Um, can you, uh, talk a little bit more about that? So, 
Participant 12: um, right now I'm kind of in the middle of, um, filing a claim, but, um, I have gone on the VA website and, um, went through the, the channels on that website to start filling out the form.
Um, after getting out of the service, I haven't had much experience actually following through with filing that claim. Um, I've just been kind of, um, I wouldn't say in limbo, but just kind of, um, holding off, trying to gather some evidence first prior to submitting the claim. But, um, I do know exactly like where to go and how to get it started.
I just never, I have, I have yet to, you know, go through and, and complete the claim. 
Moderator: Okay. That's not a problem. And um, you know, how has it been that process of collecting evidence? Cause we hear a lot about that. 
Participant 12: Um, it's, it's a little tricky, um, just because, I mean, with being, I'm a spouse now of someone who's still in the active, active duty military, so we're constantly moving, you know, so it's like the, the things that I need evidence for are, are places that.
I've chose, um, I've chosen to go on my own accord and it's not a VA facility, like, um, let's say like a mental health therapist or, um, like if I needed, needed steroids, shots for allergies or something like that. I've always gone like on my own accord and not really went through the va. So it's a lot of different facilities to, to contact and gather that evidence, you know, to kind make that packet.
So, But that's my mistake. 
Moderator: That makes complete sense. No, so many people talk about that. Um, okay. And you are doing this totally on your own, or have you reached out to anyone for support with it or, um, 
Participant 12: So I have, um, so prior to getting outta the military, I started the process and I completed like that first initial claim.
And I am getting compensated for a few disabilities. Um, right now I'm trying to, um, go through this one. It's VA Guardian and they're helping me out with, um, increasing a, a claim that I've tried to get increased on my own. And so far they're doing the heavy lifting. They kind of. They compile the paperwork and you know, so they're, they do most of the heavy lifting and you know, we just sign forms, but I'm kind of in that process right now, so.
Moderator: Okay, got it. Um, and do you know, is that a, is that a lawyer or legal counsel? Is it a V S O or some kind of veteran service? 
Participant 12: Veteran service, yeah. 
Oh, 
Moderator: okay. Got it. How did you find out about them? 
Participant 12: It was actually through an email. Um, I was, um, I, I get a monthly newsletter from the va and then, um, I don't know how I, I don't know if it was in that newsletter or it was like attached, um, as a, a separate email, but I just saw that and I was like, oh.
Participant 12: I was like, I'll, I'll give them a try, you know? So they're definitely helpful. They, they definitely guide you in like, Pretty much they do some of the evidence, um, like help you, um, organize the evidence part. It's a lot to do on your own.
Moderator: Right. Right. Would you say that's the most helpful part of what they do?
Participant 12: Yes, for sure. 
Participant 12: Yeah, definitely getting, getting the evidence, the right evidence, um, that the VA needs so you're not wasting anybody's time. That's the hardest part because that's the stuff that takes the longest sometimes. Um, and then the definitely when the VA reviews the evidence and makes their own decision, um, I mean, that takes a while too, cause they have to go over the evidence and everything.
But for, for me, the hardest part is definitely getting all that evidence collected into one file and submitted for a claim. 
So, 
Moderator: Got it. Do you feel like they're asking for a reasonable amount of evidence? 
Participant 12: I think so. For they, for compensation, you know, they wanna make sure that people aren't trying to scam the system and stuff like that.
And they actually have real disabilities. And so I under, yeah, I understand that they take their time and they really evaluate the evidence and they make sure the timeline fits and that it is service related and not prior. 
Moderator: So I see. Thank you so much, Jessica, for kind of just breaking that down for me.
It just helps me understand like what goes on behind the scenes. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to text you, uh, message you. I'm gonna put in the chat, um, this prototype and let's see if you're able to open it and, and share your screen.
