Session 7

moderator: And did you hear the alert that let you know it's recording? Yes. Yes. Okay, great. Thank you. All right, and so just to kind of start, Henry, can you walk me through a little bit of what you remember about the last time you, um, the last few times you filed a claim? You had mentioned that you, um, had someone helping before, and I was wondering if that was a V S O or someone else?
Participant 7: Uh, it was a VSO
moderator: Okay. And before you started, um, working with the, the V S O, had you, uh, attempted to do the form on your own, um, prior to reaching out to the V S O or did you begin the process with the V S O?
Participant 7: Yeah, I began the process with the vso, so, um, I put in original claim after I retired, and then I've put in subsequent claims and every time there's always been a V S O involved. So fortunately, um, we're really well taken care of cause they're the pros. But, you know, I've seen the form and it, it just looks like it's self-explanatory.
So there's not anything that's really intimidating. I think the VSOs just know. The right questions to ask to gather the right information. I see. Make it a little bit more thorough for us.
moderator: That's good to know. Yeah. Thank you for explaining that. Um, and have you ever, um, looked at the digital version of the form? No. Good to know. Good to know. Okay. And Henry, have you, um, have your claims mostly, how has your claims experience been? Would you say your claims experience has been, um, difficult, smooth.
Um, has it been successful? How would you describe it?
Participant 7: My first claim, I think, went in about 2007, so that's quite some time ago. And over the years, sort of the, the amount of time and the way that they've done the, the process has changed. So, um, it seemed like the time right now is a lot shorter and more streamlined than it used to be. Oh. But still, uh, the, I'm going through a claim process right now, still a little bit clunky.
And it leaves you with a lot of questions, um, wondering, you know, where things are in the process and, um, why certain things are done. So, for example, I was scheduled for an appointment, uh, to be looked at and they really didn't say what they were gonna be looking at. And even when I went to the, to the clinic, it was a little bit mysterious about what part of the claim they, they were.
Investigating.
moderator: I see. Any other challenges you've run into, um, or things that you wish you knew ahead of time?
Um. No, I think that's it. I think the main thing is that, that you just kept up to date on the status and you can go online. So I know that I can go into, um, into the VA site and check on the status of my claim. Um, but still, I think if the system was a little bit more proactive and letting you know what your status is, I think that would make you feel a little bit more confident.
moderator: I see. That makes sense to me. Okay. Thank you for sharing that, Henry. And so what I'm gonna do now is, um, I'm going to share the prototype with you. So give me one moment. I'm going to drop the, the link to it in the chat and I'm gonna see if you're able to open it up. Okay. 
All right. Let me get the chat open.
There it is. I see it. And I'm gonna go ahead and initiate it. I don't know if I'm gonna lose your video when I do that or not. 
moderator: You might, but it's okay.
Okay. It's opening up. I do see, have a little small window that I can see you in still. Oh, 
moderator: good. Okay, great. It should be loading and it'll, it'll take a few minutes to load. 
Yeah, it's still loading. 
moderator: Okay. So while it's loading, um, Henry, can you, uh, come back to the Zoom and I'm gonna see if we can share your screen.
All right. So you want me to maximize the zoom? 
moderator: Yes. If you come back to the zoom window, you should be able to share your screen so I can see what you're seeing. 
Okay.
All right. I see the share screen. You want me to hit that? Yes, please.
moderator: And does it give you the option to click on the prototype? 
Oh, let's see. I got a lot of things that are in there right now, so. Okay. I've got, I guess, a lot of windows that are open. So I wish I could close some of these out. 
moderator: And if you can't find it, you can just share desktop one, the first option, and you can navigate to it.
All right. All right. All right. I see something that it says Test edit, M H v Donogan. Is that it by 
moderator: chance? I think the title should say sketch.com or it might say Safari or whatever internet browser you use. It could say that, but the file should say, um, or the URL should say sketch.com. 
Yeah, I'm not seeing that, but I'm gonna hit desktop one right now to take care of that part.
Okay.
moderator: Oh, great. I, I see it.
I see it. It looks like it's still loading.
All right, can, I'm gonna, I don't know if you can see my cursor. I do. Can I minimize this? 
moderator: Are you able to refresh so we can see if it will load? Yes.
Oh, weird. Okay. Huh? Okay. Let's see. Let me check the link, make sure I sent you the right one. 
Yeah, let me know if you just want me to start from the beginning again. 
moderator: Okay.
Okay, we got 7%, so I'll give it a minute and then if it still doesn't load, I'll send you the link again. Okay. Thanks for being so patient with all of 
this. Oh, I don't mind.
Yeah, I guess you can see it loading. I can't see the percentage. 
moderator: Yes, I see. I do see 46%. Okay. What do you, what do you see? 
I'm not seeing anything. I think it's because the, um, the chat box, the chat box is probably in the way. Oh, I minimize that. Okay.
And in doing that, I think I just lost you.
moderator: Did you switch off to messages? 
Yeah, I switched off messages. Now it looks like I'm just in that, uh, screen where it's loading the link. 
moderator: Oh, so you are seeing that, but I'm not. Oh, interesting. So I'm gonna have you stop sharing and let's try this again. For some reason I'm seeing your messages, but you're seeing the screen I was on, so,
so I'm gonna, yeah, if you can open the link again
and then we'll, we'll start it from the top.
All right. Can you see that? Uh, not yet. Not yet. All right. I can see, um, it says file for disability compensation, so it looks like it's the
first page of the. 
moderator: Yeah. So, okay, so you are looking at the, the prototype, so that's good. So if we can try to share your screen again, hopefully I'll be able to see what you're seeing. 
All right.
All right. I'm having a little bit of trouble with Zoom. Let's see.
moderator: Yeah. Is it difficult to, this the Zoom window? Can you still 
hear me? Yes. I.
moderator: Okay. I'm starting to see something. Oh, yep, I see it now. Do you see it too? 
I did see it, but I don't see it now. 
moderator: Oh, I see. Okay. For some reason it just disappears when you share your screen. I 
can see it. I think I can. I think I can find it. If I go to Chrome, I think it will be there, or maybe not. I wanna see my chrome windows.
All right, now I can see it. 
moderator: Oh, okay. Great. And can you scroll just to see if we're on the same? I just wanna see if we're on the same. Oh, yep. I see you scrolling. Okay, perfect. Great. Thank you so much, Henry. I know that's a lot of hoops to jump through just to see a 
page, but the, the chat box is right in the middle of the, the screen, so, oh.
Um. It's blocking. So in the, the link site, it's um, lock, like the top. I don't know, it's, oh, I'm looking about the middle third and I wanna try to minimize, um, maybe minimize that chat box. Okay. And see what happens. I might lose you cuz when I did that the last time. 
moderator: You lost the, oh, okay. You lost that. Yeah.
If there's a little My sign or if 
you, alright. I have an option move window to left side of screen. Uh,
and I guess you can't see that, but now I just moved to the left side of screen and it's taking the entire left side. Oh. So I'm gonna play around a little bit more. 
moderator: Okay.
Yeah. And you said if you just click X on it, it's um, 
let me, let me try to close the chat The last time I lost. Um, the video picture of you, but I kept the audio. Okay. That's okay. So I'm gonna do that again now. Everything's 
moderator: okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I can see you, I can hear you. So that's okay with me. 
I think if the system was a little bit more proactive and letting you know what your status is, I think that would make you feel a little bit more confident. 
Participant 7: Can you see the app, 
moderator: the link?
I do. Okay, that's perfect. 
All right. We made it. 
moderator: Thank you. Um, okay, well, to start, I, I guess I wanna just have you imagine that you are here to apply, uh, for compensation. Okay? And I'm just gonna have you look over the pages as though you're here to apply. Um, you can look for information that's relevant to you.
All right. So I see sign in to start, and I'm familiar with the sign-in process because I use my Healthy Vet all the time. So I'm just assuming that the sign-in process would be just like that, and then once I get in, then I would take the next step in terms of starting to fill out the claim form. 
moderator: I see.
Okay. That's good to know. 
So, So I'm gonna, you see my 
moderator: cursor? I do. So you, if you landed here, that's what you would click on, sign in to start or continue your application? 
Participant 7: Yeah, that would, I'm just assuming that would be, you know, the starting point that I wouldn't be able to do anything o anything else. I see that there's some other information here that might be helpful, but for me, I want to get inside and, and get going.
moderator: I see. And when you click sign in, um, and you do sign in, what would you expect to see just after that then?
Participant 7: 
I would expect to see, uh, my, you know, my sign, it would be asking for my sign in credentials. And when I, when I do sign in, I get an auto fill on my computer, so it just fills it in for me. And then I'm on my way.
moderator: Okay. That's good to know. All right, I'm gonna have you scroll back up to the top, Henry, and what I'd like to do is just have you read this first section up to where it says sign in. You can read at your own pace, you can read out loud or to yourself. Um, and just let me know once you've read that top section up until the blue button.
All right. So, uh, everything including the to Toxic Exposure and Pact Act. Yes. Okay.
All right, I got it. Okay. 
moderator: Do you think the information , here could be clearer? Um, you know, did you find anything confusing? 
I. I, I think it works for me because I know a little bit about the PAC Act. I've already put in my claim and I've got a lot of information from the V S O, so everything there makes perfect sense.
Um, I know a lot of veterans that are eligible for benefits but have never, you know, never done it. And, um, it, it might be a little bit more. It's difficult for them to understand and I always advise 'em to get somebody like me or v s o to be able to kinda walk 'em through it. But, uh, let me just make a second run through and see if anything, yeah, I think everything about the, the background of the Pack Act is perfectly clear.
I think the, the idea about getting your claim in, but it gets backdated, um, that can be a little bit confusing. I mean, it makes perfect sense, but, um, you know, I would probably ask if I was somebody brand new, know, repeat that to me. In, in, in other words, just to make sure that I, I get what I think I'm getting.
Can you separate? And it's a really good deal. It's a really good deal. Um, you know, look, I can't suggest a way of making any clear, but, um, you know, if it weren't clear, maybe a way of directing somebody to somebody that can help them if they need more questions. 
moderator: Got it. Can you explain in your own words, like what is your understanding of what it's saying about this date here?
So 
Participant 7: updating, my understanding is that, let's say today if I file a claim and if a decision is made in my favor and I get compensated, um, I'll get compensated all the way back to today. So let's say the decision is made in December. I'll get compensated for that period. June of December. Um, we're saying, talking about August 10th, 2022.
It makes me wonder, all right, I put a claim in in, I think it was February. Does that mean that if that claim is approved under the Pact Act, that'll actually go back to August 10th, 2022? That that would be the first question I ask. 
moderator: Interesting. Is it hard to believe that it would backdate that far or is there another question there?
Participant 7: It just seems to make more sense that, um, I've always known when your claim gets stamped, so you submit it and they usually timestamp it. If you bring it in personally, then that's the date from when your compensation begins. So even if it's like back in the old days, uh, it might take two years for your claim, um, for a finding on your claim, but it would go all the way back to the original date when you filed it.
So it'd be a big chunk of. Of money that would come because two years had elapsed 
moderator: right. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Thank you for explaining that, Henry. Um, I'm gonna have you scroll down to where it says, determine if this form is for you. Okay. And I'll just have you read this section just like before.
Mm-hmm. And I'll have you stop right where it says, have you been granted benefits already? 
Okay. I'll stop there. 
moderator: Okay. So, um, you know, from what you read, what would you say is the gist of that first section? Uh,
Participant 7: you know, as I was reading through, I was just, Considering my own circumstances. And, uh, it confirmed for me that I meet the eligibility criteria. So the criteria pretty clear to me, and, um, I meet it. So it tells me I'm elligible
moderator: And how would you, um, if you had to explain to someone else who's eligible, um, you know, maybe another veteran, how would you explain. You know, who is eligible to apply in your own words.
Participant 7: All right, so, um, you, you had to observe in a active duty capacity or capacity that makes you, uh, eligible for VA benefits and that you have some type of condition that is related. Uh, to your service whether that condition manifested itself while you were on active duty or whether it was something that started later, but it had to do with your service.
So, uh, let's say that you were exposed to burn pits and then you had respiratory problems after you got out. Mm-hmm. There's probably gonna be a service connection between those respiratory problems and your service where you were exposed to those burn pit. 
moderator: I see. Okay. Thank you. Was there any information you read here that you found confusing or unclear?
No. 
Participant 7: Uh, I didn't really finish all the way down to have you been granted benefits? So, um, The part where it says you'll need to file a supplemental claim instead of this form. I didn't read that part. 
moderator: Okay. I'll have you go ahead and read that section.
Participant 7: So that makes sense to me. And in fact, my claim is a, um, I think it's a supplemental claim so it goes back and looks at previous claim, but it also added on some new things that, uh, conditions that I have now that fall under the PACT Act 
moderator: I see. And was the original claim denied? 
Uh, some of the things that I claimed were denied, yes, but not all 
Participant 7: of them.
moderator: I see. Okay. Okay. Um, is there any information you feel, um, is missing or could be helpful to veterans going through this process in this section? 
Participant 7: So, No, just again, I think a, a reference to if, if you need additional assistance, this is where you can go. Got it. So, you know, I, I worry about veterans. If you have P T S D or TMI, for example, um, you know, you have cognitive issues.
Uh, some people have short attention spans and just, you know, can't quite get through it. Um, you know, where can those people go? I see. So, uh, I know for me in the past I have PTSD. Sometimes with, with forms, um, you can get a, you can feel a little bit overwhelmed and say, you know, this is just too much for me to deal with right now.
moderator: I see.
Do you think a lot of veterans might struggle with that and, and that might affect how they go through the entire form or whether they ask for help?
Participant 7: I think, I think a lot of veterans I know, um, It would be difficult for them to cope. Anything that for them would be complex and, you know, this form or anything else, maybe like trying to apply for a mortgage or something like that. That their cognitive ability and their ability to focus is very limited.
And we have so many veterans that are like that, that have PTSD and TMI. Uh, fortunately for me, my, you know, my condition has. As resolved or healed quite a bit. So I don't have those kind of difficulties, but um, I experienced them in the past. 
moderator: I see, I see. Okay. Thank you for explaining that to me. That gives me some background and some insight, and I'm glad to hear that.
Um, so after you read this section, um, Henry, what do you think you would do 
Participant 7: next?
So, um, I know that I'm eligible. And, uh, I think in my case it would be file a supplemental claim. And so, uh, I think most likely thing I would do, if you can see my cursor. Mm-hmm. Um, I would hit that link there. I still haven't logged in yet, but uh, you know, that would get me to where I think I need to go.
moderator: I see. That's good to know. Did you notice the yellow alert there that says, have you been granted benefits already? 
Participant 7: Uh, I did. Now, I mean, I saw the yellow band, but I was trying to get through this part and understand it. So, um, I did see it. I just didn't really get there to read it yet. Not a problem. Would you, I understand.
moderator: Would you expect that to, um, That information in there to be relevant to you? 
Participant 7: Yeah, because I'm already rated. I'm 90%, so I was disabled, so I have benefits that have been granted to me. 
moderator: Okay. I'm gonna have you open that 
I would answer yes. 
moderator: I see. So I'm gonna have you, um, open that alert in the, uh, in the yellow banner.
All right, it's open now,
moderator: and I'll just have you read that and let me know what you think.
All right. That all makes sense. Nothing confusing for me about that. 
moderator: And I ask so far from what you've read, how useful do you think this information is? If you had to rate it on a scale from one to 10, um, one is not at all useful and 10 is, you know, extremely useful, where would you place this for you personally?
I'd say about a nine. Okay.
moderator: Okay, Henry, I'm gonna have you go ahead and read section two. Um, decide how you want to apply.
All right. So I see the option of contacting A V S O. So we were talking about that earlier.
moderator: Do you think that's in the right place?
Um, I would say that the earlier you can show that option, the better because. You don't know at what point where a veteran might bail out on you. So, um, for me it works here because I know that I would've worked my way down there. But, uh, I was thinking about it when we were in the upper part and you were asking me some questions.
moderator: Okay, that makes sense. I understand that. Let's see. Okay, I'll have you go on to section three.
God bless.
Yeah, I'm thinking about this part here and I'm continuing to read down, 
moderator: okay, why did that, why did that first part that that sentence grab your attention? 
Because it, it's a little bit vague. Um, claims can be pretty complex with multiple conditions and uh, it sometimes takes us a lot of work to find documentation.
So on the one hand, they say that they're gonna review your medical records. On the other hand, they say that will help your case a lot if you get in there and, and kind of drill down and find some of the information. So for me, for example, um, I started having urinary problems back in 2004. Mm-hmm. And I remember when I was first seen, For it.
And if I get into my records, um, I know that I could find that doctor's note and be able to provide it, but to be able to do that for every, all the different conditions that are involved, I kind of want the VA to be more thorough. And if it's in there, they're gonna figure out a way to find it. Maybe they can use AI.
Interesting. You go and get it. 
moderator: Okay, I see. So specifically talking about the VA medical records, is that where you're looking? Right, 
Participant 7: right. 
moderator: Okay. So, you know, if it's in the VA's possession, you're saying that they should be able to surface that for, for on your behalf, 
right. I, so I was, I was on active duty for 34 years, so you can imagine my medical record, it was right, it was two folders that were pretty thick.
Wow. And, um, those records were all turned over to the VA when I retired. And I have a, a copy of all those. But, um, it would be so much more helpful for a veteran if. They were able to search those records and using, you know, technology of today to be able to, to get in there and find something, rather than having the veteran find the records, go through all that stuff, make a copy of it, and then provide it to the va.
It could be very time consuming and may be a little frustrating. 
moderator: I see. No, that makes complete sense. Anything else stick out to you in this section, Henry?
So private medical records and hospital reports. Um, so for me, I get my healthcare from two systems. One is the VA and the other one is tricare, which is the military system that I continue to be a part of now that I'm retired. Okay, so, um, you know, I would like to think that the VA can access all those records.
So sometime when I'm seen today, I'll go to Tricare and that will be, let's say, at the Naval Hospital here on base. Um, I wanna make sure that if I'm seeN and it's related to a condition that either is in my claim. Or I've already been rated for that. They would, they would go there and see that. Oh, I see.
Make sense? 
moderator: That makes complete sense. Okay. And that tho all of the doctors you're seeing are in the VA system. Am I correct? Did I understand that correctly? Yes. 
So all my active duty documents, the 34 years I was in, all the hard copies of those medical records, um, are in the possession of the va. And then I've been retired now since 2007.
So, uh, you know, there's a period of time when I've been seen, been treated. I've gotten therapy and there's records of those, but some of that was done within the VA system and some of that was inside the military medical system, tricare, which is my, uh, medical insurance that I get as part of my retirement benefits.
moderator: I see. Okay. Thank you for helping me understand that. Okay. Let's see. Did you, um, see the section that says, uh, if you apply here online, we'll also include in your application the necessary forms, uh, we'll need if you're claiming P T S D, um, private medical records. Um, and there's a list there.
I see that and it says, uh, authorization to request private medical records. I'm just wondering, so is that just if it's related to PTSD or is it private medical records related to any condition? So, for example, I have, um, A tumor right now that they think is related to my service, um, overseas. So that's not PTs d but that's something that, um, is being addressed through tricare.
Not, you know, the VA is not gonna take that tumor out. It's gonna be Tricare. Mm-hmm. But it's related to a condition that I incurred, uh, while I was on active duty. 
moderator: Oh wow. Okay. Okay. I see. So the, okay, I understand the question is it's not, it seems like it's not clear here whether you are authorizing medical records for, for all of it.
Okay.
All right. As I'm reading through it again, number one, um, we'll include the application. Number one, if you're claiming post-traumatic stress disorder number two. You're authorizing us to request private medical records, so reading it a second time, it's not confusing and I see that it's separate and distinct.
Okay. 
moderator: Okay. But thank you for calling it out. Might be something someone else mentions as well. Okay. I think we're at our last section. Or actually before we continue, I wanted you, I wanted to get your, um, rating there. So if you had to rate that section there that you read one to 10 for usefulness, for you personally, where would you place it?
Talking 
Participant 7: about one to 10? 
moderator: Yes. So one is not at all useful? 
Yes. I would say about an eight. Okay. And if I'd read through it the first time slowly rather than trying to scan it, um, you know, it might have been a 10, 
moderator: but that, that's good to know because that's what people do in real time. Right. We skim. Not a problem.
Okay. I'm gonna have you go on to section four.
All right. Do you mind if I just take about a 32nd break? 
moderator: No, I don't at all. Please do. 
I've been drinking coffee and I need to do something about that. Okay. 
moderator: I'll be right there. Okay.
All right, thank you. Yeah, I didn't, you probably didn't want me wiggling in my chair. 
moderator: No, no. I want you, I want you to take care of it. 
Okay.
All right. Do you want me to read section four? Uh, yes. Okay.
All right. Everything that I read there is. Totally consistent with my experience, what I'd learned when I was going through the experience of putting in my supplemental claim here earlier this year. So, um, in my case, we, we, uh, made our intent to file and then, I don't know, it was probably about six weeks later, we actually put in the supplemental claim knowing that I had up to a year to do that.
And uh, now we're on the sort of later end, it says here, three to four months. I think we're beyond four months, but there has been progress. So I've been called in for appointments and that kind of thing. So, um, I know that my claim is active right now. 
moderator: I see. How do you feel about us putting this timeframe there, the three to four months?
Participant 7: I think it's good. I don't think it's, it's deceptive. Uh, I would just go back, have the VA go back because there's so many different regions. I'm in the San Diego region, I. And, uh, you know, to see whether that's really consistent with what's ac the veterans are actually experiencing. If they're not, then I would, I would revise it and I would be maybe, you know, more conservative.
Don't get the veterans hopes up. Um, If it, you know, more likely gonna be longer, uh, because a lot of your veterans, they, they get agitated and frustrated, really easy to begin with. So even things like, you know, you're calling in on the VA line to right, try to get an appointment and you get put on hold for 20 or 25 minutes.
Some veteran, because of their condition, they're, you know, they're already pretty agitated. So I would say just make sure that that three to four months is consistent with what veterans are actually experiencing throughout the country. 
moderator: I see. Would you say it's better to have no estimate than a wrong one or inaccurate one?
Participant 7: No, I think it's better to, to give them, you know, Give them an idea. Okay. Because like I said, if it were for me, uh, as I said earlier, my experience back in 2007 was, uh, having to wait a couple years. Mm-hmm. That, that, that was pretty average. So, uh, you know, I'd say just do the best you can to give a ballpark window.
I think that's better than not giving them anything at all. 
moderator: That makes sense. Did anything else stick out to you in this section?
Participant 7: It just says that the VA is gonna be proactive in, reaching out by phone or letter if anything else is needed. So, yeah, I think everything here is is good. Like I said, it's consistent and it's not confusing at all. 
moderator: That's good to know. Okay. Um, any other words, Henry, about things that maybe you wish you knew before you started the claim process?
You know, I think the main thing is to get veterans to understand that they are eligible and that there's a process and how the process works. I think that, you know, just in the last. Two days. Um, I met a veteran who was definitely eligible but hadn't filed, didn't know how to file. So I would say anything that is, is in the form of an outreach to veterans.
I think veteran service officers try to do some of that, but, uh, try to get your arms around some people who, um, are eligible and actually need. The medical care and need the compensation and, uh, bring them into the system. 
moderator: I see. Do you think the VA is doing its due diligence when it comes to that? What you said, getting their arms around more people?
I think that the VA is in San Diego was really trying. They're very veteran oriented. Everybody that you meet that's been hired is doing. They're very best to do all they can to help veterans. That's the way I come away feeling every time I have, um, an engagement with a VA here. 
moderator: I see. Okay. I'm going to have you scroll down, Henry, and um, I'm gonna have you click on start.
And again, this is a Yeah, right there. And again, this is a prototype, so you won't actually have to enter any real information, but I'm gonna, all right. That 
opened up, 
moderator: right? So I'm gonna have you click yes and I'm gonna have you imagine that you are active and click yes and continue. Okay.
All right. And I'll have you read this and I wanna know if the, what the question is clear here,
so I would probably come back and ask a clarifying question. Mm-hmm. Because for me, when I. Stop working. I had leave what we call terminal leave. Do you know that term? 
moderator: No. I'm, I'm not familiar. So, 
you know, in the military we call leave, but for civilians it's vacation and you accrue so much of that when you're getting ready to leave the service.
Um, if you have leave, that's accrued. Then, um, you can use that as terminal leave. So let's say you've got 60 days that's on the books and your contract ends on the 31st of December. You can go home two months earlier. So that's sort of a, a separation, but you don't get your DD two 14 until the last day of your contract or your retirement date.
So here I would ask, you know, kind of scratching my head and saying, okay, in my case, what would it have been? Would it have been the last day that I showed up for work before I went home and waited for my terminal leave to expire? And then I got my, uh, DD214 
moderator: I see. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah, I, I had not thought about it that way.
Okay. Yeah. Very helpful. Um, I'll have you click continue one more time
and then I'll, this will be the last page I have you read. 
All right. Do you want me to start reading? Uh, yes. Three, two.
Okay. I've read down to here and it all makes sense. I'm gonna continue reading. 
moderator: Uh, yes. Uh, if you've seen the alert there, you can read that as well. Yeah, 
that's what I'm reading now.
All right. That all makes sense. And I do know active duty, uh, folks who are actually going through this process. And I think that they get briefed as part of their transition out of the service. They get some type of information that's similar to this, and I know that they're, there's a, there is a few. I know they're taking advantage of it.
No. 
moderator: Do you think there would be anything here that would be confusing for someone going through this process when you Yeah, just of anything you read here. Or that they would need to know? No, I would 
just say again, if, if there is anything that's confusing that it says here that there's someplace that they can go to get more help.
moderator: Um, Henry, can I have you click the back button?
Let's see. Okay, so yeah, I, I did wanna, um, understand a little bit more. Um, you were explaining to me the different dates that you might put in, um, you know, either the date, um, That you leave, that you actually leave and go home, um, you know, or the date that you get your DD for your DD two 14, um, you know, what would you do here?
Would you put a date or would you go and ask for help? What do you think you would do? 
What I think I would do is put in the date that, uh, I would just say that separation means the date that I went home, that I stopped working. And, uh, that I went home. So that would be the date that I put in. 
moderator: Okay. So if, um, so if you had that, um, terminal, um, sort of, um, terminal leave.
Terminal leave, right? It would be the date that you start terminal leave.
So it would be the day that I start, start terminal leave. It would not be the date where I was actually discharged. So technically while on terminal leave, you could get called back and they could. You know, they could say, you know, we've got a contingency and we need you, and you've gotta go, oh, and you would be obliged to go.
So you're still on active duty. You're just home because you, you're entitled to that vacation time that you didn't use, and you're using that up before. Your, um, actual separation from active duty or retirement. So the word separate is the thing that causes me confusion to understand what exactly the definition of separate is.
moderator: Okay. Okay. I see. 
So when I, when I separated to go on terminal leave, I was not separated from active duty. Oh, okay. I was still on active duty, but my place of duty was at home. It was not at my workplace doing the job that I had been 
moderator: doing. I see. Okay. So that's the distinguishing factor. Okay. Thank you for helping me understand that Henry.
Henry, from what you've seen so far, how, how likely or or unlikely would you be to try and do the form digitally on your own?
I would be very likely. It, it looks pretty simple and pretty streamlined, and I would prefer to do that than to, to do, uh, you know, just regular paper forms. 
moderator: So. And do you think you would, um, ask for the support of a VSO, um, from the beginning or at any point? 
Yeah, I probably would. It just, my experience has been so positive because they have so much accumulated experience.
And I can give you a quick example. When I was first retired and I was with the V S O, And we were going through the claim process. The V S O looked at my service, what my job was, where I was at, and he understood many of the occupational hazards. So he was asking me, I would call him leading questions and for example, he said, by the way, do your ears ring?
I said, no, my ears don't ring. And he looked at me. He was kind of surprised because he knew my service and he knew from other veterans that very few of them who did what I did. Didn't have tinnitus. Mm. So he said, what I want you to do is go home. I want you to sit in the quietest room in your house, turn the lights off, sit there for five minutes, and focus in on your ears and see if your ears are ringing.
And I did that, and sure enough, my ears ring all the time. I've just got so used to it that I don't notice it. Okay. So, you know, talking with you before saying this, I, you know, I wouldn't notice my ears ringing, but now that I'm thinking about it, yeah, my ears ring. They, they ring a hundred percent of the time.
So that's where I think A V S O can really be helpful, right. Uh, that they can catch a lot of things that you wouldn't even think of to, to get in there. 
moderator: I. That makes sense. Well, thank you so much Henry. I really appreciate, you know, all of your help. Um, your feedback today was, you know, just very helpful for our team.
Um, I just wanted to say that Perian is gonna be reaching out to you about compensation. If you do know other veterans who are as opinionated as you are and you know, um, can help us, you know, with this, feel free to refer them. Um, and you know, I hope you enjoy the rest of your, your day on the West Coast.
All right. I enjoyed talking to you and kind of fun to be talking to somebody in New York City. I don't know where Lydia and Nicole are, but um, anyway, best wishes from San Diego. 
moderator: Thank you again. Take care.
