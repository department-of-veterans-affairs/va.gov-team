Session 5
moderator: Did you hear that alert? I did. Okay, perfect. So yes, we have started recording. Um, if any point we need to let, we need to stop recording, just let me know. This is the part, um, Aubrey, where I'm gonna try and share this prototype with you. And I will be here to, you know, walk you through it. It is a little bit slow loading, so just wanna let you know that in advance, but hopefully we can get it working without too many, um, hiccups.
So I'm gonna drop it in the chat and I'm gonna see if you can see that and open it on your phone. 
Participant 5: I did see it briefly, but I am not seeing it now. Okay. Now it did. Okay. You want me to open this link, correct? Yes,
it's loading. 
moderator: Okay. So while it's loading, um, well actually let's wait for it to load so you can see what it looks like. Ok. We're 
Participant 5: 40, 50% there. Ok.
Okay. It's open. 
moderator: All right, so now I'm gonna have you come back to the Zoom call and see if we can share your screen so I can see what you're seeing. 
Participant 5: Okay. Hang with me. Yeah, take your time.
moderator: I'm back. Wonderful. So you should have on your screen at the bottom, uh, a button that says share screen. Or you might see three dots that that helps you, uh, open the menu.
Okay,
wonderful. Okay. And so now I think if you are able to, let's see, I think, is it still, it might still be loading. Okay. If you're able to go back to the prototype. I should be able to see it on your screen. 
Participant 5: Okay. How will I get there? Let's 
moderator: see. Okay. So yeah, if you can go back to the internet. Oh, perfect. There we are.
That's perfect. All right, so great. So now that you, and you can see the prototype. Okay. Yes, ma'am. Great. All right. So we're ready to jump in. Um, so the first thing I'll, I'll kind of have you do, um, Aubrey, is just kind of look over the page. Um, I want you to kind of get a first glance at this page. So I'll have you scroll through and I'd like you to tell me after you scroll to the bottom, what's the first thing you would do on this page?
Participant 5: I would sign in.
moderator: You would sign in. And what would you hope to, um, gain by signing in, or what are your expectations after you would sign in? Well, 
Participant 5: I was already preempted to determine if this form is for me, then I would hope that the form would be there and I would be able to start, uh, filling it out. 
moderator: I see. And um, and you know, re I wanted to ask um, a little bit, cuz you had mentioned before that you, um, had gotten information about toxic exposure and PAC Act.
Is that correct? Correct. Okay. And have you taken steps to, um, file a claim? Um, A, according to the new law in place, I 
Participant 5: have not yet. 
moderator: Okay. Um, and, and were you interested in doing so? 
Participant 5: Um, um, about 90% certain that Yes, I will. Okay. 
moderator: Do you mind sharing, what is that 10%? You said 90%. 
Participant 5: Well, I'm just not totally clear on it.
There's an assortment of information out there, and of course, as you know, if you turn on the tv, you're bombarded with commercials where you can file on it. I haven't been diagnosed with something pertaining to the PAC Act as we speak, but I think that I'm a candidate for some of the conditions that fall under the deck.
So I don't have that 100% certainty yet. If, if I already had some of the presumptive conditions, then I would've already filed a claim under it. 
moderator: I see, I see. And have you ever filed a claim in the past? Yes. Okay. How did you find the process?
Participant 5: I'm, I'm pondering I haven't gone to sleep or anything pondering 
moderator: No, that's fine.
Participant 5: The process for me, it was okay because I'm somewhat tech savvy. I'm, I'm, I'm not a techie, but, but I have a good bit of experience with computers and with the internet, so for me, I was able to navigate my way through it. Plus I had the assistance at times of a vs o, but not all the time. I have done some stuff on my own and actually I found it a little bit confusing, some part of it.
And if you wanna know the part of it, I'll be happy to elaborate. Yes, I would. So I filed a, a claim. Uh, off of an intent to file, and I had several conditions that I was gonna file on the initial claim, but I wasn't able to list them all on the initial claim. And it, it being the website or the VA page that I was on, it, it brought me to a halt where I couldn't add anymore to it.
And I called 800 number about it, and the person that I spoke to who I've spoken to different people many times, and some of them know little and some of them know a lot, but that person told me that as long as I filed. Finished my filing that month that it should lump back to the intent to file date.
To be a little bit more specific, my intent to file was done in April and I was doing, I initiated the claim in October, cuz as you're probably aware, you have one year from the date of the intent file to initiate claim, and then it's retro back to the date of the intent file. I got cut off on the VA website from being able to add any additional claims to it, and I called the VA help desk and they said, well, as long as you go ahead and add your claim in a short, your other claims, in a short period of time, they should lump together with that claim.
That gave me the filling of a little bit of cushion as far as getting them done. I finished completing those claims in the month of October. And it did not work out like I was told that it would. They actually had a, uh, a separate claim date on them, whereas the only two that I was able to get in initially went back to my intent file date as of April.
The other ones were October the 26th, which was a couple of weeks after I began that process. In October. So that was kind of confusing to me and disappointing to me, particularly when some of those claims were, um, awarded later on because the effective date was October 26th rather than 
moderator: Right. Okay. Yes, I definitely, I definitely see how that was disappointing.
Um, yeah, thank you for sharing that, that helps us understand what's going on behind the scenes. I appreciate that. Um, okay, so I'm, I'm gonna have us jump into the form here. So you let me know what you would first do here. I'm gonna have you scroll back up to the top, and I just want you to read this first section up to where it says, sign in.
And you can read out loud or to yourself, it doesn't matter, read at your own pace. But I kind of just want you to keep in mind your situation and how, what parts of this might be relevant to, to you. Um, and, um, you know, feel free to stop if any questions come to mind and ask them. And then just let me know when you're finished reading.
Participant 5: File for disability compensation with VA form 21 dash 5 26 E Z equal to VA form 21 dash 5 26 E z, application for disability compensation and related compensation benefits. Use this form to file a new claim or claim for increased disability compensation or toxic exposure and and I won't bore you with reading that out loud.
Likely benefit your benefit, sign in to start or continue your application. And you want me to stop there? Ok. 
moderator: Alright. Ok. So yeah, I'm wondering, um, you know, as you were reading that, did anything, um, come up that was confusing or unclear? No, not 
Participant 5: really. 
moderator: No. Can I ask you, if you were to have to rate this section.
On a scale from one to 10, one being, um, you know, not at all useful and 10 being extremely useful, how useful do you think this, this portion of the form is, this information here? Uh, I'll go with a 10. Uh,
that's good to know. Is there any information that you would say is, is missing that you would wanna know before you know? He Yeah. Any information that you would say is missing that you would wanna see here?
Participant 5: Um, as we speak. I don't see anything that, uh, that strikes me as missing.
moderator: And one question I forgot to ask you earlier, Aubrey, was, um, have you, were you, um, were your claims, um, accepted and were you awarded your compensation? 
Participant 5: Some of them, yes. 
moderator: Okay. Some of them. Okay. That's good to know. All right, I'm gonna have us head on to. Um, or actually one last question I had was, you know, if you, you know, had to explain it to someone else, how would you explain who qualifies, um, you know, for benefits under the PACT Act, in your own 
Participant 5: words?
Well, I would probably direct them to, um, To Google University or to the VA website to get clarification on that because I wouldn't feel like I would be the know all, tell all source of it, and I would rely on my limited information upon them to file a claim that could affect them and their family. 
moderator: That makes sense to me.
When you were reading, uh, this info about PTAC specifically, was anything here surprising?
Participant 5: Mm. The one thing that was surprising to me was if this applies to you, we encourage you to file for benefits now, if you do so before August 10th, 2023 and we grant your application will likely backdate your benefits to the date bill signing because. 
My limited understanding was that you had two years from the date of the passage of the, uh, PACT Act
moderator: I see. And where did you get the, that information? Was it from the, you had mentioned some commercials. Is that mainly where you're learning about Pac Jack or somewhere else? 
Participant 5: Um, that, that's not where I'm learning about them. Just from, uh, different forums that I've been on that have had information about it and I'm not crystal clear on it, and that's why I wouldn't attempt to convince someone that I was able to give them a thorough understanding.
moderator: I see. That makes complete sense. Um, okay, Aubrey, I'm gonna have you scroll down a bit. Uh, exactly right, yes. Right there. Wanna ask, see, in the beginning to this section, what would you wanna click on first, if anything? 
Participant 5: I'd click on "determine if this form is for you." 
moderator: And what kind of information would you expect to see there?
Uh, 
Participant 5: uh, I expect to see enough information to make, allow me to make an informed decision if the form was indeed removed. 
moderator: Okay. I'm gonna have you go ahead and click on that section.
Okay. And then just like before, I'm gonna have you read this, um, in any way you'd like. Um, feel free to stop if there's anything you wanna comment on and just let me know when you're finished reading it. 
Participant 5: Okay.
moderator: Okay. And so just like I ask before, I'm wondering again how useful you found this on a scale from one to 10. 
Participant 5: I would give it a 10.
moderator: And as you were reading, was anything, um, surprising or did any of the information stick out to you? 
Participant 5: No, it was pretty straightforward and to the point.
moderator: And I guess again, I'm wanting to understand, if you had to summarize this in your own words, what would you say? Um, or actually I'll ask, what are the most important pieces of information here would you say? 
Participant 5: That I've read already? Well, I'd love to open the, have you been granted benefits already?
Portion of it, but we're probably not to that yet.
I mean, it, it's all pertinent. So, I mean, it, it synergistically fits together.
Thank you. 
moderator: Is there anything you saw that you thought, this isn't pertinent for me right now. 
Participant 5: No. Um, I, I,
this is specifically about the Pact Act but it has the same type verbiage that you would find, uh, filing for any claim for disability benefits. So it's a blanket statement that applies to, I don't see anything separating. It specifically for the PACT Act, uh, from what you would. The criteria that you would need where it says at least one of these must be true, that would apply to any type claim.
I see. Whether PACT, or whether it's just a brand new claim. 
moderator: I see. Okay. And that makes sense. Um, can I ask in your own words, how would you de uh, how would you or what's your understanding of a supplemental claim? 
Participant 5: Supplemental claim is something that you file. After you've already filed a claim and you, you have additional documentation that would be pertinent to the claim.
A claim that's already been denied. 
moderator: Okay. And I'm gonna have you open that up yellow alert that you were, uh, talking about and you can read that too.
 Is that the information you were expecting to 
see there?
Participant 5: I wasn't totally sure what I was gonna see there, but, um, there is some additional information there that I wasn't aware of, and that is, uh, If you're filing a claim because your condition has worsened or a claim for increase, I wasn't aware how you did that because I haven't done that before.
But I may do that in the future because I do have a condition that has worsened, so that gives some clarity to me. 
moderator: I see. Okay. So you were aware of supplemental claim before, uh, but were you, but you were not aware of a claim for increase. Is that correct? 
Participant 5: I wasn't aware how you did the claim for Increase.
Wasn't aware. The supplemental process. 
moderator: Got it . I understand now. Okay. Thank you for explaining that. Okay. I'm gonna have you go onto section two. 
Participant 5: Okay. I'm gonna reposition myself. Oh this old Alabama sun is heating up. 
moderator: It looks nice and bright. 
Participant 5: It's definitely bright.
Okay. 
moderator: Mm-hmm. If you scroll down. Yeah. 
Participant 5: Perfect.
Okay. Where were we on under two? 
moderator: Yes, exactly. 
You're right there.
Participant 5: Okay. I did it. 
moderator: Okay. Uh, was anything confusing or unclear here? 
Participant 5: No, not at all. 
moderator: Good to know. And again, I wanna have you rate this from one to 10 on a, uh, scale of usefulness. 
Participant 5: I'd give it a 10.
moderator: And can I ask, when you, um, you mentioned you were, you had worked with the vs uh, VSO a little bit. Um, was that something you, you sought yourself or did someone suggest you work with the VSO? How did that come about? 
Participant 5: That's a good question. I'm gonna have to, um, Think about it for a few minutes. I someone suggested it, um,
so that's your answer. Okay. 
moderator: You suggested it. Okay. And, um, I wanted to ask, before you had worked with the vs o, had you already, um, started the claim yourself or did you start the claim with a VSO? 
Participant 5: I started a claim back in 1972 when I was discharged from active duty service with Honorable duty. And to my recollection, I don't even know if VSOs existed at that time.
I don't remember having any, anyone help me. Um, I see there was some kind of minimum assistance, but I didn't. Work with the claim process until, uh, three or four years ago from that time. So there's a gap there of probably, uh, almost, almost 60 years. That's a pretty big gap. Yes. 
moderator: Yes. And so the, the three or four years ago when you, um, were going through the claim process, did you start it by yourself?
Participant 5: No, I started with a V S O. 
moderator: Okay. You started with the VSO okay. I understand. Okay, thank you. Um, okay. I'm gonna have you go on to section three
and we'll, we'll do the same thing as before.
Participant 5: Okay. I like it. Uh, it's very concise and uh, it's very detailed to the point. 
moderator: No. Was anything here unclear, confusing, could be improved? 
Participant 5: You know, I know that you told me at the beginning of the call that you welcome criticism and I'm the right guy.
Oh, uh, I apologize for that. I've been looking hard. 
moderator: No. I mean, you know, it's great. You know, either way we, we, we love to hear praise, we love to hear criticism. We'll take it, we'll take it all. That's fine. Okay. And can you explain for me, um, Aubrey, you know, what is your understanding of this information
you read about how disability compensation is determined by the va?
Participant 5: My understanding echoes what you've got in your statement there. I mean, that is my understanding. You know, it's a clear, concise explanation there. Um, so I mean, to me that just sums it up so that my understanding's, just what I just read there. 
moderator: And that's good to know. Thank you. I'm gonna continue being redundant, but I, I still like to hear you say it again.
Um, and let's see. Okay. And can I ask, you know, what would you say is the most, if someone had to, you know, take away a piece of information here, what would you say is the most important piece of information in this section? 
Participant 5: Well, uh, it would be hard to single out anything but, um, the supporting statements, uh, that's good information to know that someone may not know if they didn't have some insight into the process, how it worked.
It's hard to separate. That from the private medical records and hospital reports and the VA medical records and hospital records. But that's a, that's a good thing for a layperson to grasp and understand. It's something could easily be missed.
moderator: I did wanna ask you, Aubrey, did you notice the alert at the bottom there?
It says, are you currently on active duty as a service member?
Oh, yeah. I might not have been able to hear you. Okay, perfect. Okay. All right. Just wanted to make sure. Okay. I'm gonna have you move on, and before you click that last section, I wanted to ask when you see that, what are you expecting to be in that section? 
Participant 5: Are you currently on active duty as a service member?
moderator: Oh, I meant apply just 
Participant 5: underneath am I expecting, I would expect to, uh, see some detailed information about how to apply.
moderator: And one last question I forgot, um, Aubrey, was, was there anything you thought was, um, redundant or, um, not relevant in that last section? You know, something that people might not need to know right then? Not at all.
And so I'm gonna go and have you, um, yeah, you can go ahead and expand that last section and we'll run through the same exercise. 
Participant 5: Okay.
Okay, I'm done. 
moderator: Okay. And I was wondering here again, anything confusing, unclear, anything that we need to, um, make 
Participant 5: better?
I think you've done a good job.
Okay. So I don't see anything. Okay. And is this the kind 
moderator: of information you were expecting? Anything? Yeah.
Participant 5: Uh,
I would think that it could be a little bit clearer on, uh, submitting documentation, uh, rather than saying you'll have up to one year after you submit your claim to submit additional documents. While I wouldn't take that statement out, uh, closer to telling how to submit the claim initially, there. I would think that it would be helpful to add a statement that, uh, go ahead and submit any medical record or other informations, uh, statements to support your claim from family members or people that you serve with.
Uh, I would think that that would be a good thing to bring a little bit more clarity to. 
moderator: And, and just to help me understand, I remember earlier you were reading all the different types of, um, you know, the types of supporting evidence, but you're saying here it should, um, it should clarify, um, when and how to attach those to your claim.
Is that correct? 
Participant 5: Yeah, I would like to see that if I were a layperson and I was going in there and I was trying to navigate myself through the system. Um, it says after you submit your claim here, you'll see a confirmation page. We won't send you another notification or receipt, but, um, I would think something like.
At this time or when you submit your claim, while you will have a year, which it does mention the year at the bottom of this section there, I would think that it wouldn't hurt anything to tell someone to send any sent, submit any kind of, uh, medical records or, um, buddy statements or, um, letters from your doctor.
Um, the other things that would go along with it. 
moderator: I see. And do you think a timeframe is important? Instead of saying maybe within a year, you know, you have , you have time to submit all of that within a year, but maybe giving a different timeframe or how, how would you change it? 
Participant 5: Well, I would leave the year part on there because they do have a year to do it.
But you know, if. Me as a veteran or anybody else submits a claim, they don't want to lolly gag around and wait 11 months to add something. Their claim may have already got assigned to a rater at that time. Uh, it, it may have moved from first base to third base. It may be close to completion, and you add something.
To it at that point, you're just gonna start the cycle all over again and it's long enough as it is. So, uh, the sooner that someone could submit anything that they have to add to it, then they're gonna be expediting their claim rather than. Thinking they've got a year to do it, even though they do have a year to do it.
I, I'd like to get mine done a whole lot earlier. I've got stuff pending since, uh, 2021, so it's a, I see. That's an, as a veteran, we need every, everything that we can get to help speed it along. 
I
moderator: see. That makes complete sense to me. Thank you for explaining that. You seem to have a lot of knowledge of what goes on behind the scenes with the claims, and I'm wondering, um, what sources kind of help you get that understanding, wondering, uh, if we can share those with other veterans.
Participant 5: They're different forums from different websites and, Hey, I'm a participant, so. Something that affects me and my family and uh, then I'm all about knowing what it is. Knowledge is power. 
moderator: I agree. And are those forms, do you remember if they're, um, cuz I, I see some of the forms on Reddit. I see certain blogs.
So I'm wondering if, if you've all, if you tap into those or any specific ones, and it's okay if you don't remember, but just wondering, 
Participant 5: I've been on Reddit, um, I've been on Facebook, um, I've been on other websites. Um, so I've, I've searched around and. Looked around.
moderator: Well, thank you for sharing that. Yeah, that's helpful for us because, um, you know, of course we're invested in, in making sure people have an understanding of what's going on behind the scenes as well. I did wanna ask specifically about this portion here that says, it usually takes about three to four months for us to make a decision on your claim, but it could take longer.
Um, did you have any thoughts when you read that? 
Participant 5: Sure. Uh, it probably should say, but it definitely will take longer.
Hey, I'm kind of kidding. Kinda not. Uh, I mean, I, I don't know. that usually takes three to four months to make a decision. They're. mitigating circumstances that play a factor in that: covid situation played a factor in that. The, uh, the pact act, the 400 and something claim 400 and something thousand claims that have been submitted since it was, uh, uh, signed into law with others that are gonna be forthcoming with the VA being shorted short on help.
Uh, there is some. Uh, talk of artificial intelligence, speeding the process along and making decisions on the claims semi instantaneously. Of course, you're probably already aware of that. 
moderator: Interesting. I, I've heard whispers, but I'm not too aware. How do you feel about that? Uh, you know, that changing the process potentially.
Participant 5: Well, I feel like any veteran that's a recipient that has filed a claim would feel that if it's, uh, gonna expedite the process, then bring it on. Um, hopefully it would be, uh, seamlessly without errors. Um, uh, and you know, that would be a concern. 
moderator: I see. Okay. Yep, that makes complete sense. I wanna, speaking of, how, claims are decided and the speed at which they're decided, I'm wondering, you know, do you feel that the, the VA is asking for a reasonable amount of documentation, um, for the claims?
Participant 5: Well, the more documentation there is, the more evidence, the documentation is evidence, and the more evidence there is in any kind of a, a process where a decision is involved, then it's just gonna tip the scales and in the favor of the evidence. So, hey, I believe in the evidence system. I don't think everybody that's a veteran deserves some compensation because they were a veteran.
But hey, if there's evidence, uh, submit it. Let it weigh in the decision and let the process play itself out. And, you know, hopefully, uh, the raters that make the decision will be competent. Um, I don't mind telling you in my journey through the VA claims process, uh, I've had question marks about it, but that's going down a different rabbit hole than what this meeting's about here.
moderator: Can you, um, highlight for me just a few of those questions, 
Participant 5: questions, per se? 
moderator: Um, yes. About the process, um, as you were going through it.
Well, 
Participant 5: so I, I, I don't know that it pertains, but I don't mind expounding, uh, I mean, I had a, I had a c and p exam for a condition. And are you familiar with the c and p exams? I am, yes. I had a medical opinion that was issued in my favor. And a D P Q that was filled out and I saw the documentation on it in my C file and for some reason, which would seem to some as if the VA was looking for a reason to deny a claim, they got another medical opinion without an in-person exam.
And I don't know why they did, but it seemed like they might have got what they wanted because that other medical opinion, it didn't take into consideration the medical articles that were submitted and it was a negative medical opinion as to whether or not, um, it was likely or unlikely that it was pertaining to my condition.
Mm. 
moderator: Interesting. Well, that sounds frustrating. Yeah, 
Participant 5: it's frustrating. 
moderator: Yeah. Well, thank you for sharing that, Aubrey. Yeah.
Participant 5: And unfortunately, you know, I could, I could, I haven't gotten a decision on that yet. It's still pending. Uh, I don't think it's gonna be very favorable. It would almost seem like the va, they had a favorable opinion, but they wanted another opinion. They don't usually need two favorable opinions, so I don't know.
And in the. In the VA constitution or guidelines or bylaws, uh, a opinion that's not in favor and opinion that is in favor creates a situation of equipose , and equipose goes to, presumably goes to favor the veteran. We'll see. Okay. I still don't understand why they needed another opinion after that. They had a clear cut opinion.
So, yeah, and if I appealed that decision then, you know, I, I, I guess I could do a supplemental claim if I could come up with, uh, evidence that wasn't there. But there was plenty there to start with. So, uh, I see. Yeah, I like it, but I, if I appealed it then. Um, it, it would, it was already based on an appeal anyway, and it was submitted for high, higher level review and the higher level review identified, uh, duty to assist error on the part of the va.
And, and that's where it's moved to. And it, it. It hasn't come to fruition yet at this point, but for me to appeal it and take it to the Board of Veterans Appeals, then we're talking about two to three years there. So it's frustrating. 
moderator: Right. Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. Yeah, that is, that's challenging on a lot of different levels.
Yeah, but I'm, I'm glad you talked me through that, just because, you know, we don't always see what happens beyond. When the claim is submitted, um, in our particular department. So that's really helpful information, uh, for us. Can I ask, um, a quicker question? In your opinion, is there a difference between the word condition and disability?
Participant 5: Yeah. Yeah. Up.
You want some expanding on that? Yes, please. I had imagined that you would, um, a, a condition doesn't necessarily, um, equate to a disability because we, uh, I don't think there are many of us that don't have some kind of condition as far as a health issue. 
moderator: What about the word contention?
Is that one you're familiar with in this 
Participant 5: process? Well, we contend something we, we suggest or imply. Um, I mean, and it goes back down to evidence. You know, I could contend something that doesn't make it a fact. There, there are people that think the world's flat. That doesn't make it any flatter than it, than it is, uh uh.
I mean, perception is reality to the perceiver, you know? 
moderator: I like that definition. Interesting. 
Participant 5: Yeah. Okay. If one of your cohorts there slid a rubber snake under your chair and you looked down and saw it and you thought it was a real snake, you might react like it was a real snake because perception is reality and I imagine you would get up out of that chair rather rapidly.
Uh, but anyway, 
moderator: I imagine.
I imagine as well. Yes. No, that's, that's an interesting point. That's an interesting point. Well, you've, you've answered a lot of my questions. I guess as someone who may be going through this process soon, I do wanna, uh, understand kind of what, what level of preparedness you feel you have. To start, I know you said you were at 90%.
I'm wondering if after going through and reading this, if you feel any more prepared to begin your claim 
Participant 5: now, let me ask you this, do you have insights into my percentage? Because I don't remember telling you I was at 90% 
moderator: Yes. At the very beginning, or maybe I, I could have misunderstood you. What? What did you say?
You were nine when I asked you if you were going to start a claim. You said 90%, and then we talked about the 
Participant 5: 10%. I thought you was talking about you're, you're exactly right. I thought you was talking about my rating currently. 
moderator: Oh, no, no, no, no. I would not have insight into 
that 
Participant 5: right, right. And, and please repeat your question.
moderator: Yeah. So you're, I guess I'm wondering about your level of preparedness, how prepared you feel to, um, begin a claim. Uh, now after having read through this, um, portion of the form?
Participant 5: Well, I, I do have other claims that I will be starting. I'm just waiting, pending a decision on the case that I mentioned with the two different medical opinions there conflicting each other. Um, once that is resolved, then I have other stuff to, to claim, but one of them is the, uh, it pertains to the PACT act and.
I've just, um, waiting some on some additional information there. Um, even though I don't have to, I break it down to a little bit more specifics. I, I have some neurological issues, I have some memory issues. I have tremors. Uh, I have some different cognitive stuff going on, even though I'm sure you probably think, well, this guy's pretty sharp.
Uh, just kidding. But I went to a VA referred neurologist just to see. I was at Camp Lejeune for 18 months. I drank a whole lot of the toxic water there, and that water tasted like something out of a, a horse stall might taste, even though I've never tasted water out of a horse stall. It was horrific. So I showered in it.
I bathed in it and. Uh, the way the toxic count was in water came about, and this is more than you asked for, but I'm gonna go ahead and give you a little dose. Anyway. There was a leak of VA information, VA information on the website. The, the Marine Corps actually knew there was toxic water there for a long time before they addressed it or admitted it.
So there were some people there that had been affected, that happened to come across it. A link on the internet. And so that's, that's how it came about. But the VA refers Yeah. Yeah. There's a, a documentary out there and I, I watched it. You can, you can get to pay a few bucks to watch it, but for somebody that was in the Marine Corps and that was stationed at Camp Lejeune, it's very interesting.
There were lots of babies that died prematurely shortly after birth and even some, uh, Young adolescents that died and lots of people had breast cancer, including males, and it, it's just horrific. The, the lists that went on. So the VA referred me to community care to see a neurologist, and I just wanted to get his take on could some of my issues be tied to the toxic water at Camp Lejeune?
And this guy told me. That basically that that was very unlikely and that, uh, did I wanna scam my government? And he said that he. He was in New York City up there in your stomping grounds after nine 11, and he was a physician up there, and that people were coming out of the woodwork to claim that they were affected by all the carcinogens and other pollutants in the air, that they're even worse than what you guys have got up there right now.
And he said he, he, he basically, Indicated that they were trying to scam the government and he had a, a flawed perception that anybody that thought they were having something was a fraud. Uh, I see. Wow. Down that rabbit hole. But, uh, he said that it, it. It was just too difficult to tell if any of the conditions that I had could have been caused by that.
But, uh, he told me that the, the power of suggestion would make me think that due to all the commercials that were out there on the tv, that they were basically brainwashing people and making them think flawed, that any kinda little condition would be tied to that. I 
moderator: see. Wow. Wow. That's, that's, that sounds pretty frustrating.
That sounds like a lot 
Participant 5: unbelievable. 
moderator: Yeah, it, it truly is. Thank you for breaking that down. Cause that wasn't something I was aware of, but I wanna have a better understanding as I talked to more veterans who were gonna be facing, um, you know, uh, making claims with the PACT Act. So I know you didn't have to go into it, but I appreciate that you did.
Um, I think I'm coming on, you know, your full hour. I did just wanna ask kind of just, you know, lastly, if there's, there's anything else that comes to mind about this form, whether, you know, any information you think would be helpful for veterans like yourself looking to apply, um, that should be added here to this page.
Participant 5: Nothing other than what I told y'all already. And, um, You know, like you said at some point in our dialogue here that I seem pretty familiar with the process. Uh, it took a while for me to get familiar with it, and I don't believe it would be too redundant to tell somebody from the time they started their claim to attach their documentation if they have any.
Um, okay. I don't, I don't think somebody could overdo documentation to support their claim. 
moderator: That's great. That's good for me to to know. Thank you so much, Aubrey. Um, let me see if I. I think I have everything else that I need. So yeah. Thank you again. That was, it was really helpful for you, you know, for me to just hear you go into everything and really break it down and give me some context and understanding of what things are like on the veteran end.
I really appreciate it. Um, I guess the only thing. That you should know is that pair Jean's gonna be reaching out to you, um, about your conversation. They're gonna send you a little blurb. Um, if you have any friends who are equally as opinionated, who, who would like to help us refine and develop, um, you know, our products, we would love someone like yourself who can really articulate things and, you know, um, really break things down.
Super helpful. 
Participant 5: Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you again. Good job facilitating this. 
moderator: I appreciate it. I'll be taking that snake, uh, that snake metaphor with me. I think it's gonna be very useful for some people. I know. Thank you. Well, 
Participant 5: Just to tell you a short story, and I know we're out of time here, but I, I had a little plastic snake and I don't mind playing a prank every once in a while on somebody, but I forgot about plastic steak and actually prank myself.
That perception is reality. Oh 
moderator: my goodness. Very personal story. Yeah. Well, thank you again, Aubrey. I appreciate it. You 
Participant 5: take care. All right. Thank you. Y'all have a good day. You too.
