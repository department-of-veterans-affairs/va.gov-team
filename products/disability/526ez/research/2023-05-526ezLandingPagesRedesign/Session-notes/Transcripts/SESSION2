The first thing I'm gonna have you do is,  , just read this first section for me until you get to where it says,  , Basically where it says,  , start and then I'll stop you and you can read out loud, you can read to yourself,  , you know, read at your own pace and just let me know when you're finished.

moderator: Okay. Now are you familiar with PACT Act Hunter? Yes, I am. Okay. And how did you become familiar with it? 

Participant 2:  , I, I'm pretty sure I got a message, uh,  , the, uh, veterans letter that I get every once in a while on my computer

moderator: 
I see. So that was a, uh, email or a newsletter? 

Participant 2: Uh, it was an email, yeah. 

moderator: Oh, okay. Good to know. I mean, 

Participant 2: it was, it was addressing several different, uh, things and one of them was the PACT act, and I, the others were like, oh gosh, what? Uh, Five forms of exercises, you know, just different topics. 

moderator: Okay. Okay.
That's good to know. And so when you were reading this, you know, did you find this information,  you know, what do you think about this information? Do you think it could be clearer?  , 

Participant 2: yeah,
honestly,  , I thought it was very clear. Okay.  ,
and I did file a claim,  , so I mean it and everything. Hmm, pardon me. Everything, uh, that I needed to do, it was just, uh, you know, once I got to the right buttons, like in this instance, uh, everything was smooth. 

moderator: Okay. That's good to know. Okay. Is there anything, as you were reading, that you wish you had known or seen earlier when you were going through the process?
Is there anything you felt was missing from this section that could be helpful for other vets? No, not really. 
And that's good to know. Thank you for sharing that. So, can I ask on a scale from one to 10, so one is not at all useful, 10 is, you know, very use, extremely useful. How useful would you rate this, this section here, this information 

Participant 2: I don't want to completely give it a 10, but I would say a nine.
moderator: Okay, and why did you choose that number? You said maybe one point less, 

Participant 2: right.
Just for the simple reason that it's probably something that somebody else may have thought of that I didn't. 

moderator: I see. I see. And when you applied for PACT Act, Hunter, did you apply, apply on your own or did you apply with A VSO or

Participant 2: No, I applied on my own

moderator:  Okay. And was that digitally or through paper?

Participant 2: Uh, that was,
that's a good question.  ,
I think I did it electronically on the computer and then got an acknowledgment both on the computer and mail. 

moderator: Okay. Thank you for letting me know that. All right, so I'm gonna have you scroll down
until you see. A few sections. There we are. Right. So just underneath, follow these steps to get started. You can scroll there. Okay. And I'm gonna ask, what, what would be the first thing you would do here after seeing this? 

Participant 2: Okay. "Follow these steps to get started. All right. Determine if this form is for you.
Decide how you want to apply, gather information and apply."  Let me expand. "Use this form if you're filing a new claim or claim for increased disability compensation. Make sure you meet eligibility requirements before you apply. You may be eligible for VA disability benefits or compensation if you meet these requirements.
Both of these must be true : You have a current illness or injury. Known as a condition that affects your mind or body, and you served on active duty, active duty for training or inactive duty training. At least one of these must be true. You got sick or injured while serving in the military, or you had an injury or. An illness or injury before you joined the military and serving made it worse, or you have disability related to your active duty service that didn't appear.
Until after you ended your service or a service connected illness or injury you already have caused, uh, a new injury or illness. Learn more about eligibility. Uh, if you need to file a supplemental claim instead of this form. Either of these, your claim in the. And you have documentation you didn't submit to us in the past or identify us to gather that proves or disapproves something in your claim.
 , you're requesting a review of your claim based on the PACT Act or change in the law, such as the PACT Act. And then have you already been, have you, have you been granted benefits already?"

moderator: Okay. So how did it feel reading through that? Did it feel -- was anything confusing? Anything stick out to you?  ,

Participant 2: I think the first part of it is, uh, defining what must be true. Uh, and the uh, uh, first two paragraphs, I didn't have any problem with that. where I got Confused is if you-- where "we decided your claim in the past and you have documentation you didn't submit to us in the past or identify us to gsther, that proves or disproves something in your claim or you're requesting a review of your claim, uh, based on the PACT.
Uh, yeah. The change in law. Uh, and the reason I got confused there is: I did file a claim for, uh, high blood pre --No, with high, yeah. High blood pressure. Uh, and they came back and said, yeah, you know, maybe, uh, Uh, that was, uh, true, but you know, we're not, you know, we just have it noted they're not gonna do anything about it.

moderator: I See. So, and was that under the PACT act when you, that you filed with that? 
Participant 2: Yes. 
moderator: I see. Interesting. So you did file a supplemental claim? 

Participant 2: have not, uh, for a simple reason that I do not have any further evidence to present to them. I'm not gonna say I developed high blood pressure. I'm sure I had it before the mil-- before my military records. I didn't get -- let's see, how do I explain this? Back in the nineties, my civilian doctor diagnosed me with high blood pressure.

moderator: I see.

Participant 2: And then, uh, when I joined, uh, the VA under Agent Orange, qualification, they also noted high blood pressure, but they said it wasn't over a certain standard. Well, of course it wasn't, they put me on blood pressure medication, so I 
see. Okay. And, I mean, not that I'm expecting you to answer that question, I just, you know, trying to explain 

moderator: No, that, that gives me some good context because I, I do wanna know, when you're reading this, is there something you think people should, veterans should know before so that we don't give them, uh, false expectations?
Right. 

Participant 2: Hey, that makes sense. Mm-hmm. 

moderator: And so is that what you were thinking about reading this section?  , at the bottom, you'll need to file a supplemental claim instead. 

Participant 2:  
let's see. Uh, it says you'll need to file a supplemental claim instead of this form if either of these are true.  ,
I'm gonna click on that, uh, file a supplemental claim. And see, 

moderator: I won't have you click on it just yet because I'm gonna have you do it. I might have you do it later. Okay. Why, why would you click on it? 

Participant 2:  
Because I wanna file a supplemental claim. I see. Uh, with these-- with either of the conditions listed or true. 

moderator: Okay. Can I ask Hunter, if you had to explain what a supplemental claim is to, uh, you know, a friend or someone else, how would you explain it?

Participant 2: Uh, you're, you're providing additional information that, uh, I guess you could say is used to justify or present evidence, that hadn't been considered when you filed the initial claim or they made the official determination. I see. 

moderator: Okay. Good to know. After reading this section, what would you do next?

Participant 2:  well, I'd go back, uh, and probably read, decide how you want to apply and then gather information and then apply. Okay. And then, uh, after that sign in. 

moderator: That's good to know. Did you notice that yellow alert towards the top of your screen, 

Participant 2: "Have you been granted benefits already?" Yes, I did. 

moderator: Okay. What did you think about that?
Did you think that would be useful to you? 

Participant 2:  yeah, it would be, but I just kind of ignored it. Okay. That's good to know. and, and I, I don't know why I ignored it, but even though it's highlighted and underlined and  has the symbol out to the left side of it. 

moderator: Yeah, we hear that a lot. So we are actually trying to work on that.

Participant 2: I think if it was a bulletin right under. Without having to be,and it, you know, explained what they were saying without having to open it up would be more beneficial. 

moderator: I see. Okay. I'm gonna have you open it and read it to see if it's what you expected. Okay, 

Participant 2: "If you have already been granted benefits and are filing a claim because your condition has worsened, this is called a claim for increase.
You might want to check to see if you're already receiving the maxim disability rating for your condition. You can do this by signing in and viewing your claim letters." 
I would probably sign in and, uh, view the claim letter, just to see what they were talking about, but it really doesn't, doesn't make a lot of sense to me. 

moderator: Okay, why so? What, what part of it was it little?  ,

Participant 2: because I'm not -- if I were to file a supplemental claim, and I'm not mistaken in what it is or what it's for, then I don't have a condition that's worsened, and I already know that I'm not receiving the maximum disability rating for the condition. So, that's why I would, I said I, you know, have to sign in and see what the claim letter said specifically looking for that, those two things in mind.
Okay, 

moderator: I see. But you said you're pretty certain that you have, you haven't been granted the maximum , right? 
Participant 2: Correct. 

moderator: Okay. Right. So, can I ask, when it says claim for increase, Is it clear that that's different from the supplemental claim?

Participant 2:  
I'm sorry, a --ask the question again. 

moderator: Yes. So in this paragraph it says, “if you have already been granted benefits, uh, and are filing a claim because your condition has worsened, this is called a claim for increase.” So I'm wondering, when you read that, what that meant to you : claim for in increase? 

Participant 2:  It, well, just what it said: you're filing a, a supplemental claim, uh, to increase your compensation. 

moderator: I see. So that's interesting to me because a claim for increase is actually distinct from a supplemental claim. So it seems like we need to be, uh, more clear there. Okay. 

Participant 2: Well, yeah. Now that you put it like that, you Yeah, I can see exactly. 

moderator: So that's good to know. So I'm gonna actually have you click on,  , uh, the second section.

Participant 2: Okay.
Uh, file for disability compensation with VA form 21 dash 526 EZ

moderator: oh, it's taking you back to the top. Hunter. You're, you'll have to scroll down again. Oh, okay.
Just scroll down a little more. I think it's 

Participant 2: okay. All right. Uh, we're talking about the toxic exposure and impact deck. Uh, 

moderator: scroll down just a bit more underneath that whole section and then back. 

Participant 2: Okay. 

moderator: And then where it says, follow these steps to get started. 

Participant 2: Okay. All right. 

moderator: Right, so now it's, number two is open, so you can go ahead and read that.

Participant 2: Okay,
"We'll take you through each step of the process online. You will be able to answer the questions relevant to you, upload digital documents, and save your work in progress. The time it takes you to complete your application depends on how many conditions you are claiming and how many documents you need to upload.
"You may choose to contact an accredited veteran service officer to assist you with your application. If you need further assistance with the application process, you may also contact your state office of Veteran Affairs. Learn about other ways you can file a disability claim. "

moderator: And so after reading this, what do you think you would do first?

Participant 2:  
Well, I would try to find the form online. And see if, I'm not sure what you call it, but fill it in on screen, uh, if that's available for that form, and then see what happened. It’s good to know that I could contact a VSO or, State Office of Veterans Affairs, but, sometimes, well, I'm not sure what a, a veteran service officer is, uh, number one and number two,
I mean, if that's a, a representative at your local or our local VA office or what, and,  , In the state office of Veteran Affairs,  , I,
I really haven't explored that possibility. 

moderator: Okay. And so on a scale of one to 10 again, how useful would you say this information is for you to have?  , you can imagine,  , you know, coming here as a first time, uh, you know, a veteran coming here for the first time to apply.  , on a scale of one to 10,

Participant 2: I would say it's.
I would say it has to be a 10, cause I mean, it does tell you everything you need to do. 
Okay. If you, if, if you're not a procrastinator like me, and we'll go ahead and do it

moderator: 
And you know what, I forgot to ask you that about section one. Do you mind going back and reviewing section one up there? Not at all. Right. Oh, okay.
If you, uh, you can take some time to review and I wanna just understand again how useful you found that section. 

Participant 2: Okay. 
Okay.
All right. I'm done reading. 

moderator: Okay. So yeah, I wanted to ask you again about the usefulness of this section as well. On a scale of one to 10, what you thought about it?

Participant 2:  I would have to give it a nine for a simple reason.  , it, there may, for me it was great, but there may be some other questions that would arise that,  , I hadn't thought about and once I got into the process,  , had other questions that weren't, weren't apparent to me at the time I was reading through this.
Got it. If that makes any sense

moderator: no, it completely does, because this is such a long form. I would be surprised if that didn't happen.  And, and I guess reading through it that second time again, did anything come to mind where you, where you thought we could clarify something or add some information, that could be useful to someone else or someone going through this process I should say?

Participant 2: Let me review it here.
Now that I read through it again…There's nothing. It is pretty clear, right? But sometimes, I guess I just get in a rush. And, uh, maybe I don't comprehend everything that it’s trying to tell me. 

moderator: Not a problem. When you're looking at it, does it feel like a lot of text to you? 

Participant 2: Yes. 

moderator: That's good to know.
Is there anything you think we could take out that's not so useful here? Maybe shorten it. 

Participant 2:  ,
no, not really because, I think that you -- They are trying to give as much as advice on how to do this as they can,  , so that it won't,  , be a problem to follow. But by the same point, it, like you said, it's a lot of information and, unless you keep referring back to it, uh, At least for me, I get lost.
That's 
moderator: good to know. That's good to know. Thank you for, for explaining that to me.  , for our last few minutes, well actually, let's see. Okay, I think we're just at time. So I think, you know, you, you've given me a lot of good information, hunter, so I, I wanna. I'm gonna pause here and just say thank you for, you know, letting me pick your brain today.
