Participant 3: I believe Oh, for the benefits?

Participant 3: I just Remember the notice of the orange and
I'm, I I get 20 percent for diabetes. 
moderator: Okay. 
Participant 3: Since my healthcare at that time was under the va and they had of course had diagnosed me. I just filled out the paperwork and the money started coming. It was, no, a lot of people, I guess have -- seem to have trouble getting their approval.
But I didn't see that myself. 
moderator: Okay. That's good to know. Thank you for sharing that. All right. And you filed alone Davis or did you have someone to help. Now or then, 
Participant 3: Then at that time I was living with my wife who died in 20 13.

Participant 3: I was also, I was still working the time too, okay. 
moderator: All right. Thank you for sharing that Davis. That was really helpful for me. So what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to share with you that prototype that I had mentioned. Okay. And I'm going to see if you are able to see it and then share your screen. Okay? Okay. Okay. So the first thing I'm gonna do is pop that the link to that in the chat.
And if you need help finding the chat, just let me know and I can walk 
Participant 3: you through that. Okay.
And you Okay. Do I just click a little box? Bounced up down here? 
moderator: Yeah. There should be a box at the very bottom of your screen that says chat, or there might be, okay, you see that? Okay, great. With a 
Participant 3: or red one on it? Or a white one in a red background. Let's see. 
moderator: That's what, okay, so you clicked on a oh yes.
With the white icon that says chat. 
Participant 3: You want me to ch click on the chat. 
moderator: Okay. And then did it open up on the right hand side of your screen? 
Participant 3: In the middle of the screen. 
moderator: Oh, okay. That's fine too. And then you should see a message from me. Okay? Yep. Okay. And if you click on it, you should be able to open it up.
Participant 3: Okay. It's loading. 
moderator: Yeah, it might take a little while. Okay. All right. Okay. And so then I'm gonna have you come back to Zoom. 
Participant 3: Okay. 
moderator: And you should see a green should screen button.
Participant 3: Okay.
moderator: And do you see that button? 
Participant 3: I don't it's a, I got a blank screen here that has Zoom on it. 
moderator: Okay. Let's see. And do you see me, do you see my face? Yes, I see you. Okay. You do see me. Okay, so that's good. And so let's see if you are able to get back to the Zoom window, then I should be able to get you to that share screen button.
Participant 3: Okay?
Yes. 
moderator: And take your 
Participant 3: time. What? Yeah what? See, I have a blue zoom. 
moderator: You said it's blue, 
Participant 3: blue zoom. And it is asking me if I wanted to join. I think what happened here is you joined me. I opened up Zoom yesterday. And I got a message that says, it's 24 hours to your meeting when I clicked on the link. Oh, okay. Then when I came in here you would, okay. Now I got it.
Okay. Now, yeah. Okay. Now what you want me to click on share screen? 
moderator: Yes. And that should give you some options on which, which screen you wanna share. Okay. So I'm hoping you'll be able to see an option to share that screen that you just opened up that I gave you the link to of the product. 
Participant 3: Yeah I got, now I got a big white thing here that is desktop, whiteboard, all kinds of stuff here.
moderator: Okay. So I think you're on the right place. 
Participant 3: And then in the bottom left there's a blue button to share. 
moderator: You, different boxes that say whiteboard, iPhone, and different things like that, right? Yes. So do one of those boxes have the prototype in it?
Participant 3: No. The first one that's highlighted in solid blue, it says desktop one. Okay. 
moderator: Let's then whiteboard and then whiteboard. Let's try desktop one. So I'll have you click that and click share.
If I can't see your screen, I'll let you know, though.
Participant 3: Okay. Lemme see.
Okay.
Is anything sharing now or 
moderator: let's see. Okay. Yes, so I see your screen. Okay. And if you go to the very bottom of your screen where it says The Safari, the internet. Yeah. And you click that compass icon on the left for Safari. I wanna see if that link is in there. Yes. So on the far right side. Yeah.
Perfect. All right. That's great. Thank you Davis. No problem. Okay, so now that you can see it again, this what we're looking at here is a prototype of the first page of the 5 26 EZ form. This is the form for applying for Disability compensation. And, basically what I'm going to do is I'm gonna have you look at each section, ask you a few questions and gauge your experience of each of those sections.
Okay. We'll start. From the top, and I'll just ask that you imagine, you are here to file for compensation and I'll have you take a moment to look over the page. And I guess I wanna know, firstly, what is the first thing you think you would do after arriving on this page?
Participant 3: Let me see. Read. Read what it says there before before I do anything. Okay. It says, 
moderator: so I, I'll have you do that then I'll have you read that top section. You can read it out loud or to yourself. The 
Participant 3: PAC Act as a new law of expands benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits, ancient orange and other toxic subjects.
By adding to the list of conditions we can automatically. Assume or pre presume was caused by your service. If this applies to you, we encourage you to file for your benefits now. Okay. 
moderator: You can just let me know when you're done reading.
Participant 3: Okay? Okay then there's a blue button or bar bottom to sign in or continue your application. 
moderator: Okay. Oh, and I'm gonna ask you not to click on anything just yet, but I would like to know how did you feel reading that? Was anything in that paragraph or to confusing or did anything stick out to you?
No, 
Participant 3: It
It's pretty clear.
moderator: Do you think any of the information you read could be clearer? 
Participant 3: No.
moderator: And then when you received notice about toxic exposure, was it similar to this one? 
Participant 3: When I filed the first time. Oh, I don't even remember what it, it said
moderator: That's fine. That was 10 years ago no problem. Can I ask you on a scale from one to 10, so one is not at all useful and 10 is extremely useful, how useful do you think this information in the, in this section of the page is?
Participant 3: I'll give it a 10. I see nothing unuseful about it.
moderator: And do you think it would be useful for someone filing for the first time? Do you imagine that it would be? 
Participant 3: I believe so, yes. Good 
moderator: to know. And can I ask you, from what you, can you explain to me from what you read here, your understanding of who qualifies for benefits under the PACT Act? 
Participant 3: It, it says if you been exposed to agent orange , other toxic subjects, your list of conditions, and it says, we encourage you to file benefits now before August 10th, 2023.
And then if you're approved, they are going to pay from . August of 2022. So
that, that's pretty clear. 
moderator: Okay, that's good to know. Thank you for sharing that. 
Participant 3: Actually once you Set this up I'll be using it, I guess becaues under the new PACT act hypertension is. considered For Agent Orange, although I think they have some kinda a delay on it. But I talked to the county rep's rep, but he said file now, even though they say it'll be several years, I think before they, they start paying that.
moderator: Oh, I see. And who did you speak to about it? The, 
Participant 3: Sumner County veterans Officer. 
moderator: Okay. That's good to know. Okay. Okay, Davis, I'm gonna have you scroll down. Okay. Yeah. And I'm gonna have you look I'm gonna have you Yeah. Read this first section here, just like the first, again, can read it out loud to yourself.
Feel free to go at your own pace and just let me know when you're finished. 
Participant 3: Is determine if it's for you. This is how you decide if you meet conditions.
Okay.
It says, have you benefit been granted benefits already? That would be, yes. And then 
moderator: so seeing that that alert, have you been granted benefits already? What do you think you would do? 
Participant 3: Click on that i guess
moderator: okay. Why so. Why is it why would you click on it? What would you expect to see there?
Participant 3: It will give you an explanation, of what to do because it's got the little down pasting arrow and the blue line underneath the text. So I take it that's a hyperlink of 
some kind. 
moderator: I see. That's good to know. So when you were reading the above text Davis, did you encounter anything that you thought was unclear or confusing?
Participant 3: No.
And then were there any sections you thought could, maybe they weren't confusing, but they could be made clearer.
No, I don't think I, I can't think of any changes I would make. 
moderator: That's good to know. And can I ask, if you had to explain, the information you just read in this section to someone else how would you phrase it to them?
Participant 3: It just tells you how to determine if you have any medical issues that came from your military service, how to determine. It talks about whether you were treated before or after you got out of the military and if the injury occurred during the military. And and also if you have a disability related to active that didn't appear until after your end in service or service connected injury you had already caused a new injury or I illness.
moderator: And what would you tell them is the most important piece of information here? 
Participant 3: The most important information? 
moderator: If any.
Participant 3: The most important in information to me is gonna be the list that tells you what I, items were, are under consideration. 
moderator: Do you remember, and it's okay if you don't but it, do you remember when you filed your claim? Was it clear to you what you needed in order to file?
Participant 3: They Needed to have a doctor's diagnosis. And since the VA was already my healthcare at that time, and that was easy to come by. Good to know. 
moderator: And can I ask you Davis, and what, from what you read here, what's your understanding of a supplemental claim? 
Participant 3: It says if we decided your claim in the pass and you have documentation you didn't submit, or you're requesting a review of your claim based on a change in the law, such as the PAC T Act. So that's second case would be what would be affecting me. 
moderator: Okay. I'm gonna have you open that alert that you were just about to click on earlier,
and I'll have you read that too. 
Participant 3: If you've already been granted benefits and are filing a claim because your condition is worse, this is called a claim for increase. You wanna check to see if you're already receiving the maximum benefit disability. You can do this by signing in and reviewing your claim letters.
moderator: So was anything confusing when you were reading that?
Participant 3: It wasn't quite what I was thinking it was gonna be. I was
 Basically what, the
item of information I'm looking for is the list that says what issues are covered under this PAC T Act. I see. Because if I don't have anything, if I don't have any of those problems that are on that list nothing else really matters. 
moderator: Okay. So that's the information you were expecting to see when you clicked this.
I understand. Okay. Thank you for explaining that. How useful on a scale of one to 10, would you say this information and the alert is for you?
Participant 3: I don't know, maybe an eight. I can see where somebody that thinks that their situation is worse, that it might wanna read that.
moderator: And then can I ask you Davis in your, in what, from what you read here, what's your understanding of a claim for increase?
Participant 3: I'm not really sure. Cause I don't know what would be, I don't know how they. Determine the percentage they give you in the first place. I see, 
moderator: I see. And so here do you think it's clear what we're trying to establish this difference between a claim for increase and a supplemental claim?
Participant 3: Okay. There's a link up there to file a supplemental claim. 
moderator: And can I ask what are, oh, you're looking for information about a supplemental claim.
Participant 3: Okay. The yes, the basic. To me the most in most important information if I'm looking to file something under this PAC Act is okay. It would be this here, right here at the top of Lend more, learn more back to PAC Act and what is now presumptive. 
moderator: Okay. I see. And from what you've read here, Davis would you be filing, if you were to file, would you be filing a supplemental claim?
Or a claim for increase? 
Participant 3: A supplemental. 
I'm covered for diabetes now, but I believe I will be covered in the future for hypertension. 
moderator: Okay. Davis, I'm gonna have you go onto section two. Okay. And I'm gonna have us do the same thing.
Participant 3: Okay.
Okay. It;s telling us different ways that you could apply : An accredited veteran service officer, such here at the county. There's also down in Nashville, there's a state office and it says, learn about other ways to file a disability claim, I guess online. That's what the purpose of this form is. 
moderator: Right.
And you said okay, so you're saying this is where you would Or you said, I guess you know, this is why you know that link is there. Is that what you meant? 
Participant 3: This is where you determine if you wanna go, if you wanna do it online by yourself, or go find either a state or county veteran service officer, get their assistance.
moderator: Alright. Thank you for explaining that. And is there any information you think should be here that you would personally wanna know?
Participant 3: Well, I.
It gives you apparently two, two links either to send an accredited veteran service officer or a state veteran service officer. 
moderator: Can you explain that a little bit? 
Participant 3: Accredited can also, I think some of the veterans organizations such as the VFW or
Others might have VSOs. Oh, I'm sorry. But I know here in Tennessee, the county also has one. Okay. 
moderator: And is that important you think, for people to know when they come here? 
Participant 3: They should know that there's help available that you should not have to pay for somebody to file it for you. 
moderator: I see.
Okay. And is there any other information you think is missing from this section that would be useful either to yourself or people who haven't filed before? No.
Okay, I'm gonna have you then move down to section three. You already got it. Okay. Same thing as the last time. Feel free to stop if you see anything that you think is confusing and just name it out loud. Or if questions come up for you, feel free to ask them.
Okay.
So reading that yeah. How, in your own words, I guess I wanna know what would you say is the gist of the information in this section? 
Participant 3: Okay. Basically, they want, they, if you're making a claim, they want the medical records to back up your claim, which can either be for the VA or from. Private medical records that you would've to obtain
moderator: submit. And can I ask, on a scale of one to 10 just like I did before, how useful you would say this information is ,either to you or someone else who was applying?
Participant 3: I would say it is useful, yes. This tells you the types of medical records.
The only way it could be more useful is if it already had my medical records here, which is not practical. Yeah I'd give it a 10. I don't, 
moderator: I see, why did you say it's not practical? Oh for 
Participant 3: each individual to have their own. Yeah. 
moderator: I see. And is there any information you feel is missing from this section that you would wanna know or have explained further?
Participant 3: =
no, I think it's pretty, pretty clear.
moderator: Did you notice that alert there that says are you currently on active duty as a service member? Yes. Okay. And I saw you skipped over it. 
Participant 3: No, I'm not. So 
moderator: just wanna make sure. Oh, yeah, you can, you don't have to read it, but I did wanna just understand if you saw it. Yeah. Okay. Now, and so if you scroll just back up to section three I did wanna ask, I guess I wanna know, if you imagine you needed to explain to someone else how disability compensation is determined I'm wondering how you would explain it to them.
Participant 3: You have to have either through medical records, either VA or outside of va. Have to document that you have the condition that you're applying for under the backpack.
moderator: And what would you say is the most piece most important piece of information here? If someone were to take just one thing away from it or a few things.
Participant 3: It says the VA will review the medical records basically my takeaway is obviously you can't just say, I have this problem. You have to be able to document it with your medical records. And the more, the better. 
moderator: I see. And something I noticed Davis, is you said that you need medical records.
Do you feel like that's the most important piece of most important piece of documentation? To help make your claim
Participant 3: Other than a DD2 14? I, I would say it's 
moderator: yes. Or is there another reason you mentioned the medical records?
Participant 3: If. Under the PAC T Act you're filing for disability caused by a certain, some, a certain something, a certain disease or medical problem from a list that's on the PAC T Act. So if you don't have one of the problems that PACT act lists, you might as well just, there's nothing else to do.
moderator: I see. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for explaining that.
Now, just underneath that yellow alert is a little bit of extra information, and I'm just wondering what you thought about that section. 
Participant 3: Okay. If.
Okay.
Since we, if you apply online we'll also include in your application the necessary forms we will need if you're claiming PTSD or request for private medical records. In other words if you wanna submit private medical records, you're gonna have to Sign a document that allows the VA to go to your doctor and obtain those records.
Also if you can't work because of a disability related to your service,
just telling you if you have any of these issues. They will provide the necessary forms to fill out.
moderator: Okay. And from what you read here where would you submit those forms?
Participant 3: We got down to that point. Yeah. But you would submit those forms along with your claim. 
moderator: I see. I see. Okay. I understand. Okay. I'm gonna have you go onto that last section there. 
Participant 3: Apply 
moderator: and I will run the same exercise. You can go ahead and read that. Feel free to stop if any questions come up for you can ask them.
Participant 3: Okay. It tells you basically the process, what it happens when you apply,
when you start your application, you declare your intent to, to file. This will reserve a potential effective date for when you could start getting your benefits. You have a year from the day you submit to your intent to complete your application. After one year, you'd have to start a new application.
After you submit your claim here, you'll see a confirmation page. We won't send you another notification. It takes three or four months and we'll contact you by phone or letter. If we need additional information,
please open respond. Any letter you received from, 
moderator: was that funny?
Participant 3: I don't know. It did.
moderator: It's okay if it was, I'm just wondering why it tickled you? 
Participant 3: Oh, I get a lot of mail that is a waste of trees.
moderator: I get it.
Any other information kind of stick out to you when you were reading that? 
Participant 3: No. Said you have up to one year to file it. Submit your additional documents.
It says, learn more about uploading evidence, documents that support your claims.
It says, do I need submit additional forms?
Once you file, you're gonna get a claim number, and if you have to file additional information, you put your claim number on that document so they'll know what claim goes to. 
moderator: I see. When you scrolled up, were you looking for some more information or why did you scroll up? Oh, 
Participant 3: Not really. I don't know. I was just playing with a mouse. I think 
moderator: that's fine. And so I wanted to know Davis, was any of the information you read there unclear or confusing? 
Participant 3: No. No. It's, it is pretty clear. It's not a simple process. 
moderator: And can you explain that it's not a simple process?
Was that Yeah, I just wanna understand that a little bit more.
Participant 3: You have to first make sure you have the correct issues. If you're not aware of them, you should talk to your doctor about do you fall under the category of this act. And then you go to gather all the right documents and get 'em all uploaded.
moderator: And was there any information as you were reading you thought could be explained better?
Participant 3: No I don't think so.
moderator: What did you think about the text that reads the text about the length of time that the VA takes to make a decision?
Participant 3: It says it takes about three or four months. It should take longer.
It's
directly proportional to the number of employees the VA has working the claims. 
moderator: Oh, are you saying that the length of time is gonna be dependent on just how many people they have to review claims? 
Participant 3: I think that's, that, that will have an impact on it. Okay. What are, how long, I don't know how long it takes one person to review a claim, but
and then, how long it takes them to do it, and how many they can do in one day, and how many they get in one day. 
moderator: Are those all the factors you believe go into that process? Number of people, how many workers reviewing it, how long it takes them to review, and how many they get?
Participant 3: Yeah, there's it
depends I guess on also on how.
How clearcut your medical evidence is. Is it, do your, if your medical records documented that you've had this problem for a period of time and they're from and off authentic source, then it should be checked the block. Yeah that's them. If it's something that's, one person look at it and say I don't know if this fits that.
The next guy says yeah it does. And then so I see that there could be some, I don't know. I've been lucky with the va all my, all the issues I've had or, pretty straightforward think that they've been able to take care of without. Too much problems. 
moderator: I see.
Okay. Can I ask you, in your opinion Davis, is there a difference between the words condition and disability?
Participant 3: I. Yes. I'm not sure, I'd have to think about that a minute. You would have a medical condition that may or not, may or may not be a disability. 
moderator: Can you give me an example?
Participant 3: If you had hypertension and you take proper medication and it's under control if you have a condition, but it's not disabling you, 
moderator: I see. Can I ask you, Davis after reading through this page, do you think, I'd like to know how likely or unlikely would you be to reach out to A V S O for help completing the form
or your local office? Yeah, 
Participant 3: I
would have to look at the form.
And see how it goes of some,
the hard part on forms is sometimes they'll ask you a question to answer. You don't really understand. Name, rank and service number is easy. And
when they start asking, do you do this or you do that, it's, I don't know. It's not always clear what they're asking. 
moderator: I was that your experience in the past filling out forms? Yes.
And then my very last question Davis was really I wanted to try and understand why, personally, why do you think the VA asked for this documentation when applying for disability benefits?
Participant 3: Okay. They're giving away money, right? And they gotta make sure that you're one of the, they're giving away money to people for a reason. So they have to make sure they're, look at what happened to all the. Money they were given away for covid. They got millions and billions that gone places the people that weren't supposed to get it in the first place.
So they have to make sure that you are who you say you are and that you have the issue that you claim. 
moderator: I see. You think they asked for a reasonable amount of documentation? I would think 
Participant 3: Yes. I don't see anything unreasonable about it. If you want him to give you the money, then you have to prove that you have the problem that covered under the law.
I 
moderator: see. Okay. Davis, this was really helpful. So I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. With all of us today, your feedback is gonna, allow us to continue to improve and work on the site and just make sure it really works for veterans. Before I let you go, I did wanna say that, per jean is, Gonna send you a thank you note, little blurb.
Feel free to, to pass this along to other veterans who might also have strong opinions, wanna share their feedback so that they can participate in future research studies. But just wanna, again, thank you and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. 
Participant 3: All right thank you very much and thank all of you.
moderator: Thank you.
