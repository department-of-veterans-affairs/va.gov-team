Session 16

Participant 16: Even just trying to load.
Okay. 
moderator: Did you hear the alert that said recording started? Yes. Ok. Just whenever? 
Participant 16: Yes. Ok. It's weird, it 
moderator: didn't even, oh, safari didn't load it either. 
Participant 16: Yeah, it's weird. It's like I said, and I didn't even put in the website. I think it's a little overloaded with all the stuff going on. I'm trying to 
moderator: feel free to min minimize my video if it helps.
Um, I don't know if it's blocking you, but I'm 
Participant 16: not sure it does, but it is taking a long time.
All right. Well, I can load Chrome. Let me see. I, it's weird. I can't even, all right. Let me close out Safari and try to reload it again. 
moderator: Yeah, take your time. Sometimes it's just low. 
Participant 16: Yeah, it's really, I haven't seen it do this before, but it's doesn't look like it wants to even opened it.
At least Chrome was loading. I don't know if it's because I had Chrome Open, but I've had the two browsers open at the same time and it doesnt usually interfere. 
moderator: I'm gonna send different link really quick, Cece, just in case it's the link. 
Participant 16: Okay. Okay.
It's just weird. I can't even get in Safari.
It's just a slap. I do this, I can't. I'm wondering if I could do Zoom on my computer and cuz it's a mobile website. You want me to look at, I have the link now. I could get on Zoom on my computer and look at on my cell phone. But you wanna screen share? So, Hmm, 
moderator: I'll, I see Yeah, at it on your cell phone. Oh.
Like connect your cell phone to your laptop to look, to look at it.
We might, we might have to try that. And did you, you try the second? No, not even 
Participant 16: connect it. I was just gonna say, could be. 
moderator: I see. 
Participant 16: Uh, I tried, but something, yeah. Okay. It, it's, whatever it is, is taking really long on both. Let me see, I, I, let me see if I, let me try to close out all my windows except 
moderator: Zoom.
If not, we can just move to laptop. That's okay. 
Participant 16: I have, I have a lot of apps open right now. Sometimes I forget to close them out. I just minimize them. I do that all the time, 
moderator: so 
Participant 16: I wonder if 
moderator: that's Yeah. Completely drains my battery and interfer 
Participant 16: a lot of apps of P Rain.
Hold on. If I just
close all of the, just keeps going. That could be part of the problem is that I have so many apps that are. Minimize, but I didn't realize it. I thought it was close. No, I 
moderator: forget. They're running. Are you still there? Yes. I, you're cutting out a little bit so I can't, are you still there? Your screen as much, can you hear?
Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me? No. Testing, testing
Cici. I think if you turn your camera off it might help as well. Uh, 
Participant 16: hi. Oh, okay. Lemme try, lemme try to close the chat first. Okay. I'm gonna stop the video. Uh, you're still online? Yes. Can you hear me now? Okay, I can still see you. Okay, well now I can't, uh, yeah, let me try. Yes, I can hear you. So it's not a problem.
And let me try again with the links. You want me to use the second one? Lemme try the second one. Yeah,
hold on. It's slow. Yeah, I need to get, I think I have too much stuff loaded in. There we go. Okay. Now it's gonna, are, am I still screen sharing? 
moderator: Yes, I still see it. 
Participant 16: Okay. I think it's slow. It's gonna try and load the, the second page now. Okay. 
moderator: We'll try it. If not, we'll just move to desktop. No worries. Okay.
Participant 16: Do you see the sketch loading? 
moderator: Yeah, I see a little loading bar at the top. 
Participant 16: Yeah. It seems to get Okay, now it's got the little timer thing. Yeah, I think it's asking a lot of it, but I closed out all my other apps. I, I wonder if that will make it 
moderator: easier. Right. I hate that you have to get to a hundred before it tells you No, it's ok.
Participant 16: It's like, it looks like really promising and then it like, gets stuck at the end. 
moderator: Sorry. Yeah. You know, sometimes the phones also have, um, 
Participant 16: popup blocker. Yeah. I'm wondering, 
moderator: yeah. Popup block or something. So open new 
Participant 16: page in, in new open page. In a new incognito. Uh, yeah. I wonder if that's it cuz I, I do block popups.
I think I, or I used to, I had some, some setting. Oh wait, let me try this open 
moderator: link. I don't know, is this an incognito page? 
Participant 16: I'm not even sure how to do incognito. Uh, let me, yeah, I think I said it at some point to that and I'm wondering if that's what's going on now, but it's weird that I can't even open safari.
Right. 
moderator: Are you able to disconnect from your, um, wifi and use your data? That's a 
Participant 16: good idea. Yeah, I could try that if it doesn't work this time. Okay. It might be that, cuz the, the wifi is fast, but sometimes there's a lot of things happening at the same time it can't handle. All right, let me try that. Yeah, cuz you know, it actually something blocks my, um, my bank too.
So this is the only website maybe. Wait, let me try. Okay, so now I'm on data. Data.
Maybe this will work. It'll be slower, but sometimes is is more stable, actually. Okay. Which is weird. Well, let's 
moderator: see. We'll see. 
Participant 16: Maybe, yeah.
Sorry. It's wasting a lot of time. 
moderator: Oh, no, that's we, we built it in. We, we know how long it,
Participant 16: yes. See, it's only 3% now. It's gonna be while. Okay. It's just all right. Getting there. Yeah. It's definitely loading slower, but it's something different. It's a good idea actually.
It's like the wifi. Like if I was on a wired connection, I usually don't have this problem. But I think because I have so many smart machines, some things I've called my i s p like a dozen times and yeah, they've come over. Yeah, they can't seem to do very much. 
moderator: Okay. Okay. Oh, well we've, we tried it. That's fine.
We can head, uh, if you don't mind, if you have your desktop. 
Participant 16: Yeah. Lemme, well, lemme just get the error message cause, oh look, it's doing this, it didn't do this. Yeah, I don't, I don't remember doing this before. I like loading it. 
moderator: I'm thinking, I keep thinking at 
Participant 16: the end it's gonna have 
moderator: hope. What is that?
Right? I'm thinking it's the popup thing. If you hit the plus sign at the bottom of your screen, do you get the option for incognito? 
Participant 16: Oh, I never tried that. Uh, how do I do that? Plus, wondering 
moderator: if you would have it here, but I don't see it. Everything's, 
Participant 16: yeah, everything's slow right now cause it's trying to do too many things at the same time.
moderator: I think it's okay. We've can transition to, to laptop probably be a little easier. 
Participant 16: Hmm. Sorry. No. Okay. Well I'll start turning it up then. You want me to get on Zoom or do you want me to send the link directly? Um, you can, 
moderator: uh, if you can rejoin Zoom on your laptop, that would be great. All right. And I'll meet you.
Thanks for bearing with us through all of this. It's a lot. Yeah, 
Participant 16: no, it's, I feel bad too. Um.
So I'm on my desktop.
Okay. I just had the recording again. Oh, well it's op, it's trying to open Zoom, but, uh, takes everything, takes a little while. I have too many apps and both these things slow. 
moderator: No worries.
Well least the, 
Participant 16: uh, the, uh, what do you call it? You know, now that I, um, now that I close the sharing, let me try to see, I was able to get into Safari on my phone. Oh. I was also trying to open Zoom. I'll try to do two things. One, but let me try on. Safari one, 
moderator: you're on Safari on, um, your phone or desktop? 
Participant 16: Yeah, on my phone, which I wasn't able to do before when I was screen sharing.
So let me, it's just is loading this sketch website right now. It's just really, um, slow. It's like 33%. Let me just try this one thing and then I'll hop on Zoom
and uh, lemme see. Yeah, it's just super slow. Uh, let me get the meeting ID for Zoom just in case, cuz I think I can be joined for both my phone and from the thing right from, uh, my computer. I believe 
moderator: so it might make it a little slower, but you should be able to meaning an id. Yes. I believe, um, crystal from Perian can send you the link again, but let me ask,
Participant 16: oh, do you just have the, the number that we don? 
moderator: I don't, but let me see. Anyway, 
Participant 16: safari, uh, uh Okay. I could also send it directly, I think. Uh, 
moderator: okay. And if you have, 
Participant 16: I can find it in my email and I, I just don't wanna give up on the Safari cuz it's loading 73% now. It is. I we've never tried it on Safari on my phone, so I have a little hope that it might work.
No. Okay. I don't know. Wait. There, there's something popped up. I didn't get to read it. It looked like a little error message, but I'm not sure. Oh, whatever it is. It's not, yeah, it's trying again. It's, it looks 
moderator: like the same, yeah, this has happened before. I, I think it's a popup blocker issue, which is fine.
You know, we all have popup blocker. Ah, no worries. Um, I can, I don't even know how to turn that off. I actually, um, it's okay. I, I think I can, 
Participant 16: yeah, it's okay. I could get the zoom link and send it directly to my computer. I just need to get in my inbox again. 
moderator: Okay. And I have the now too. They sent it to me, so whatever is easiest for you.
Participant 16: What is that? Oh, the meeting number? Yeah. Can you just gimme the meeting number? That's probably the easiest. Yeah, it's 
moderator: 8 6 0 2 1 3 8 2 8 9 3. Mm-hmm.
Participant 16: Okay, that's it. 8 6 0 at 2 1 3 8 2 8 9 3. Perfect. Okay, I'm gonna try and join cause I think I'll be on both. You might hear some,
moderator: can you hear me now? Yeah, perfect. 
Participant 16: Okay, sorry, I don't, the phone's working.
Alright. Maybe I should turn off my voice at least. 
moderator: Yeah, you can. If you wanna leave the meeting on your phone, you can 
Participant 16: do that too. Okay, well, no I can't cuz then I, I have to have audio somewhere and it's giving me an echo so. 
moderator: Oh, interesting, because I can hear you from your desktop. 
Participant 16: Yeah. Okay. This is better.
Okay. So, um, still trying not to give up on my phone, but I think it's, it's not gonna help because, no, yeah. I think it's this popup blocker problem. I don't know why I'm so stubborn. 
moderator: No, that's ok. We also wanna test desktop, so it's, I mean, it's helpful either way, but I need to send you, uh, the desktop link.
Yeah, go ahead and do that now and pop that in the chat. 
Participant 16: Right. Okay. Oh, I need to share, right. Let me, well, let me see. Oh, it's loading much faster. Yep, I'm in already. Oh, great. Yeah. Let me share, uh, my screen. Remember how to do this on my. I did this before, just always, every time I'm, oh, there we go. That's right in the middle.
Yeah. Uh, share the desktop. 
moderator: Okay. I start. I see it now. Okay, great. I see your desktop. Perfect. Okay. Awesome. Thank you so much for bearing with us through that. I know it's a lot of hoops to jump through just to talk to somebody. No, I'm 
Participant 16: sorry it took so long on my phone. 
moderator: I don't. No problem. So, yeah, like I was saying before, um, you know, I just wanna kind of, we're gonna walk through this prototype together, um, and I want you to basically imagine yourself coming to this site to either learn about, this form, um, which again encompasses applying for disability compensation, um, or even start.
So I'm going to, um, and have you seen this page before? 
Participant 12: I think so. 
moderator: Okay. Right. Cuz you had mentioned that you had looked into, you had done some research, um, concerning the form. 
Participant 16: Yeah, but I don't think that this form was for me. So, uh, I, well I wasn't sure because it's, um, like I said, my injury is unrelated to, uh, service.
I see. 
moderator: So, yeah, I'd just kind of like you to imagine that you're here again to do some research. I'm gonna have you read this, um, well actually first I wanna ask you, after landing on this page, where do you think you would go first? 
Participant 16: Uh, after I read this, I would probably click this blue button. I don't know.
Can you see my cursor? 
moderator: I can't. It's great that you're pointing to what you can see. That's really helpful. 
Participant 16: Okay. Sign in to start or continue your application. Okay. 
moderator: Okay, so I'm gonna hold, I have you hold off on clicking just yet, but that's good to know. Um, I'm gonna have you read this first portion of the page up until that sign in button.
You can read out loud to yourself, you know, at your own pace. Um, but just let me know when you're finished reading and I'll ask you some questions. Um, if anything comes up for you that's confusing, feel free to pause and, and let me know as you go. Okay. 
Participant 16: Okay, so this is VA form 21 5 26 E z, which is equivalent to this other one V I mean, that looks the same numbers, uh, Yeah, so, um, use this file, uh, use this form to file a new claim or claim for increased disability, toxic exposure and PAC Act.
The PAC Act is a new law that expands benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits, agent orange and other toxic substances. By adding to the list of conditions we can automatically assume or presume was caused by your service. If this applies to you, we encourage you to file for benefits. Now, if you do so, this for, honestly, I would've stopped reading because I already know I'm wasn't exposed to any burn, burn injury.
But, yeah, I just quickly scan this. It, yeah, it's mostly about the PAC Act, which I don't think applies to me. 
moderator: Okay. Was anything confusing in the paragraph you read? 
Participant 16: Uh, I didn't read it super clearly, but I think that, uh, I mean, it seems like it's, it expands everything to be more generalized. So probably veterans who had to jump through a lot of hoops before for these kind of burn toxic injuries, uh, can now, uh, get it like a, the automatic, uh, um, criteria.
So that's, that's good for them. 
moderator: See. Is there any information you feel should be at, in this top section that is missing that would be more relevant to you? 
Participant 16: More relevant to me? Um, I mean, it's talking about toxic exposure. Mm. I mean, I, I feel like that's kind of just like a news update about this form. One aspect of this form.
I don't know if they really need to add anything about it. I mean, I guess it could be a little bit more general information about who qualifies for disability compensation and who doesn't. Cuz this I feel like, is a, just the new change. In who qualifies. But yeah, that's all I would say. 
moderator: I see. Okay. I'm gonna have you scroll down, um, a bit.
It should say, follow these steps to get started. Perfect. And I'm gonna have you do the same thing as before. Um, you can read section one and just let me know when you're finished. 
Participant 16: Okay. Yeah, I guess that, that if I just scrolled, cuz before on my phone I couldn't scroll. So. All right. Follow these steps to get you started.
Determine if this form is for you. So this is the information I needed. Use this form if you're filing a new claim. This is what we just read. Make sure you meet our eligibility requirements before you apply. You may be eligible for VA disability benefits or compensation if you meet these requirements.
Both of these must be true. You have a current illness or injury known as a condition that affects your mind of body and you served an active duty, uh, active. Duty for training or inactive duty training, and at least one of these must be true. You got sick or injured while serving in the military. You had an i illness or injury before you joined the military and serving made it worse.
Or you have a disability related to your active duty service that didn't appear until after you ended your service. A service connected injury or illness or injury you already had caused a new injury or illness. Uh, okay. Learn, uh, learn more about eligibility for va. Okay, so that's probably more specific.
You'll need to file a supplementary claim instead of this form. If either of these is true. We decided your claim in the past and you have documentation you didn't submit to us in the past or identify for us to gather. Um, that proves or disproves something in your claim or you are requesting a review of your claim based on the change in law such as the PACT Act.
Have you have been guaranteed benefits already or granted. So I guess that's thing that you can open. You haven't filing claim because your condition has worsened. You might want to check uh, maximum disability. Okay. Decide how you want to apply. 
moderator: Oh, I'll have you stop there just for now. Okay.
Um, so yeah, the section you just read, what would you say is the gist of this section? 
Participant 16: Uh, so these are the criteria about whether or not you're eligible to file, uh, with this form. Um, so the top section, both of these must be true, are kind of like, uh, there's, uh, both of them you have to satisfy.
Um, Yeah. So you have to be able to prove duty at some point, um, concurrent with your, uh, current illness or injury. Uh, and then one, so then the next section is one of those or more has to be true. So it has to, you just have to prove that it was, the illness or injury happened during your service or, uh, before you joined and service made it worse, or it didn't, uh, didn't appear until after you ended your service.
So that's kind of me, but I wasn't really sure if I qualified before when I looked at it. So, Reading it now I feel like I do qualify. Um, a service connected illness or injury, you have already c had caused a new injury or illness. I don't believe that that applies to me. Okay. 
moderator: E explain again which one you believe applies the best.
I think the third 
Participant 16: one, uh, the third of the second section cuz the first section, there's no getting around it. You have both have to apply. And I did serve on active duty, uh, and I do have a current illness. So, um, I know that the first criteria are both, uh, they're both, uh, it's easy for me to prove both of them.
Uh, in the second section. I believe the one that I would qualify through is number three. You have a disability related to your active duty, related to your active duty service that didn't appear until after you ended your service. Well, I guess my con confusion, uh, fusion is it's related to my service.
And I don't know how related it has to be, uh, because I mean, or, or maybe the first one. I think maybe the first one because I got sick while serving in the military. That seems like the broadest one to me but it wasn't related, so that's like, I don't feel like, yeah, like lupus wasn't caused by the military.
It was something that came about at some point, and I'm having difficulty proving the timeline of when it came about. 
moderator: Mm. I see. Um, and do you feel there is any service connection? 
Participant 16: I don't know. It's tough because lupus, even doctors don't know how much of a genetic component there is and how much of an environmental component there is.
I see. So, yeah, I, I don't know if it's related at all, but it's, I mean, the first one just sounds like, while would be good enough while it's just a timeline. Um, and I started having symptoms, but I wasn't diagnosed. I see. So that, that's the problem. Like I, I was, you know, but I was medically discharged based on arthritis symptoms.
They just didn't know what was causing it. Um, I see. I took a long time to figure out. Right. 
moderator: Okay. Thank you for breaking that, kinda breaking that down. I was anemic too. 
Participant 16: Yeah, I, I was anemic and I had arthritis and uh, eventually I had, I was hospitalized for lung problems. Oh. But, and that's when they started testing everything.
I mean, I wasn't even di diagnosed then until I got discharged. I saw a rheumatologist and they, they did all the tests and they said, you definitely have lupus. And now since I've been discharged, my symptoms have gotten worse. 
moderator: I see, I see. And I'm sorry to hear that. That's a lot. Yeah. Okay.
Well, thank you for explaining that, Cici. That kind of just helps me understand your thought process. Um, can I ask you, um, have you, you opened the alert that says, have you been granted benefits already? Why did, why did you open that? 
Participant 16: Um, because I did, I don't, I don't think I was, I was just curious about that more than anything.
I haven't been granted benefits, but I just was curious who, like, what that applied to. Mostly because it has a little exclamation point. It was different colors, so I was just curious about that box though. 
moderator: Okay, got it. Did you see information, the information that you saw wasn't what you were expecting to find?
Participant 16: No. It was what I was expecting to find. I just didn't, I didn't, I opened it thinking it didn't apply to me and I was right. It didn't really apply to me. 
moderator: Good to know. Have you heard of the term in the alert that says, um, claim for increase? 
Participant 16: Yeah, I saw that. 
moderator: Um, had you heard of that before? 
Participant 16: Mm. I'm not sure if I heard of it specifically, no.
 I assumed it was a. I don't know. Hmm. Actually I don't, yeah, I don't know. I, I guess I kind of thought maybe somebody would've, maybe I would be assigned a caseworker or something and they would just like monitor whether or not I, I had enough benefits, but maybe I'm giving them too much credit for that.
Cuz there's a lot of people who apply for this. So I guess you have to be the one to be proactive and, and in, you know, claim your own increase. I 
moderator: see. And was it clear from what you read here? You know, if you had to explain to someone else, what would you, how would you describe a supplemental claim? 
Participant 16: Um, a supplemental claim would be like if you already, uh, let's see.
Uh, okay, so if you already submitted a claim, You, uh, you can add to your claim somehow, and it's, I assume it's if you've already submitted your claim and you got rejected, but it doesn't say that we decided a claim in the past and your documentation you didn't submit to, they didn't say that it's was rejected.
 Like you're requesting a review of your claim based on a change in law. I, I kind of assume that that's for people who were rejected or they're still in the process. 
moderator: Could you assume it because you've heard that before? 
Participant 16: No, I haven't heard anything about supplemental claims.
moderator: Okay, so just from reading this, it kind of gave you that impression, is that right? 
Participant 16: Yeah, but it doesn't say if you were rejected, but I guess they don't say that because there's, it's probably a long process and there's probably people who are in the middle of the process and they have new, new evidence to submit.
So that, I kind of assume it's like that. But I would assume I don't, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong in the as assumption, but just that people who are already granted benefits would not file a supplemental claim in order to get more, but I'm, I'm not sure, like I feel like that's like the yellow box. 
moderator: I see.
So is it clear to you that a claim for increase is different from a supplemental claim? 
Participant 16: No, I wouldn't say from this. It is, I see there's, there's no information about a claim for increase except a yellow box, and there's no link for claim for increase. Is it a separate claim? I guess it is. 
moderator: It is a separate And that was interesting.
You said there's no link, um, for claim for increase. Is that what you were expecting? Yeah. 
Participant 16: Yeah. That would be nice in the box. Not for me necessarily, but for somebody else. Um, yeah, I, I think that that is a confusing point is that supplemental claim is for people who haven't been granted like a full re review for whatever reason.
Like maybe they, they either got rejected or they're still waiting in the process and uh, uh, they have new information to submit. And now hearing you talk, it sounds like there's like an increase form that's separate that for people who already successfully got disability, but their disability condition has changed.
moderator: Right. So is there a way you think we can make that clearer? You said we can add a link. 
Participant 16: Yeah. Uh, let's see. I mean, we have supplemental claim like this. I think they should have a se I mean this is, have you been granted benefits already with Oh, I see. It's clickable so I only knew that until I hovered usually I just for this underlined, uh, link, cuz I know that these are links, but this one I didn't know it was a link until I had, oh no, this isn't even a link.
This is just, sorry. Right. Just, uh, to open a box. So I think they should have a link just like file a supplemental claim. I think they should define the difference between a supplemental claim and an increased claim or whatever you call it. 
moderator: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, that's helpful to know. Um, for the sake of time, I'll just have you move on to section two, uh, for now, but I might come back to that if we have some time later.
Okay. Yeah, so same as before. You can read this portion. Um, feel free to call things out as you go and let me know when you're finished. 
Participant 16: Okay. Uh, decide how you want to apply. We'll take you through every, each step of the process online. You'll be able to answer the questions relevant to you, upload digital documents, and save your work in progress.
The time it takes you to complete your application depends on how many conditions you're claiming and how many documents you need to upload. You may choose to contact an accredited veteran services service officer in or, uh, to assist you with your application. If you need further assistance with the application process, you may also contact your State Office of Veterans Affairs.
Okay. Learn more. Uh, learn about other ways that you can file your disability claim. So this is, um, to me is walking you through the actual process. Um, and this is for people who need assistance. Um, I'm picturing mostly elderly people or people who might have trouble with English. Um, I actually did contact my V S O when I had a few questions because there was nobody to talk to directly from this.
So, uh, I, I did talk to them. They, they were kind of responsive, but yeah, I, I had, uh, like I said, I, I had a separate issue also, which was a change in status, so I kind of wanted to figure out the change in status before I did any disability, because it's kind of complicated if my status remains I didn't think I really qualified for much disability anyway, so, um, yeah, but I, I just had a little experience with that.
Like my local office was really, really nice. They were, they called me back like several times. I think the state office was a little harder, but you kind of expect that they handle a lot of people. 
moderator: I see. Did you find the VS L helpful? I think so. 
Participant 16: They, they were nice. They, um, they re redirect me back to the website.
I just had some questions about, you know, like if I need a, uh, a, a pro bono lawyer to, to handle anything if they had like, any resources for that kind of thing.
moderator: I see.
Participant 16: So they gave me some numbers. I was just asking for information. I wasn't asking for them to do my application for me. Got 
moderator: it. And to be clear, when you're, um, are you comfortable explaining what do you mean by status?
Um, Uh, 
Participant 16: I, I, I'm other than honorable discharge right now, and I didn't think that that was fair. Uh, so Oh, I see. I think that was actually what I talked about my last thing. So I, I felt like I had a unfair judgment about that because I, I feel like I served honorably and I, I had commendations. Um, that was a situation I, I don't really wanna go into here, but like, I, I couldn't control and I was accused of someone at something in the civilian world, and that was like later dismissed, um, by like a biased party.
I was accused, and at any rate, they. They didn't really know at the time, so they sent me like an O T H. Uh, they discharged me under an O T H and I was also like going through the medical problems anyway, so I, I didn't really pursue that because I was, uh, really stressed out from the medical problems already.
I was just glad to get outta the army, but looking back on it, I felt like I was shortchanged a lot of, uh, disability and other benefits too. So. 
moderator: I see. Yeah. That's a lot. Wow. Yeah. Yes. Thank, well, thank you for just explaining that a little bit for me. Um, okay. I will have you go on to section three. 
Participant 16: Okay. Will determine your disability compensation based on the nature and symptoms of the conditions you claimed severity, duration of the symptoms, and the impact of the condition or symptoms on your employment. We'll review relevant medical records from the va, medical centers and from private doctors or hospitals that, uh, that you identify and authorized to us to also ask you to complete an exam.
We strongly encourage you to submit documentation to help us understand how your injury or illness is connected to your service and how the condition impacts you and your ability to work. If we previously ga granted you benefits and your condition has worsened, we need documentation that shows the increase in severity and the effect that it has.
Had on you and your in ability to work to support your claim. You can upload documentation such as va, medical records and hospital records, blah, blah, blah. Private medical records, hospital reports, um, supporting statements. It could be from family members, friends, clergy members, uh, but these statements could tell us a lot more about your claimed condition and how it happened, how it got worse.
Okay.
Okay. Um, yeah, so, and, and this little section, are you currently in active duty? So that would, this time I'm gonna not click. 
moderator: That's fine. You can skip that. 
Participant 16: Yeah. Cause I know for sure that I don't qualify for this. Uh, if you apply here online, you'll also include in your application the necessary forms you will need if you're claiming post-traumatic.
Okay. So specific for PTSD, you are authorizing as to request private medical records. You can't, uh, work because of a disability related to your service. This is called individual unemployability. Okay. 
moderator: So if you had to summarize this section, what would you say? The gist of it 
Participant 16: is, uh, how to gather information and how to submit it and, uh, how, how they process information from different sources.
moderator: On a scale from one to 10, if you could rate this. Uh, on a scale of usefulness. So one is not at all useful and 10 is extremely useful, the most useful, where would you place this section? 
Participant 16: Uh,
a five, honestly, because I just feel like I kind of knew a lot of this and I just, I mean, I think the section at the top kind of summarizes everything, right? 
moderator: Is that the section one? 
Participant 16: no, I mean three. The section, yeah. Will, the bullet points will determine your disability. Okay. Got it. I mean, it's very similar to just general disability from SSI or something, but, um, Yeah, like, like it is just the nature of what your illness is, the severity and duration and the impact on your employment.
So, um, the other stuff I kind, I feel like it's kind of wordy. Um, 
moderator: can you point to which parts, just so I can understand which, where you're, what you're referring to? 
Participant 16: What parts are wordy? 
moderator: Yeah. Just to help me understand a bit more. Uh, 
Participant 16: like I think that the bullet points, va medical records and hospital records private me, uh, way to your Yeah, I mean, I, I don't think there's an explanation that's necessary to why you should submit the records.
moderator: I see. So if you could cut parts of this where, what would you sort of take out? 
Participant 16: I just have them make it bullet points. For me personally, it's very clear why I would submit all the medical records that I have. Like if I was going to apply, uh, I don't know, maybe some people need an explanation of why in that detail.
But I, I think it just kind of obvious that you need to submit some kind of medical records in order to get a claim approved. Okay. 
moderator: And just so I know, I'm making sure you're meaning the bullet points that say, um, let's see the increase. Oh wait. We strongly encourage you to submit documentation to help us understand are those, the, the, the bullet points under that section or the bullet points under to support your claim.
You can upload documentation. 
Participant 16: Yeah. Support your claim. You can upload documentation such as, I think they should have that section, but they just don't need, for me at least, they don't need the explanation next to va, like they should have va medical records and hospital records and then just move on to private medical records and hospital reports and then move on.
I think supporting statements, you, you'll notice when I read it out loud too, that was the one section that I read out loud because supporting statements are a little bit more detailed, but the other two kind of just go without saying and they say the same thing. These could relate to your acclaimed illness.
Like, like it's exactly the same. Okay next to it. So that doesn't, like, I don't know, who wouldn't understand that they have to submit medical records and that the, you should know that it's you. They allow both VA and non va, like private, like I think they should have them, but I don't think they need an explanation next to them.
I think you do need an explanation next to supporting statements, because I don't know what supporting statements means specifically, but now that I know that it's like letters from family and friends and you know, so on, um, that, that might be necessary to 
moderator: explain. Okay. Now I understand. 
Participant 16: Okay. Thank you.
Yeah, but I kinda skipped You're welcome. Yeah. I kind of skipped over the sentence that says, these could relate to your claimed illnesses, or they could show that your rate of disability has gotten worse. I mean, maybe they could put that in the top part to support your claim. You can upload documentations.
moderator: I see. And the information, you know, you already know about applying for disability compensation. Where have you gotten that information mostly? Was it the VSO that you spoke to or the state office? 
Participant 16: Uh, I looked for it myself when I initially, I spoke to the V S O for different reason, which was for the status issue.
So I, I'm just familiar with how to contact the VSO I, I, uh, yeah, I didn't contact them through this. I, I tried to do it on my, my own, but I just Googled it. Yeah, I kind of like looked for this website and I don't think I'm ready to apply yet because like I said, I have some status issues right now first that I have to clear up.
So I guess I'm missing the disability part, 
moderator: but No, that's fine. But yeah, that helps me understand. So you did your own research, you Googled, uh, what are some of the sources that you used to help you understand more about the process? Was it the VA website or blogs or any other source? It 
Participant 16: was just the VA web website.
I don't need to, you know, I mean, maybe if I got rejected I would seek out more of a community and find out more from other people. But every case is different. Like I said, I have some status issues, so I, I don't, you know, for obvious reasons, I don't really wanna make that public and go into detail about it unless I need to.
So, um, yeah. So I don't know, like. There are other times I go online like social media to seek out information like lupus, cuz there's a lot of information online about people who, you know, cuz I'm in like two subsets. I I'm a lupus, uh, patient and I'm also, uh, a veteran. So there's like two separate things.
It's hard to find somebody who suffers from lupus needing disability and is a veteran. Um, there's probably like a subset community I could find somewhere, but I haven't really looked and, and I think that my, my issues are very specific, so I haven't tried to, to look online because a lot of these blogs are just general or it's like people complaining about why they didn't, uh, get it.
So I don't know if that would help me, you know? I see. I think different people go through, yeah. They might get rejected for different reasons. Um, most of the information of lupus is from civilian rejections for disability from. You know, uh, just SSI 
moderator: I see. Um, I'm gonna have you for our last few minutes, go to section four.
I'll have you read that. 
Participant 16: Okay. Uh, apply. We'll take you through each of the steps of the process. When you start your application online, we'll declare your intent to file. This will reserve a potential effective day for when you get, could get, could start getting benefits. You have one year from the day you submit your intent to file, to complete your application.
After one year, you'll have to start a new application and your potential, uh, effective date will be reset. After you submit your claim here, you'll see a confirmation page. We won't send you another notification or receipt. We process applications in the order we've received them. It usually takes about three to four months for us to make a final decision on your claim, but it could take longer.
We'll contact you by phone or letter. If we need additional forms or information to support your claim. Please open and respond to any letters. Uh, you'll have up to one year after you submit your claim to submit additional documents. If we decide your claim before the end of the year, we might request that you submit a new application.
All right. Learn about uploading evidence, do I need additional forms? And then the rest is kind of like technical details about saving your work in progress. 
moderator: Okay. Yeah, you can skip that. Yeah, 
Participant 16: that's the end of the document. 
moderator: Yeah. So, um, yeah, this section, where would you rate this on a scale of usefulness?
Participant 16: I think this is useful. I think a nine. Because this gives like very specific timeline information about how long, like you can't drag your feet on it because after a year it's going to, um, like invalidate your first application. I see. And it gives you a timeline for when you might hear what, when you might expect to hear from them.
But like all government organizations, I realize that it could be really slow too. 
moderator: Got it, got it. Um, having read through this entire thing now, Cece, if you had to rate yourself in terms of like preparedness to, to start, um, an application online, uh, where would you place yourself? So if one is not at all prepared, 10 is, you know, extremely 
Participant 16: prepared?
Uh, I mean, it's tough for me because my situation's kind of complex. I told you, um, I. Yes, I would say a five. But it's not because of the website or you just asked me from the information on the website. Right. Okay. So let's say I settled my status and they approved something with my status. Um, then I would say, yeah, I would definitely say like a nine or 10 because yeah, like my preparedness has nothing to do with the website.
I think the website is informative enough. I just felt it was a little wordy in some sections, but, um, I know how to do it now if, yeah, when I'm, when I am ready because of my own personal circumstances, I would click here and sign in or start to, to start the process and then I'd create a login and just follow the steps, whatever they are.
moderator: I wanted to ask Cici, do you think that the VA asked for a reasonable amount of, uh, documentation for these claims? 
Participant 16: Uh, I mean, having kind of like applied for just government benefits before. Uh, I, mean, yeah, like they're definitely gonna need medical records. I just don't know in order to get it, how much it would actually be because they're telling me right now, but it could be something technical that they'll probably ask for more information.
If I know government agencies, it's, it is usually a whole frustrating thing where you submit everything that you have, but then they want more information or a missing one detail or date or something like that. So, but based on what I'm seeing here, I, yeah, I don't, I don't think, you know, they, they don't have a lot about your service record or anything like that, but I think that's mostly irrelevant to your disability claims.
So, um, I, I mean, I, I like that they're just focusing on the medical as suppose as gathering information. So, um, yeah. And I, I think it's, it's reasonable, yeah. Everything they're, they're asking, and I, I like that they're asking for supporting statements in case I have a, a lack or a, what do you call it?
Like a, uh, an um, like a void in my medical. I, I have to look again, but like certain times I, I don't even remember if I was seeing a doctor during that time, or I might be missing a hospital record. So it'd be nice to be, to support that with other statements if necessary. 
moderator: Well, thank you so much. Uh, C C I guess if I, I could have one more minute that I would just lastly ask you from what you see here, if status was not a, uh, was, you know, already settled, how long do you think it would take you to fill out the form digitally?
Participant 16: 
Well, I haven't seen the form, so I don't really know if it's like multi-page, but from what it sounds like it's mostly about documentation. So once I gathered the documentation, I think the form itself should be pretty standard, I'm guessing. So I am guessing if I reserve like an afternoon, I probably could fill out the form in an afternoon if I have all the, the, the information that they're looking for already.
So I would probably gather the information beforehand, which would take like maybe an hour or something. And I'm thinking maybe the form would just take a couple minutes. Because the, the information would be the hard part. I just have to go through different records, different whatever. But it sounds like, like a form shouldn't take me longer than 30 minutes.
moderator: Right. I, I hope. Okay. I see. Got it. Um, let's see. Cici, do you need to, do you need to go somewhere else? Do you have another obligation you need to hop to? 
Participant 16: Yeah, no, it's alright. I, I know we had a lot of technical issues in the beginning. Yeah, I don't, not right away. No. Okay. 
moderator: Well, if you have five more minutes, I'll have you scroll down to the bottom and if you could click start or sign into, start your application.
Okay. And then I'll have you go through this page. You can imagine you're, yes. Imagine you are active duty as you go through. Okay. 
Participant 16: Oops. Uh oh. No, I can't change. 
moderator: Oh, was it not 
Participant 16: letting you Yeah. Yeah. It too fast. I just did it for me. 
moderator: No, that's okay. If you click back in your browser, it should take you back a page.
Let's see. Did that work? No. No. Oh, okay. If you hit continue, what happens if I would've, 
Participant 16: oh, I was gonna say, maybe if I reload it. Oh yeah, 
moderator: let's try that. Try. No, it's our fault. I didn't have in, um, 
Participant 16: ability Go back. Yeah. No ability. Go back 
moderator: here, continue. 
Participant 16: Oh, no. Ability to continue, I guess. Oh, interesting. Oh, okay.
Oh, strange. Uh, trying to see if maybe I can get back to the original page. Like what, what if I click the link for the. It was in the chat, 
moderator: right? Oh, yeah. If you still have 
Participant 16: it. Okay. Yeah. But where did I go from there? No, so sign in, but I'm in Zoom right now. I'm screen sharing. Oh, go to chat. Okay. Here we go.
Let me try it again. Thank you. Sure. Oh, sorry. Okay. Your face here. Okay. There we go. It was start. Start. Yes, patient. Okay. Okay. Now I can do it. Are you gonna, okay, continue? 
moderator: Yes. Okay. Uh, you can read this portion. 
Participant 16: All right. When did you, when will, will you separate from active duty? This could be from, it could be a different date from when you, you're released from your contract or when your service obligation ends.
Okay. 
moderator: Is that sentence clear or unclear? 
Participant 16: Um,
I mean, they usually have a separation date in your paperwork when you're separated, "it's, it could be a different day from when you're released from your contract when your service obligation ends."
Yeah, I, I think it is because I would just go straight to my separation paperwork as I think most veterans would like.
That's very specific. So yeah, I would just look at the date for that. Most people know their separation date. Right. So 
moderator: you feel certain about what date you would put in this box, is that what you're saying? 
Participant 16: No, I would get that from my separation paperwork. 
moderator: Got it. Okay. I'll have you click continue.
Participant 16: "The application will be saved on every page based on the separation date. You can apply. No benefits. You have 90 days left until December 1st. Apply by benefits under the B D D program. Benefits delivery at discharge."
Okay, so it's at the discharge after this date, you can still apply for benefits using the va. So this is the form that we just discussed, although you will not be in the BDD program. Okay. So my understanding of this, reading it so far is that the BDD program kind of streamlines your disability from the point of discharge.
So if you already know you have some kind of disability at discharge, you can, you, like they, they will already, they already have a program in place, but if you forget or like somebody drops the ball on that, it's not too late, then you would go back and do the, the VA form. So that's my understanding of that.
moderator: I see. And was anything here clear, uh, unclear or, you know, confusing as you read? 
Participant 16: Not too much. No. I mean, I don't think so. You, you have 90 days left, so, so the BDD I believe means that you are clear that there's some disability issue or that you might be eligible. So you would file for that very close to your discharge date.
But if for some reason, like maybe it wasn't clear, you have a disability, you're still about to see medical, but you're not sure if you have an illness, um, then you, anything outside that window of 90 days, you will go through the VA form. So that's the way I'm reading it. 
moderator: I see, I see. And then, um, did you read this alert, um, about the health assessment?
Participant 16: Uh, no, I didn't read that yet. "Complete a separation health assessment part, a self-assessment. You need to submit a separation as part of your claim so that we can request your VA exam. Your claim will be delayed until we receive the self-assessment form. We estimate that it will take at least 30 minutes to complete it. We recommend you download and fill it out on a computer or desk laptop, then return to this 5 26 form to upload." 
Okay? So that's like the first step. If you are still active duty and you're going through this, this whole process. 
moderator: Thanks so much, Cece. Before we, uh, close any last things we should know about, um, what you would like to see here in order to feel more prepared or what you think veterans would need to see to feel prepared to start the form on their own.
Participant 16: Mm. I mean, in my situation, no. Um, I'm trying to think of all veterans. Um, I think it's, I mean it's always confusing. There's a lot of red tape involved. I think for like my, my generation, I'm a little bit older, but I'm pretty computer savvy, I think. So I feel comfortable doing a lot of online forms, but a lot of veterans of, uh, prior wars, like, like Vietnam and Korean veterans, um, I think that they have like a technology barrier and all this would be really confusing.
Um, yeah, I don't, I don't know if the, the stuff about the V S O and everything could be like, placed higher up for them because it was kind of like in the middle of that first page where, I don't know, I just, I, I, I work with a lot of senior citizens and I helped them, uh, I helped them, uh, during covid, uh, get like vaccines, uh, in my state.
It was really, really difficult and everything was online and they just didn't have any of the tools to be able to help, you know. So I just went, uh, I, and like thousands of volunteers in this group, we, um, decided we were gonna like do our own thing cuz um, a lot of like younger people are trying to like hop over the elderly who really needed vaccines. So I, I do know about this technology barrier issue with senior citizens, so I try to help them, like I, I helped my neighbors and my parents, like, they just had a lot of difficulty navigating website forms. Uh, especially when there's a time component, at least here, you can slowly read it. With the Covid vaccines, it was like, you need to do it within seconds and if you didn't do it, you couldn't get a vaccine.
So, um, So here, I mean, I, I think it's just like a lot of them get confused easily with like different, you know, so I don't know. Maybe have a box like where you, like, at the top of the first page, like if you, uh, would like to apply in person, you know, like here are some options if you'd like to get like a paper form if you'd like assistance.
Um, if English is not your first language, you know, your difficulty, we can get a translator. I, I don't know if like any people who are otherwise, um, Uh, uh, like, I don't wanna say handicapped, but disadvantaged individuals I guess. And, uh, kind of like larger text maybe. I see maybe something that pops up in the corner.
It's like, really? You know, cuz cuz I don't need to read all that. I, I feel comfortable enough just clicking the thing. But yeah, if, if it's something like, you know, you don't feel comfortable filling in online form or you need assistance, like something with big bolded letters and it's like a different color, so right at the top, I don't know, it's just a suggestion.
moderator: But No, I, I'm happy to hear those suggestions. It's really important for us to hear. 
Participant 16: I, I think the majority of people, they don't need it, so it should be one of these like, uh, what do you call 'em? The, the box where it opens up. But I see like I could just ignore it and could scroll, scroll past it. It doesn't take up much room, but you know, Right.
moderator: Okay. That makes sense. Well, thank you again, Cici. This was very, very helpful. You know, just hearing you go into detail, um, you know, I really, really appreciate it. Um, Perian is gonna reach out to you about compensation. If you know other vets who are opinionated like you and, and like, like to share, um, please, please, please refer them.
We really wanna hear from, um, you know, more events to just kind of improve and improve, improve this experience. So thank you again, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. Okay. 
Participant 16: Thank you so much. Okay. Bye-bye. All right. Bye-bye. Nice to
