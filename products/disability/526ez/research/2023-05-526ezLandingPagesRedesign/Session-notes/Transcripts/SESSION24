Session 19

moderator: You can record. Awesome. And you heard that notification? 
Participant 19: Yes. And I just clicked on the, the popup saying Got it. Versus leave meeting. 
moderator: Awesome, thank you. Um, okay, so before we jump in, can you tell me a little bit about, um, your experience with va.gov, if any? Do you use the website, do you not use it? 
Participant 19: Um, the, I do, I do use it.
Uh, it has, uh, The single sign-on is actually much better than having to previously have like four different usernames and passwords to, to manipulate and get to where you're going. So I really appreciate that. Um, so there's, uh, and it's slowly integrating everything into the one website. Uh, so, so that's good.
Got it. Uh, that's what I like about it anyway. Okay. 
moderator: And that's good to know. And you had mentioned that you, you weren't familiar with the 5 26 easy form, uh, specifically, but I did just wanna ask, have you ever applied for any benefit, even if it wasn't, uh, a disability, uh, benefit or compensation? Yes. Okay.
Good to know. Thank you. That just helps. Give me a little bit of context. And did you apply for that, um, benefit online or, um, in person or any other? That 
Participant 19: was, uh, that was in person, um, through a, uh, A V S O and we had to write it down on paper, make copies, send, send it in. So this was, I don't even know, at least 10 years ago, when.
Doing. Doing things. 
moderator: Okay. That's good to know. Okay. All right. Well, I think we're ready to jump in. Thomas. I'm just gonna, I'm gonna pop the link to the prototype in the chat to see if you're able to open it. It doesn't always work on mobile. We like to get feedback on when people are on their cell phones, but we'll just see how 
Participant 19: it goes.
Let's see here. I'm opening up sketch com. 
moderator: It might take loading lot to load's loading. Yeah. 
Participant 19: Okay, there it goes. File for disability compensation with V8 form 21 dash 5 26 Z. 
moderator: Great. And are you able to share your screen? 
Participant 19: Uh, let's see here. 
moderator: I can walk you through it if, if if's not, uh, 
Participant 19: it should be, yeah. Yeah.
If you could walk me through that. Let go to the zoom. 
moderator: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. There should either, they'll either be like a green button at the bottom that says share screen or broadcast. But if you don't see that, there should be like three dots for the menu On the right I do 
Participant 19: see the, I see the little three.menu.
Oh, shoot.
Take your time. Oh, there goes, uh, share, share screen. Okay. Share screen broadcast. Start broadcast. Okay. 3, 2, 1. Countdown. It says that I'm nice, so I broadcasting. Let me go over to here. Perfect. Okay. 
moderator: Feel free to move my face out of the way if it helps. Um, Great. Here we are. So, yeah, I guess my, my first question is, after landing on this page, what are, what, what would you do?
Kind of just wanna observe what you would do when after 
Participant 19: landing. So after getting to this page, I would actually, I would read it, uh, which is what I'm trying to do now. Uh, I've heard of the PAC deck and the toxic exposure stuff stuff. Uh, let's see here.
Okay.
Okay. So after reading that, then if this were to apply to me, then take a look at these things here. Mm-hmm. 
moderator: So you probably go through those 
Participant 19: as well. Oh, yes. Yeah. I, I mean, when I see, if you know, Just make sure that this is applicable. Right, 
moderator: that makes sense. Awesome. I did notice that you scrolled past the sign in button.
Can you tell me what you were thinking when you saw that? 
Participant 19: Well, so I, I saw the sign in button. The sign in to starter, continue your application. Right. So I haven't, I don't want to start. The application, and I obviously have, I, if I have never started this, I can't continue it. So I wouldn't sign in until after.
For me, I wouldn't sign in until knowing, uh, what this was all about so that I could then read what it was and then see if it's something that I want to, uh, uh, apply for and work, work, work through. 
moderator: Got it. Okay. So I'll have you scroll back up to the very top, and I'm actually gonna kind of have us read each section of this.
Okay. We'll, we'll start with that, that first section up to, um, the sign-in button you can read to yourself out loud at your own pace. Um, if something sticks out to you though as you're going through it or a question arises, you can let me know. 
Participant 19: Okay. Uh, so right here where it says burn pits Right and Other Agent Orange, other toxic substances, um, Me personally, I, well, I've never been exposed to Agent Orange.
Uh, I was not exposed to large burn pits like out in, uh, Iraq and Afghanistan, which this has generally been. I think that's what really pushed for this. And it says other toxic substances. I was a, uh, mortar man for a number of years, uh, in the Marine Corps infantry. And so our mortar rounds have these, uh, Little, they look like small donuts with the little, they look like little seed donuts.
Mm. Uh, and those are filled with, uh, black powder. And so when we would launch our, uh, our munitions, um, they would, I think, oh God, I think there was like five or six on there and 
moderator: Oh, uh oh.
Okay, I think we just got disconnected everyone, so we'll just give him a minute to rejoin.
Hopefully he is not talking for too long before he realizes that we're not there.
Okay, here we go.
Hi. Sorry, we got disconnected. 
Participant 19: Yeah, so I'm gonna start my video again. Okay. And then, let's see here. Uh, go back to share screen, start broadcast.
Let's see here.
Okay, so back over here at the, uh, at the webpage. So like specifically for me, I was talking about, uh, so on these mortar rounds they have, uh, these little C-looking. Uh, almost like donuts, a little yellow donut type things that look like a letter C that are filled with black powder. So we would have to remove charges as necessary to get our correct, uh, elevation and distance to, uh, to hit the, to hit and destroy targets.
So we would have hundreds and hundreds of these, um, Uh, after various, uh, fire missions in, in, in training and whatnot. And then all we would do is we'd go dig a little hole, drop 'em all in there, and, uh, then, uh, break a few open. And then, you know, like old westerns we'd have this, uh, line of black powder going out.
Mm-hmm. So that it's not. Super intense and in our face, you know, right next to us. But we'd, we'd drag it out, you know, a few feet, light it on fire, and then just like, oh, Wiley Coyote, it would be, uh, a little fire, uh, of, uh, gunpowder or black powder, uh, to this pit of hundreds and hundreds of donuts. And then they'd sit there and burn for a few minutes and, That's the way we did things.
Um, I don't know if they still do it that way. So, and we would do this all the time, every day, uh, every day that we had, uh, had fire missions or, or training where we were shooting live rounds. So I don't know if, uh, where it's just got the three where it reads, burn pits, other.
Agent orange and other toxic substances. 
moderator: Mm-hmm.
Am I hearing you right that it, you're saying you're not sure if it applies to this situation? 
Participant 19: Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm just No, it's okay. I'm thinking about my buddies that it make it back. 
moderator: I'm really sorry. I don't, I'm so sorry about that. I know that's really hard.
Mm-hmm. 
Participant 19: So I don't know if it applies to me or not cuz it's not very uh,
The paragraph on it is not very, does not seem very inclusive. It's just very, uh, you know, a broad statement. I see. Uh, or, not say broad, but it's very, uh, finite with other toxic substances uh, agent orange and burn pits. So does the burning of, uh, of powder uh, From live fire exercises, does that constitute burn pit or is it giant burn pits that are, uh, garbage and human waste and all that other stuff?
Plastic and whatnot. 
moderator: I see. Okay. So it's like, it's sounding like you wanna see, you would wanna see more of that information here. 
Participant 19: Yeah. Like. Yeah, cuz other toxic substances, I mean, well, what do they mean? Like, is that like just potential exposure to, uh, asbestos because of living in, you know, fricking old barracks and we know that it's got you asbestos insulation or, you know, is it, you know, what the water at Camp Lejeune or, or what, what is other toxic substances?
Um, So I'm, I'm just, I'm curious about 
moderator: that. No, that makes sense. Yeah, no, that makes sense. Okay. I'm gonna have us move on to the next session. Before we do, Thomas, do you wanna grab water? Do you or anything before we, before we move on? 
Participant 19: No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'll move on. I, 
moderator: okay. All right. So, um, I'll have you scroll down.
Um, and, and one last thing. I guess if you had to rate that section on a scale, a usefulness scale, so one's not at all useful, 10 is extremely useful, where would you place that first 
Participant 19: section? I'd probably, I'd probably drop it in as like somewhere between six seven. Um, because it does give you, it gives people information, um, is, it's just not, um, It's just, in my opinion, it's just very specific information.
And if you don't know, like there's no link out, no hyperlink to, you know, what is the, the PACT act? You know, it just says PACT Act, oh, burn toxic substances. Well, what's the law? What are the presumptives in the law? What are the, uh, other toxic substances in the law? Is it, does it include fire? The, the firefighting foam?
Uh, that 3M is being sued for right now? Is it the, uh, is it, uh, jet fuel? Is it, you know, any number of other things that, uh, that the military uses where, you know, OSHA would have a heart attack about, but since it's the Department of Defense, they don't fall under the same OSHA regulations. 
moderator: I see. Okay. I understand.
Can you, sorry, can you scroll back up for a second, Thomas? I'm wondering when did you notice that link at the very bottom, learn more about the PACT Act and what is now presumptive? 
Participant 19: So I saw that. Um, 
moderator: did you think it would, did you, did you expect it to be helpful or answer any of the other questions you were having?
Participant 19: No. The reason that I say no is that, uh, Uh, when there's talking about the presumptives, I know that, uh, I generally, it's been my understanding that the presumptives is the, um, the manifestation of the, the issue. So like a presumptive being, okay, well, you know, exposure to Agent Orange is, uh, Um, you know, it can cause various neurological disorders.
So that, and saying, okay, well you've been exposed to Agent Orange. We can't necessarily prove or disprove that, uh, you have some sort of, uh, neurological disorder, um, based on that. But we're gonna presume that it is, it's not necessarily, the presumptives aren't typically like the causal, um, It's just, okay, because you were exposed to this, we're just gonna go ahead and assume that, that, uh, it was, this was the, the, the cause.
But it doesn't say like, it's like, or the presump, uh, presumptive or like, uh, uh, let's see here. Uh, agent Orange can cause, you know, breathing issues and we say, oh, well you've got breathing issues, so we're just gonna assume that it was due to Agent Orange. But, you know, on the. Going back to the, uh, the other, mm-hmm.
Substances. That's the thing. Well, okay, now if I have breathing issues, was it, are we gonna presume that your breathing issues were caused by the burning of, of, uh, black powder and unexploded ordinance or, uh, or whatnot? It's not, uh, that's my understanding of how the presumptives work. We're just gonna presume that.
Your health issue was due to exposure, but not necessarily what the exposure was like, what are the exposure, um, items. 
moderator: I see. Okay. I see. Okay. Well probably come back to that cuz I think I wanna understand that a little bit more. But for now, um, I'll have you go down, um, to the first step you were looking at.
Mm-hmm.
And I'll have you read this, um, just like before. Okay. If you can, um, actually no. Yeah, that's fine. 
Participant 19: Mm-hmm.
Okay. Uh,
okay. What's 
moderator: your first impression of the, of this 
Participant 19: text here? So the text, um,
So for this text, it's okay. So on this first, both of these must be true. Uh, it's pretty finite, uh, as far as, you know. It's like if it's one but not the other, then you're, you're dq, you're disqualified from it. But if both of them are true, Then it gets into the, uh, the, and so both those are true. Then you also have to have at least one of these.
Uh, and, um,
so I mean, that's fair in my, in my opinion, it's pretty, uh, self-explanatory as far as reading this portion. Um, And so this helps understand this upper portion here where it says Toxic Exposure Impact Act. Uh, but we are working on one portion at a time. So this does help explain some of the questions that I, I've had, uh, that I, that I brought up.
Uh, so. 
moderator: Can you explain a little bit more, like exactly what does it answer for 
Participant 19: you? What does it, do you have a current illness or injury affects your minor body? So do I have, like, let's just say I have, um,
 Let's just say that I never had any type of, uh, seasonal allergies prior to joining the military. Then joining the military, you know, I started developing seasonal allergies, um, and uh, then getting out of the military. Seasonal allergies still exist. Um, that could potentially be due to exposure to toxic substances and potentially be, could potentially be, you know, what I was speaking about in my real world experience in the Marine Corps was burning, unexploded ordinance, uh, specifically the, uh, black powder, for mortar rounds. So it could potentially, uh, be, uh,
presumptive for me. 
moderator: I see. Okay. Got it. Okay, that makes sense. So, That makes sense. Was anything in this section unclear, confusing? 
Participant 19: Sometimes the verbiage used with any of these things, cuz they're, it's quasi legal, uh, because, you know, so these things are sometimes just slightly confusing. So
like, for some people, even for me, Um, like how would I know if I have a disability related to active service that didn't appear until after my service ended? How would I know that that disability is related to my active service without previously having to go through, um, uh, like a, uh, disability and compensation board and, and or, uh, uh, Physical, physical exam.
So I wouldn't know. Uh, 
moderator: so when you're saying, uh, and correct me if I'm wrong, when you say quasi legal, is it just making a lot of assumptions about who is reading this or what do you mean by, can you gimme an example? 
Participant 19: So, uh, what I mean is like for quasi legal, it's not very,
So one of the things that we would always say in the Marine Corps is, um, break it down Barney style, right? Because not everybody is same intellectual level. 
So it's like, kinda like it's already been either diagnosed or presumed or something to the, to, to, uh, what is it? One of the. Freaking, uh, part of the verbiage that that is used greater, greater than 50% chance, greater than 50% probability that it was due to military service. Right? So it's like, what's, how, how would anybody already know if, you know, it's like many people that I know in the Marine Corps, uh, that I served with, you know, they get out and, you know, it's like, We didn't go to, we didn't go to medical.
It's the, the corporate culture of the Marine Corps, especially in the infantry, is suck it up. Drive on. Mm-hmm. If pain is every day, you know, and, uh, so then you don't go to medical and so then when you get out, there's nothing for you to fall back on for potential, um, disability and compensation benefits.
I see. Because you need medical. And so then, you know, you're like, okay, well then it gives a sour taste, uh, to some people. And they're like, well, F the va, they don't care anyhow, so they never go back. Uh, and so that's what, that's what I'm saying on specifically on bullet three. Got it. 
moderator: If you could explain it to somebody, how would you phrase it?
Participant 19: Uh, it's like if you have an issue that you believe is related to your military service that didn't appear that, uh, that appeared even after you got out, apply and then let the, the medical officials make that determination if it's related or not. If you think it is, apply. And then it weeded out on the back end, but on the front end accept everybody back, end, get it, you know, get it, uh, get it squared away.
moderator: Got it. Any of these other phrases you think could be clearer?
Participant 19: The fourth one is kinda, kinda confusing. Um. Well, I should say it could be kind of confusing for some people. If you have a service connected illness or injuries, uh, that caused a new illness or injury, um, you know, it's like I would venture to say that, uh, there's a number of people who are unaware that.
You know, um, one injury has caused a second, like, let's say, you know, uh, bad ankle, uh, can cause over time, knee problems, well, that knee problem can over time cause a hip problem. Well, that hip problem time can cause a back problem. And then now you're, you know, you're sitting there and you got back problems, can't sleep.
Your, your hip hurts. Your knee hurts, you know your ankle hurts. And then you're the crotty old man down the street that nobody wants to talk to because he's the old, crotchety old man. But no one knows why, cuz everything freaking hurts. 
moderator: I see. It's kind of like, you might not be sure, correct if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're saying, you know, a, a veteran might not be sure where it started.
Participant 19: Exactly. Exactly Where it starts, where it ends, you know, it's like, did did my knee problem cause my hip problem? Did my hip problem cause my back problem? Or did my back problem cause these other problems or did my, you know, uh, okay. Um, Because saying right here where it says caused, that's pretty definitive that that, you know, or that some medical professional said, okay, your service connected injury illness caused this other thing.
moderator: Okay, so in the case of like you, like a veteran receives a rating and they know that it was determined maybe by the va. That it's service connected. Mm-hmm. Um, and that, you know, so they know that, you know, they had a service connected illness. Um, you know, then maybe we could make that more clear that this is for people who already potentially have a, you know, decisive, like understanding that they have a service connected illness.
Participant 19: Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, exactly. And yeah, that, yeah, that would be good. Uh, a service connect illness or injury that you already had, which caused a new injury or illness? Yeah, that's just, I don't know. I think maybe that verb is, is just a little,
uh, maybe it's a little, just a little bit too complicated, even though it's a short sentence. Just, um, 
moderator: so. Is there a specific word you think? Like the surface connected or, um, the use of, or in the sentence, like a lot of, or like is there something there that you feel like might trip people up 
Participant 19: or it's just that, that, you know, it's right there.
It's, uh, after, uh, caused, you know, suspect illness or injury, uh, caused a new i injury or illness because using the word caused in my opinion, Um, denotes fact. I see. So right when it might not be. Yeah, because that, you know, because it, it might exactly, it might not be, so service connect, injury, illness you already had may have caused a new injury or illness.
And again, this goes back to the third bullet, you know? Right. 
moderator: Okay. Yeah, it's 
Participant 19: similar. Uh, go ahead and apply and then we'll figure it out on the back end, uh, with the, with the medical exam. Got 
moderator: it. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah. Thank you for just kind of breaking that down for me, cuz that helps. Um, did you see the section about the supplemental claim?
Participant 19: I did. Uh, so yeah, this is, yeah, like if the VA has previously denied a claim, um, like say, uh, Somebody, somebody puts in a claim for, uh, sleep apnea and then, uh, and it was previously denied, and then, well, now the PACT Act says, well, that may be on the presumptive list, so let's go ahead and get you checked out.
Did you, you know, X, Y, and Z exposed to A, B, and C And then, uh, Okay. Now, all of a sudden, um, because you were exposed to various toxic substances, this is on a, and I'm not saying that sleep apnea is on the presumptive list, but uh, yeah, now it is. It's on the presumptive list because of things you were exposed to.
So now we're gonna go back in and change that, uh, denial to a, uh, to a granted. 
moderator: Got it. Have you heard of a supplemental? Had you heard of a supplemental claim before? 
Participant 19: No. I don't know what else I, no, I don't know. All right. 
moderator: Um, how, uh, how did you know that you have to be DEI denied first?
Participant 19: Cause right here it says, we decided your claim in the past and you have documentation you didn't submit. So, um, that proves or disproves something in your claim. So, To me, for me, I just kind of understood that as, okay, well basically, um, we decided in your claim in the past saying that basically they denied it.
Um, and then now there's this new information, new law saying, okay, well let's just go ahead and take l uh, and review it because based a little bit between bullet one and bullet two, um, because the PACT act changed some stuff, so. And also I've had friends that, uh, have put in, I didn't know it was called a supplemental claim, but they've filed claims that have been denied, and then years and decades later, they're like, okay, well yeah, I, we've been fighting it or, or whatnot.
And yeah. Now we're gonna go ahead and grant it to you. I didn't know that was called a supplemental claim. When you go back into, uh, um, to, I guess, uh, Review or fight a denial. I
moderator: see. Okay. Um, I'm gonna have you open the yellow alert there and read that as well,
Participant 19: okay
moderator: is this what you expected to see before you clicked on this? 
Participant 19: I expect to see something, uh, I'm not necessarily saying that, but basically this says that, uh, in my opinion, what this means. Is it whatever you have, is it already on the presumptive list? And if so, is it at the maximum for that, uh, for that condition?
Um, And if not, you can do, you could potentially file a claim for an increase. Um, so, um, no. Yeah, this is pretty, in my opinion, this is fine. This is pretty self-explanatory. Um, yeah. Cause I mean, And what I'm reading this as is, you know, there's different levels of,
of let's say like post-traumatic stress, you know, how what is the, uh, as an individual, what is, what is their, um, level of disability? Is it more along the lines of like some sort of, uh, you know, just some anxiety? Is it that. It's, you know, dang near debilitating to the, for them that they can't even go outside or can they, you know, is it just like daily stress?
They get, you know, driving around, always kind, not always looking over their shoulder, but, you know, doing different things. See something on the side of the road, like a broken down car or dead animal, and then they changed to the furthest lane away. Is it something like that? Or is it like, you know, if they're driving and they see that, then they start to freak out and then they gotta pull over somewhere and they're having an anxiety attack or a panic attack?
Or is it something to the effect where somebody can't, their mind has never left and they're stuck home? 
moderator: I see. You're saying, you know, the severity, and correct me if I'm wrong, but are you saying the severity of the disability, that's kind of like related to the. What you're reading about maximum disability ratings, 
Participant 19: correct?
Yeah. Correct. I see. So let's say you got like sleep apnea. I don't know what it is, uh, what the maximum on that is, but let's just say it's, uh, 30%. Right. Okay. And you're receiving 20%. And I don't even know if these numbers make any sense or if they're even valid, but just using them for the, um, Right, right.
For, for, for this example. So then you could potentially, uh, uh, file that supplemental claim to get that increase from a 20 to 30%. Okay. Is 
moderator: it, um, clear here? So a claim for increase is different from a supplemental claim. Okay. Is how clear is 
Participant 19: that to you? I did not know at all that there's a claim for increases different from a supplemental claim.
moderator: Is there a way you think they can make that clearer in this section? 
Participant 19: Um, maybe having, uh, some sort of, um, uh, hyperlink that may have the definition, uh, both the legal definition and like a lay definition of. Supplemental claim and claim for increase, uh, that might help because I had absolutely no idea that those were different things.
Right. 
moderator: So when you were reading claim for Increase, what were you thinking? 
Participant 19: It was? I thought for me it was like, okay, um, You know, filing a claim to, you know, increase it, but I didn't know like there's a separate form or, or whatnot. I thought maybe it's like the supplemental claim, uh, because even here it says on the supplemental claim, we decided your claim, you know, maybe it wasn't as high as somebody thought it was gonna be, or it was completely denied.
And I thought, okay, maybe just in reading this section in 20, 30 seconds, thought that, uh, They were different or they were the same, but they're not. They're different. Got 
moderator: it. Makes sense. Sense. Yeah. We've heard that before. That makes sense. All right. I'm gonna have you go on to section two.
Participant 19: Okay. Decide how you want to apply.
Okay. 
moderator: Anything unclear or confusing here? 
Participant 19: No. I didn't know the vs. O was veteran service officer. I thought it was a. Veteran Service organization, unless it's the same, 
moderator: it's both. I think so. You, you feel right? 
Participant 19: Yeah. Okay. Um, yeah, no, I think that, that, that's, uh, I don't have any confusion or issue with, uh, section two.
Okay. 
moderator: Can I ask you, um, in your, um, opinion, is there a difference between the word condition and disability?
Participant 19: Um, yes, because the condition is,
does not necessarily mean, uh, that, uh, for the purpose of the va, a condition does not necessarily mean that it is, uh, Compensable disability, in my opinion. And also the word condition to disability outside the va, you may have a condition, but that does not, uh, that does not afford you protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act because that condition is not one of the finite things.
Uh, one of the finite disabilities listed under the A D A. Got it. 
moderator: Okay.
You see me look into the slide? I've just taken a few notes. Okay. All right. I'm gonna have us go on to section three. 
Participant 19: Okay.
One thing I don't like is when opening these up, uh, af it's like, Oh, right. It 
moderator: takes you to the top. 
Participant 19: Right. Then I open up three. Then it takes me back up to the top. Then I gotta scroll back down. 
moderator: Right. Yeah. I think that's a prototype thing. I don't think, you know, hopefully we don't have that in the real.
Participant 19: In the real, yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, this is, uh, in my opinion, this is all pretty easy. It's just stating, Hey, we're gonna. On the gather information, this is like, they, they're gonna take a look at any, uh, any and all medical records they have and anything that you provide, uh, for medical records if you're gonna get any, uh, swo, um, supporting statements.
I guess these have to probably be sworn before somebody, uh, uh 
moderator: oh. Uh, what 
Participant 19: made you say that? Because a supporting statement, well maybe say they probably have to be sworn before somebody because I mean, you can have any Tom, Dick, or Harry write a statement that doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be true.
But if, uh, you know, you're talking about the federal government here, right? And making false official statements is, you know, uh, is a crime. So if. You know, it's like if you swear before, let's just say a, um, what do you call 'em? A notary public, that what you're stating is true Then, you know, and then you, you and your friend or whatever, uh, or your friend submits it and then it's turned out to be false.
Then, you know, that's, you know, your, your buddy could. Your friend or whomever one of these people could be, could be in trouble. Um, and, uh, cause you don't want, if there's no,
there are people who will take advantage of the system if there are no, if there's no, uh, recourse for false filings and providing false information. So that's why I made that about, uh, you know, uh, a sworn statement sworn before somebody, whether it's uh, um, notary or, or whatnot. 
moderator: Got it. Okay. That makes sense.
Uh, yeah, thanks for explaining that. Uh, anything else stick out to you here in this section?
Participant 19: No, I mean, I just, no, nothing. I just, I've just, you know, in my, in, in my mind I'm thinking to say, well, like, what if it was somebody like me that who got out 25 years ago, 20 years ago? And um, you know, it's like you got your buddies, but dang, they can't remember. That's 20 something years ago. And like, how do you, how if, if, and then going back to the whole thing, like where I previous said, you know, the, uh, corporate culture, the Marine Corps infantry is don't go to medical.
You're weakling if you do, and we're gonna, we're gonna haze you even more, uh, cetera, et cetera. Um, you know, and then your buddies don't remember you hurting. I was like, Cause it's not their body. Like how the, how the heck do you do you do that? Uh, but like I said, that's just something that that popped up in my head.
Cause I mean, I can barely remember what the hell I wore three days ago. I mean, how am I supposed to remember one of my buddies that, uh, yeah, I don't know. Uh, started. Having nose bleeds her. And I'm just making that, I have a friend who has random nosebleeds, but how can I say that? Uh, you know, it's like, you know that, that his nose bleeding was, uh, related to military service.
You know, it's like he wasn't in the military. I'm just saying. He just, right. No. 
moderator: Yeah. But just as an example. 
Participant 19: Yeah. Well, like, but I haven't seen him in 20 years. How am I supposed to say? Oh yeah, I remember his nose was bleeding. But I didn't know it was caused by this or that. So how would I make that, um, as a friend, how would I, uh, make how would I write a statement on that, but Right.
moderator: Do you expect the VA to do, its like, how likely do you think the VA is to do its due diligence when it comes to doing, collecting whatever documentation they can and making a case? 
Participant 19: I think it's, honestly, I think it's hit or miss and it absolutely depends on, um, you know, uh, who is reviewing the documentation.
Cause I've got some friends who, you know, were rated, you know, a hundred percent, a hundred percent disabled. Um, uh, and, uh, employable. And then, you know, seemingly there's nothing dang wrong with them. But then I've got some other friends who are, you know, it's like broken bodies, uh, and, uh, you know, they're like 30% and they've been fighting the VA for years.
So I honestly think who is, who is the, uh, the person or people that, uh, it gets to, I believe that sometimes those whomever it is, whatever they're called, they, uh, they don't hold the data to the same standard. 
moderator: I see. I see. And can I ask as a result of that, you know, is it, do you feel the onus is on the veteran to kind of build the best 
Participant 19: case?
It is on the veteran to build the best case. Um, in, in any situation, the, the onus is on the veteran to file claims to go to medical, et cetera, et cetera. I, it just think that it's kind of, it's that whole catch 22, uh, it's a catch 22 type of situation though. Um, you wanna be, and, and I'm only speaking from my position in the infantry is like, you wanna be a good marine, you wanna be a strong marine, so you don't go to medical. But then years later you're like, dang, my back hurts. And you know, uh, and
it's like, oh wow, there's an x-ray. They x-rayed my back. And it's like, okay, well I have a, uh, I have a spinal compression at S one L five and, uh, well, how do I say that? That was, how do I say that was military service when I never went to medical. Like yeah, I carried, I would carry, you know, 50, 80, a hundred pounds of, of gear on me walking up and down stupid ass mountains and, uh, In, uh, camp Pendleton, but if I never went to medical saying, you know, I was like, oh, my back hurts.
Well, everybody's damn back hurts carrying a hundred pounds of shit with them for miles and miles and miles upon days upon weeks. So it's like, it's like everybody hurts. It's like, so how do you have an entire battalion go to freaking medical because everybody damn hurts. You, you, you can't. So it's like, well, are you in pain or are you hurt or are you injured?
So, I don't know, is my, I can't prove that, uh, my spinal compression was due to service and, uh, Because there's no proof, like how would that even, uh, how would that relate to me? To, into getting some sort of a pension ation for it when, you know, it's like what we did was we, you know, box Tylenol, so I don't know.
moderator: Yeah, there's not that track record there. Exactly. Yeah. That actually makes me, actually, you know what, I'm, I'm gonna have you read this yellow alert, cuz I think it's related to what you're saying. 
Participant 19: Okay.
Well, that would've been a nice form to, to do and nice to know when I got out. Hmm. And it's like, Hey, I'm getting out. Okay, turn in your shit and get outta here. That was about it. Mm-hmm.
Okay. That's, that's good for, for current and future veterans. I see. So that's nice. It's nice for bunch of jerks.
moderator: Okay. Yeah. I wanted you to to see that just because I'm wondering if the language is clear, because I know not everyone has the opportunity. Yeah, yeah. Let's see, and then, um, I guess the last section is the apply section at the very bottom. Sorry, it makes you go back up again. 
Participant 19: That's fine.
Three to four months. But that's a laugh. 
moderator: Is it too short or too long?
Participant 19: That's way too dang short. Hell no. Okay. Four months.
I've had friends that, uh, waited 18 months and, uh, And some longer, some shorter, some longer, but almost all of them longer than three to four months. 
moderator: Do you think it's better not to give an estimate at all rather, or have an estimate but it's not entirely accurate? 
Participant 19: Um,
I would, if anything, I would double that if you're gonna put, because then it usually takes us three to four months. I can't say that I've had any of my friends receive a response within three to four months.
moderator: Anything else in this section sticking out to you? I've noted that. Yeah, 
Participant 19: that makes sense.
No, not on there.
Okay. And then the sign in stuff. Okay. Yeah, let's just sign in, start create an account to, to do it. And yeah, once you start it, you got a year to, to finish it. Okay. Yeah. 
moderator: So I'd like to ask in our last few minutes, having read through this, um, how. If you have to rate your feeling of preparedness, right? Say you have a say, you suspect that you're eligible for disability compensation.
How prepared would you feel, um, having read this to begin to apply by yourself online? So one is not at all prepared and 10 is, you know, 
Participant 19: I would call it. So reading this, say, uh, you know, I'm not exactly sure what to put it at because reading all of this says, says, okay, you can go ahead and start, but just don't click finish until you get all these documents.
So, uh, reading this from start to finish, it may take 25 minutes, but on the back end, the uh, veteran would need. Hours, days, weeks to gather the data, to take the 25 minutes to, to input. So respondent burden 25 minutes if all documentation has been gathered. 
moderator: I see. Yeah. What would be your, what would be your approach?
Would you start and as you go, or do you think you would collect 
Participant 19: the documentation? I would start. I would start it and then come back and get the documentation because, um, I know that at that point in time I have a, uh, I have a, uh, no shit stop date. So otherwise, you know, I was like, oh, well I am gonna get it.
I'm gonna get it. I'll get it later. I'll get it later. I'll get it later. Well, getting it later takes weeks, months, maybe I, it, you know, falls off my, uh, my radar. And I don't get it. And now it's a year later, I'm like, shit. And then here it is a year later and you're like, okay, well lemme try to remember what the hell else it is that I need to get, you know, any civilian doctor's appointments.
Do I need to go find, do I still have my military medical records? Um, you know, that, that kind of thing. So, I would go ahead and start it and know that in a year, I have to finish it. Got it. Okay. Because then where was it? Uh, the potential effective date could change. So, you know, if you, if I started, you know, theoretically if I started today, And then finish it in 360 days, which would be just a couple of days, you know, say beginning of, uh, middle of June of 24.
Mm-hmm. But then the start date would be June of 23 if it were approved versus, okay. It took me a year to gather everything. Well, that's one year of benefits that I, that I didn't lose it. But that's just a year of benefits that I didn't, was not able to obtain because I didn't at least start it. I see.
moderator: Okay. Yeah. Okay, I got it. Um, can you scroll back up to section three? I wanted to ask you after you the gather information, cuz we talked a lot about that. I didn't ask you how useful you thought this section was. 
Participant 19: Um, 
moderator: like if you had to rate this one on a scale of 
Participant 19: one to 10,
on a one to 10.
I'd probably talk, go in, uh, as a, as an eight only because, you know, maybe not, not every veteran is gonna have va medical records, you know, do they have their military treatment records? Um, You know, uh, so, and then the private medical records, you know, because, you know, if they're not already receiving stuff, they wouldn't have any VA medical records.
Uh, and then they'd have to do a FOIA to get their, uh, their military treatment records and who to heck knows how long that would take to get from the 
archives. Right. 
moderator: So in terms of like how you, how well you think this section is preparing veterans, you would give it an 8 because it's not necessarily giving them like all of the options.
Is that right? 
Participant 19: Yeah, and that's it. You know, it's like it's, yeah, and that's all, it's like, I don't even know
Steve in there. Yeah. So like, oh well. Private medical records, hospital reports, supporting statements. Yeah, that's all. And then the supporting statements, it doesn't say whether or not they need to be sworn. Um, cuz like I said, going back to that is like if they're sworn statements that may give people pause from lying and give veterans pause to ask a friend to lie.
Got it. 
moderator: All right. Well, thank you so much, Thomas. Um, I don't wanna keep you too long. Okay. Um, you've given us a lot of good, you know, information and we really appreciate it. Um, if you have no other vets who you think might are opinionated and might wanna share their opinions, you know, feel free to refer them.
Okay. But this is great for us. 
Participant 19: How do I refer them? 
moderator: You can reach out to per Gian, I believe. Um, okay. Yeah. And, uh, kind of recommend folks that way, or you can, uh, per Gian also has a link they'll send you that you can send to your, um, you know, colleagues or 
Participant 19: friends. Okay. Yeah. Cause I know that my brother has been waiting like seven or eight months already, uh, just to get his, uh, uh, for his claim because, He doesn't have his military, military treatment records.
Uh, and so he is waiting on them from the archives. Oh, wow. Yeah. 
moderator: So yeah, we, we need to hear more about what goes on behind the scenes, so we always appreciate it. Okay. Well, thank you again, and I, I hope you enjoy your weekend. 
Participant 19: All right. Thank you so much. Y'all have a great, uh, great weekend as well.
