Session 8
And 
moderator: did you hear that? Um, that, uh, alert? I did. Okay, great. So yes, we are now, uh, in business. Perfect. Now, um, Jerry, could you, um, help me understand, do you have, um, do you often use va.gov for anything? 
Participant 8: Yes, I, I, I have, um, an account with the va. I have had surgery there and. I've got a primary doctor. I visit the, uh, audiology often cuz I wear hearing aids and, um, I visit, uh, orthopedic, uh, for my legs.
I see. 
moderator: Thank you. And, and, and how about the, uh, the website, the VA website? Is that something that you ever access? 
Participant 8: I have had, um, uh, virtual communications with my doctors via the va, so that really is a, a great advantage rather than me having to go into the hospital and actually scheduling that event.
But, uh, they've been very open with that. Okay, great. 
moderator: Wonderful. And have you ever applied, um, with the VA for any kind of, uh, benefit other than medical care? No. 
Participant 8: Yes, I have a, a disability benefit. Okay, 
moderator: wonderful. And, and what, how was the application process, um, to receive that benefit? How did you find it?
Participant 8: Very difficult. I did not do it online. I, uh, through a, another marine veteran i, uh, was told about a veteran service officer in Lewisburg, North Carolina. And I went to visit her and so we together, uh, submitted the claim.
moderator: Okay. And at the time, Jerry, were you aware that you, um, could do it online if you wanted to? 
Participant 8: Yes. But, um, I have also gone back into the online and, uh, wanted to submit another claim, but, uh, I never got through the process. I, I just found it a little difficult and, and so I just put that on the back burner and I never followed up on it.
That's 
moderator: good to know. Yeah. If you remember, and it's okay if you don't, can you walk me through a few of those difficulties? I think it might help us, um, you know, fix the form in certain areas. 
Participant 8: It's the terminology of what the, the, uh, benefit claim says that the veteran needs to have, uh, like for example, I've got cancer and I struggle a lot with the terminology of the type of cancers that the VA publishes versus my cancer doctor what they have identified the cancer as. 
moderator: Okay, I see. 
Participant 8: Yeah. That, that's, that's the, the, the real problem. And then there's the, um, other two issues. One, having to do with the burn pit. While I was in Vietnam and, and struggled with not only the jp, but also the um, uh, the burning and how does that apply to my condition?
And so that, that's kind of like putting into like a story, uh, timeline of how to add that to the application. And so what I do is I go into like Word and put my thoughts down, and then my plan was to add that to the claim, now that I know about it online and I've never done that. 
moderator: I see. Yeah. And that makes complete sense to me.
Okay. Yeah. 
Participant 8: Um, I know that there's a, uh, there's been a lot of traffic cause I subscribe to a couple VA newsletters and they're, they're talking about these lawyers that are available for veterans to call and, and they will help through the benefit process, but I'm really leery about calling a lawyer. I mean, I, not that I distrust them, but I distrust them.
I, I, yeah, I don't know what their agenda is. 
moderator: I see. And do you know if you have to pay for those lawyers? 
Participant 8: That's, that's another issue. You know, I, I've just read about that in the newsletters. I've never, Uh, followed up on that. I don't know any veteran that has ever used that facility for, for their, um, relief.
But yeah, I, I don't know. 
moderator: Okay. Thank you for walking me through that, cause that gives me a little behind the scenes understanding. Um, one of my colleagues is in the waiting room. Is it okay if I let them in? Oh, sure. Okay. She's just gonna introduce herself really quick and then she'll --.
Hi Lydia. It's just you today. Um, you can say hi.
Participant 8: She's, she's, oh, there she is. 
Observer: I'm here.
Good morning. Uh, my name is Lydia. I'm a designer who works with the VA on the team with y um, Yeah, excited to hear what you have to say this morning. So thanks for letting me listen 
Participant 8: in. Hi Lydia. You look awful familiar to me.
I think at some point in in life we have touched base online before. 
moderator: Oh, interesting. Cause you've done these interviews before. Yeah, that's possible. 
Participant 8: It may have been one of my VA calls. 
 I'm not quite sure, but she does definitely looks familiar. Yeah. 
moderator: Well, I'm hoping you'll encounter us again.
Um, okay. So, and then, um, yeah, thank you for walking me through, you know, the, the process, um, of applying, you know, last time with the V S O. Um, I'm gonna, I'm going to try and share with you this prototype. And so the process here is I'm gonna send you the link and I'm gonna have you open it and then I'll see if we can share your screen.
Okay. So that I can see what you're seeing. So first, let me share the link with you. 
Participant 8: So, so this is something that the VSOs will be trained on too. 
moderator: Um, we're actually, we're not sure about this. So this digital form, as you, you noted before, you can do the, um, application for disability online and that's what we're hoping to improve, to allow veterans to do it by themselves.
Oh, 
Participant 8: okay. So this is for me? Yes. 
moderator: So you're, you're who we wanna talk to. Um, 
Participant 8: okay. So, Yeah. One thing nice about the vso, they had access to my medical records. And, um, uh, since then, uh, they gave me the, uh, link and I've requested it from, I think Kansas City. So I've got the entire package. 
moderator: Oh wow. Was it a lot of documents or?
Participant 8: Yeah, it was a pretty thick envelope that I got. 
moderator: Oh, wow. Look at that. And was it just the VA medical records or the private ones as well? 
Participant 8: That was, it was, uh, the history of my, um, medical, uh, service and, uh, that was included. Oh, okay. You know, where I was, um, what, um, clinics I, I visited, uh, what was my status. Had a lot to do with uh, my overseas service. 
moderator: I see. Okay. That's good to know. Um, okay, so I've, I've posted this, uh, prototype link in the chat and um, if you're able to find the chat, you should see it there. If not, let me 
know. 
Participant 8: Okay. I see it. Okay. Go ahead and click on it. Yes, please.
Okay. It's loading. 
moderator: Okay. And it, it usually takes a little while. It's a little slow. Um, so if you're able, while it's loading, and if you're, if you can share your screen, um, then we will, we'll be able to see what you're seeing. Okay.
And the share screen button is a green button at the bottom of the zoom. Yeah.
Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much. I see it. All right. And so, um, before we start, Jerry, what I would like is for you to kind of imagine you're here, um, you know, with the interest of applying for disability compensation, online. And, um, so I want you to just kind of keep that scenario in mind and imagine you're here to do that in real time.
And my first question to you is just to kind of skim over this entire page really quickly and kind of, um, let me know what would be the first thing you did once, once you arrived on this page. So,
Or actually, let's, we'll skip the skim part, but if you could let me know, what would be the first thing you would do, um, or first few things you would do after arriving on this page? 
Participant 8: Well, the first thing I'd be looking for is, um, uh, any idea about my, uh, uh, conditions. So I, I see two right off, off the, uh, bat that I have submitted a claim for Agent Orange and, uh, I've been I disqualified for that.
I mean, my application was denied rather. And, uh, the burn pit was, uh, the other one that I was going to do. That's the one we talked about earlier. But, uh, yeah, that, that the whole thing about cancer, I mean, they're, they're very, very specific and I can never get the doctors to agree about my cancer condition.
Yeah, I went through chemo and uh, radiation. But anyway, those are the two things that I picked up on that first screen. Okay. 
moderator: Okay. And what would you do after you kind of look through that? 
Participant 8: Well, well, there's a button on there that says sign in to start or continue your application. I know that I have to, uh, sign in.
Okay, 
moderator: that's good to note. Okay. And so Jerry, what I'd like is for you to kind of read everything up to the sign-in button if you already have. That's, that's fine. Um, and just I have, yeah. Okay, great. Was anything in that paragraph or two confusing or unclear? 
Participant 8: Um, no. I'm very familiar with the PACT Act and, um, uh, there's a button on there to file supplemental claim supple, but, uh, I, I do know that I need to sign him first. 
moderator: Okay. Uh, what is your understanding of a supplemental claim? 
Participant 8: Well, it's, um, additional information of follow up of a claim that has been, uh, submitted prior.
moderator: I see. Okay. And so, um, I guess on a scale from one to 10, if you could rate the usefulness of this section here at the top, um, one being not at all useful, 10 being the most useful, extremely useful. Um, where would you place this section? 
Participant 8: Well, it would be very useful because I've got three places I can go.
I can continue on with my. Uh, submitted claim for a supplemental information, I can actually go visit the PAC Act and see what's available and I can go ahead and continue on by signing in. That's 
moderator: good to know. Okay. Is there any information you feel is missing here that you would wanna see as someone just landing on the page?
Participant 8: Actually, Up at the top. Very informative because I'm familiar with, uh, VA locations. I've got, uh, three within driving distance. That's pretty nice. Uh, information about the va, but most important about the benefit and the healthcare, uh, that I, I like the links, uh, that are provided up there.
Um, as far as the search is concerned, um, I don't really use the search all that much because the dropdowns really provide the links of where I would be going. 
moderator: Okay, so you don't, it's not really necessary because you Yeah. Yeah. 
Participant 8: And I, I also keep my own records and, uh, files for, uh, contact information. So, uh, as far as the doctors, people I've interfaced with at the VA and also the service officers. I, I keep that in a separate, uh, word document. 
moderator: I see. Okay. Thank you for sharing that. Um, yeah, that helps me kind of understand, um, what, what it's like to just kind of arrive on the site. I'm gonna have you scroll down, um, a bit more, Jerry.
Um, And I'm just gonna have you, um, read this first section, number one. Okay.
And if anything kind of comes to mind as a question or you know, sticks out to you, feel free to call it out. Um, or you can wait until the end.
Participant 8: Okay, well there's a a little discrepancy in there because it says that if any of the items are true, which they are, I need to file a supplemental claim instead of this form. Well, I have to do both actually, cuz I wanna file a new claim and it would be great to go back and file a supplemental claim for my cancer issue.
So I've got two choices here, or two, two different paths. So what I would do is I would take one path and follow 
moderator: through on it. Okay. And which would you think would you be more likely to pursue, you think here? 
Participant 8: I, I would, uh, uh, create the new benefit claim. Okay. And did you first before I go in to do the, uh, supplemental claim.
Okay.
moderator: Um, anything else that stick out to you 
Participant 8: here? No, it's, uh, I, I like what they say about, you know, uh, at least one of these must be true. And so you read through it and you know that that kind of stands out as to allowing you to continue on. So rather than, you know, waiting until later to find out that no, you're not eligible, having it as number one kind of helps you to lead you down the path.
Okay. 
moderator: Was there any information here? Um, and thank you for sharing that. Um, was there any information here that you thought was not relevant to you or, you know, shouldn't be here? Um,
Participant 8: I don't think so. Um, it, I think it would be kind, kind of nice, um, even though we've done it before. Um, The last bullet says you're requesting a review of your claim based on a change of law such as the PAC Act. It would be kind of nice to just, uh, put in there a link for that PAC Act change. Um, rather than, well, like I said, I don't use the search all that much, but then I would have to back up and actually do the search to find that.
moderator: I see. And, and what, and can you point to that section, Jerry, just so I I'm clear you're looking for 
Participant 8: Yeah, it's, uh, right before the, um, uh, triangle with the question mark. Well, you're requesting a review of your claim based on a change in law. 
moderator: Okay. Um, and what information would you be looking to link out to or have listed there?
Participant 8: Uh, what they're actually talking about. What change in the pac. Affects that law. I see. Or just goes back to the Pact, act and, and, and allow me to, uh, search to find out what, what they're actually talking about. 
moderator: See. And um, did the, uh, yellow alert Jerry, um, did you notice that earlier? What the alert?
Yes. Yeah. Okay. I did. And, um, would you be likely to, um, click on that alert or not so likely? 
Participant 8: Uh, probably not. Um, I do have a benefit, but that's not why I'm here. I don't know if it has any effect on me submitting a new claim. So, um, Rather than losing this page, I probably would not have initially clicked on that.
I 
moderator: see. And just so I, I'm clear, and I understand you're expecting that when you click on it, it'll open up a new page or it might replace this one? 
Participant 8: Yeah, that, that's what I would presume. And then I would, I would lose where I'm at. 
moderator: Okay. I see. Um, okay, so I, I'm gonna have you actually go ahead and click on that one.
Okay, because I just wanna see your reactions to it. 
Participant 8: Oh, it just opened up a message. Okay. If you have already been granted a benefit and you're finding a claim, cause of your condition has worsened, this is called a claim for increase. Check to see if you're, oh, actually, that's very informative. That might be one I would follow through on, uh, that would be a third, uh, thing.
moderator: And when you're saying a third thing, like a third path or, or action, you could 
Participant 8: Well, yeah, I, I would probably make a note of that. And, um, uh, it, it gives me a path to, uh, resubmit a benefit i, I already have received for, um, An increase in disability based on my condition. 
moderator: And were you aware of that before the claim For increase as?
Yeah. Were you aware of that claim for increase? 
Participant 8: I'm very thankful for my benefit and no, I never really considered doing that prior to seeing this alert. 
moderator: And were you aware it was a possibility? 
Participant 8: Yes. You know, I, I did, but the VA was very grateful. Well, not, not grateful, but granted me my benefit and, you know, there was no, no argument by on my side.
I, I thought it was just something that I was due, but I was very grateful that I got it. I see.
moderator: Um, okay Jerry, I'm gonna have you scroll down cuz I know you said you you need to leave a little early. So, um, feel free to go to section two and then you can read that section. 
Participant 8: Okay.
Well I like the first sentence to begin with.
Upload, say,
Well, section two is real. Um, very informative, but I didn't know. That I could start a claim and then contact A V S O, would they be able to see what I'm doing? I see. Cause when I went to the VS O originally, I didn't see what they were doing. I sat across the desk from them and they were very helpful. So, On the second paragraph, if I choose to contact A V S O, is it going to be my Vs O or just anyone that's available to assist me in my application?
I don't know. 
moderator: I see. And which would you want it 
Participant 8: to be? Well, it goes on to say that you may contact your state office of Veteran Affairs. Well, I don't wanna do that. I wanted to talk to A V S O. So, um, it doesn't have to be my vs o that I need to talk to, but I've already established a relationship with them.
I don't know how that would affect a future application. I think it would be something that I would try. And is it something that it doesn't say that they would be online or would I have to go visit them? It, it doesn't really say. 
moderator: Okay. Yeah. Any other questions come to mind when you're reading this? Any other, um, parts that you would wanna know more about?
Participant 8: Well, that, that last link, learn about other ways you can file a disability claim. Other than online and also through a vso. Um, that might be something that I would click on just to see what other ways there are. 
moderator: Makes sense. And just to make sure I understand, you're saying right now you're seeing two ways to apply.
One is online, um, and the other one is online with a V S O Potentially, yeah. 
Participant 8: That's correct. If that is online with the vso, it just says contact an accredited, uh, VSO officer. Um, it, it doesn't say that we're going to be connected online. Okay. 
moderator: I see. And can I have you, um, again, Jerry, rate this on a scale of usefulness from one to 10?
Participant 8: Actually, I found this very informative. I, I would probably give it an eight or a nine actually. There's several things on here that I would probably go look at and like I said, we, we, I would do the contact for accredited vs o and then I would look for other ways to file a claim. 
moderator: Good to note. Okay. I'll have us go on to section three.
Participant 8: Okay.
Well, this is true. This is really, um, um, a major benefit because of the, um, first real paragraph after the, uh, the three bullets. Um, it states that we'll re review relative medical records from the va and, and they have those, but. From private doctors or hospitals, this is really critical. Cause not everything is managed by the va.
Uh, a lot of times. Uh, well, I, I know that it's been very difficult with, uh, Tricare and they'll refer you to an outside, uh, doctor or, um, or a hospital. And so, That's very important that those records can also be submitted and or given access to the VA while you're doing your, uh, submission for benefits. I like that ability. I don't remember that happening before. 
moderator: And can you, can you help me understand that a little bit, Jerry? Um, so you're saying in the past when you were filing, um, the, the VSO or the VA did not procure your private medical records for your claim, 
Participant 8: uh, also correct. Yeah, it was strictly through the, uh, VA records.
I, I don't remember that ever being, being asked, or, identified before. I know that the one that was denied, that one, uh, we did submit letters from my, cancer doctors. And, you know, they don't tell you why they denied you, but they did. Uh, and those were not, va records at all. 
moderator: I see. I see.
Participant 8: Yeah. Okay. But, uh, yeah, this is a, this is a very, very good, uh, section cuz it kind of reminds you about, well have your, your information, uh, ready and that you can, uh, actually submit that now the three bullets at the bottom of, uh, section three, that's really the, the meat of it. You know, you know, as far as your records are, are concerned, you know, we, we all have, have that, but you need to submit cuz the records are not gonna show that your disability has gotten worse.
And that's the issue with a veteran. I mean, uh, you may have gotten a, a claim, okayed, but over time, It is really, escalating and that's the whole purpose of the, uh, supplemental claim. And so the, uh, last bullet about supporting statements. I mean, that's one that, you know, I didn't know that, you know, family members, friends, uh, clergy, you know, uh, you know, people that you deal with in your normal life.
They can actually submit and help you to identify why you're even here. Why is your disability getting worse? 
moderator: I see. And does that seem like a viable option for people? 
Participant 8: Yeah, uh, absolutely. I'm gonna, uh, really kind of zero in on that one. I 
moderator: see. That's good to know. Jira, you had mentioned that, um, this section, it seemed as though it was saying that, you know, the VA is going to procure TRICARE and private medical records.
The, the, um, act in actuality, um, it doesn't, so they, they, the onus, they put the onus on the veteran to procure the private medical records. Is there a way we can make that more clear, you think? Here? 
Participant 8: Well, I'll give you an example. Um, we have, uh, duke here in the, uh, the, uh, North Carolina Medical System, and Duke has something called, uh, duke MyChart.
And MyChart is a online medical connection between you and your, your doctors, or your, your appointments, your, uh, uh, medicines, uh, everything that's going on with, with you at whatever facility uses MyChart. And I have three locations that are used in MyChart from, U N C, uh, and also Duke, and then Novant.
And, you know, they all talk to one another. So if something happens to me in Chapel Hill or UNC uh cancer Center, uh, my primary care doctor can see that information. And it would be good if the VA would open up and allow outside medical records. To be accessed real time. I see every time I go to one of those locations and, and ask them, you know, make sure that the va, uh, has access to this.
And they say, no, those are are two different systems. They, they just don't communicate. 
moderator: I see. Is there a way we can change the language here to make it clear, uh, more clear that, um, you know, the private medical records are something that, you know, the vet is going to have to provide on their own? Yes.
Participant 8: Right up at the top where they say that we'll review relative medical records, well, who provides those medical records? It should be that the veteran. Is providing the records that the VA will review. It, it, it kind of implies that, you know, and from private doctors or hospitals that you identify. Well, y yeah.
I, I tell 'em about it, but they don't have access to those records. I see. 
moderator: Oh, thank you. Yeah, that, that's very helpful for us to know. Um, for the last few minutes, I'll have you read section four and then I'll let you go so you can make your event. 
Participant 8: Thank you.
Okay. I'm very familiar with the one one year time limit and, I'm very familiar with, um, saving the work and, restarting it, uh, later on, based on interruptions or if you need to find something that you wanted to add to it. So this is for me just kind of like a review, and it's a good review. 
moderator: That's good to know. Um, Jerry, I wanted to ask you, um, about the kind of three types of claims we have.
The supplemental claim. Yes. The claim for increase and of course a new claim or an original claim. 
Participant 8: Right.
moderator: Um, which of the three, uh, apply to you and in what scenario? 
Participant 8: Well, actually I've got, Um, a new claim, uh, that I'm going to be submitted. Uh, you know, I just, I've been thinking about it. Um, an increase in benefit.
Okay. That would be the, uh, the, the one that I now have and the, uh, supplemental one is the one that's been denied. So in my case, This really applies to all three conditions. 
moderator: Okay. Thank you for helping me understand that. Now that we've made it to the end, is there anything you think could be added to this page that would help a, a veteran newly applying for benefits?
Anything you wish you knew that isn't here?
Participant 8: No, I, I, like I said, I was very familiar with it. It's good that you keep repeating that you have a one year time from the start of the application. Okay? So you, you're, under the clock, but you know, the application should not take a year for you to complete because reading over this, it allows you to do your due diligent work ahead of time and have it ready. You could probably submit the claim really within a week, uh, and, because you have everything that you needed to do. Now, there may be something that comes up and you can add to it. It actually states that you can actually add to your submitted claim.
And so, uh it's very, informative and to my way of thinking. It's very straightforward, very informative, and I like the the parts where it actually helps you to think about, well, which path do you wanna take? 
moderator: That's good to know. Thank you so much, Jerry. This was very, very helpful. Really appreciate your time.
You're welcome. Okay. Well, I hope you 
Participant 8: enjoy your event. Well, thanks very much. It is a, a Marine Corps League event, and so I'm, I'm looking forward to it. Oh, that's 
moderator: great. Enjoy the rest of your day. 
Participant 8: Well, thank you very much. You too. Bye-bye. 
moderator: Bye-bye.
