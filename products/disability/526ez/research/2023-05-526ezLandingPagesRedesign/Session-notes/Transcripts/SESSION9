Session 6
moderator: Did you hear that alert, Ryan? Yes, I did. Okay, perfect. Just wanna confirm. Awesome. Um, and just could you just, um, elaborate a little bit more, I just wanna make sure I got this right earlier you said you had applied for, um, but it fits through a V S O. Yep. Okay. In the past? Yep. In the past, yes. Okay. And, um, was that a long time ago or was it more recently?
Participant 6: Um, a little bit of both. Um, I think, I think the most recent, well, I guess I kind of went on for about a year, but, um, uh, but yeah, I would say the most recent, um, there were some updates that happened back in December, um, to. But yeah, so over the, I would say over the past two years there's been, I've, I've submitted, uh, two, I guess three claims and, and, uh, you know, been part of the process going through that.
moderator: Okay. And have you experienced like, um, you know, being denied or being approved, um, getting a rating. 
Participant 6: All of the above. So I've had things, um, denied, uh, things approved, um, and getting ratings. So I've kinda, kinda, uh, seen it all. I guess maybe not all, but I've definitely seen, um, different types of, uh, responses, uh, based on the claims that are submitted.
I 
moderator: see. That's good to know. And , did you attempt to do the form alone prior to, um, working with the V S O? Or did you start with the VSO 
Participant 6: Um, I started with the vs o based on a personal relationship, um, that I had with him. Um, since then, I know he, he tends, he tends to be a person that's very overwhelmed just with the area and things.
So I have considered that if I ever did something in the future, I would wanna maybe just do it on my own. So I just had that kinda full control over things, and I obviously learned a lot over the last two years that I didn't have any idea about when this all first started, and he helped me get that first claim submitted.
moderator: I see. 
Okay. That's good. That's good to know. Thank you for sharing that. Um, okay, I'm gonna go ahead and I'll share the prototype with you. Okay. Um, and I'm gonna post it in the chat, so let me know if you can see it and if you can open it. Oh, wait, just one 
Participant 6: second. Okay.
I see it and you, you just want me to click on it and watch it? Yes.
moderator: Yeah. And then once it's launched, um, if you're able to share, uh, come back to Zoom and share your screen, um, that would be great. I can walk you through it as well. Okay. You can't see the, 
Participant 6: the prompt. It looks like it's loading. I mean, I could start sharing now, but it looks like I'm at like 26%, but I can go back and share.
No 
moderator: worries. Yeah, it'll take a little bit. 
Participant 6: Okay. Share is screen usually the best, I would assume It says 
moderator: yes. Um, sometimes it offers you the option just to share your web browser where it opened, but you can also just share your, your entire screen. 
Participant 6: Okay, great. Did the sharing work or 
moderator: Yes. I'm seeing you're at 60%.
Okay. You can move me out of the way. 
Participant 6: Mm-hmm.
Oh, start over. I must have, must have refreshed the page somehow. 
moderator: No worries, no problem. Yeah, it takes a 
Participant 6: while.
Is the, the, the slow loading part of the like sketch or something versus like, or. 
moderator: Exactly. Yeah, I, yeah, this is more about the prototype environment, fortunately. 
Participant 6: Yeah. 
moderator: Or at least we hope it's not this slow in, in real time for most people. 
Participant 6: Yeah. Makes sense. Um, 
moderator: great. So yeah, I think I'm gonna have you just kind of quickly look over the whole page.
Um, I just wanna know, you know, after looking, kind of skimming through this, like where would you go first? What would be the first thing you would do? 
Participant 6: Um, if I, if I launched to this, I would probably just scroll through the whole thing and see what the overall page looked like. Um, I think naturally I would probably click into some of, uh, pluses just to kinda see more information.
But otherwise, if I knew what I was, knew what I was you getting to, I'd probably just immediately click on that sign in to start or. Continue your application, but, um, if I wasn't sure, I'd probably wanna be expanding these and just kinda scrolling through, um, the subsections to kinda start, get an idea if there's anything that, any reason why this wouldn't apply to me.
But, um, I think this all looks pretty, pretty normal. 
moderator: Okay, great. So I'll have you, uh, head up to the top and then, um, I'm just gonna have you read that first section up until where it says sign in, and then I'll ask you some questions. You can read out loud to yourself, you know, feel free to read at your own place and I'll ask you some questions.
Um, and, you know, if you can kind of keep in mind, um, you know, your scenario of, you know, potentially being someone who might apply online and look for pieces that are relevant to you, that would be great. 
Participant 6: So like this gray section, read this whole thing until that sign in part, or what exactly. Okay.
Okay. 
moderator: Okay. Um, 
say that one more time.
Participant 6: I was just gonna say, I mean it seems like obviously very specific to the Toxic Exposure and PACT Act, um, for the, for the whole section, but there's actually stuff in here that I did not know, so that's actually useful to, to actually read through. 
moderator: Interesting. Like, uh, what stood out to you?
Participant 6: Um, just the fact that, um, it looks like I didn't know that things potentially would be backdated to the date of the bill signing. Uh, but essentially like, obviously this, this like pushes for any veteran to say, just apply now and get things started. Um, I know like the intent to file is usually the starting point
of a claim and backdate to that. But if this backdates back to the bill signing, then, um, as long as, you know, it's done before August of this year. Um, but yeah, it, it's, um, that's something I didn't know. Um, but, um, that's, that's or good to know. Um, 
moderator: is this information, do you feel it's relevant to you or more so relevant to other veterans?
Participant 6: Uh, it's relevant to me. Um, I, I was in Iraq in thousand five, um, for a year. So, um, and I, the truth is I have been kind keeping an eye on and listening to what's happening with the PACT act and I actually even joined. One of the like, seminars or, or online things that happened last fall, I think, or maybe it was November. Um, but anyways, I thought I kind of knew most of the things.
Um, but obviously I didn't know at all. I didn't know about some of the things that are listed off in this, and I probably have actually seen something very similar. I kind of just, I, I usually see the headline and I kind of like, well, I kind of know what's going on with the toxic exposure and. Um, and I kind of skim over it and pass it.
But by reading through this fully, I definitely see some stuff that I didn't already know. So was anything 
moderator: else here surprising or, or stood out? 
Participant 6: Um, I, I guess, I mean, I mean, from my perspective, I. Um, I mean, I know this is kind of top of mind and, and most current right now for all veterans or potentially all veterans that are, you know, would be as part of the PACT Act
um, but I would assume this would also be useful for any veteran, um, to be able to do this online and not necessarily just toxic exposure and PACT Act um, so I don't know if, I mean, I know that again, that's like. You know, very pertinent right now. Mm-hmm. Um, but I don't know, is there any, I don't see anything if it calls out like this is still pertinent for people who maybe, you know, weren't in a PACT Act area or something.
Um, but you know, obviously this is kind of like the most, um, pertinent, uh, points right now in, in what's happening this year and, and the end of last year. 
moderator: Is there any information here that you think maybe is less relevant or, you know, is distracting? 
Participant 6: Um, I guess, I guess maybe it kind of expands even what I just mentioned.
Like, I mean, this is printed to me, but obviously not, uh, not all veterans are gonna be, um, under the PACT act. So, um, I, I, so this, this defaulted to open, right? Yeah. Use this form. Okay. Um, yeah, cause like, I guess if somebody already kind of knows that they're maybe not relevant, so maybe they were, you know, whatever guard or reserve and never were deployed or, or whatever, um, like it probably isn't relevant for them.
But for me, this is definitely relevant. Cause you know, I, I know that I'm under the deck, um, myself as a veteran. 
moderator: I see. Can I ask on a scale from one to 10, um, how useful you think this is? So one is not at all useful and 10 is, you know, extremely useful. For you personally? 
Participant 6: So the funny thing is, I probably would've, before reading it all, I probably would've said, um, that the whole section is probably lower.
Like maybe like a three or four. Um, but actually after reading it, reading it, um, uh, you know, top to bottom, um, I would say it's probably a little higher, like a six or seven. Can you 
moderator: explain a little bit more the, the three or four to the six or seven? Was it just like the information at the top versus the information at the bottom or, 
Participant 6: I think it's more, maybe it's more personal.
Um, for me, like, just like, because I, I feel like I have been following the PACT Act stuff that as soon as I see the header of that, in my mind I'm just like, okay, I know generally what that's about, so I don't need to read anything. And I, so I guess. Without reading it, I would've saw the head, the header, just like the, just the very, the bold top on it and just knowing like, oh, I already know that stuff, but I,
obviously didn't know all of it. Yeah. So then when I actually read it actual, like top to bottom, then it, it, it actually gave me more information that I already knew. Um, so like, it's, it's probably one of those things that probably would burn or not burn somebody, but like, affect, uh, maybe other people too that have been kind of following it, but maybe not following it as closely as I thought I was.
Um, so there's, there's information here that I didn't know, like the, you know, the dates and when to consider things. Um, but I probably. Without you asking me to read the top to bottom, I probably would've skimmed past it and just saw the Toxic Exposure Act and said, oh, I know I'm already under that, but wouldn't read through the full details.
So that's, that's what that's like. That's my reason for like, initially if I just saw the header, I would've been like, ah, probably like a three or four. Cause I've been seeing that all over the place, the VA gov and every time you log in, you just see PACT Act stuff all over the place. Um, and then going, actually after reading it, I would say it's more like a, actually, I would say even, maybe even high, like a seven or eight maybe, because.
It does have stuff in here, like the, you know, if doing it before August 10th, very pertinent and I didn't know that. And then also the back dating, um, to the, the bill signing. That's something I didn't know. Um, but I might have dismissed that with other, um, things that were sent out about the PACT Act
but, um, so that's, that's the reasoning even though that's kind of complicated. Maybe it's more of a personal thing and, and in my mind, 
moderator: No, but that's, that's great to know. Um, you know, because that provides us even more context about like all the different alerts that you're seeing in general. So that's that.
Thank you for sharing that. Um, okay. I'm gonna have you, uh, scroll down, um, to the section just underneath this. And, um, I'll have you close to, um, I mean, if you were here, would you start with section one you think I saw that's working? Yeah, I think 
Participant 6: so. I mean, Okay. Yeah, I, I guess I'm, that's usually what I do.
Like if I see stuff on like a, what kind of, and, and a lot of times I would probably like expand it and close it. Um, I, I can't remember exactly, and this might be just a prototype environment, but there was one thing, I can't remember exact order of what I did it, but it, it refreshed at the top of the page, which I would find annoying.
So like, if I think I expanded, I expanded two, and then I, I think when I closed number one, it put me back at the top. Um, and it, again, I don't know if that's just the prototype environment. Cause obviously refreshing on our web page might be different than what's happening in Sketch, but yeah. Um, I would not want that.
moderator: Yeah, I mean, it, it, it's a part of the prototype. Um, definitely, you know, well we hope to fix that for the real deal, but it's still important that you call it out. Um, you know, because some of those things might be. You know, might make it to, um, when this is live so you can keep calling that stuff out. Uh, even if it is a part of the prototype, um, it's helpful.
Yeah. Um, okay, so I'll have you, you know, go ahead and kind of open, you know, uh, the one that you choose and, and read that 
Participant 6: one. Yeah. And another thing I would call out, I, I did see the expand all is, again, this is probably a personal preference. I don't generally like to do expand alls. Um, There might be, there might be times where it makes sense, but I personally, and, and again, this is personal preference, but I usually like to like expand the thing I wanna read through, finish reading it, and then close it just so it's not taking.
On my computer or on my phone. So I would, I would collapse one after I read through it. Um, and I think that's what happened when I, it jumped me back to the top, um, of the full page. Um, but yeah, I just wanted to call that cause I, I did notice the expand all. Um, but again, personal preference. I usually like to expand, collapse, expand, collapse, that kinda thing, um, as I'm going through things that I'm trying to read through.
moderator: Right. Okay. Yeah. Thank you for walking me through that.
Participant 6: So you just want me to read through this, right? 
moderator: Yeah, same as before. Read at your own pace. Um, if anything sticks out to you or questions come up, feel free to ask or call it out, but yeah. 
Participant 6: Okay.
So I guess in general, like I think a lot of this information I probably, especially for a veteran, maybe has never done a claim. I think this is very pertinent. Lot of this things are, I'm like, I'm probably personally past it, but it is kinda interesting just to read through this. Um, and. No more details of the claim process and what, you know, who's eligible.
Um, I think the VSO that I work with because of my personal relationship with them kinda like just jumped me right into like, this is what you should be considering if, if, if you do have these issues, those types of things. Um,
But I guess this, this covers even for me, so, yeah. You know, if I already have benefits, so.
So I think this, this, this is to me is a good summary of um, you know, like as the header is, determine if the form is for you. That makes sense to me and covers the things that I think, um, I would wanna know. 
moderator: And so what would be, um, I guess, yeah, I'm wondering kind of what you would say is the gist of this section.
Participant 6: Uh, I mean, to me it's, it's essentially a, a good, a full summary of what veterans are eligible to, to apply and use this form to apply for or to submit a claim. Well, I was just gonna say, yeah, I mean, essentially know, breaks it down pretty detailed in terms of what, that it all entails
there's always like, looks like options to jump out to more details. Um, you know, if, something doesn't, if something's not covered enough for, for somebody. I see. 
moderator: Where would you place this on the, the usefulness scale? Um, and I guess you can, um, rate it for yourself. I know you've said, you know, you've encountered some of this information before just by going through a claim before, so 
Participant 6: Yeah, I would say it's, um, I would rate it pretty high, um, especially for somebody who hasn't done a claim yet.
Um, um, it would, for myself, I hadn't even known about this process until two years ago. So if I had been coming here as a, like a veteran would never hearing anything, uh, about claim process and, and the forms and things and the steps that would have to happen, um, this would be pretty high, like a eight or nine in terms of just kind of knowing what.
What the process is and what the form, like, what this form kind of covers and who, who would be, you know, per, or like, um, who would be cover or if the form works for a specific veteran. Um, in terms of just reading through that. Okay. So I would say pretty high. And then for myself, it still gives me some information.
I probably would've scrolled through this still, but maybe a little more quickly just because I have gone through the process before or, you know, mostly on it. Um, mostly through all the process. Um, I probably would've expanded like, I did this, like have you been granted, you know, benefits already and just kinda seen what, you know, the information that's around that scenario.
Okay. 
moderator: Um, from what you're seeing here, can you explain to me in your, in your own words, what a supplemental claim is or what your understanding of that is? 
Participant 6: Um, my, my understanding and, and both from just kinda already historical knowledge and then obviously in this, in the details here, is that, um, if you've already submitted and you've been denied, um, or.
Um, yeah. So if you've been, if you submitted and had a denial and you, you, and you wanted to do something extra or add more details, then you're gonna do a supplemental claim. Um, along with, um, if, if something like, I think this it out, if it's been worsened, if you already have a, um, a condition that's already been granted, uh, as like service connect gotten worse.
Have evaluated to, to a different rating. I 
moderator: see. And have you heard of that term in the yellow alert claim for increase? Have you heard of that 
Participant 6: before? Um, I don't know about exactly like that, like a, a specific thing. I mean, I've known that you can claim, um, I know that you, I have historically known that there are ways to, you know, over time if, if a condition worsens that you would file to get an increase in your rating.
I don't think I've heard of a, called a claim for increase, um, specifically. 
moderator: I see. Would you say it's clear or, or unclear here that as a claim for increase is separate and different from a supplemental claim? 
Participant 6: Um, it's, I mean, just based on the order, it seems almost like it's the same, um, because your conditioning of the claim for increase.
I see. I dunno, I guess it's just, to me, just the way it flows, it seems like, Supplemental claim and then, then this is more like if this was collapsed. I guess it, I dunno, to me, and I guess I might be wrong on this, but it to me is like, um, that the, the supplemental claim kinda like this section and then almost like this alert is kind of continuing that, but maybe overall, um, yeah, I guess it's hard to.
moderator: I see. Okay. Thank you for calling that out. Yeah. That's important to know. Got it. Yeah. Okay. Is there any information you feel like, um, you would want to see here that's 
Participant 6: missing?
Um, I don't think so. I mean, I think this gives, I mean, as the purpose of this section is like, determine that this form is for you. Um, I think that's, it covers what's needed for that. Obviously, if, if somebody's not sure what these details, it looks like, you know, there's options to, you know, jump out and learn more about.
You know, eligibility and things, but I think it covers, you know, the basic, um, reasons for why you would, you know, use this form and who's eligible for the form. 
moderator: Yeah, good to know. Um, I'm gonna have you go ahead to, um, different section. Can be any of the others. 
Participant 6: Okay. Should I try? I don't remember if so I'm gonna collapse this.
Okay. It did look like it. That's not what I remember, but, so maybe I must have clicked something else on accident. No, you're 
moderator: right. It will jump if you don't collapse it. So yes, F 
Participant 6: Y I. Oh, okay. Okay. Gotcha. So yeah, so if you just go to the next section and expand it, is that what you're saying? 
moderator: Or? Right. If you don't collapse the first and you go to the next it, it's gonna jump.
So you can just collapse after each. Okay, 
Participant 6: got it. Got it. Okay.
moderator: So I'll have you, um, you know, read this one, same as before. 
Participant 6: Okay.
So, um, I think this one's a little bit confusing to me. Um,
This says this, this section is, decide how you want to apply. Um, so to me, I feel like this first section kind of covers, I would assume what's leading into using this form. Um, and that would, you'd just do it all on your own and online. Um, so like to me that's almost like option one and then. And it's, and I could, I could be wrong on this, but then it says, you may choose to contact the, the vso.
Um, I guess would, would eventually, would the plan be that the VSO would also use this form? Cause I, or do they do something different? I'm not sure exactly the process and the VSO side. Um, but I, I've been assuming that this would be like a veteran like LED thing right? From VA gov. You'd launch this, you'd start this form online, uh, on your own.
Is that correct or it's been 
moderator: kinda like, can you explain like what brought that question about? Like what did you see here that made you think, oh, maybe this might be for VSOs as well? 
Participant 6: Well, it's just, it's more about, so it says, decide how you want to apply. So to me that that section header or this section is supposed to help me decide out of multiple ways to apply, which way do I want to apply.
But it's not clear to me reading through this, like the, to me, like the first section kind of touches on like, it seems like I would do that on my own as a veteran, um, and do it online. Um, and, but then but then the second paragraph, um, so I guess it, it's, it's not clear just reading through it that these are kind of two separate options.
Um, But I think they're, and I could, again, I, I could be wrong, but to me the first section is like saying, Hey, you could do it all on your own online, and this would be this new form. And then secondarily, or not secondarily, but maybe separately, you can say, I, you can also work, you know, look for a, an available VSO in your area to, um, do, do like, actually have them submit the, the, um, the form or to submit, yeah, the form.
Um, And then it looks like you can also contact your state office of Veterans Affairs. Um, and then looks like it also goes into other ways you can fly file. So, um, I guess I, I mean, thinking about this in just the, if this is supposed to be just covering, like prep, prepping to do it, doing the online form yourself.
It's, it's a little confusing to me to say, decide how you want to apply, and then it's not super clear in the text that like the first part was, should prompt you into continuing with this online form. Um, and then separately you could choose not to do it on your own or work with somebody else that would help you like the, OR or other ways.
Um, I see. Yeah. I don't know. Sorry. It's kinda vague, but that it's, 
moderator: no, and And when you're saying the first section, do you mean this first paragraph here versus the second or the first paragraph? Yeah, the first paragraph. Okay. 
Participant 6: Okay. Got it. Yeah, the first 
moderator: paragraph I see. And so, correct you mean. Yeah, 
Participant 6: please.
No, I was just gonna say, yeah, the first paragraph of this section makes it seem like that's covering. Like this new form that's gonna new online form. That would be like, you know, like that would be the next steps of like actually doing the app, applying and uploading myself to this, um, you know, using this.
But it's not, I don't know, it's not like I, I, and maybe it's, maybe it's, I'm reading too much into it, um, where I'm like taking my historical, what I've done historically. Along with trying to, you know, read through this and you know, see what would be the use cases for, you know, doing it on my own versus using a VSO or something else.
Um, yeah, so I dunno, to me it just seems like especially, well, maybe a veteran that's never done anything and reading this, I think it would be confusing for them. Definitely. If you're like, the first paragraph makes it seem like, okay, you can do it all on your own. And then, but it, it says you may choose to contact, I dunno, I feel like there's just not enough distinction between the first paragraphs, meaning you're gonna move forward on your own as a veteran to, to do the form and uploading process, and then separately that there's, you know, you could also work with a bso.
But to, and I could be wrong on this, but I, I feel like that would be almost like saying you're not gonna move forward with this form. You're just gonna go straight to a Vsso and say, Hey, I need help submitting a claim for Tinnius and, and can you help me with that? And they would do it all, all the steps instead of the veteran doing it online.
I 
moderator: see. Okay. So it's almost like, you know, if you're here, you're wanting to do it digitally and you want information pertaining to doing it digitally on your own, is that, what's the code Dad? Is that right? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I understand. Yeah. Thank you for calling that out. Um, okay, well, we'll head on to uh, the next section then.
Okay.
And then again, same as before. I'll have you read this as well. Feel free to call out things as you go or you can wait to the end, whichever, whichever is more comfortable. 
Participant 6: Okay.
So I think that all makes sense. I, I don't, I think some of this stuff for me was like more the VSO just asking me for stuff. So I didn't, I don't think I've ever had a good, concise summary of like, here's, you know, like, here's how we're gonna review it. You know, here's, you know, what you're, what you, what you should submit based on what you're trying to claim
um, I.
So like this, this wouldn't be pertinent for me, but obviously anybody who's trying to do stuff that was still active duty, um, because it hasn't been per so pertinent to me. I haven't, I've heard of bdd, but it's not something I did. Um, and I also, um, I think if I was active duty, I would've wanted to know about that and, and.
You know, done that before I, I, uh, separated from service, but
moderator: I see. Had you had, you, you had heard of the program while you were still active, 
Participant 6: correct? Yep. 
moderator: Oh, you had not heard of the program while you were active, an active service member, 
Participant 6: correct. Yeah. Yeah. So like to me, this isn't pertinent to me directly now, cuz obviously I'm not, I'm not active duty.
I think I would've if I was active duty. I'm just curious about, you know, you know, submitting for claims or something. Like I would've, this whole yellow section would've been nice to read, have read myself and known, you know, 15 years ago, 
moderator: I see. Okay. Well that's good to know. Um, is this what you expected to see in this in section three, excluding the yellow alert?
Um, is this what you expected to see in this section? 
Participant 6: Yeah, I think so. Um, I guess, I mean, maybe this is more slight confusion on my part. It does mention about uploading VA medical records and hospital records. Um, and for some reason in my mind I always thought that was available as part of the claim process to, you know, for the review and, and, and claim process.
But 
moderator: which part is automatically available? Sorry. 
Participant 6: Uh, like VA medical records and hospital records. I mean, obviously if you had like specific things you wanted to call out as submitting. I, I thought I, I guess this is maybe a more of a thing that has not been clear to me. Um, and maybe is more of the fact that I work with the vso, but I didn't, I wasn't sure what was like, what do, what do I as a veteran need to submit if, if the VA process, if the claim process may already have access to my VA medical records and hospital records. Um, but here it's saying that you, you would probably want to upload it, you know, like on your own still, uh, separate from the claim process.
Is that true? And again, that might be a confusion on my part. 
moderator: Yeah, no, I think that's what we're wanting to communicate. Um, but does it change your thoughts about what the process is going to be like? Does it have any effect on what you're thinking the process will, will be like when you read that? 
Participant 6: I think it just helps clarify for me that that's something I would want to do.
I don't know if I. I don't know what all I would've thought was necessary if, you know, prior to having the VSO help me with my previous claims. Um, so yeah, either way, I mean, this would just clarify that I do need to consider, like, even though, and, and maybe I'm wrong on my assumption, that, um, uh, that just to make sure that they have what, what I want to submit, that I should submit it, even if it's the va, even if it's in the VA medical record.
Um, that's 
moderator: okay. That makes sense. Um, any information here that you think is, is, um, missing, um, or, or that you personally would wanna see here?
Participant 6: Um, I can't think of anything offhand. Um, I mean I've obviously, this is kind of like a good summary of what you're would be planning to gather and then ready to submit. I think as part of the submission process, I would probably wanna be able to see this kind of list, and maybe that's already there, but just like, to me, this is still kind of leading into, I haven't actually started applying on my own yet, but once I'm in that, and then it's like just, uh, as a reminder, like in the form process, just knowing did I, did I hit on all these things?
Like did I. You know, like, is there anything I'm not submitting that I should be submitting? Um, again, I don't, I dunno what that looks like later on in the process, but, um, but I think this is a good summary of, or a good preparation for like, here's what I need to think about as I'm gathering information prior to starting the, the process.
Okay. 
moderator: I'm gonna have you, um, again, just wanna ask you, uh, where this falls on the usefulness scale again. 
Participant 6: Um, I think fairly high. I mean, I think, I mean, I think I knew some of this stuff just based on, you know, submitting with the V S O. Um, and then, but as a, maybe as a veteran who's never submitted anything, this would be good to know and have a good summary of things that they should be thinking about, including, you know, private medical records, like, you know, which, you know, which doctor, which hospital might have information about this, this condition.
Um, and just knowing that like, hey, You know, like if you don't already have supporting statements from, you know, family or others or you know, people you served with that, like, start thinking about that now as you're, you know, thinking about the, the claim process. So, I mean, all, I mean the whole, the whole list I think is good.
Um, a good, um, initial summary of like things that you will be having to gather, um, as part of the process. Okay. So I would say, uh, so in terms of usefulness, uh, I would say definitely, uh, for like somebody who's never submitted anything and just would be their first submission claim on their own, then I would, I would probably put this up there, like eight or nine.
Um, for me it's still probably, or even other people submitted before, still probably semi helpful. Probably six or seven. 
moderator: Okay. Good to know. Um, yeah. Thank you for walking me through that. Um, okay. Yeah. Uh, were you reviewing something? I don't wanna cut you off. 
Participant 6: No, no. Nope. I just, I was just, uh, gonna collapse it.
Okay. 
moderator: Um, so yeah, you can go ahead and open the, the last one here. Um, can I ask, before you read, what are you expecting to see in this section? 
Participant 6: Um,
I guess to me it almost seems like it should be barely anything in here, because to me the apply part would be launching, going into like the actual form and just start filling things out. And then, um, I, I don't know. I feel like the other sections I haven't started reading yet, but like, I feel like the other sections have kind of given an idea of like all the things that you need to be thinking about doing apply actually.
Yeah, so I, I'm not sure what would be in apply in the, I'm tempted to start reading just to kinda see what's there, but, um, but otherwise, yeah, I was just like, I was expecting like, maybe that would just be like, okay, you know, you know, going onto the next step, but like, sign in and, and start the application.
I 
moderator: see. Okay. Good to know.
Participant 6: But there's a, it looks like there's a decent amount of stuff, so maybe I'll read through it. And so I wasn't expecting, um, I, I like the first sentence cause that's, I was thinking about that I mentioned earlier of like, You know, like would, it would be nice to go through each step again after doing it and like, you know, what am I, what's, you know, what do I, what have I done?
What I, what I should I be doing at this step? But it sounds like they will be, you know, we'll take you to the, each step of the process. So,
so that's, I think that's useful to see, like when you say start your application online, now you declare your intent to file. So like some of these steps, I, I know things have happened from my previous claims. I don't, I don't know exactly technically what happened at each stage. Um, but yeah, the, I just, I've known, you know, since this has started for me, that the intent to file is pretty critical and that, that, you know, like if you're already planning on doing something, you want to do that intent to file.
And then even if it takes you six months after that to, you know, gather all their evidence or, you know, whatever documentation and details. Um, that, but it sounds like here it's calling out that as soon, it sounds like when you start the application online, you're declaring your intent to file. Um, so to me that's useful.
Um, I, for somebody who maybe doesn't know, I'm trying to think what's this would, okay, that's good. So like the, and then like obviously goes in, so like if this was a veteran who's never done this before and any claim, you know, it does call out the fact that it, you know, You know, reserves that potential effective date, um, for when you, you would get like a back pay or back dated for the condition.
moderator: Is that, is that something that was clear to you when you, when you went through the process? 
Participant 6: To me it wasn't, I think at some point it was called out. I think I, and then I think since I started the, doing the, the claims through the vs o, I've done like stuff on my own and just learned more about everything, the process overall and just, and since then, I think I've just started to know more about that, like the one year.
Um, you know, from that date, from the intent to file and, and things like that. Um, I don't remember the, if my VSO was like super clear about like, okay, we did the intent to file and then now we have time to do stuff because everything, it is really just pertinent to the intent to file.
I think it wasn't that clear for me. Um, and so like, I, I think there were times for myself that. Like I was feeling like I should, like, I was kind of rushing things and saying like, okay, we, I want to get this submitted, you know, this week or whatever. But really when it's only a month after the intent to file, it's not, it's not super critical.
Oh, ok. Um, but anyway, so that's just more of a, more of my personal experience than anything. Um, but reading this, you know, having that, um, having that be pretty clear about the, the one year from the date of the intent of file is helpful to see and read through that.
So that's, so it says we won't send you another notification or receipt. Um,
I dunno. I, I guess for myself, I meanly confirmation page is definitely a positive thing. Um, do you know when it says don't, won't send another notification received? So that means not even an email or anything? Cause to me, I like, maybe it's more of, I guess for, for me, like if there's any way to have like some type of like, Hey, this has been submitted, you email or something.
Or even if it's on the website, but what all, uh, personally for me, like let's say. You know, I've submitted, let's say I've submitted, and you get the confirmation page. Sometimes personally I'll try to like, take a screenshot of that or something, but then I'll try to save that somewhere and like I don't remember where I saved it.
And then if like in a month you're like, did I, I think I'm pretty sure I submitted that. Did I submit it? And you're trying to figure out where is the confirmation that you submitted. Mm-hmm. But I, I guess, uh, I mean, but then again, I also know, like online you can see all the claim statuses, so you would be able to say like, pending or, you know, all the different statuses.
So maybe it's not that pertinent, but a lot of times for me, I, I'll do like a quick email search for my email and just be like, you know, did I get a confirmation for whatever, like I paid my bill or whatever. So, um, but it looks like at least, at least initially there wouldn't be any type of, it says no other notification or receipt, which I would assume includes any of email too.
moderator: Is that, uh, so it sounds like, correct me if I'm wrong, it's a concern. It's a concern that you might not be able to go back and, you know, um, confirm that you did submit it because there's no other notification after that, after you leave that 
Participant 6: page. Yeah, I mean, that's, that's a personal thing. I mean, I know at the same time, like I know that there's ways to look at the claim status, so I would assume this should show as a pending claim or.
Like either the VA app, um, or VA do gov or whatever. But personally, when I just say like, no other receipt or notification just makes me feel like I kind of wish there was an email. Um, so that would be a concern for me. But, but it also, if that's just not part of the process right now, then that makes sense.
Whereas it might be a whole, a whole project in itself just to like come up with a way to, you know, generate an email or some other thing, uh, based on completing a form or completing something else, 
moderator: it's definitely a valid concern. Yeah.
Participant 6: Um,
Okay. I think that makes sense. Um, One, one thing that like, was kind of confusing to me, and I know how this plays into doing this, you know, online and on our, like on our own as a veteran, when it says, please open or respond to any letters you received from us, um, I feel like there were times that even know from some of my claims, um, and working with the VSO.
 I would get notified by, like, I would get letters in the mail and then I would get letters online, and maybe they were the same ones, sometimes I would assume they were the same ones, but, you know, obviously I'm getting notified online quicker than the, the snail mail letters. Um, but there was letters that seemed like there were times where like, maybe they were, it was like a delayed thing where I would get a letter and then that request would be closed.
So either way it was confusing to me even working with the V S O to be like, what can I, what should I ignore and what, what or what can I ignore and what shouldn't I ignore? Cause it does say, here, please open and respond to any letters you received from us. But there was at least one or two times where something came in. It was like a request, but it wasn't really a request to me. I think it was a request to like get other, I don't, I guess that that's what's, that part is kind of confusing to me because I don't know if the VSO did something without me knowing. Or, or if the VA did something just like, I'm, we're pulling your medical records from a different hospital, or whatever it was, and then all of a sudden, like, that request was just closed even though I didn't do anything.
 Um, so I guess I don't know that one, it was confusing to me as it was happening and then reading this and this thing to say, please open or respond to any letters. Like, I don't. I don't know if that's always gonna be the case where if, if I don't need to respond, is that gonna be clear or not?
But anyways, this just something I'm thinking of like as I read that section and then thinking about my personal experience with some of the confusing letters that I got where it's like, Hey, we're we're requesting more information from you but then it ended up just being auto close based on them like I know the VA got some file or something that wasn't.
Something I was doing. So, um, maybe that was a personal thing and it shouldn't have happened. Um, but I dunno if that's something my other veterans go through, either on their own or with the vso. Yeah. 
moderator: Thank you for calling that out cause it might be something that comes up again. You never know. 
Participant 6: Okay.
Um, I don't know if, if the links work, but I would wanna click on this to learn about uploading evidence, documents, support, um, disability claims. I'm assuming as part of the process they would cover that too, but, I'm, I'm assuming that all online you would be able to just upload files, like grab them from your local desktop or something and, and upload files, but, um, I would be kinda curious about that and, um, knowing what my options were for uploading.
moderator: Okay. And when you say, um, the options, like the, the technical options, like how the technical process for uploading evidence. 
Participant 6: Yep. Okay. Yep. And I see like, it looks like this is a link, but I if, I dunno if I wanna click on it or not, or if it doesn't work, but I haven't clicked. But learn more about uploading evidence, documents that calls out.
moderator: Okay. Okay. That's good to know.
Participant 6: And then I, I was gonna collapse this, but is there anything else for this section? 
moderator: Um, I guess I am wondering about, um, that last section. What's your understanding of, um, when the, when these additional, um, forms come into play? Um,
Participant 6: So I was thinking that most of this stuff would not be relevant for me, but I mean, I do have dependents, um, and I think I ended up handling that kind of completely separate from any claim or specific claim. Um, uh, but yeah, so like, let's see. I mean, personally, I feel like most of, most of the other ones other than dependents isn't relevant for me.
But I guess I'm not sure. Um, I guess I don't know about the additional benefits because you, oh, I think I did read one point the, the third to last bullet. Um, but I think it was more of like, you know, like health needs or something and housing or something. So, um, glancing at it, initially I was thinking it wasn't really relevant and then I did see dependents at the very bottom.
Um, if anything, maybe dependents would be better closer to the top cause I would assume more veterans might have dependents when they might not always have like all the other needs, but, um, well, at least it looks like you would be able to quickly jump out and start looking at those forms too if they're relevant for you.
moderator: Okay. And then before we end, I guess now that we're kind of at the end of the page, I'm wondering, you know, again, just thinking through your own, um, experience, filing a claim, if you feel like there's anything you know, missing here, any questions that are unanswered that you would, you would wanna see answered here?
Participant 6: Um, I think it's, I think it covers mostly everything. I think maybe the one concern that I could think of is that, I might, depending on the scenario and like how I came to trying to do this, I might skip by a lot of this too. Like I could, um, like as I read through everything, I think there was pertinent stuff in each section.
Um, but I also feel like there's some times where I kind of just wanna jump into something and then I'll figure out stuff along the way. I see. Um, so I don't know if there that, I would assume that there might be some people that just don't even expand any of this and just go straight in to sign in. To start and then hope that as they go through that, that process, that they would just pick up the details that they would need as they're doing it.
And maybe that's completely the case. I don't know. Um, but I mean, I, I personally would probably expand each one of these individually and kind of skim through it. And I might, I, I think personally I would probably miss some of the stuff that I, I read more closely just as part of this process. And I, and I, I'm in the way, I'm glad that I did, but I don't think I would've done this naturally on my own.
Um, so I think overall, I think it covers a lot of information in a, you know, in a good way, like a good concise way where, you know, people can choose to, you know, read through it top to bottom what they, it all expanded. Um, but I also feel like at times I probably would've just kind of skipped past, like maybe I would've jumped into one or two of them.
But I also, I could say like, well, I don't know. I'll just, I'll just start. I'll just start it and hope that it covers what I need as I do the process, especially since that like this blue one is above this, you know, like there was another way. Yeah. So it looks like we can sign in both above and below it.
And to me, if I started from the very top of this and kind of started scrolling down, I would kind of see this, but I might wanna just click right into that, that top blue one, the sign in and start it before even. You know, actually going through all the, the steps, but I would assume some of these steps might be just built into the, into the full process too.
So maybe it's not that big of a deal, but, um, but I do think it covers the information that I would want to, to find all on the same page. I know there's a couple links out to places, but I think personally it covered what I wanted to know without having to jump out. But I also know that different page if wanted detail.
moderator: I see. Okay. Okay. That's good to know. I was wondering, um, you know, um, and the first one we looked at, um, some information about supplemental claim. Do you mind opening up that first section? Yep. And, and I think it's towards the bottom. Yes. Um, yeah. So yeah, here we wanted, uh, just to ask, so, so basically, you know, we're wanting to distinguish the supplemental claim, which is what you file when you've been denied and you have four evidence.
Um, as opposed to this claim for increase that we talked about, which is what you do when you mm-hmm. Have been granted some benefits, but you want it to be increased. And we're wondering how we can make that clearer here, um, and kind of distinguish between the two more if you have any, um, suggestion about that.
And if not, it's okay. But I did, we did talk about that a little bit, so I was just wondering. 
Participant 6: Yeah. Um. So I guess, I mean reading through it, like as kinda like fresh eyes. I mean, I do see that like you'll need to file the supplemental. Instead of this form. So like, this is obviously separating it from this process if either of these cases is true.
So I do think like that part is clear to me now that I'm kind of looking at it fresh from the start. So then essentially what I'm reading now is that it's either one or two. It's like first bullet, second bullet, and that it, you know, like separately, you know, have you been granted benefits already? Um, I don't, so I.
Again, I think maybe as I was reading before, I had already had this expanded. Um, and then I kind of just kinda lumped this all together a little bit. Okay. Um, I, I guess, I don't know, let's see. I dunno if there's way that, like maybe something should be bolded. 
moderator: Yeah, it was in that alert, that yellow alert where it mentioned the claims for increase and um, you know, we had talked about how it kind of seemed like an extension of the first part, so Yeah.
Right. 
Participant 6: Well, so yeah, that's what I was trying to get to is like, like to me, when I originally read it, I wasn't rereading that first section of the supplemental. The, you know, like where it says instead of this form, either of these is true. So like that clearly says like it's one of these two bullets that are relevant to the supplemental claim.
Um, and not like the whole section below it. Um, but I think initially I didn't. So when we were talking about it before, I was thinking about it as like supplemental claim. Like this whole area, this whole entire section, like in my view right now was all supplemental claim. Um, but I do think that the first sentence does say either of these true, are true.
Um, so I don't know how it could be different though. So have you been granted other than, I dunno if there's any maybe more space. Lemme just see. I dunno if that would make a difference either. I'm trying, I. Like the other parts of this section, of this, um, of this section. Like you have some bold, there's some bulleted and some different bullet stuff.
Um, I see like, I'm just trying to figure out like in my mind, what would I, what would I expect to see to keep it more separated to me? Like even a single more space above the yellow section. But I, I don't know if that doesn't really match up with the kind of the, the rest of it. It's not like you have double.
Double spaces anywhere just to kind of separate different parts of it. 
moderator: Yeah, but it's still good to think through, just like, you know, it could be format, we might try some formatting there. So yeah, thanks for, it's still helpful to call it out. Yep. Um, okay. I guess, you know, we are running on time. I guess additional, the, my last question would just be how prepared do you feel, you know, to start the form on your own, on a scale from like one to 10, do you feel, you know, one not at all prepared, or 10, you know, extremely prepared?
The most prepared to start? 
Participant 6: Um, I, I think as, as I am personally right now, and knowing what I've gone through in the last two years with the VS O and other claims, and then reading through this, I think I'd be, I feel pretty highly prepared, like, like a nine. Um, if I'm trying to think about this stuff, like I've never done a claim before.
I never worked with A V S O, I, I, I think it might be a little lower, but not much. I do think, I mean, I think it covers a lot of the steps and it covers what the expectations are. Um, but I don't, I guess I personally, it's hard for me to know, like I, as I read through this, I'm like, oh yeah, I did that. Oh, I did that, I did that.
But like, if I didn't have that background, if I read something, I don't know if I would translate it correctly in my mind of like, yes, that means that I should be doing this, like getting my medical records or, or whatever. But I still think overall I probably still feel pretty prepared as somebody who didn't know.
But, uh, personally, I'm, I would say like a nine. And this would make me want to just, like, if I did a claim in the future, I might, this would make me wanna just do it on my own and do it online. Um, so I don't, in my mind it's like taking away time from other veterans with the VSO that might be, having more, you know, different types of scenarios than I do, um, where I think I could handle this on my own and not take time away from the VSO and other veterans.
So. 
moderator: I see. Okay. Well, thank you so much, Ryan. That was, that was really helpful. I really appreciate the way you walked me through everything and, and your thought process. Um, you know, it's really gonna help inform, you know, the way we refine this, this. This form. Um, so that was great. Um, before we go, I just wanna let you know that per, uh, Perian is gonna follow up with you, um, about conversation, about, um, sharing this.
If you know other veterans who are as opinionated as you are and can help us, um, feel free to refer them as well. Sounds good. All right. Thanks again. Hope you enjoy the rest 
Participant 6: of your day. Thank you, you too. Bye-Bye.
