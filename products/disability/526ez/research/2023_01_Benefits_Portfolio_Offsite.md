# Research Plan for OCTO Benefits Portfolio Support Team, January 24 - 26, 2023

## Background
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
We aim for our portfolio's products to get Veterans benefits in minutes, not months.

- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
The main one we're interested in for this research: https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction

- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
Iteration on an existing one. Veterans submit ~1,500 disability claims per day through this tool.

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims. This is one of ten OCTO objectives for 2023.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

Getting out / starting up / taking care of myself (applying for disability compensation benefits)


## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 
- How do Veterans feel about VA when applying for disability benefits on VA.gov?
- What are the biggest pain points Veterans experience when applying for disability benefits on VA.gov?
- What do Veterans like about the experience of applying for disability benefits on VA.gov?

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
- We will share our learnings with the teams we support that work on the disability benefits application tool on VA.gov. They will use these learnings to reduce the time it takes to apply for benefits on VA.gov.

### Research questions

- How do Veterans feel about VA when applying for disability benefits on VA.gov?
- What are the biggest pain points Veterans experience when applying for disability benefits on VA.gov?
- What do Veterans like about the experience of applying for disability benefits on VA.gov?

Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

We intend to hear directly from Veterans about what it feels like to use one of our products to get access to a crucial benefit. Our hypothesis is that Veterans are skeptical going into the application process, but if we can make the process easier and quicker, we can help create feelings of trust and pride.

## Methodology	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
We want to have somewhat open-ended conversations with Veterans to explore ideas we may not yet have encountered and leave room for unexpected insights.

Additional resources:
- Please review the [PRA primer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/what-is-paperwork-reduction-act.md) to educate yourself on how PRA impacts the research we do as a government project. 
- Review the [Perigean recruitment guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recruiting-Participants.1958773044.html) to understand how Perigean recruits, and what types of research they can support. 
- If conducting testing on mobile, refer to the [mobile research guidelines.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Conducting-Research-Sessions.1958773061.html#ConductingResearchSessions-Researchingwithmobileusers)
- If conducting [unmoderated usability research, refer to the guidance here.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Planning-Unmoderated-Studies.1904738369.html) 
- If conducting [research with disabled Veterans, refer to this checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-with-assistive-technology-users) and [follow disability etiquette guidelines.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/disability-etiquette)
- In the rare event of an emergency during research, be prepared by reviewing guidelines for [research safety and emergency exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html).

### Location
Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)
- We'd like to hold the research sessions at either Los Angeles Regional Office (11000 Wilshire Blvd, Los Angeles, CA 90024) or Greater Los Angeles Medical Center (11301 Wilshire Boulevard).
- While we would prefer in-person sessions, we're open to remote: Zoom.
- POC: Zach Goldfine (zachary.goldfine@va.gov)
- No equipement besides our own laptops.


### Research materials

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.  

For moderated interviews:
- [Link to conversation guide]([url goes here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023_01_Benefits_Portfolio_Offsite_Conversation_Guide.md)) 
	
## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 
- Veterans
- Perigean


Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? Maximum variation sampling.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 
- 3 Veterans


**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 
- The only necessary criterion: That each Veteran has applied for disability compensation benefits through VA.gov in the past 24 months (either in 2021 or 2022)
- Ideally, we'd like to have those 3 Veterans be: 1 person with an identified cognitive disability, 1 person aged 55+, and 1 person of color



**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 
None

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
