# Conversation Guide 

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session
- Review VA Platform's Research Checklist.
- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)
   - Assign and confirm notetaker(s)
      - This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review guidance on taking notes. If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes.
   - Prepare for note-taking
      - Create a “session notes” folder within your research study Github folder and store each session as a .md document. Copy the conversation guide over to your .md file before each session so that you have a structured way to capture your notes.
   - Invite observers
     - Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. Limit your observers to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed. You should empower participants by allowing them to decide if they are comfortable having observers. Ask observers to review information about observer guidelines and attendance etiquette.
   - Prepare as moderator
      - Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions, and guidance on participant and researcher safety and exit strategies.
   - Confirm participant knows what technology they need for the session
      - If we have access to participant communications or reconfirm with Perigean that the participant has been informed
   - Confirm Zoom is recording to the cloud.
   - Assign timekeeper from observers?

### Day of the session
- Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

### Starting the session
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. We’re a [ROLE] and [ROLE] with VA. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about the experience of starting the 526EZ application and observe your process of completing the form.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This session is scheduled to last for up to two hours. You are welcome to take any breaks you need or end the session early.  Most of our time together will be observing you working on the 526, but we will start and end our time together with some questions to learn more about you. 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was all right to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
      - “Hi, I’m [NAME], and I’m a [ROLE] with the [PROJECT] team at VA.”
- Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- Is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
Start recording.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Section 1 - Warm-Up Questions- 10 minutes
Before we start our observations, let’s start with some warm-up questions. 
- We saw from the information you shared that you are planning to apply for disability benefits online. Are you still ready to start that with us today? 
   - [If no] What do you need to do to be ready to apply? 
      - How would you find out if you’re eligible to apply?
      - Is there anything else you would want to know or prepare before starting? 
- What is motivating you to apply for disability benefits today? 
   - [If they’ve been eligible for a while] What has prevented you from filing before now? 
- Why have you decided to file using the online form? 
   - [For those who have filed previously] How do you think filing online will compare to your past experiences filing?  
- Did you do anything in advance to prepare to file today? 
   - [If yes] Why did you plan ahead?
   - [If yes] How do you think that preparation will help you with the process?
- What do you hope to achieve during today’s session? 
   - Is there anything you think could get in the way?
   - How long do you expect that process to take?
- How easy or difficult do you think it will be to complete the form? Can you explain what makes you think that?

## Section 2 - Observation 
Before you begin to fill out the form, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- We've asked people to allow us to observe them fill out the form with real claim information because it gives us a better view into potential difficulties with the form. 
- You are under no obligation to continue or to even submit the form during our session if you are not ready to. We can also stop recording if there are portions of the form you do not want us to record.
- You are in control of this process. If you need to take a break or end the session at any point, please do so. Your safety and comfort are our priority! 
- We are researchers, not experts on filling out claims. While we welcome your questions, we may not be able to answer them for you. 
- It’s time to begin! We ask that as you work, you share your thought process by thinking aloud. We will chime in from time to time with questions, but our goal is to listen and learn from you, so we will mostly be observing quietly with our videos off. 

[Throughout the observation, the moderator will watch for evidence of confusion, hesitation, frustration, bouncing, etc. See sample questions below. ] 
- I noticed that you paused for a moment on [name the page], can you explain why?
- I observed that when [x] happened you did [y]. Can you explain your thought process there? 
- I see that you have [insert thing they did- ie. opened another browser window], can you explain how that is a part of your process?

## Section 3 - Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
- How do you feel about the overall experience of working on the digital form? 
   - Were there any aspects of the experience that stood out as particularly positive or negative? 
   - On a scale of 1-5 (1 being easy, 5 being hard), how would you rate your ease of use of the application?
   - Did any aspect of the experience surprise you? 
- [For participants who did not finish] What are your next steps for completing the form?
   - When do you think you’ll continue working on the application? 
   - Do you have any concerns about being able to finish it? 
- Imagine a friend of yours was about to fill out the online form. What would you want to tell them in order to prepare them for the experience?
- [If you used multiple devices to complete the application] How does your experience differ across these devices?

Closing Questions
- Do you want to share anything else about your experience filing for benefits? 
- Any questions for me?

## Consent to use video clips
- I want to circle back and re-confirm that it’s okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
[For Veterans who did not finish the form] If you are willing, we are interested in trying to schedule another session so we can continue our observation. What do you think? You are also welcome to think about it and contact Perigean to schedule another session. [Moderator will not schedule next session in real time.] 
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

## Backup Moderator Plan
In the event the moderator needs to stop moderating, we’ll have determined a backup moderator for each session from one of the other possible moderators in the session (Nichole Nicholas nichole.nicholas@coforma.io, Julie Pedtke julie.pedtke@coforma.io, Evelyn Hilbrich Davis evelyn@cityfriends.tech).   
- The initial moderator will communicate with the backup moderator via the Feedback-backchannel on Slack that they need to swap roles.
- The initial moderator will communicate with the participant that they’re going to switch with a note-taker and introduce the new moderator. 
   - “I’m going to switch out with my note taker, Julie Pedtke, who will be moderating the remainder of this session. I’ll still be on the call, but Julie will be leading. Did you have any questions before we switch out?”
- The initial moderator will assume note-taking responsibilities.
