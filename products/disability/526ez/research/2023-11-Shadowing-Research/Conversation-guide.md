# Conversation Guide 

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session
- Review VA Platform's Research Checklist.
- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)
   - Assign and confirm notetaker(s)
      - This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review guidance on taking notes. If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes.
   - Prepare for note-taking
      - Create a “session notes” folder within your research study Github folder and store each session as a .md document. Copy the conversation guide over to your .md file before each session so that you have a structured way to capture your notes.
   - Invite observers
     - Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. Limit your observers to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed. You should empower participants by allowing them to decide if they are comfortable having observers. Ask observers to review information about observer guidelines and attendance etiquette.
   - Prepare as moderator
      - Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions, and guidance on participant and researcher safety and exit strategies.
   - Confirm participant knows what technology they need for the session
      - If we have access to participant communications or reconfirm with Perigean that the participant has been informed
   - Confirm Zoom is recording to the cloud.
   - Assign timekeeper from observers?

### Day of the session
- Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

### Starting the session
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 10 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. We’re a [ROLE] and [ROLE] with VA. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I have a few things I want to go over with you:

- Today we will be observing you while you apply for disability benefits using the online form. We've asked people to allow us to observe them fill out the form with real claim information because it gives us a better view into potential difficulties with the form.
- This session is scheduled to last for up to two hours. Our time together will include some opening/closing questions, with a majority of the time dedicated to your filling out the form.
- We are researchers, not experts on filling out claims. While we welcome your questions, we may not be able to answer them for you. 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. If you choose to leave the session, it  will not affect your benefits with VA in any way. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- We will take a planned five minute break at the halfway point in case either of us needs to stretch or use the restroom or get some water. We can extend that break if either of us needs more time.
  
That was a lot of information. Can I answer any questions you may have before proceeding?

We are going to pause here and make sure you are set up to screen share when the time comes for the observation. 

- What kind of device are you using today? This could be a computer, phone, tablet, etc. 
- Which browser are you planning to use to work on the application? This could be Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, etc. 
- Did you have the opportunity to sign into VA.gov before joining us today? 
   - Are you signed in right now? 
   - [If not] That’s ok! We will do it together once we get started. 
- In order for us to observe your work, we will need to ask you to share your screen.
   - Would you mind practicing screen sharing now? [Offer support if necessary]

Wonderful, now we are all ready for the observation when it is time to begin. Two more points to discuss before getting started. 

- Is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - If unsure: An option we have is that we could stop recording for any pages that include sensitive information, like your SSN and bank account. We can provide a heads up when these pages are coming. Is that something you’d be interested in trying? [If still unsure, offer to not record.]

- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was all right to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
      - “Hi, I’m [NAME], and I’m a [ROLE] with the [PROJECT] team at VA.”
        

**- [Start recording.]** **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Section 1 - Warm-Up Questions- 10 minutes
Before we start our observations, let’s start with some warm-up questions. 
- We saw from the information you shared that you are planning to apply for disability benefits online. Are you still ready to start that with us today? 
   - [If no] What do you need to do to be ready to apply? 
      - How would you find out if you’re eligible to apply?
      - Is there anything else you would want to know or prepare before starting? 
- What is motivating you to apply for disability benefits today? 
   - When did you finish your military service?
   - [If they’ve been eligible for a while] What has prevented you from filing before now? 
- Why have you decided to file using the online form? 
   - [For those who have filed previously] How do you think filing online will compare to your past experiences filing?  
- Did you do anything in advance to prepare to file today? 
   - [If yes] Why did you plan ahead?
   - [If yes] How do you think that preparation will help you with the process?
- What do you hope to achieve during today’s session? 
   - Is there anything you think could get in the way?
   - How long do you expect that process to take?
- How easy or difficult do you think it will be to complete the form? Can you explain what makes you think that?
- [Once complete] Thanks so much. I’d like to open the floor to my colleagues for any follow up questions. 

## Section 2 - Observation 
Before you begin to fill out the form, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- You are under no obligation to continue or to even submit the form during our session if you are not ready to. We can also stop recording if there are portions of the form you do not want us to record. [Offer to flag screens with sensitive information]
- You are in control of this process. As I have said already, if you need to take a break or end the session at any point, please do so. Our scheduled break will come at the hour mark. Your safety and comfort are our priority! 
**- It’s time to begin! We ask that as you work, you share your thought process by thinking aloud**
- I will be turning my video off so you can focus on the task at hand. I will chime in from time to time with questions, but our main goal is to listen and learn from you. 

[Facilitator turns off video for the duration of the shadowing]

[Throughout the observation, the moderator will watch for evidence of confusion, hesitation, frustration, bouncing, etc. See sample questions below. ] 
- I noticed that you paused for a moment on [name the page], can you explain why?
- I observed that when [x] happened you did [y]. Can you explain your thought process there? 
- I see that you have [insert thing they did- ie. opened another browser window], can you explain how that is a part of your process?

## Section 3 - Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
- [Skip at first if participants got blocked early in the form] How do you feel about the overall experience of working on the digital form? 
   - Were there any aspects of the experience that stood out as particularly positive or negative? 
   - On a scale of 1-5 (1 being easy, 5 being hard), how would you rate your ease of use of the application?
   - Did any aspect of the experience surprise you?
   - Were there any moments when you felt uncertain while filling out the form? 
- [For participants who did not finish, jump to here] What are your next steps for completing the form?
   - Let’s make a list! What do you need to do in order to be ready to complete the form?
   - When do you think you’ll continue working on the application? 
   - Do you have any concerns about being able to finish it?
   - What will you do if you experience challenges again?  
- Imagine a friend of yours was about to fill out the online form. What would you want to tell them in order to prepare them for the experience?
- [If you used multiple devices to complete the application] How does your experience differ across these devices?
- [Once complete] Thanks so much. I’d like to open the floor to my colleagues for any follow up questions. 

Closing Questions
- Do you want to share anything else about your experience filing for benefits? 
- Any questions for me?

## Consent to keep recording
- Now that we have completed the session, I want to circle back and re-confirm that it’s okay with you that we use this recording to make sure we capture your experience accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
   - Is it ok if we use this recording as I described for research purposes?
   - If yes: Thinking back, are there any parts of the session you do NOT want us to keep in the recording? 
 
## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

[For Veterans who did not finish the form] If you are willing, we are interested in trying to schedule another session so we can continue our observation. What do you think? You are also welcome to think about it and contact Perigean to schedule another session. [Moderator will not schedule next session in real time.] 

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy. Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

## Backup Moderator Plan
In the event the moderator needs to stop moderating, we’ll have determined a backup moderator for each session from one of the other possible moderators in the session (Nichole Nicholas nichole.nicholas@coforma.io, Julie Pedtke julie.pedtke@coforma.io, Evelyn Hilbrich Davis evelyn@cityfriends.tech).   
- The initial moderator will communicate with the backup moderator via the Feedback-backchannel on Slack that they need to swap roles.
- The initial moderator will communicate with the participant that they’re going to switch with a note-taker and introduce the new moderator. 
   - “I’m going to switch out with my note taker, Julie Pedtke, who will be moderating the remainder of this session. I’ll still be on the call, but Julie will be leading. Did you have any questions before we switch out?”
- The initial moderator will assume note-taking responsibilities.
