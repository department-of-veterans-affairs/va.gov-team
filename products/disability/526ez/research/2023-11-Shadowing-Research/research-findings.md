## Research Goals
Disability compensation is often the first VA "service" that Veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their future experiences. 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. 
526 has many known pain points and multiple teams working on improvements. While there is continual user testing of features within the form, we were missing the Veteran perspective on end-to-end filing. 
* **Goal 1:** Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
* **Goal 2:** Identify the pain points that lead to uncertainty, distrust, form exits, multiple sessions, and abandonment.
* **Goal 3:** Learn how Veterans plan for and adapt to the length and complexity of the 526. 

The most relevant touchpoints in the Veteran’s journey are Taking care of myself, Putting down roots, and Retirement. 

## Research Questions
* **Goal 1:** Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
   * How easy is it to use the design the first time? Can Veterans understand what they need to do?
       * How does the Veteran’s experience change from the beginning of the form to later sections? 
   * How quickly can Veterans perform tasks?
   * Are there many user errors that are easy to make, and can they easily recover? (Efficiency)
   * How do Veterans feel about their experience?

* **Goal 2:** Identify the pain points that lead to form exits, multiple sessions, and abandonment.
    * What are the blockers that are preventing Veterans from completing the form in one session? 
    * Are certain parts of the form a heavier burden to complete than others? If so, why?
    * Where might the form be relying too much on memory and recall?

* **Goal 3:** Learn how Veterans plan for and adapt to the length and complexity of the 526. 
    * How can we best prepare Veterans for what’s ahead in the form so that they can plan accordingly?
    * What are Veterans' expectations for completing the 526ez before getting started? 
        * Where did they get their information? 
    * Do Veterans intend to finish in a single session, or do they plan for breaks?
        * Do they time-box work on an application, or do they have other milestones such as finishing a specific section?
    * What do Veterans do when they have a question or need assistance? 
    * (After completing the form) How well does their plan hold up? Did their approach or mindset change throughout the experience? Does anything surprise them?

## Methodology
We facilitated 11 semi-structured interviews via Zoom and observed Veterans filling out the 526ez form. During the sessions, Veterans shared their screens and thought aloud as they filled out the form using their personal information with the intention of filing.

Structure of the sessions (capped at 2 hours):
* 10 minutes for introduction and questions about preparation/expectations for the 526
* 90 minutes for shadowing Veterans during form completion with the moderator asking occasional questions (with a 5-minute break at the hour mark)
* 10 minutes for reflection questions and wrap-up.

**Limitations**

Although we met with 11 Veterans, the findings in this report are based on the 5 participants who started the 526. The other participants were not ready to file or were looking to file a different type of claim such as an appeal or supplemental claim. 
* Of the 5 who started, 3 successfully submitted a claim while 2 stopped at Step 3 Evidence. 
* Three were first-time filers who had never submitted a claim before, while 2 had submitted previously (in paper and online).
* Due to the small sample size, we cannot conclude this is representative of all Veterans.

**Learnings**
* While shadowing provides meaningful “real life” data, it took longer than anticipated to observe Veterans filing. If a participant struggled with authentication or hit an ITF error, we had no way to unblock them. We increased our number of participants mid-study to ensure the proper sample size was able to start the form. 
* Many Veterans expected the researcher to help them file—not just observe the experience. For future work, we will make sure our recruitment language sets clear expectations. 

## Thematic Findings

### Finding #1<a id="finding"></a> 

**Participant’s existing level of trust in VA informed how they reacted to uncertainty throughout the filing experience.**
* Some participants view unclear language or usability issues as further proof of VA’s malintent.
    * “There is built-in ambiguity… because of the necessary precision they’ve mandated in the past… If you don't put exactly what they want it is probably a mechanism they can use to reject your claim.” -P11
* Other participants—especially those claiming for MST—doubt that VA will be able to retrieve evidence and fairly evaluate complex claims. 
    * “I personally have no faith. To be totally honest, I might not get any benefits because it was so long ago … I don't think that we as older Veterans have faith in the VA system and being able to provide the evidence we need.” -P21
    * “When you think you have enough information to support a complex claim, get more. Save everything you send to the VA and vice versa.” -P18
* Conversely, participants who have had good outcomes with VA in the past might have an easier time completing the form by assuming goodwill. 
    * One participant, who liked their local VA facility, was confident that VA would follow up if something was confusing or missing from their claim—a strong contrast to the feelings of other participants. 
    * “I was able to fill out what I thought was the right information, with the assumption that if I've done something the VA doesn't understand I will be contacted for more information.” -P6
* Veterans who have filed previously online or paper found filing easier than in previous experiences.
    * “Quite frankly, my experience with VA in the past has been pretty cumbersome and many times ungood. This was much easier. So thank you for your work on this.” P6

**Finding #1 Recommendations**
* The best way to rebuild trust is to continue improving the filing experience, which will gradually increase Veteran confidence in VA's ability to execute complex tasks quickly and transparently.

### Finding #2<a id="finding"></a>

**Questions designed to connect Veterans with more or better services were confusing and unhelpful to some participants.**
* Some Veterans do not understand why VA is collecting or using sensitive data about homelessness and POW. This uncertainty reinforces distrust.   
    * “Have you ever been a POW? What difference does it make? Don't you have my records? Can't you figure that out? … What difference does it make if I'm homeless or terminally ill? That shouldn't be a part of a disability claim. It's more bureaucracy.” -P11
    * [Upon seeing the questions about homelessness] “The VA doesn't care if Veterans are homeless. They really don't care about us, period. That's why they make things so hard like this.” -P12  
* At the additional benefits questions, Veterans often hesitated, skimmed the text, clicked yes, and then were disappointed to discover that none of the additional benefits were relevant to them, or that they would require more paperwork.
    * “There's nothing they offered [in Additional Benefits] that I could use for these two issues.” -P15 after selecting yes and going through the extra pages
    * “So it has two forms for [additional benefits], can I just skip that and finish my disability claim and do that later? Is this more red tape? They'll probably ask the same questions they did at the beginning of this.” -P12

**Finding #2 Recommendations**
* Review content throughout the form to ensure plain language, add helper text and examples where possible, and explain how information is used by VA. Start with sensitive questions such as POW, terminally ill, and homeless. 
* Good content hinges on good communication between designers and the business lines. Continue to collaborate closely with VBA and look for opportunities to engage claims processors directly. 

### Finding #3<a id="finding"></a>

**Form navigation does not allow participants to move easily around the form, making it harder to review their work and set expectations.**
* Participants are unable to preview what comes next in the form or continue past required fields, making it difficult to know if they’re entering information in the best place, or anticipate how much work still remains. 
    * “If I had this in paper, I'd read the whole questionnaire. I'd look ahead to see what the next question was… Here I just have to have faith in the back button that it's not going to take me back too far.” P21 after expressing uncertainty about how to respond to a question.
* Throughout the form, P11 used the browser rather than form navigation to move backward. When asked why, they stated, “I trust the browser more than I trust the website.”
* After submission, P6 identified a mistake in their claim but didn’t pursue a correction. 
    * “My name is actually [name] Junior. My father is also [name] and he's retired from the military also. I don't know if that would cause a problem… I have no idea [how to fix it]. I’d have to go back, look at the form, see if a Junior could be added.” P6
* There is a heavier emotional cost of going back when the Veteran is sharing information about traumatic events—especially in the PTSD flow. After realizing they may have entered something in the wrong section, P21 considered going back to change their response but then decided against it. 
    * “No, I’m not going to go back because I don't want to reread [the description of the event]." -P21

**Finding #3 Recommendations**
* Help Veterans navigate and anticipate
    * Explore an alternative navigation structure that doesn’t rely on the back button, such as replacing the “stepper” with an indexed sidebar navigation that shows what’s complete and what’s missing.  
    * Offer task lists so that Veterans can create their own time estimates based on their situation.
    * Look beyond the introduction and review pages for ways to set expectations. Important content should be delivered “just in time” at each step throughout the form. 
* Make it easy to make corrections
    * Evaluate the message that tells Veterans their application has been saved to see if it could be more prominent. 
    * Build on the summary pages to provide opportunities to review and edit throughout the form, not just at the end.

## Findings (organized by 526ez form flow)
### Navigation to the 526 and Intro Pages<a id="finding"></a>

**Finding: Participants had trouble navigating to the 526ez online form on VA.gov— even after login.**
* “Where is the form that actually has to be filled out? I see how to file a claim, when to file a claim... but where is the actual form that needs to be filled out?” -P6
    * P6 reviewed the ‘Evidence Page,’ downloaded the paper version of the 526, and scrolled the ‘When to File’ page, but was unable to find the ‘File a claim’ link without clicking on several other pages.
* Navigation to the form did not match the mental model of some participants, leading to lots of scrolling. 
    * [After scrolling around My VA and ‘How to file a claim’ screens] “I would've expected the 'filing a claim' option to be at a higher level in the process.” -P11 
* Three participants found success locating the online form by clicking on “File a claim online” on the left navigation bar for disability benefits. 
    * P12 asked the facilitator where to find the form. They scrolled the ‘My VA’, ‘Check your claim and appeals’, and ‘Learn how to file’ pages before finding the ‘File a claim’ link to the left of the screen. 
    * We hypothesize that Veterans repeatedly read past the “Start the Disability Compensation Application” because it was buried within a page of text and not plain language. “File a claim online” was a clear directive that stood out from surrounding content.

**Navigation to the 526 and Intro Page Recommendations**
* Increase consistency of language across entry points, and use words that tie to Veterans' expectations. Change instances of “Start an application” to “File a claim.” 
* Increase the prominence of entry points through visual design and hierarchy on the page.
* Explore the journey from login to filing and work across teams (such as Authenticated Experience) to reduce the number of clicks needed to find the form and assure Veterans that they're in the right place.

### Wizard and Intent To File<a id="finding"></a>
**Finding: ITF errors lead participants to form exits–and potential abandonment.**

* Three participants received ITF errors when they started to file, leading Veterans to doubt themselves or VA. 
    * [After receiving the “We’re sorry” error] “I guess I did something wrong…This is the part that… makes me stop and start again.” -P12
    * [Reads ITF error] "Something wrong happened on our end... Welcome to the VA…50% of the time I get error messages like that. I don't think I'm stupid, I think someone who is older and more feeble than I am would get mad.” -P11
* Veterans do not understand why they are being blocked by the ITF error messages—or how to correct them.
    * “Maybe if I go get the additional form, I won't get the error message-- maybe there is something precursor I should've done. Like maybe I need that [supporting form]” -P11
    * P12 is confused by the implications of the ITF error. “[The error] says I have to do an Intent to File, but I didn't say I wanted to do an Intent to File, I wanted to start an application … So because I have an Intent to File, does that mean I have to file from the Intent to File, I can't start a new claim? I think [the ITF] was from my last condition ... that's what I never got responses to. I would think it would let me start a new claim rather than start a new claim based on my Intent to File because I don't even remember what this Intent to File, it may have been for [past condition].” -P12

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-11-Shadowing-Research/Images/Image%202%20ITF.png)

P11 and P12 received this ITF error message when trying to start the form.

* Participant attempts to get past the error were largely unsuccessful. As far as we know from previous technical discovery, this error is not solvable by the Veteran and just requires some time to pass for the ITF system to recover—but this is not communicated to Veterans.
    * Three participants immediately hit the back button upon receiving the error. One participant was able to reload the page with a generated ITF. 
    * At the facilitator’s recommendation, two participants tried changing their browsers to get past the error. One Veteran who switched to Chrome was able to generate the ITF.
 
**Finding: When faced with an error that blocked their progress, participants rarely expressed interest in seeking help from the Contact Center.**

* P11 called before and got “nothing… recordings, leave a message, no response.” 
* “I would wait and try again later. I don’t want to call…I don’t like dealing with the VA over the phone” -P7
* P10 makes plans to call and visit their regional VA location. “I'll call first and then if I have to schedule to take off work and set up to talk to a case manager…If I end this meeting now, unless they close at 4, I'll try to talk to someone today.” 
* Only one participant considered calling the Contact Center for information but didn’t want to do it during the observation. “I’ve called the 1-800 for a few small things and they were very helpful.” -P3

**Wizard and Intent To File Recommendations**
* Allow participants to continue to file even if the ITF system is down (Team 2 has started this work, see open tickets).
* Rethink how we introduce the concept of ITF to clarify how it relates to past claims and conditions.
* Reinforce understanding of ITF by making it accessible in other places, such as the confirmation page after submission, the Veteran's profile, or the Claim Status Tool.

### Step 1 Veteran Details<a id="finding"></a>

**Finding: All Veterans who served in the Reserves or National Guard found this section of service history confusing for different reasons.**
* Participants faced questions that did not apply to their situation.
    * “I've already said I'm retired and now it's asking if I expect to receive active or inactive duty pay. It doesn't apply in my case.” -P6
* The obligation date field is seen as inapplicable or redundant for some Veterans.
     * “I did not sign a contract every 3-4 years like the enlisted ... I'm not sure what's needed.” -P6
     * “It's making me put in the same information that's already on the screen before this. I don't know why … I agreed that [the prefilled info] was correct and hit continue, and it made me put it in again.” -P12
* Level of detail needed for unit names could be clarified to reduce uncertainty:
    * “During the period of time I was in the reserves, I was a member of ... about seven or eight units. And I do not have all of those unit designations with me right now.” -P6
    * “I wasn't in a unit, because I wasn't National Guard. I was just... not applicable. What's it called? I was IRR.” -P15
      
**Finding: One Veteran shared that their discharge was not determined “honorable”—making it difficult to complete the Veteran Detail section when they filed previously.**
* As a result of an experience with military sexual trauma (MST), this participant shared that they were denied an honorable discharge and DD-214, which is a key document referenced when completing the form. 
    * “They didn’t want to give me a DD-214 and wanted to give me an “uncharacterized discharge.” -P18
 
**Step 1 Recommendations**
* Add conditional logic to streamline the flow. For example, if a Veteran says they are retired, skip the question about active or inactive duty pay. 
* Add helper text that clarifies obligation dates may not apply to some Veterans, such as officers. 
* Add helper text that clarifies the level of detail required for unit names.
* Do further discovery on the journey for Veterans with less than honorable discharges

### Step 2 Disabilities<a id="finding"></a>

**Finding: Usability challenges slowed Veterans down as they were adding their conditions.**
* Currently the form only allows Veterans to select one rated disability as the cause for their secondary condition. One participant wanted to select multiple rated disabilities, but couldn’t. 
    * “It won't let me choose both things. They are both, in conjunction, contributing to the [new condition]. But I can only choose one or the other. I would expect to have a box over on the left so I could click on more than one. Maybe if I hold control I can click on more than one... no... maybe shift? No.” -P12
* Veterans experience data loss if they decide to change the cause of their condition mid-flow.  
    * The form asks Veterans what caused their condition via a series of radio buttons and a text box that appears dynamically on the page. If they write a response in the text box and then change their radio button selection, their text is deleted and cannot be retrieved, as P12 experienced. 
    * “My answer might change again if the other [condition] isn't under here. Oh, it is! But it took away all my typing.” -P12

**Finding: A participant expressed interest in additional support to identify conditions they could apply for.**
* Veterans often learn about the claims process through word of mouth and rely on this for context around what the VA considers a service-connected disability. 
* In other research studies, we’ve seen that Veterans sometimes use the dropdown list of conditions as another way to learn what’s possible and decide the appropriate conditions to claim (see Finding 2 and 6, Conditions List Veteran Research Findings).
    * “What I was hoping... I thought maybe it would ask me questions and I could be like oh I qualify for this disability I didn't know about. The only way I know about [certain conditions] is by talking to other people who have filled out these forms. It would be nice if there were a place where someone could look to see what is considered a disability.” -P21

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-11-Shadowing-Research/Images/Image%203%20Conditions.png)

Follow-up page for each new condition includes causes as radio buttons, a dropdown for rated disabilities, and a free text field for descriptions


**Finding: The process of filing for PTSD is long and can be confusing.**
* One participant completed the PTSD flow during observation and a second participant extensively described past experiences filing for MST. These two accounts speak to the unique and acute challenges of claiming PTSD–and validate earlier findings by VEO research.
* The observed participant took 58 minutes to complete the PTSD flow, while other participants filed their full claim in about/under an hour. 
* The form asks Veterans to describe the event that led to their condition. However, the cause may have been multiple events or a pervasive culture—which is harder to know how to report. 
    * "If I got hit in the head, then it's very straightforward. But for something like sexual harassment, it's not one event. Yes, I've had some events. But I don't know if this is going to allow me to continue with the harassment I went through... It was the environment." -P21
* The form offers multiple checkboxes describing different types of PTSD. This Veteran thought one event would be considered multiple types of PTSD, and then got confused when they were asked to enter the information more than once for the different PTSD types.
    * "I had several events where it was very traumatic, so I didn't know whether to hit the last line [Non-combat PTSD other than sexual trauma or personal assault] or not." -P21
    * “I put everything down that I wanted to about that event, and now it's asking what happened during the event. It says I don't need to repeat anything I already put in the form, so I'm going to continue … If anyone is reading what I wrote don't you think that would be sexual assault? ... I should've not answered that other stuff previously, I should've waited until this part [because] it's labeled personal assault and sexual trauma." -P21
* The transition out of the PTSD section of the form is abrupt and unclear.
    * "All of a sudden, I'm like ok Step 2 of 5 Conditions. Am I still on the sexual part? Or now I wear hearing aids... so I'm going to back up and see … Ok so I go from personal assault and trauma... ok I'm going to make the assumption, and I think you need to label it better. This is just to file for the disability." -P21
* There can be challenges for survivors of MST to obtain evidence to complete the form.
    * “I’m sorry I don’t have a more visible injury.  You have to develop a thick skin to hear that pushback from an authority figure in VA”. -P18

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-11-Shadowing-Research/Images/Image%204%20PTSD.png)

PTSD condition page includes multiple choices for the type of PTSD-related events.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-11-Shadowing-Research/Images/Image%205%20PTSD%20MST.png)

At the end of the PTSD/MST flow Veterans are asked the POW question directly, without an intermediary page to signal the transition.

**Step 2 Recommendations**
* Consider allowing Veterans to select multiple service-connected disabilities per secondary condition. 
* Help Veterans discover conditions they might be experiencing, but did not know they could claim. 
* Address data loss that results from conditional logic for condition causes. 
* Meet and collaborate with the team working to digitize the PTSD form. 
* Address the experience of entering and leaving the PTSD flow to reduce confusion.

### Step 3 Supporting Evidence<a id="finding"></a>

**Finding: The types of records Veterans have and how they want them collected impact their filing burden.** 
* There are three types of evidence for a disability claim: VA medical records, Private Medical Records (PMR), and Lay/Buddy statements. We will break down the three types and highlight Veteran questions we heard throughout the research.
* Veterans must determine:
    * 1. What type of evidence do they need to prove their case
    * 2. Where the evidence lives/who has it
    * 3. How they want that information collected
      
**Finding: Having only VA records streamlines the filing process for Veterans and reduces cognitive load.**
* If the Veteran selects only VA records, they’re asked to provide VA facility information and date ranges of care. They do not need to upload additional documentation or authorize a release of information.
* One participant who requested only VA medical records completed their filing on a  mobile device in 22 minutes. [Note: They had filed online in the last year, which would contribute to speed.]
* However, participants had questions that led to uncertainty about the success of their claim. 
    * **Community Providers:** “I went to a [doctor] that VA paid for but it was a community doctor, would that be a VA doctor or private medical records? I think it's a VA medical record, but it's a private doctor VA contracted with, so I don't know.” -P12
    * **Precise Data:** P11 expressed concern about being precise with “the correct or exact information” for the facility location. They shared, “I can see how if [my answer] isn't precise they might say “Oh I don't have any record of that.” -P11 
    * **Old Records:** “How do I get information for something that happened in '75? That's why I've been hesitant to fill this out because it's been so long… The VA has to reach out to the Veterans who were in the military in the 1970s and 80s to convince us that the records can be obtained.... because I personally have no faith... it's hard to prove because it's been so long ago.” -P21

**Finding: Private Medical Record [PMR] collection is burdensome for participants who decide to collect it themselves, which leads to form exits.**

* Two participants were blocked in Step 3 (Supporting Evidence) because they did not have their Private Medical Records ready for upload during the session. 
* Neither Veteran opted to have VA collect the private records on their behalf; one explicitly said they didn’t trust the VA to do it in a timely manner.
     * “We get your medical records for you… [laughs]. Give me a break. They can't even get the dermatologist to call me for an appointment.” -P11
* Participants felt that restrictions on file type and size put the burden on them rather than VA.
    * “Some MRIs are not in those formats [permitted by the form], so that requires doing a conversion or them having to go get it themselves. Yet again, huge distrust factor.” -P11
    * “It's a full medical record, I might break my scanner trying to scan all that in… That's where I'm stuck. It's about a two-and-a-half-inch thick document. I'm going to have to mail that in somehow.” -P3
* Both blocked participants were frustrated to find that they could not continue with the rest of the form and come back later to add evidence. 
    * When P11 attempted to advance without uploading files, he received an error. “[Reads screen] ‘you must upload the file.’ [Laughs] So you blow up the whole process [cannot move forward] if you have to do it later… Any time I've had to do anything on the commercial side it says skip this, continue on. [This form has] no indication of next steps.” -P11
* Veterans who exit the form at Step 3 need to keep track of which conditions they entered to correspond with which records they need to upload. This recall becomes more complex as the number of conditions claimed increases.
    * P21 claimed seven conditions and shared that a condition list and way to plan the next steps would be useful support. 
   * [Can’t see beyond the current screen and asks facilitator] “How much more of the application do I have [left] to do? … I’m writing down now what I need [in order to finish]… Because I’m not uploading my records today, it would be nice if there was a way for us to have a printable list or something of the conditions.” -P21

**Finding: Lay statements add emotional and logistical complexity to the filing process.**

* Participants claiming PTSD were the only ones to mention lay statements, which can sometimes be the only type of evidence available to those with invisible disabilities.
* “The burden is put on the survivor, the claimant... It’s more difficult than showing an X-ray or test to show the damage.” -P18
* "With the specific event, there's no evidence, it's my word against his. I never told anyone because I was so ashamed, I haven't even told my family about it because it bothered me so much … Maybe [VA] could reach out to other women in the field unit to understand what the environment was like.” -P21 on PTSD

**Finding: A majority of participants did not know to prepare their documentation in advance of filing—but wished they would have.** 

* Only two participants (who had filed in the past) predicted that documentation could be a challenge during the filing process. 
     * “Completing the form I think will be relatively common sense and simple…Collecting information required in submitting it I think will take more time…I'll have to go back to doctors in three different states to collect forms and information.” -P6
    * “Some parts easy, some not–documentation (doctor's reports, etc).” -P17
* After our session, participants shared that they would tell others to be ready with medical records, facility addresses, and appointment dates. 
    * “Provide or have access to as much information as to facilities, doctors, addresses as possible before starting.” -P6
    * “Take your time to think about what you want to write down in your explanation, make sure you have all your documents and things to submit.” -P15

**Step 3 Recommendations**

**VA Medical Records**
* Reduce uncertainty by providing examples for what “complete” data fields look like (e.g. Jesse Brown Veteran VA Medical Center, not “Chicago.”)
* Consult VBA partners to determine whether records from Community Providers are VA or PMR.

**Private Medical Records**
* Explore redesign of ancillary form 4142.
* Build transparency.
    * Explain how PMR is collected by the VA– especially for Veterans with older records.
    * Identify how the Claims Processing Tool can help Veterans understand and track documentation collection.  
    * Allow Veterans to continue past required fields (but block them from submitting before the application is complete).
* Reduce abandonment.
    * Provide a printable claimed condition list to Veterans who opt to collect their records. 
    * Explore ways for Veterans with paper records to submit via the mail rather than digital upload. 
    * Plan for form exits by allowing Veterans to download populated PDF forms at any stage in the online process. 

**Lay Statements**
* Review the Lay Statement form in order to assess ways to reduce Veteran burden. 

**Set Veteran Expectations** 
* Help Veterans plan for documentation requirements before filing to reduce form exits. 

### Step 4 Additional Information<a id="finding"></a>

**Finding: All participants questioned why they were asked for their bank account information.**
* Out of three participants, two were already receiving compensation and didn't want to change their direct deposit info, and one had selected the option to decline compensation earlier in the flow. 
* “I don't know why they asked about my bank account information at the end when they already sent money to my bank.” -P12
* “Ok, I don't need to do that. Because I get my deposit, I don't want it going to a different bank. That's why I wouldn't add a new one, because it would go to the same place it's always been going to.” -P15

**Step 4 Recommendations**
* Add content that explains why the sensitive information is being collected and how it will be used.

### Step 5 Review & Submit<a id="Step 5 Review & Submit"></a>

**Finding: A majority of participants who submitted their claim expected to receive a confirmation email with a copy of the claim from VA.**
* When participants did not receive an email immediately from VA, they digitally saved it for their records. 
    * “I would request on this page, where it says your claim was successfully submitted, I would recommend VA send an email with all this information. But I don’t see that on this page and I do not have a printer with me, so what I’ll do is save as PDF.” -P6
   * “Ok, it says my application has been submitted. I was checking my email and I didn't get anything. So I'll take a picture of this page so I can see the claim number … I usually ‘favorite’ it, and check in like a week to see if it's in the system. If I had a printer I'd print it.” -P1

**Step 5 Recommendations**
* Confirm the claim submission quickly and clearly across channels. 
* Provide an opportunity for Veterans to download a full copy of their completed form post-submission.

## Detailed Additional Findings 

### Additional Finding #1<a id="additional finding"></a>

**The participants who submitted their claims did so in under an hour.**
* The participants that did complete the 526 application, below is a table of their expected time to complete the form and the actual time it took to complete the form.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2023-11-Shadowing-Research/Images/Table%201%20Additional%20Findings.png)

* Participant estimates were rarely grounded in an advanced understanding of the form and what it would entail. Estimates were both longer and shorter than the actual completion time. 
    * “[How long will it take] I don't know. My claim that I'm going to file isn't a big one, it's not heavily inundated with information, so it'll probably be quicker than normal I guess?” -P15
    * “I know the estimate was two hours, I estimate about 1.5 hours.” -P6

### Additional Finding #2<a id="adiitional finding"></a>

**Worsening symptoms motivated participants to file for benefits.**
* Participants cited concern for worsening or new conditions as their reason for filing. 
    * “My civilian doctor said my condition has gotten worse. They said it’d be best that I apply.” -P12   
    * “I heard about benefits for women, but I didn't need it then– but then realized I should look into the services.” -P10
* Family, friends, and providers were key in encouraging participants to apply. For one participant, learning about the research study motivated them to file. 
* A couple of participants also reckoned with lasting feelings of not being disabled “enough” to apply. 
    * “I had my [medical condition] before retirement and as I was sitting in [medical center] I noticed a solider without an arm from Iraq.  I said, ‘That’s disabled–I am just inconvenienced,’ and I couldn’t get over that. I couldn’t get over the mental hurdle at the time”. -P3  
    * “I have the mindset that most Veterans have: The money should go towards the new Veterans…Being female, when I got out [in 1976] they interviewed us…To them [my conditions] wasn’t anything.” -P21

### Additional Finding #3<a id="adiitional finding"></a>

**The opportunity to file online is welcome to Veterans with health or privacy concerns.**
* P4 has a hard time leaving their home as a result of medical equipment and mobility issues. Without the online form, filing would be inaccessible.
* A participant experiencing homelessness explained that they preferred the privacy of applying online when filling a claim. 
    *   “Take the time to fill out what you need instead of sitting in front of somebody that may not be comfortable talking about their situation”. P18 
 
### Additional Finding #4<a id="adiitional finding"></a>

**Participants filed using computers rather than mobile devices.**
* The only participant who used a mobile device stated that they thought that it was “pretty cool” that they could use their phone, but thought it would’ve been easier on a laptop. They would have appreciated a bigger keyboard and access to their documentation (which they store on the laptop).  
    * We suspect that medical record type is an important factor in device type. This participant only had VA medical records, which eliminated document upload. 
* Some participants used their mobile phone as a second device throughout the filing process, starting with VA.gov login authentication. They consulted the secondary device to look up information (last appointment dates in their calendar, for example) at the start of Step 3 (Supporting Evidence)

## Next Steps
* Collaborate with OCTO to prioritize future design work for the 526ez
* Connect with other relevant product teams to share findings and recommendations
* Share methodological takeaways from shadowing with the Benefits Portfolio
