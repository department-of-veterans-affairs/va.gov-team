## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. We’re [ROLE] and [ROLE] with VA. Would you like to briefly introduce yourself?

Today we're going to talk about a VA Form that will be used by Veterans claiming PTSD and related mental health conditions that are connected to a traumatic in-service event, including military sexual assault. We’ll be showing you some in-progress designs for this form, which we like to call a prototype. And we’ll ask you questions along the way.

- We’ll ask you questions about your experience filling out a VA form, which could involve sharing some limited details about your own mental health or traumatic experiences. You can decide how much detail you’re comfortable sharing.

- Do you still feel up for this today? We always have the option to reschedule.

[If yes] Great! Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- We scheduled this session for 90 minutes. We may not use the entire time, so you can let us know if you’d like to stop at any point. You’ll still receive full compensation even if we end early. We’ll also have a scheduled break part way through the session.  
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth


- We have two options for today’s session;
  - We can record the audio and video. We would use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your feedback accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - Or we can not record, and we’ll just use our notes to reflect what we learn from you.


- Let me know which choice you feel comfortable with and will move forward with your option. 
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I’ll confirm that you’re okay with me recording this session once more. And you’ll have another opportunity at the end of the session if you’d like to change your mind and delete the recording.


- Do you have any more questions for me before we get started? If not, I am going to move on to the warm-up questions.


*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my [screen and audio or just audio] as we talk today?



## Warm-up Questions - 5 min (start by 0:05)


Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- It looks like you completed a disability claim [online / with a paper form] - is that correct?
  - [If not covered] What conditions did you claim? _[If they miss something that was on the screener]_ I see you claimed _[condition]_. Is this correct?
  - What type of support or resources did you use to complete your claim — or what support do you wish you had?

**[Optional, use your judgment]** Pause and Check-In: Just wanted to check in to see how you're feeling before we move on to the prototype. Do you feel ready to move to the next section? 


## Form Walkthrough - 40 min (start by 0:10)

Next, we are going to look at a prototype of the new form. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

We want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

To give you a heads up… part of the form asks about your condition, the traumatic event you experienced (a one-sentence description of what happened), behavior changes, the treatment you may have received, and any supporting documents you might have. 
  - As we go through, you can use your own personal experience to tell us how you would fill out the form. 
  - Or, if you’re not comfortable sharing your personal experience, you can silently imagine how you might answer questions, and speak generally about how someone might respond.

### **(Staging) Conditions**

I’ll now start sharing my screen so that you can view the prototype we’d like your feedback on. For this task, we are going to pretend that you have already logged into VA.gov, completed some basic questions including your contact information and military service, and are now on Step 2 of the 526 form. As we are looking at this prototype I want you to think out loud about how you would complete this section and what you think this section is about.

**[Screen 1 - select new condition]**

So on some pages we’re going to move through pretty quickly. We’ll show the page, and briefly describe what is on the page. If you have questions, we can pause and discuss, but otherwise we’ll move on to the next page, and spend more time in the areas where we have particular questions for you.

So this will be a section of the form where we move through quickly.

**[Screen 2 - Condition list]**

_[If they’re sharing their personal experience]_ Based on your experience claiming [match to their screener], what would you type in this field? 

Great, thanks for that. I’m also going to ask you to imagine that you’re claiming one other condition that may not be related to your traumatic event. Let’s say hearing loss. So I’ll enter that as well so we can see how the process works.

**[Screen 3 - transition]**

**[Screen 4 - Follow-Up for other conditions (MST, mental health, hearing loss…) **
For hearing loss - just use the example provided: “I operated loud machinery while in the service, and this caused me to lose my hearing.”]

**[Screen 5 - Service connection]** For hearing loss - just use the example provided: “I operated loud machinery while in the service, and this caused me to lose my hearing.”

Now I need to adjust my screen share, bear with me for a moment… 
[Stop sharing, pull up the prototype for next pages]


### (Prototype) 0781 Intro
**[Screen 1 - Provide a statement]**

These next few pages we’re going to take our time, let you read the content, and ask a few questions.
- Help me understand what you're seeing on this page. What do you think this page is for?
- From your perspective, how useful is the content presented on this page?
- Anything you'd expect to see that you're not seeing? What's missing?
- Did the content on this page logically follow the previous one?

**[Screen 2 - transition]**

**[Screen 3 - Get support]**
- From your perspective, how useful is the content presented on this page?
- How prepared do you feel for what’s coming next?

### Event Details

**[Screen 1 - no pause]**

**[Screen 2 - Types of events]**
- What would you select based on your experience?
- Do you understand what these different categories mean?

**[Screen 3 - Y/N no pause]**
- _If they select No, ask why, then select Yes so that we can see how that looks on the next pages_
  
**[Screen 4 - Details]**
- I’ll give you a moment to review this page and think out loud about how you might answer these questions.

_Pause to hear from them before asking following questions_

- Did you have a clear understanding of what information you should provide on this page?
- Were the examples provided helpful in understanding the level of detail required?

_Things to watch for:_

- _Does the Veteran understand the event categories and event types?_
- _Are Veterans able to easily report singular, multiple, and ongoing events?_
- _Are the new examples provided in the form helpful in orienting Veterans to the level of detail required, and lightening the burden of filling out this section?_
- _Overwhelm, too much information on one page?_
- _Transition, do they know when they’re “done” entering an event, and what to expect when they hit continue?_
- _Reactions to example/hint text_



**[Screen 5 - Official Report]**

**[Screen 6 - Official Report Filed]**

**[Screen 7 - Police Report location]**

**[Screen 5 - Summary - no pause]**


**[Offer a break]**  

**We realize that you just answered some hard questions, so it might be a good time to take a break! I’m going to suggest we take a couple minutes to stretch or grab a glass of water. How does that sound?**


### Behavior

So these next few pages we’re going to move through pretty quickly. As a reminder, we’ll show the page, and briefly describe what is on the page. If you have questions, we can pause and discuss, but otherwise, we’ll move on to the next page, and spend more time in the areas where we have particular questions for you.

_[Moderator can check things quickly and enter an example description]_

### Treatment

_[Slow down, ask what they would enter on each page, but no additional questions]_

For the next few pages, I’ll give you time to read through the page, and I’ll ask you to think aloud and share how you would respond to the questions, and what information you would enter.

- What would you enter here?

_Things to watch for:_

_- Do they understand this is just for mental health conditions? Do they enter any info regarding other non-mental health conditions?_

### Supporting Documents

**[Screen 1 Intro]**

**[Screen 2 Checkboxes]**
- Which options would you check?
- Thanks for that feedback. In the interest of time, I’m going to walk us through one example where we just check one option.

**[Screen 3 Upload in list-and-loop]**

_Things to watch for:_

_- Do they read the header and understand that they’re uploading one type of doc at a time? Or do they try to upload everything at once?_

**[Screen 4 Summary]**

### Consent (skip if passed 0:40)

**[Screen 1 Consent]**

### Transition (start by 0:40)

**[Screen 1 Additional info]**

**[Screen 2 Completed - listen for reactions before prompting]**

_Things to watch for:_

_- Transition, do they know when they’re “done,” and what to expect when they hit continue?_

### POW - Condition Summary

**[Screen 1 - POW]**

**[Screen 2 - Additional benefits - answer NO]**

**[Screen 3 - Conditions Summary]**

_If no comments, prompt with questions:_

- Let’s pause here for a minute. Imagine that you had to save your progress and step away. How would you describe what we’ve covered so far, and what might be coming next?

### Step 3 Evidence

For the next few pages, I’ll give you time to read through the page, and I’ll ask you to think aloud and share how you would respond to the questions, and what information you would enter.

_Things to watch for:_
- _Do the new alerts about info they already entered make sense?_
- _Do they find it confusing to have two different sections for uploading documents within the form?_


## Post-Task Questions - 15 min (start by 1:00)

We’re going to wrap up at this step in the process. Thanks for walking through those pages with us! We just have a few final reflection questions.

**Support Messaging** 
- How did you feel about the information that appears in these blue boxes on each page?
- Where in the form did you want support? What type of support would you be looking for at that moment?

**Placement and transitions**
- Were there any points where the transition felt abrupt or disconnected? If so, where?
- Did you understand where to provide information for each of your conditions?
- Did you feel prepared for what to expect as you moved through the pages of the form? 
  - [If yes] What helped you feel prepared?
  - [If no] What were the moments that were unexpected or confusing?
- Were the headings and instructions clear and easy to follow?

**Wrap up**
- Were there any aspects of the process we just went through that stood out as positive or negative?
- If you had a magic wand and could change anything about the process we just went through, what would it be?
- Do you have any questions for me before we end the session?

**[If recorded]** I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable that we recorded today’s conversation. Just to remind you, we use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your feedback accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.


## Thank-You and Closing -5 minutes 

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

**Exit Strategies**

If we need to exit for any reason on our side consider the following exit strategies.  Please do not share personal information as it may create additional stress for all. 

- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
- Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time. 

**Back-up Moderator Plan**

In the event the moderator needs to stop moderating, we’ll have determined a backup moderator for each session from one of the other possible moderators in the session (Nichole Nicholas nichole.nicholas@coforma.io and Julie Pedtke julie.pedtke@coforma.io,). 

- The initial moderator will communicate with the backup moderator via the Feedback-backchannel on Slack that they need to swap roles.
- The initial moderator will communicate with the participant that they’re going to switch with a note-taker and introduce the new moderator.
  - “I’m going to switch out with my note taker, Julie Pedtke, who will be moderating the remainder of this session. I’ll still be on the call, but Julie will be leading. Did you have any questions before we switch out?”
- The initial moderator will assume note-taking responsibilities.
