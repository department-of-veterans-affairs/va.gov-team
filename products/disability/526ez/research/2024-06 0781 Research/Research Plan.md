# Research Plan for Benefits and Claims Disability Experience Team, New VA Form 0781 Concept Testing, June 2024 


## Background
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
     - 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. Not every Veteran will fill out the 0781 when completing their disability claim. However, it is estimated that 23 out of every 100 Veterans have PTSD at some point in their lives. About 1 in 3 women and 1 in 50 men report having experienced sexual harassment or assault while in the military. Plus the inclusion of mental health conditions beyond PTSD means that even more Veterans may opt to fill out the 0781 to support their claim.
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
     - The VA is on track to roll out the new VA Form 21-0781 Statement in Support of Claimed Mental Health Disorder(s) Due to an In-Service Traumatic Event (s) which is a combination of two current VA forms: 
          - Form 0781 Statement in Support of Claim for Services Connected for PTSD, and…
          - VA Form 0781a Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connected for PTSD Secondary to Personal Assault. 
     - Overall, we aim to make the process of claiming PTSD and related conditions faster and less retraumatizing.
     - We’ll be taking a trauma-responsive approach informed by the VA Trauma Community of Practice.
     - While there has been testing on the existing forms, no testing has been conducted on the new 0781 form. During the design of the new 0781, we identified the following high-level issues: flow placement, evidence upload, and event flow. 
          - Flow placement: The new 0781 will be embedded within the larger 526 (as it is today), but we want to improve the transitions in and out of the flow to better prepare Veterans and make it less abrupt. 
          - Evidence upload: There are two evidence upload sections in the 526 form; one to upload evidence for PTSD and other mental health conditions, and another for other (non-PTSD) conditions. We want to ensure that Veterans understand what evidence is being asked for in each section, and that this won’t appear redundant or confusing.  
          - Event flow: We know from past research that some Veterans do not have a single event they want to report, but rather a series of events or a pervasive environment. We want to validate that the form redesign is inclusive of these experiences. 
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
     - The digital 0781 is an ancillary form embedded within the 526EZ form. The form requires the Veteran to be signed in and authenticated. We are not currently working on a stand-alone digital version of the form.

### OCTO Priorities 

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.


### Veteran Journey
- Getting out: Engaging VA to access benefits and services
- Taking care of myself: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
- Putting down roots: Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health
- Putting down roots: Engaging VA to access benefits and services
- Retiring: Finding additional sources of income
- Retiring: Taking care of my health


## Research Goals	
- Goal 1:  Understand if the placement of the new 0781 form within the 526, particularly as it relates to evidence (which also appears in Step 3 for other conditions) aligns with the Veterans’ mental model. 
- Goal 2: Validate that the event entry works for all Veteran experiences: reporting singular events, multiple related events, ongoing events, and so on.
- Goal 3: Understand whether Veterans feel supported and heard through the claim process.

### Outcome
The purpose of concept testing is to allow us to validate key concepts that reflect the “thorniest” design decisions. We plan to use what we learn to make improvements to the form design before release.

We want to understand if the form flow and placement match the mental model of Veterans.  In addition, we want to understand if there are any concerns about understanding the content, resources, and ease of use of the form. 

### Research questions
Goal 1: Understand if the placement of the new 0781 form within the 526, particularly as it relates to evidence (which also appears in Step 3 for other conditions) aligns with the Veterans’ mental model. 
- How well are Veterans able to orient to the ancillary form and understand when they are starting and exiting the 0781? 
          - Does the content on transitional pages into and out of the 0781 flow provide enough context for Veterans when navigating the form?
          - Does the “opt-in” approach work for Veterans with a variety of condition types? Or should we reconsider automatically routing some conditions to the 0781?
- Will Veterans be confused by having two separate evidence upload sections within the form? 
     - Does new messaging in the Step 3 evidence section showing what was already uploaded address this?
- Would Veterans prefer to upload one file at a time, or all documents together on one page? Will they be able to follow the headings that indicate which type they are uploading on each page?

Goal 2: Understand whether the event flow works for all Veteran experiences: reporting singular events, multiple related events, ongoing events, and so on.
- Do Veterans understand which event type(s) to choose based on the content provided? 
- Will Veterans understand how to report singular events, multiple related events, ongoing events, and so on?
- Are the new examples provided in the form helpful in orienting Veterans to the level of detail required, and lightening the burden of filling out this section?
- Will the distinction between conditions and events be understandable, or should we explore adding MST as a condition (in collaboration with the contention classification team)?

Goal 3: Understand whether Veterans feel supported and heard through the claim process.
- Will adding support alerts to every page increase a sense of safety and provide relevant assistance as the Veteran navigates the form? Will they be distracting? 
     - Where in the form process will Veterans look for support messaging?  
     - How can we align the support content with Veteran needs (e.g. desire for anonymity)?
- Are there specific aspects of the claim process where Veterans feel less heard in the process?
- Are the new instructions and examples provided in the form helpful in orienting Veterans to the level of detail required, and lightening the burden of filling out those sections?


### Hypothesis
Goal 1: Understand if the placement of the new 0781 form within the 526, particularly as it relates to evidence (which also appears in Step 3 for other conditions) aligns with the Veterans’ mental model. 
- Veterans will be able to easily orient themselves to start and exit the 0781 with the new content on transitional pages.
- Veterans will be able to understand that there are two evidence upload sections within the form, and correctly identify what should be provided in each. 
     - The new alerts and inclusion of previously uploaded documents will help the Veteran understand why they are asked for evidence twice, and prevent duplicate entries.

Goal 2: Understand whether the event flow works for all Veteran experiences: reporting singular events, multiple related events, ongoing events, and so on.
- In past studies, we have observed confusion about how to report ongoing events. We hypothesize that new instructions and examples will make it more clear to Veterans how they can describe their experience accurately and orient Veterans to the level of detail needed.
- Some Veterans may conflate conditions and events; for example, entering military sexual trauma as a condition. The form will help them understand how VA defines conditions and events, and guide them to enter information needed for a successful outcome. 

Goal 3: Understand whether Veterans feel supported and heard through the claim process.
- New instructions, examples, and support alerts on every page will increase a sense of safety and provide relevant assistance as the Veteran navigates the form. 
- Form updates will help clarify VA’s definitions (for example, that MST is an event rather than a condition) while accounting for the Veteran’s mental model (for example, entering MST as a condition). 


## Methodology	
We will be conducting concept testing on the new VA Form 0781. Concept testing is used to evaluate concepts of new products before they are fully developed and launched; we will test two high-fidelity prototypes of the form, but they will have limited functionality and the Veteran will not be able to enter information directly into fields to complete tasks (as in a usability test).

Prototype A: We plan to walk participants through the 0781 form flow using a Figma prototype starting in Step 2: Conditions ‘New condition’ page and ending at the summary page of Step 3: Supporting Evidence. 

Prototype B: We’ll walk participants through the form starting in Step 2: Conditions ‘New condition’ page and ending at the end of the new Strep 5: Additional Forms section.

For Goal 1, we will ask questions about the form placement, the evidence section, and transitional pages. For Goal 2, we’ll ask questions about the event flow to understand if having the event details, location, and date on the same screen will make it easier for Veterans to report all event types. For Goal 3, we’ll ask questions about the instructions and support messaging.

Moderated interviews will be conducted remotely over Zoom. The discussion guide will include warm-up questions, questions outlined above, and closing questions.

## Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who have previously filed for related conditions (ie. PTSD, and other mental health conditions). This audience will be able to provide us with an informal comparison of the old and new flows and validate challenges based on their first-hand experience.   

Because of the sensitive nature of this study, we are taking a trauma-informed approach and proposing extra steps to prepare participants. Veterans will be sent an introductory email about our study upon signing up and asked if they are still interested in participating in the study. The introductory email will include a brief description of the study along with FAQs. We’ll also emphasize the option to not record the research session if they don’t feel comfortable. 

We will be using Perigian to help us recruit participants for this study. 


### Recruitment criteria
Primary criteria (must-haves): Our target audience for this research is Veterans who: 
- Have filed a claim for disability benefits
- Have claimed PTSD or a related mental health condition
- Have participated in studies with OCTO in the past. EG, not first-time participants.* 
- Must be ready to complete the session on a working computer, tablet, or mobile device with Zoom installed before the session and be able to view screen share content

*Note that we are adding this criteria in an effort to be trauma-informed; because of the sensitive nature of the study, we believe that Veterans who are familiar with OCTO’s process and have participated in studies in the past will be best prepared for what’s involved and less likely to be traumatized.

We are looking to complete 6-8 sessions. Because of the sensitive nature of the study, we anticipate it might be more difficult than usual to recruit and we could see higher than usual no-show rates or need to end sessions early. So we’d like to suggest recruiting 50% more than needed: 16 participants.

Screener Questions
1. Have you ever filed a claim for disability benefits?
     - [Yes/No: Must answer yes. If no, can end screener and not ask them the following questions.]
2. Did you claim any of the following conditions? You can check multiple types.
    - PTSD
    - Military sexual trauma (MST)
    - Other mental health conditions related to a traumatic event, such as depression or anxiety.
    - None of the above

      [Must check at least one of the first three. Recruit at least 2 of each]

3. What type of event(s) contributed to your condition? 
    - Combat
    - Personal trauma, such as robbery
    - Military sexual trauma (MST)
    - Other, such as a natural disaster
    - None of the above or not sure

      [Must check at least one of the first four. Recruit a mix; ensure at least one of each]

4. How recently did you file your claim?
    - Within the last year
    - Over a year ago

      [Within the last year is ideal; secondary criteria so if it’s difficult to reach our goal, can recruit a mix]

We’re asking Veterans to share their experience with us so that we can improve the process of filing claims related to traumatic events. However, we know it can be difficult to talk about these topics. We’ll ask you questions about your experience filling out a VA form, which could involve sharing some limited details about your own mental health or traumatic experiences. Are you comfortable sharing your experience with us? 
- [Yes/no: Must be yes]
