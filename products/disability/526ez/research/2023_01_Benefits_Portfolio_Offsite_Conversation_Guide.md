## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Zach Goldfine and [NOTETAKER NAME] is here with me taking notes. 

Today we would like to talk about your experiences applying for disability compensation benefits. We are interested in finding out about the process you went through, and what the high and low points of that experience were, so that we can find ways to make experiences better for Veterans in the future.
 
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- Your participation is entirely voluntary, and you can stop the session at any time for any reason. Stopping the session will not affect your stipend for participating in this session. 
- Likewise, if there is a particular question you do not wish to answer, just let us know and we will move on.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions, whether you found your experience positive or negative. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback. We’re here to learn from you.
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers to Zoom call.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
(Encourage the participant to have their camera on, but don’t force the issue. For example: “If you are comfortable doing so, we would love to be able to see you while we talk, but if you prefer you can keep your camera off”)
- Is it OK if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
   - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- I see you were in the [Branch of service], is that correct? When did you separate from service? How long were you in service?
- You mentioned to Perigean that you had applied for disability compensation benefits in the past [X months], using va.gov to apply. Is that correct? [if not, find out more and decide if the participant fits well enough in the criteria to continue]. 
- How many different conditions did you claim on this latest application?
- How many of those were new? Were any claims for increase? [explain these terms if needed - new means never claimed before, and claims for increase mean you are already service connected and rated and are asking to have that increased]
- Was that your first time applying for disability compensation? 
   - [If no] 
   - How many claims have you submitted in total? 
   - Was this your first time using va.gov to apply?


## Claims experience - 30 mins
Let’s go ahead and jump in! We’d like for you to describe your most recent experience of applying for benefits on va.gov. 

We can start with what motivated you to start the process, and when that was… [allow participant to walk through the experience on their own terms. Follow up and prompt as needed as they work their way through the experience.]

Prompt as needed: 
- What happened next? 
- How did you do that?
- How did you feel about that?

Listen for:
- What are the major steps or milestones in the process from their perspective?
- What actions did they take? 
- What channels did they use?
- Who or what supported them in their actions or decision making? When did they need that help?
- What kinds of documentation did they need?
- When were they confused, frustrated, or happy, and what other words do they use to describe how they felt along the way?
- Were there points in the process where they hit a wall or thought about giving up?

Follow up if not covered:
- Did you have any VA-required exams as part of this process? If so, how many? If multiple exams, were they scheduled together? What was that experience like?
- Were you treated at a VA facility?
- What was your experience like while waiting for your decision?
- What was the final result?


Topics of interest if there is extra time in this section:
- Delve more into the actual online experience - do they recall any sticking points with the site or application? Was it hard to enter the conditions they were claiming? Did they attach any other documentation at the time of the application? Did they finish it in one go?
- Delve more into the exam experience. For example: What role did the exam play in the process for you? How do you think it factored into your claim?
- Delve more into how they would like to hear of decisions for multiple issues claimed - would they rather hear as they are decided or all at once? What would be good or bad about each way of hearing? What if it is “bad” news (a denial)?
- Delve into decision letters: did they understand the decision that was made as outlined in the letter? What questions did you have that weren’t answered by the letter?

## Reflections on the process - 15 mins
Thank you for sharing your journey with us! Now we would like to ask you a few questions about the experience overall…
- Now that you have gone through this experience, are you glad you did it? Why or why not?
- Were there any high points in the process? If so, what were they? Why were those high points?
- What about low points? What were they? What would have needed to happen to turn that into a high point?
- Were there any points in the process that made you trust the VA more? Less? Tell us about those and why they made you feel that way.
- In what ways did this follow your expectations? In what ways did it not?
- What advice would you give to other Veterans who are embarking on this experience?
- If the VA could change one thing about this process, what would you advise them to do?
- Anything else you want to share that we haven’t covered yet?
- Any questions for me?


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on delivering this service and making sure it really works for Veterans.

Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
