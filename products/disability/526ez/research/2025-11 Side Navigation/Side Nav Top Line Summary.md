This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

#### Finding #1: All participants were able to understand and use both navigation components after interacting with them.

- After testing each navigation component, participants answered scaled questions about how helpful and effective the component was in understanding progress, identifying their current location, and navigating back to edit answers. Responses were rated on a 1–4 scale, where 1 indicated least helpful/effective and 4 indicated very helpful/effective. Across all questions, the Side Navigation received an average score of 3.7 out of 4, while the Process List received an average score of 3.9 out of 4, indicating that participants generally found both components helpful and effective.
- Generally, participants were enthusiastic about the inclusion of a navigation component. They expressed wanting it in the past when they filled out their form, or wanting it in the future. 
> "They're both fours, but as far as [both components], but the second one...does go into further detail and is more accurate....Not more accurate, but it just makes it easier… easier to see where you are.” - P11 (Mobile)

> “When will this be available?” - P5 (Mobile) 

> “Yeah, I wish this was this way when I did mine.” (Referring to the inclusion of the navigation component) - P4 (Desktop)

#### Finding #2: All participants preferred the Process List because it provided more explicit progress indicators.

- While both designs met core navigation needs, participants consistently favored the Process List because the “In Progress” and “Complete” labels (combined with supporting visuals such as the subway map and blue highlight) gave participants greater confidence in their current position in the form, how many steps they had completed, and which step they were currently on.
> “I think it's way better than the other option...I think the biggest thing was letting you know in progress or completed." - P2 (Desktop)

> “I like this one much better...they show where you're at, what progress you're in..." - P5 (Mobile)

#### Finding #3: Most participants primarily relied on text-based cues to interpret progress and status within the navigation.
- Most participants relied heavily on text-based cues such as labels, font weight, and text color to determine which steps were complete, in progress, or unavailable. Additional visual indicators, including the border beside the “in progress” step on the Side Navigation and the subway map circles on the Process List, were mentioned less consistently.
> “Because they're a different color. They're all, you know, black. They haven't turned blue yet. They haven't turned light… I know this… I know I finished this. That's how, you know, I know this is finished, and it's light blue, so I'm… I'm imagining that when I finish each step, it's gonna look like this one here. Light blue.” - P3 (Desktop)

> “I'm working on something, it must be bold. Well, blue. It's not black, yeah...Light blue is finished.” - P5 (Mobile)

#### Finding #4: On mobile, most participants needed to take the additional step of opening the accordion to recall their progress and current location in the form.
- When the navigation component was collapsed into an accordion on mobile, most participants could not determine their current step or overall progress without expanding it, requiring an additional action to understand where they were in the form. The collapsed accordion copy says “Select a step,” which does not convey progress or current location.
> “And I think I'm still in step 1...If I remember the steps, I can't remember the steps!" - P5 (Mobile)

> “And it tells you what the next steps are, and what you'll be doing as a next step. Because without the navigation, you don't know what the next steps are and what [it's] gonna ask you.” - P8 (Mobile)

> “I think I would like to see maybe what step I'm on at the very top, like, up here. You know, it just says review and submit. If that would say, like, 6 out of 6, and when I'm in conditions, it would say 2 out of 6.” - P10 (Mobile)

#### Finding #5: After interacting with the navigation component, all participants understood why inactive steps were unavailable.
- All participants understood that inactive steps could not be selected because they had not yet reached them. Some participants expressed wanting to skip ahead in the form, and at least one participant said it was better that users are not allowed to skip ahead to avoid missing steps.
> “It looks like nothing's happening here...Probably because I haven't entered any information on my conditions, which is tinnitus.” - P4 (Desktop)

> “I like how you can't move forward until you complete what you're on. You can't get ahead of yourself, you can't skip anything. It keeps you… it keeps you in order. You can't rush it, you really can't have any excuse for missing anything, because…If you don't have everything you have, then you can't move forward.” - P11 (Mobile)

> “It's not letting me click on the one that says Step 6. It doesn't allow me to do so.
 Why I think that is, it wants you to fill out these steps, and because you really can't review anything without providing information to the VA...they don't want you to move on to the last step, because…it's kind of like a moot point, because without internal information [there would be no information to review].” - P8 (Mobile)

#### Finding #6: Some participants had difficulty navigating back to edit answers when navigation steps did not clearly map to individual pages.
- Some participants’ ability to navigate back and edit answers was affected by a mismatch between the steps shown in the navigation and the multiple pages contained within each step, making it harder to identify where to return to change specific information.
- Participants relied on recall and trial-and-error navigation, using the “Continue” button to advance through pages in order to find the location where they wanted to edit information.
> “You know, part of me still feels that it should have, like, a subcategory if, for whatever reason, there's more than one page, or more than one step” - P2 (Desktop)

> “I think it'd be quicker, like, if I wanted, like…so if I'm in the review right now, if I wanted to go back and look at that page two of those veterans' details...that I could easily get to it and save a step.” - P2 (Desktop)

> "I would have thought it would… it would have been on the first step...Well, what step am I on, actually? Step 1. Okay, I was still on step one. I was on the first page of step one. It was actually page two of step one that this information was listed." - P8 (Mobile)
