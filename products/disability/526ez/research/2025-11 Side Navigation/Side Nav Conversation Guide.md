# Intro - 5 minutes

Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. My name is [NAME] and I  work on VA.gov. I am part of a team that is trying to improve it so Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible.

I'm going to start by sharing what we hope to do today and providing an overview of how you'll participate. Then we'll do some introductions and then get started with taking a look at the form that we'd like to get your feedback on.

[PAUSE] Does that sound good?

What I hope to do today is get your feedback on a navigation feature on the Disability Benefits form (526EZ form) so we can make it easier to fill out the form.

[PAUSE] Have you filled out this form before?

Ok, great. I want you to know that today, I don’t want to add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits. As a heads up, we may take a look at disability claims experiences that may have caused frustration for you in the past, and I want you to know upfront that I don't have any contact with claims reviewers and I don't have any access to your records. However, I do want to gather your feedback in case there are things we can improve in the future. 

[PAUSE] Do you have any questions so far?

Now we'll talk a little about your participation: 
This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

**If no**: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom. </br>
**If yes**: Admit observers.

     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Also ask the participant to give a brief introduction of themselves. ("Would you mind telling us a bit about yourself and your connection to the VA?")
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
Now, I’ll talk a little bit about what you’ll be testing. We are working to improve the online disability benefits form, specifically how someone might navigate between different sections in the form. We are looking to incorporate your feedback on our work in progress. To do so, we will be asking you to interact with a demo version of the form which is shorter than the regular version, and we’d like to gather your thoughts as you interact with it. We’ll be asking for your feedback on two concepts today. 

Just a heads up that you will be seeing some prefilled data as you interact with our demo. None of the data you see is real veteran data. Also, none of your actions during the demo will affect your VA information or benefits.

[PAUSE] Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
[Record answer here]

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the demo website, we’ll start with a few warm-up questions.
1. [If they indicated that they have filled out the disability benefits form before] Can you tell me a bit more about your experience filling out the disability benefits form?
2. [If they have not filled out the disability benefits form] Can you tell me about the last time you filled out a government form?
3. When you’re filling out a long form or application online, how do you usually keep track of where you are or what’s left to do?
4. What helps you feel confident that you’re making progress when you’re filling out something online?

# Context, Prototype, and Screen Share Set Up - 3 min 
Before we get started, are you using a desktop or mobile device?

[Participant responds]

Great, I am going to send you our link for X device in the chat. 

Side Nav Desktop [Insert Figma Link]
Side Nav Mobile [Insert Figma Link]
Process List Desktop [Insert Figma Link]
Process List Mobile [Insert Figma Link]

I am going to ask you to share your screen. But please feel free to take a minute to hide anything, like your personal email or anything you don’t want us to see. Let me know if you need help. I am more than happy to walk you through the steps you can take to share your screen:

---
**For “mobile“ participants:**
Do you have an iPhone or an Android phone?
- iPhone: [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)
- Android: [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)
  
If they are a “mobile” participant but joined on their desktop (and if asking them to rejoin on their phone is too time-consuming):
Please feel free to access the link on your computer.

**For “desktop” participants:**
On the bottom of your Zoom screen, there should be a “Share” button in the middle (it should be in green). Please click on that.
Please make sure “Desktop” is selected/highlighted.
Please click “Share” again at the bottom.

**For “tablet” participants:**
*We should not have tablet participants, but in the event that we do, we can send the mobile prototype*

Instructions should be similar to “mobile”

If you are on an iPad or Tablet, the button is hidden in the bottom of your screen. Tap anywhere on your screen, a “tool bar” will show up at the bottom of the screen, and the share button should be within the tool bar (you may need to drag the tool bar to the left to see it). 

---

Once you open the link, please share your screen. Please do not click on anything at the moment!

Awesome! Now you have entered our demo page. It is going to look like the VA.gov website that you may be familiar with. I just want to reiterate that this is a demo website and none of the account information is from a real person. 

For the remainder of the session, I’d like you to imagine that you are a veteran named Jordan Jackson. (Just to clarify, Jordan is not a real person, and the demo that you are looking at is not a real application.) 

I will be asking you to fill out a shortened version of the disability benefits form as Jordan Jackson. The form is not real, and you will not need to type in any information. When you click on an area, text will automatically appear in the box. 

During the session, I’ll ask you to go through several screens.

On some pages, I’ll just ask you to click through to get to the next part -  that will be to help us move along.

On other pages, I’ll ask you to complete a task or share your thoughts as you go - that’s where we’ll focus our discussion.

I’ll let you know which is which as we go.

I want to emphasize that you are testing the form, the form is not testing you. So please feel free to give us honest feedback.
