# **Introduction (5 minutes)**

[Moderator Introduction]
Welcome and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today. 

My name is [NAME], I am a Designer and Researcher and will be moderating our session today. XX is joining us as a notetaker today.I am part of a team that focuses on improving the Veteran experience when submitting disability claims on VA.gov.

[Goal]
Today we will be getting your feedback on a new navigation feature for the Disability Benefits form.

[Disclaimer]
If you have filled out this form before or have applied for disability benefits in the past, we may go over parts that have caused frustration. We don’t intend to bring up any challenges you may have experienced with getting benefits.
We also do not contact or work with claims reviewers, and we do not have any access to your personal or medical records. 

[Session Details]
A few things about today’s session: 
This entire session should take about 75 minutes. I want to be sure we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We also welcome any of your feedback, and we won't be offended by any opinions you express.

Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your VA benefits. If you would like to stop the session at any time or do not want to answer a question for any reason, please let me know.
The folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was ok to allow people to observe, but I want to double-check with you before we keep going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?

[If no: Use Slack to ask the observers to leave the Zoom.]
[If yes: Admit observers.]

[Notetaker and observers: camera ON, mic UNMUTED]
I’ll now pass it over to my colleagues briefly introduce themselves.
- [Notetaker] Hi, my name is [NOTETAKER NAME] and I am a [ROLE].
- [Observers] Hi, my name is [OBSERVER NAME] and I am a [ROLE].
- [Notetaker and observers: turn camera OFF, and mic MUTED]
  
If you don’t mind, we would also like to get to know you a little bit. Could you introduce yourself and share your connection to VA?

Before we start, I want to go over what you’ll be testing. We are working to improve the experience of completing the disability benefits form on VA.gov, specifically going back and forth between different sections of the form. We’ll be asking for your feedback on two different concepts. 

You will be interacting with a prototype today. This is a demo version that is shorter than the regular version of the form and may not function exactly as you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.

For some of the areas that are clickable, we have prefilled information so that you do not have to spend time typing answers to certain questions. None of this information is real and therefore your actions during the demo will not affect your VA information or benefits.

[PAUSE] Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

[Screen record consent]
To ensure we have captured your opinions accurately, we would like to record your screen and audio for today’s session. These recordings serve for notetaking purposes only. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

Are you comfortable with us recording your screen and audio for today’s session?
[If yes]
I will start recording now. Once it begins, I am going to ask again if you are okay with us recording this session.
➡️ [Start recording]
Are you comfortable with us recording your screen and audio for today’s session?


Tip: 

After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

# **Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)**

Before we look at the demo website, we’ll start with a few warm-up questions.

*\> \[If they indicated that they have filled out the disability benefits form before\]* 

1. Can you tell me about your experience filling out the disability benefits form?

*\> \[If they have not filled out the disability benefits form\]* 

2. Can you tell me about the last time you filled out a government form?  
3. When you’re filling out a long form or application online, how do you usually keep track of where you are or what’s left to do?  
4. What helps you feel confident that you’re making progress when you’re filling out something online?

# **Share prototype and screen sharing set-up (2 minutes)**

Before we get started, are you using a desktop or mobile device?

\[Participant responds\]

Great, I am going to send you our link for X device in the chat. 

  * [Desktop Prototype - Side Nav](https://www.figma.com/proto/pvrA4dBGYhgiRyI0cxN8vE/526---Side-Navigation?page-id=2601%3A22166&node-id=2601-22168&viewport=2012%2C822%2C0.21&t=gXvnjdX1sVKmHo0j-8&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2601%3A22168&hide-ui=1)
  * [Moble Prototype - Side Nav](https://www.figma.com/proto/pvrA4dBGYhgiRyI0cxN8vE/526---Side-Navigation?page-id=2601%3A22166&node-id=3096-60661&viewport=2012%2C822%2C0.21&t=gXvnjdX1sVKmHo0j-8&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=3096%3A60661&show-proto-sidebar=1&hide-ui=1)

I am going to ask you to share your screen. But please feel free to take a minute to hide anything, like your personal email or anything you don’t want us to see. Let me know if you need help. I am more than happy to walk you through the steps you can take to share your screen:

* For “mobile“ participants:  
  * Do you have an iPhone or an Android phone?  
    * iPhone:  
      * [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)  
    * Android:  
      * [Start screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)  
  * If they are a “mobile” participant but joined on their desktop (and if asking them to rejoin on their phone is too time-consuming):  
    * Please feel free to access the link on your computer.  
* For “desktop” participants:  
  * On the bottom of your Zoom screen, there should be a “Share” button in the middle (it should be in green). Please click on that.  
  * Please make sure “Desktop” is selected/highlighted.  
  * Please click “Share” again at the bottom.  
* For “tablet” participants:  
  * Instructions should be similar to “mobile”  
  * If you are on an iPad or Tablet, the button is hidden in the bottom of your screen. Tap anywhere on your screen, a “tool bar” will show up at the bottom of the screen, and the share button should be within the tool bar (you may need to drag the tool bar to the left to see it). should show up until you hover over them\!

Once you open the link, please share your screen. Please do not click on anything at the moment\!

Awesome\! Now you have entered our demo page. It is going to look like the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) website that you may be familiar with. I just want to reiterate that this is a demo website and none of the account information is from a real person. 

For the remainder of the session, I’d like you to imagine that you are a veteran named Jordan Jackson.  

I will be asking you to fill out a shortened version of the disability benefits form as Jordan Jackson. Just to clarify, Jordan is not a real person, the demo or form that you are looking at is not a real application. When you click on an area, text will automatically appear in the box. 

During the session, I’ll ask you to go through several screens.

On some pages, I’ll just ask you to click through to get to the next part \-  that will be to help us move along.

On other pages, I’ll ask you to complete a task or share your thoughts as you go \- that’s where we’ll focus our discussion.

I’ll let you know which is which as we go.

I want to emphasize that you are testing the form, the form is not testing you. So please feel free to give us honest feedback.

# **Wave Concept: Side Navigation (30 minutes total)**
## Task List (25 minutes)

*Note: The ordering of tasks is slightly different for Mobile since the participant would have to actively open the accordion in order to notice the way that the nagivation menu is laid out, versus just being able to visually see the navigation component right away.*

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks\! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

# **Emergency Exit 🚨**

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.

## Exit Strategy Scripts
Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
