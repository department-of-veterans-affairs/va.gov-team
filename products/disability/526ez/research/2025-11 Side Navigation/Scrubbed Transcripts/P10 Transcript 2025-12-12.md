00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.020
Moderator: Participant 10, is it okay if we record our session today?

4
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.620
Participant 10: Yes.

5
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.610
Moderator: Thank you!

6
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:26.420
Moderator: Alright, so I have some one more questions before I share the prototype link. Can you tell me about your experience filling out the disability benefit form? I know you mentioned that you might not have, or you might not remember, filling out this form in particular, is that correct?

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:46.200
Participant 10: Correct. So, I'm not sure if I've used this specific form, just because it's been a couple of years, but I've filed back in the day when it was just paper version, and you actually have to mail it in, so that was, you know, a couple years ago, and as, you know, certain conditions worsened, or new conditions arose, that's when I went ahead and refiled again.

8
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:55.280
Moderator: Okay, and when was the last time you filed any form at the VA or government form?

9
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.450
Participant 10: I want to say, probably, like, 2-ish years ago, give or take.

10
00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.280
Moderator: Okay.

11
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.830
Moderator: Was it online or paper? This one was online.

12
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.050
Participant 10: Okay.

13
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:15.609
Moderator: Alright, let's think about that one. When you're filling out a long form or application online, how do you usually keep track of where you are and what's left to do?

14
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:37.409
Participant 10: So first and foremost, I don't start it until I know that I have the allotted amount of time to finish it. I don't like to do it halfway, because I think it would be hard to keep track. But from my experience, a lot of the systems keep track for you, but typically it would just be, like, a pen and paper of kind of where I'm at, or what still needs to be completed, just so I know what I have left to do.

15
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.320
Moderator: Got it, so you'll take, like, notes on your behalf to be like, okay, I just completed up to this point, and then you'll continue from there if you need to step away.

16
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.810
Moderator: All right, so what helps you feel confident that you're making progress when you're filling out something online?

17
00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.420
Participant 10: I personally like the little tabs at the top that tell you, like, you're 25% done, you're 30% done, or it tells you, you know, you're on page 1 out of 6.

18
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.470
Moderator: Okay, some sort of indicator telling you, like, a progress of where you are, how many steps you have left.

19
00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.970
Moderator: Awesome! Alright, so, I'm going to be sharing now,

20
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:27.330
Moderator: a link for you, but before I do that, I'm gonna figure out if you can, start, sharing your screen.

21
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.869
Participant 10: Okay, so the email I got said I had to be logged into my phone for this. Is it easier if I do it from my laptop instead, or do you.

22
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:43.600
Moderator: No, no, no, we do, we do. The prototype that I'm going to be sending you is going to be a, a prototype, mobile prototype.

23
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.389
Participant 10: Oh, oh, I see.

24
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.780
Moderator: We want you on your phone, so yeah.

25
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.110
Participant 10: Okay.

26
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:56.680
Moderator: If you… before you start sharing, feel free to, like, close any applications that you may have open, any… any text messages that you don't want us to be seeing,

27
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.520
Moderator: So, but we were just gonna…

28
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.349
Moderator: Want to see your screen as you're interacting with this particular prototype.

29
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.029
Participant 10: Okay, I think I should be good to go now.

30
00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.230
Moderator: Okay, let me… Share the link…

31
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.409
Moderator: Of the prototype, if you can…

32
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.410
Moderator: Open that one for me. You should be seeing a sign-in screen if you do click it open.

33
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.419
Participant 10: Yep, I'm there now.

34
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.329
Moderator: Awesome. Okay, now I want you to share your screen. If you go back to Zoom.

35
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.350
Moderator: You should see a share. You should see audio, video, participants.

36
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.020
Moderator: Chat, react, and then share.

37
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.349
Participant 10: Okay, so the option for share… let's see… share screen, I'm assuming?

38
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.390
Moderator: Yes.

39
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.100
Participant 10: Okay.

40
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.740
Participant 10: Okay.

41
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:03.609
Moderator: Can you see it?

42
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.140
Participant 10: Nope.

43
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.729
Moderator: Yeah, I can see the Zoom, and we can just… perfect, we're back to where we need to be.

44
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:21.150
Moderator: Awesome! Alright, so this is our demo page. It looks similar to VA.gov. I know this is not the sign-in experience, per se.

45
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:32.300
Moderator: But I would like you to imagine that you are a veteran named Jordan Jackson. Like I said, I'm gonna be… you'll… I'm gonna be asking you to fill out this shortened version of this particular application.

46
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:42.220
Moderator: during the session. And, and I'm gonna be asking you, as you're going through it, you know, observe the different pages, and then just…

47
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.529
Moderator: Remember to think out loud, because we want to hear your thoughts as you're thinking and reading through the different pages.

48
00:04:49.630 --> 00:05:09.149
Moderator: And like I said, I might prompt you to do something next, just so that we can, you know, stick with our, time today. And I want to emphasize that we're testing, like I said, the form, not you, and we, appreciate any honest feedback that you can give us. Okay.

49
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:22.309
Moderator: Perfect! So, for the next 15 minutes, we're gonna test this first concept. Let's go ahead and, sign in. You can click submit, and we're gonna…

50
00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.620
Moderator: Pass here, and just… You know, take a look at this whole page.

51
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.749
Moderator: I do have additional questions on this particular page.

52
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.540
Moderator: And as you're looking through this page, what stands out to you first?

53
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:56.770
Participant 10: I like that at the top it says, we'll save every application, or we'll save your application on every change. So that's good to know, and then just reconfirming my information at the bottom, like if I were Jordan Jackson, and where I need to call

54
00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.930
Participant 10: If that information is incorrect.

55
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.069
Moderator: Got it, good to know. If you wanted to move to another part of this application, what would you do?

56
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.720
Participant 10: Click continue.

57
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:19.080
Moderator: Is there anywhere else that you would go to, sort of jump to a different step from here?

58
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.409
Participant 10: Probably the top Select a step.

59
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.640
Moderator: Oh, perfect.

60
00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:34.249
Moderator: So I want you to sort of, like, look through this particular component on the page. What are you thinking here? Is there…

61
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.350
Moderator: Anything that stands out here?

62
00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.240
Participant 10: No, I feel like it's pretty straightforward on what I would need.

63
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.300
Moderator: Okay, what do you notice about how the parts of the form are labeled?

64
00:06:52.500 --> 00:07:06.209
Participant 10: Again, just straightforward, like, it makes me understand, like, what we're going to be kind of submitting in what order, so obviously we're going to discuss my details, the conditions, my statements, supporting evidence, and pretty much, like, last step, just review and submit.

65
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.290
Moderator: Okay.

66
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.000
Participant 10: Nothing really, like, sticks out to me, it's pretty straightforward.

67
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:17.030
Moderator: Alright, sounds good. Alright, let's, go ahead and scroll all the way to the bottom.

68
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.939
Moderator: And click, continue.

69
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:28.639
Moderator: Perfect! Alright, I won't be asking any questions here, so feel free to read through this page.

70
00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.070
Participant 10: Okay.

71
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.729
Moderator: Awesome. Anything that stands out to you here?

72
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:56.099
Participant 10: Nope, pretty straightforward. I like that I have the option to, like, edit my contact information, in case I moved, or changed my phone number, or I want a different email.

73
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.560
Moderator: Okay.

74
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.469
Moderator: Perfect, alright, let's click continue.

75
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.660
Moderator: Awesome, and take a lot, take some time to skim this page.

76
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:24.570
Moderator: I mean, if you can, think out loud as anything that's, like, speaking up for you.

77
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.670
Participant 10: I like the examples of conditions, I think that's super helpful.

78
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.569
Participant 10: Let me see…

79
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:52.579
Participant 10: the… if your conditions aren't listed, just seems kind of repetitive, like, you can claim a condition that isn't listed. I feel like that's kind of a given, right? I think we could kind of forego that and just put, enter your condition, diagnosis, or short description of your symptom.

80
00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:02.430
Moderator: Oh, you're saying that because of what you're seeing there, your condition and are listed, that the examples are repetitive?

81
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:11.680
Participant 10: Well, so it says, if your conditions aren't listed, and then on the bottom it says, you can claim a condition that isn't listed. To me, that just seems like it's a given, you know what I mean?

82
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.489
Moderator: That particular… okay.

83
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.100
Participant 10: Yeah.

84
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.030
Moderator: That particular sentence is repetitive, yeah.

85
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:24.719
Participant 10: Yeah, I just, personally, I like things straightforward and to the point, like, the more repetitive it gets, or the more information, it just becomes confusing.

86
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.789
Moderator: So, I think, like, that doesn't need to be there, but…

87
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:29.070
Moderator: Sure.

88
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:36.989
Participant 10: But the rest, I would say, love the examples, and straightforward, like, enter your condition, and if it doesn't populate, then, you know, pretty much, like, tap it in.

89
00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:38.180
Moderator: Okay.

90
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:45.529
Moderator: Thank you for that feedback. Alright, so I'm gonna have you, enter a condition. It's gonna be tinnitus, so…

91
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.790
Moderator: You can save…

92
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.179
Participant 10: Do I click save?

93
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.060
Moderator: Yeah.

94
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.800
Participant 10: Okay.

95
00:09:53.270 --> 00:10:00.159
Moderator: And then, it should have taken… it should say tonight as there, and then we can click…

96
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.580
Moderator: Continue.

97
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:06.600
Moderator: Perfect.

98
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.159
Moderator: So, in here, go ahead and skim this page.

99
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:16.999
Moderator: And I am gonna have some questions for you in this particular page.

100
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:27.210
Moderator: I wanted to know, what step are you on?

101
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.249
Participant 10: I'm sorry, what was that?

102
00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.690
Moderator: What step are you on?

103
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.710
Participant 10: Pretty much reading what caused the condition.

104
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:45.200
Moderator: Do you know, the sort of steps that you've completed.

105
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:49.539
Moderator: And the particular step that you're on.

106
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.969
Participant 10: Yeah, so would this be, like, what is applicable to me, or if I had any questions about, like, what's listed here?

107
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.590
Moderator: So not…

108
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:12.900
Moderator: Specifically, the content that you're seeing right now, it's sort of like, we want to know, like, if you know where you are within the.

109
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.420
Participant 10: Oh, oh, I see. Okay, I apologize, I didn't understand, the question.

110
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:26.210
Participant 10: Yes, I understand. Pretty much we're trying to figure out what actually caused my condition, and I would have to select one of the three options, and then describe.

111
00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:36.780
Moderator: Alright, do you know how many, sort of, other sections you have left to finish this application?

112
00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:47.189
Participant 10: I think there were a total of 6, so I'd probably need 4 to 5 more sections after choosing, like, all the conditions.

113
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:56.340
Moderator: do you know, like, specifically how many you have left? I mean, you can feel free to, like, scroll up and down and…

114
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.000
Participant 10: Okay.

115
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.979
Participant 10: Oh, oh, I see the question. Okay, yeah, so I would have 4 more.

116
00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.490
Moderator: Okay.

117
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.600
Moderator: And how do you know that you have 4 more to go?

118
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:19.350
Participant 10: I would go up to select a step. I'm currently under conditions, so I know there's obviously a total of 6. If I'm on step 2, then I would need 4 more after this.

119
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:25.490
Moderator: Are there any indicators that tell you, like, where you are? How do you know you're in step 2?

120
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.900
Participant 10: It's listed as Step 2.

121
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.930
Moderator: Okay.

122
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.020
Participant 10: the drop-down.

123
00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.460
Moderator: Okay,

124
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:43.019
Moderator: And let's say that you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit section of this form.

125
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.839
Moderator: How would you go about that?

126
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.539
Participant 10: I would select a step, and then click on…

127
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.089
Participant 10: the corresponding step I need to go to.

128
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:53.300
Participant 10: So, step 6, I would click on.

129
00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.859
Moderator: Okay, let's try doing that.

130
00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.599
Participant 10: Okay, do you want me to click on it then?

131
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.300
Moderator: Yeah.

132
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.230
Participant 10: Okay.

133
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.070
Participant 10: It won't let me.

134
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:13.860
Moderator: what do you think… You can't access that particular step.

135
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:24.790
Participant 10: because I haven't completed the other steps, so I haven't saved my progress from conditions or gone through the other necessary steps to review and submit. So there's really nothing to submit at this point.

136
00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:25.970
Moderator: Okay.

137
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.330
Moderator: And was there anything here that, without clicking, that would tell you

138
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.889
Moderator: Why you can't sort of access that page.

139
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.140
Participant 10: I mean, to me, it's just, like, common sense. If I can't click on something, that's why.

140
00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:41.980
Moderator: Okay.

141
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.910
Participant 10: Okay. Thinking of, like, the older veterans.

142
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.310
Moderator: who, you know, we're talking about, like, Vietnam era that maybe aren't computer savvy.

143
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:56.469
Participant 10: I don't think it would be intuition or common sense for them to assume that's why they can't go forward.

144
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.119
Moderator: Got it, okay That they might need additional.

145
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:09.830
Participant 10: Yeah, like an asterisk or something, maybe at the beginning, saying, like, you must complete all steps before you can move on to review and submit.

146
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:20.670
Moderator: Okay, yeah, so additional information there for them. Sounds good. Alright, let's, scroll to the bottom.

147
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.060
Moderator: And I'm gonna have you select the first option.

148
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.870
Moderator: And, yeah, just superfill everything, and let's click continue.

149
00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:42.209
Moderator: All right, I won't have any questions on this particular page, but feel free to, skim this, sort of, like, scan this page.

150
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:59.010
Moderator: Alright, and… And we are going to… Click no.

151
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.830
Participant 10: Oops. Oh, okay, perfect.

152
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.120
Moderator: It's gonna refill, it's not gonna let you click anything else.

153
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.890
Participant 10: Oh, okay. And then continue?

154
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:05.880
Moderator: Yep.

155
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:18.390
Moderator: And then, we are gonna focus on this page, so I do have some questions here. Talk me through what you're seeing on this page, without clicking on anything.

156
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.120
Participant 10: Can I still scroll?

157
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.080
Moderator: Yeah, you can scroll, yeah.

158
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.650
Participant 10: Okay.

159
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:31.429
Participant 10: So I like The examples of what you can submit for evidence.

160
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.190
Participant 10: I can't really read. It says, records from treatment providers…

161
00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.770
Moderator: I see what you're saying, it's getting cut off, okay.

162
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.840
Participant 10: And then so is lay your witness statements from… I'm assuming this is family.

163
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.559
Moderator: Yes, yes, yes, yeah, I think we… it's a prototype thing that we can fix.

164
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.280
Participant 10: Okay.

165
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.680
Moderator: Alright.

166
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:04.140
Participant 10: I guess a question I would have, if I did have evidence to… Submit, for example.

167
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:07.790
Participant 10: Treatment providers, doctors, reports, stuff like that.

168
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.519
Moderator: I mean, those can be super, super large files, so…

169
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:19.950
Participant 10: if I uploaded would… would a large file be okay if I had, like, 6 different conditions?

170
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.930
Participant 10: I'm presenting, and 6 really large files.

171
00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:32.610
Moderator: What would you like to see, before you're uploading anything, so you are confident that you are uploading the right…

172
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.440
Moderator: File…

173
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:46.860
Participant 10: For me, it wouldn't necessarily be the right file, it would be the capacity, because I've uploaded documents, not necessarily to this, but to VA.gov, and it'll say, like, it has to be, like, a PDF, it can't be a JPEG.

174
00:16:48.200 --> 00:17:03.520
Participant 10: So, which, I don't know if that's there. If I clicked yes, there's, you know, evidence, so I'd like that up front, because if we did have everything, I don't know, some people take pictures of their documents versus a PDF, then I think that'd be a huge problem, because now I have to go scan it, and now I can't finish this in one sitting.

175
00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:21.100
Moderator: Yeah, yes. So, if we do click yes, it's not gonna work in this particular one, so, but we do have the file type, and also the, file size, and I think it will give you an error if you go beyond that.

176
00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:22.059
Participant 10: Okay, gotcha.

177
00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.320
Moderator: For your group, yeah.

178
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:32.030
Moderator: Perfect. So, let's imagine that, You want to… update.

179
00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.169
Moderator: You're… you want to make sure that you have the right email address.

180
00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:42.330
Moderator: Where would you go to update it if you wanted to update it from here?

181
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.049
Participant 10: Go to Step 1, Veteran Details.

182
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:52.100
Moderator: Okay.

183
00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:57.400
Participant 10: Or I guess I could just click back, like, all the way back to… Perfect.

184
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:05.100
Moderator: Yep, that's true, you can do both. Alright, let's go ahead and do the first option. Let's click on Step 1.

185
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.140
Participant 10: I'm sorry, you wanted me to update what?

186
00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.440
Participant 10: Was it the email or the address?

187
00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.269
Moderator: Sorry, the email address, yeah.

188
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.359
Participant 10: Okay, so I would click next. Can I go ahead and click it?

189
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.069
Participant 10: And then I would click Edit up in phone and email. Do you want me to click it?

190
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:38.659
Moderator: Let me see, hold on, let me make sure that we're not skipping any questions that we have here. Let me see…

191
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.330
Moderator: Alright.

192
00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:50.669
Moderator: let's… I think we can… yeah, you were able to draw those completely? Yeah, we can pass here,

193
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.369
Moderator: Actually, let's go ahead and edit your email.

194
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.740
Participant 10: started clicking.

195
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.999
Participant 10: In here, where it says email address.

196
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:02.180
Moderator: Yeah.

197
00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.539
Participant 10: And then once I'm done, I'd click save.

198
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:10.399
Moderator: Yep. You can click on… I think you might be able to click on the email address.

199
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:16.249
Participant 10: Oh, it doesn't let me on the email address. Oh, okay, it probably already changed. You can click save.

200
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:24.990
Moderator: And just double check that that tanked. Awesome. Alright, so we're gonna pause here.

201
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:31.839
Moderator: So I want you to talk me through what you would do if you wanted to return

202
00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:35.710
Moderator: To the previous step you were on.

203
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.579
Participant 10: So I would just scroll to select a step and go back to where I was at.

204
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:46.310
Moderator: And where… without clicking on anything, where… what step was that?

205
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.969
Participant 10: Supporting evidence.

206
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.739
Moderator: What makes you think that you were there?

207
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:56.940
Participant 10: So, like, the different color and font, like, everything's blue.

208
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.759
Participant 10: And the other two steps I haven't been to are in black.

209
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:02.100
Moderator: Okay.

210
00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.120
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, let's click on Supporting Evidence.

211
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:12.699
Moderator: I don't have any questions here, because we've reviewed it before.

212
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.619
Moderator: And we're just gonna select no.

213
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.949
Moderator: And you can continue… I won't have… I don't have any questions in this particular page.

214
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:27.749
Moderator: That we can click.

215
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:33.509
Participant 10: Did you say continue here?

216
00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.349
Moderator: Yeah, you can click continue.

217
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:46.519
Moderator: Perfect. So we… I do have questions on this. Take a minute and talk through what you're seeing, anything that's sticking out for you.

218
00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:07.559
Participant 10: I like that pretty much, like, anything I've answered is kind of broken down here so I can see it, and I also have the option to edit. I don't have to, like, go back to whatever step, like, drop down and go back. I could just click edit.

219
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.290
Moderator: Here.

220
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:24.249
Moderator: Alright, so let's say that you've reviewed everything, which you did, you went all the way to the bottom, and let's say that you wanted to add another condition. Without clicking on anything, like, what would you…

221
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.110
Moderator: What would you do throughout another condition?

222
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:35.850
Participant 10: I would scroll to that portion and click edit, or I could just drop down from the step and go back to the conditions, and then list it there.

223
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.930
Moderator: Okay, yeah, you can… let's try either one.

224
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:40.790
Participant 10: Okay.

225
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.430
Participant 10: Okay, so it doesn't seem by the first option that I can add another condition.

226
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:04.570
Participant 10: just edit what I've already added, so then I would go up here. Can I click it, or no?

227
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.589
Moderator: You can go ahead and click that.

228
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.360
Participant 10: So I'd go drop down here, go to Conditions.

229
00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:13.059
Participant 10: Scroll down, and now I would click Add Another Condition.

230
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:19.199
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, let's go ahead and add another condition. We're gonna add ankle replacement.

231
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.440
Participant 10: And then save.

232
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.050
Moderator: Yeah, we'll do the same thing that we did previously, and you can click continue.

233
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:37.890
Moderator: Alright, so… Let's say that you wanted to… You…

234
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.730
Moderator: To return to the review and submit page.

235
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.480
Moderator: Can you tell me what you would do next?

236
00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.710
Participant 10: I think I would have to fill this out before I went, or else…

237
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.070
Moderator: important.

238
00:22:50.070 --> 00:23:01.029
Participant 10: you know, take it as a new condition, since these options are required, and then I'd drop down here, and then click back to review and submit, or I guess I could click continue all the way through.

239
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:09.750
Moderator: Okay, alright, let's, go ahead and, select the first option.

240
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.690
Moderator: And then…

241
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:21.309
Moderator: navigate to the review and submit page with, like you mentioned, you can open up the, Electa step at the top.

242
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.940
Moderator: Perfect.

243
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:37.470
Moderator: Before you click on anything here, feel free to, like, how confident do you feel about the responses that you edited?

244
00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:50.340
Participant 10: So I noticed, like, with adding that condition, there was no save, there was just continue. So, personally, I would have clicked continue through the whole thing, I wouldn't have gone to the drop-down.

245
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:51.160
Moderator: just to…

246
00:23:51.160 --> 00:24:05.719
Participant 10: make sure, because there was nothing that said, like, okay, it accepted that change, but I guess I could also go here and then click on, you know, conditions to make sure it's in there, but I would have just clicked continue all the way because of no save button or…

247
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:06.760
Moderator: I see.

248
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.549
Participant 10: Acknowledging that it was accepted.

249
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.370
Moderator: Okay, you need an acknowledgement before. Okay, go ahead and expand that condition.

250
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:21.120
Participant 10: Okay.

251
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:23.300
Moderator: How confident do you feel that it was?

252
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:27.820
Participant 10: Yeah, now that I see it here in the, like, review page, then now I'm pretty confident.

253
00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:31.810
Moderator: But I guess not knowing that initially, I wouldn't have gone straight to this point.

254
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:42.720
Moderator: Okay, I see. You wanna… you wanna make sure that everything is safe, so you will click continue. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Alright, let's… I have a few questions,

255
00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:50.210
Moderator: Let's see, like, overall, like, what were your impressions of the… of navigating the form?

256
00:24:51.830 --> 00:25:04.739
Participant 10: I would say pretty simple. I personally don't like that there is a limit on how many… how much you can type in there, because I don't think that things are as straightforward as, like, in 400 characters, explain what happened, right?

257
00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.400
Moderator: Mmm, okay.

258
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.020
Participant 10: I would also like an option of uploading, like.

259
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.300
Participant 10: my own reasoning behind things as well.

260
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:23.480
Participant 10: they can't be included in, you know, the little box where it says 400 characters. So that would be, just thinking back when I filed my case.

261
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:24.950
Participant 10: you know.

262
00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:36.059
Participant 10: I'm just thinking about things like military sexual trauma. Sometimes you can't put that into 400 characters, into what happened to you, you know? So, I think to make a case.

263
00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.549
Participant 10: We would need more than that.

264
00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:42.800
Moderator: Okay, so you're saying you would want… more.

265
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:50.610
Moderator: Expending the character limit for responses, especially when you're uploading, documents and evidence.

266
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:56.500
Participant 10: Yeah, or even an option for, like, a miscellaneous upload, where you can type your own…

267
00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:07.439
Participant 10: whatever, right? Because I saw there was an option for, like, family and friends, to upload, like, their statement, but maybe a state… not necessarily a statement, but, like, a…

268
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.499
Participant 10: a type, a write-up of my own, kind of.

269
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.429
Moderator: Explain the condition.

270
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:15.309
Participant 10: themselves, you know what I mean? If we can't expand the character limit.

271
00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:22.910
Moderator: Got it. Okay, so… let me see if I'm understanding correctly. If you upload something… You would want to…

272
00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.370
Moderator: Type your own, sort of, like.

273
00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:29.710
Moderator: file type, so, like, name. This is the file that I'm…

274
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.870
Moderator: Or, sort of, like, describing the file that you're uploading, or you wanna…

275
00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:38.740
Moderator: Have additional description about the file that you're uploading.

276
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:46.820
Participant 10: The description wouldn't necessarily be a requirement, just, like, a miscellaneous, where you can upload anything outside of, you know.

277
00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:47.500
Moderator: options.

278
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:48.990
Participant 10: of the Yeah.

279
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.669
Moderator: Okay, sounds good.

280
00:26:50.860 --> 00:27:00.569
Moderator: Alright, let's think about, like, how you were navigating from one section to the other, jumping, like, several steps. How was that experience for you?

281
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.889
Participant 10: Pretty simple, I would say. Pretty straightforward.

282
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:12.779
Moderator: Was there anything confusing regarding that sort of navigation, from the beginning of the application versus the end?

283
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:31.099
Participant 10: Mmm, no, not… not really. I think I would like to see maybe what step I'm on at the very top, like, up here. You know, it just says review and submit. If that would say, like, 6 out of 6, and when I'm in conditions, it would say 2 out of 6.

284
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:34.440
Participant 10: around that, I think, would be more beneficial.

285
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.109
Moderator: Right, instead of having you open to.

286
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.900
Participant 10: Yeah, like, drop-down. Which, the drop-down is so great, because I can go back, right? But, like…

287
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.820
Moderator: Right. You don't know.

288
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:49.800
Participant 10: Yeah, I don't know where… I mean, obviously, I'm assuming review and submit's the final step, right? But if it would say 6 out of 6 or something of that nature, it would be helpful.

289
00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:50.800
Moderator: Okay.

290
00:27:51.050 --> 00:28:10.720
Moderator: That sounds good. Alright, so I'm gonna have you, give a rating, for a few of the following questions. On a scale of 1 to 4, 1 being not helpful at all, and 4 being very helpful, how helpful was the navigation menu? You can click and expand it if you want.

291
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.659
Moderator: In completing the form.

292
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.600
Participant 10: Is that this one, the Select a Step?

293
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.210
Moderator: Yeah.

294
00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.660
Participant 10: 4.

295
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:18.870
Moderator: Okay.

296
00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:25.609
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu helping you know which steps you have completed?

297
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.660
Participant 10: Or.

298
00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:34.309
Moderator: Okay, and how effective was the navigation menu helping you know which step you are on?

299
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:39.939
Participant 10: I guess, like, a 3?

300
00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.850
Moderator: At 3. Okay.

301
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:50.169
Moderator: And, how effective was the navigation menu helping you know which steps you need to complete?

302
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.110
Participant 10: 4?

303
00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:04.150
Moderator: Awesome, and how effective was the navigation menu helping you go back and change your answers on the form?

304
00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.000
Participant 10: 3.

305
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:08.900
Moderator: Okay.

306
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:17.810
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, so let's go ahead and… I wonder… I'm seeing my face there, I wonder if we can…

307
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:20.910
Moderator: I don't know if we can minimize it. I know it's

308
00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.989
Moderator: A little bit of your view.

309
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:25.049
Participant 10: No, you're totally fine, don't worry about it.

310
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:27.549
Moderator: Okay, oh, Notetaker, you have your hand up.

311
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:37.380
Notetaker: Yeah, I was just gonna suggest, actually, Participant 10, if you drag, the little, like, Zoom box that's showing up, like, to the right, it'll, like, disappear.

312
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.570
Participant 10: There you go. -Oh!

313
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:38.910
Moderator: Oh, okay.

314
00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.430
Participant 10: Okay, perfect. Thank you for that.

315
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:41.700
Notetaker: No problem.

316
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:50.339
Moderator: Thank you. Alright, alright, so let's go ahead and, submit this form, and we're gonna go to the next concept.

317
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.689
Participant 10: Do I click certify and all that?

318
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.099
Moderator: You can, yes.

319
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:56.550
Participant 10: Okay.

320
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:10.019
Moderator: Alright, so we're gonna start the other prototype. Hopefully it'll be the next 10 minutes we can, do the next one. So go ahead and click on, the link there.

321
00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:23.830
Moderator: Alright, it should look similar to the previous one that we were looking at.

322
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:28.680
Moderator: Okay. Go ahead and, like, scroll through this page, and…

323
00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:33.720
Moderator: Click Continue.

324
00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.680
Moderator: We're gonna do the same thing here.

325
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:51.040
Moderator: Until we get to the condition step. Alright, so in here, I do have some questions.

326
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:58.080
Moderator: Similar to the previous one, if you wanted to move to another part of this form, what would you do?

327
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.729
Participant 10: I would click continue, or drop down here.

328
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:12.459
Moderator: Okay, alright, let's pause here. What are your overall impressions of this particular design versus the other one?

329
00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:17.629
Participant 10: Oh, I like this way better, because it says what I've completed, what's in progress, and it…

330
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:26.279
Participant 10: grayed out the other, steps, which I know means, like, I can't click on them until I've completed the previous steps, so I like this a lot better.

331
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:30.509
Moderator: Alright, and how do you know which step you're on?

332
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.180
Participant 10: It says, in progress.

333
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:33.790
Moderator: Okay.

334
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:41.330
Moderator: And you did mention… I was gonna ask you, like, how many studies do you have left, but it… you did… you do know that the ones that are grayed out is something that,

335
00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:41.880
Participant 10: Yeah.

336
00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:45.350
Moderator: the ones that you need to complete.

337
00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:52.540
Moderator: let's say that you wanted to go ahead and go to, let's say, supporting evidence. How would you do that?

338
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:58.349
Participant 10: I would have to fill, like, all this out, and then just click continue all the way through.

339
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:04.779
Moderator: Okay, how did you know not to… Click on the, link.

340
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:06.840
Participant 10: Because it's grayed out.

341
00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.660
Moderator: Okay.

342
00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:17.160
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, so, let's… Go ahead and, add tinnitus again.

343
00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:20.830
Participant 10: Okay.

344
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.025
Moderator: And…

345
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:28.799
Participant 10: And then continue?

346
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.480
Moderator: Yeah, go ahead and continue.

347
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:42.140
Moderator: And we're gonna select, the thing that we did before. We're gonna select the first option, it should fill out everything.

348
00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:47.140
Moderator: And click continue.

349
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:59.080
Moderator: Alright, we are gonna pause here, and I'm gonna ask you some questions here. What step are you in?

350
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.070
Participant 10: Can I click on it, or… or no?

351
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.240
Moderator: Yep.

352
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.019
Participant 10: So, I'd be on step 3, mental health statement.

353
00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.990
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know what step you're on?

354
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.479
Participant 10: It says, in progress.

355
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:19.689
Moderator: Alright, and what steps have you done?

356
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.750
Participant 10: 1 and 2, because it says complete.

357
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.659
Moderator: Perfect. And, what steps do you still need to do?

358
00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:31.900
Participant 10: 3, because they're grayed out, and I can't click on, or move on to them.

359
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.790
Moderator: Okay.

360
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:46.730
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, let's go ahead and click… let's go ahead and scroll down and continue filling out this form. You should be able to select no…

361
00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:55.140
Moderator: And we're gonna not add any supporting evidence.

362
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.110
Moderator: And… We're just gonna continue.

363
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:18.219
Moderator: And I'll just… ask. You can review, you can open and expand things if you want.

364
00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:25.860
Participant 10: Okay.

365
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:33.130
Moderator: Alright… Let's say that you wanted to,

366
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:41.380
Moderator: I don't know, edit your, email address again from here. Without clicking or anything, what would you do?

367
00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:47.270
Participant 10: I select the step, and go back to Veteran Information.

368
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.040
Moderator: Okay.

369
00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:50.760
Moderator: Perfect.

370
00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:58.890
Moderator: Alright, I think we are done with this particular task. We won't have you… we won't have you do all that again.

371
00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:09.379
Moderator: But I do have some post-task questions. So overall, what were your impressions of this version?

372
00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:15.769
Moderator: In comparison to the previous one. And you can go ahead and expand it, so you can take a look at it.

373
00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:29.309
Participant 10: Yeah, I just liked it a lot better. It's a lot more concise. The other one, it was just, like, black and blue, so, like, if you're not really paying attention to it, you can't tell that you can't click into them, but these are actually grayed out, they're, you know, they have a…

374
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:38.540
Participant 10: they're, like, blue versus, you know, the black worm, and now it says in progress, complete. So, to me, it's just a lot more straightforward and clear.

375
00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:40.130
Moderator: Okay.

376
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.700
Moderator: Was there anything confusing or unexpected about how it worked?

377
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:46.590
Participant 10: No.

378
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:52.199
Moderator: Alright, and then is there anything that you would change or add?

379
00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:57.640
Moderator: I know you had… I know I had asked you at the beginning of the session, like, the different

380
00:35:57.810 --> 00:36:00.979
Moderator: Forms that you've used, to…

381
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:06.930
Moderator: to fill out online. Is there anything that you would add or change?

382
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:15.100
Participant 10: I would love to add a save button, especially, like, when you're adding conditions, because continue just means you're continuing on. To me, it doesn't imply saved.

383
00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:31.659
Participant 10: But I would also love when I'm about to review, or when I'm reviewing down here, I think where it was talking, yeah, about your, like, additional information, pay information. There should be something that says, like, what the current wait time is right now.

384
00:36:31.660 --> 00:36:35.669
Participant 10: for… reviewing a claim.

385
00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:41.210
Moderator: Are you thinking about… After you submit it.

386
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.649
Participant 10: Yeah, so, like, after I submit it,

387
00:36:44.040 --> 00:37:03.369
Participant 10: you know, like, typically, back in the day, at least when I did it, you'd have to, like, call or, like, online, and be like, right now, it was, like, a 12-month wait before it can even get reviewed. Obviously, times change, or it could take longer or less, but something along those lines, I think, would be helpful, because this gives me no indication on what the current wait time is to have your case reviewed.

388
00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:17.029
Moderator: Okay, so it seems like you would want an estimate as to, like, when… Yeah. …someone would… like, how long it would take for… for… for VA to review your… your application. Exactly. Okay.

389
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:20.490
Moderator: That's good to know.

390
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.930
Moderator: Awesome. Anything else that you would change or add, specifically to how you would

391
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:30.790
Moderator: Navigating and jumping around the form.

392
00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:34.180
Participant 10: Nope, not really.

393
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:44.910
Moderator: Okay, all right, so I'm gonna have the same reading questions. On a scale of 1 to 4, how helpful was the navigation menu in helping you complete, the task?

394
00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:45.880
Participant 10: Or.

395
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.840
Moderator: Perfect. How effective was the navigation menu helping you know which steps you have completed?

396
00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:53.270
Participant 10: Fourth.

397
00:37:54.360 --> 00:38:01.320
Moderator: And then how effective was the navigation menu, helping you know which steps you are on? 4.

398
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:07.409
Moderator: And how effective was the navigation manual helping you know which steps you still need to complete?

399
00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.550
Participant 10: 4.

400
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:18.439
Moderator: Oh, I think the last one we don't need to choose, because you didn't go back and navigate and change your answers. Awesome. Alright, so I think…

401
00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.300
Moderator: This is all we have. I'm gonna open…

402
00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:29.750
Moderator: And see if anyone has any additional questions, Notetaker, Observer 2, or Observer 1.

403
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:33.239
Moderator: Young gum.

404
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:39.280
Notetaker: Yeah, hi again. Turn on my camera so I don't seem like I'm just a random

405
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:52.229
Notetaker: in the ether. Thank you again for going through that. This is extremely helpful. I'm kind of curious, at the very beginning, when we kind of started the entire session.

406
00:38:52.230 --> 00:39:02.799
Notetaker: you had kind of noticed that, like, select a step, pretty early on. Does anything around, like, the words select a step.

407
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:12.149
Notetaker: Are those helpful? Is there anything else that you think would be needed to kind of let you know that the select a step is kind of an option that you can use?

408
00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:29.710
Participant 10: That's a really good question. I honestly feel like what would be super helpful, and I don't really know how to articulate this, so please bear with me. Like, sometimes when you go on websites, right, it freezes the select a step even when you're scrolling, so if that portion were still while I'm scrolling.

409
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:30.470
Moderator: I…

410
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:31.429
Participant 10: I think that would…

411
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:39.420
Participant 10: indicate, like, hey, you can click on here at any point, versus it just kind of disappears, and I'm trying to submit a million different things below.

412
00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.339
Participant 10: Alright, so if it sort of, like, stayed there.

413
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:43.410
Moderator: us.

414
00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.360
Moderator: Sort of, like, stuck at the top of your…

415
00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.780
Participant 10: Yeah, I'm like, I don't know how to put it in better wording, but yeah.

416
00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.700
Moderator: Yeah, that's fine.

417
00:39:53.290 --> 00:40:03.380
Notetaker: Perfect. Yeah, no, that's a great point, because, yeah, like, freezing is definitely something that is done on a couple of, like, other websites as well.

418
00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:10.990
Notetaker: I think another follow-up question, that I had was for the

419
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:28.119
Notetaker: treatment of especially this option, if you open it, like, the… was there anything in particular? You mentioned kind of the blue and black text, is there anything else that helps you kind of know what step you're on, what steps you have completed, besides the blue or black?

420
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.210
Participant 10: Is… are we talking about the one we're on right now, or the first one?

421
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:33.380
Notetaker: For this one, yes.

422
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:47.809
Participant 10: I mean, like, in progress is kind of bolded, so the bold really makes a difference. And I think, especially, it's very overwhelming to file a case or a claim because you have so much information, so I think the more…

423
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:55.850
Participant 10: you know, Barney-style broken down it is, the easier. So, like, the bold, the capital letters, like, that does make a difference.

424
00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.600
Notetaker: Perfect.

425
00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:01.819
Notetaker: Alright, I think those are all the questions I have.

426
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:02.950
Participant 10: Awesome.

427
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:07.970
Moderator: Thank you, Notetaker. Observer 2 or Observer 1, do you have any questions?

428
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:16.189
Observer 1: Sure, just… a quick one, and I will also go…

429
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:21.190
Observer 1: off-camera, so I'm not just a disembodied voice.

430
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:40.860
Observer 1: Were there… in terms of the words on the screen that you read that were guiding you through the process, was there anything in particular that was a real sticking point for you that was very unclear, or kind of threw you off, or just didn't lead to what you were expecting it to based on what you were reading?

431
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:46.600
Participant 10: Not necessarily. I feel everything was pretty straightforward. I will say, I don't know if that's because I've…

432
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:57.750
Participant 10: filed multiple claims throughout the years, and it's just, like, the experience, right? But I feel like this is very clear-cut, very forward, it's not wordy, you know, it literally tells you, like, click.

433
00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:07.569
Participant 10: type in, if it's not in there, like, still type it in, put a description. So, nothing like that really caught my eye that I was like, oh, I think this… this is something I'd get… I'd get stuck on.

434
00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.589
Observer 1: Okay, great, thank you so much.

435
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.150
Participant 10: Sure.

436
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:21.730
Moderator: Perfect, and I think that's it for our questions, unless at least you have any .

437
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.779
Observer 2: Nope, everything sounds good to me. Thank you.

438
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:39.449
Moderator: All right. Before we finish, I'd like to confirm that you're okay with us, having recorded to this conversation. We also really appreciate you taking time to share your thoughts with us today. And,

439
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:47.890
Moderator: Yeah, and your feedback was very helpful, as we are, you know, enhancing all of the different forms that we work with at VA.

440
00:42:47.890 --> 00:43:00.969
Moderator: Lastly, Paragian will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along other veterans, in case other ones… other veterans want to have, sort of, participate in this sort of session that you've participated today.

441
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:02.710

442
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:07.690
Moderator: And thank you guys so much for all your feedback, and enjoy the rest of your day!

443

444

445
