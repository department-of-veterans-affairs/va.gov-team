00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.499
Moderator: All right, are you comfortable with us recording your screen and audio for today's session, Participant 8?

2
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.670
Participant 8: Yes, you guys can record the session.

3
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.160
Moderator: Awesome.

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:22.749
Moderator: All right, so we'll start with some warm-up questions here. You… you shared earlier that you filled out the disability benefits form online before. Can you tell us a little bit about that experience?

5
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.579
Participant 8: Generally, it's pretty, straightforward.

6
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.859
Participant 8: You mean the… you know, you mean the benefits, claim form, or…

7
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.460
Moderator: Yep.

8
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:53.789
Participant 8: Yeah, it shows you if you want to apply online, or you want to fill out the form and mail it, so I believe, if I'm not mistaken, it gives you, like, step 1, 2, and 3, and then on number 5, it says, click here to apply online.

9
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.369
Participant 8: And that's how I remember.

10
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.550
Moderator: Okay, awesome.

11
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:12.460
Moderator: And when you're filling out a long form, like the disability benefits form, or any other, like, long application online, how do you usually keep track of where you are in the form and what's left to do?

12
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:24.979
Participant 8: Oh, I now… this refreshes my memory. When I… whenever I fill out these VA forms, I do remember the first thing I ask you is your name, your social security number, address.

13
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:37.139
Participant 8: any other relevant information? I believe it saves the form. If you want to come back to it, it will bring you back to the same place. So…

14
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.409
Participant 8: I don't recall if I didn't finish the whole session in one shot or not.

15
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:52.109
Participant 8: And though it says it saves it for you, if I want to continue the form, I would know how to,

16
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.639
Participant 8: How to go back to that form.

17
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.959
Participant 8: If I remember correctly.

18
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.099
Moderator: So, just to clarify, so you said you would… you would know how to go back to the form if it saves it for you, or no?

19
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.020
Participant 8: No, I don't… I know there's a little,

20
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.109
Participant 8: snippet about, oh, your form is saved to a reference number.

21
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.020
Moderator: On the bottom, but…

22
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.169
Participant 8: I, I don't recall…

23
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.229
Participant 8: I don't… I have… I don't… I haven't really gone back to the form and continued a form. I normally do it one shot, basically.

24
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:36.959
Moderator: Okay, okay, awesome. And when you are filling out a form like this, what helps you feel confident that you're making progress on the form?

25
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.060
Participant 8: Well, it goes to the next field, you know?

26
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.440
Participant 8: So, you know, when you fill out your name, social security address, and

27
00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:00.770
Participant 8: you know, dependent information, it goes to the next page, so… and then what makes… you asked me what makes me confident it's going through? On the bottom of it, every time I…

28
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.290
Participant 8: every information I fill out, on the bottom, it says, oh, your information is being saved.

29
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.579
Participant 8: And you can come back to continue with that process at a later date.

30
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.880
Moderator: Awesome.

31
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.990
Moderator: Awesome, thanks for sharing that.

32
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.290
Moderator: Okay.

33
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:26.820
Moderator: Alright, so now we're going to go ahead and move into our demo. I am going to share a link with you in the chat.

34
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.350
Moderator: Just give me one second here…

35
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.190
Moderator: Okay, you can go ahead and, tap on that link?

36
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.350
Participant 8: You want me to share the screen with you?

37
00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:01.939
Moderator: Yes, I do. When you're ready to go ahead and do that, go ahead and do that, and don't click on anything on the screen yet. And if you need help, sharing your screen,

38
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:11.540
Participant 8: Okay. I clicked the links, it gave me the page that you… that has a demo page. I gotta come back to, to the Zoom session, right?

39
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:22.330
Participant 8: If I hit X, I had… On the bottom, share… Yup, share it to me.

40
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.760
Moderator: Right,

41
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.809
Participant 8: start broadcast… Let's see if you see my screen. I believe you might.

42
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.769
Moderator: Awesome. Okay, so I see the Zoom. Yeah, if you swipe to the right, perfect, I see it right there. Awesome. You got it.

43
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.690
Participant 8: Want me to close out this so you can see better? Okay, how's that?

44
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.929
Moderator: Perfect. That's perfect. Thank you.

45
00:04:43.050 --> 00:05:02.449
Moderator: Awesome. Okay, so I'm going to give you some information about what you're looking at here. Alright, so you've entered our demo page. It's going to look like the VA.gov website that you're familiar with. I just want to reiterate, this is a demo site, and none of the account information is of a real person.

46
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.270
Participant 8: Okay.

47
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.600
Moderator: For the remainder of the session, I'd like you to imagine that you're a veteran named Jordan Jackson.

48
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.440
Participant 8: Yes.

49
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:21.560
Moderator: I'm going to be asking you to fill out a shortened version of the form. Jordan is not a real person, and the demo or form that you're looking at is not a real application, okay?

50
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.030
Participant 8: Understand, understand.

51
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:35.299
Moderator: Alright, so, another thing to note is that when you click on an area, text, will automatically appear in a box, so, you won't have to be actually typing anything in.

52
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.580
Participant 8: Okay, is it clickable, or is it something I tell you I'm gonna click? Probably… it might be clickable, right?

53
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.099
Moderator: It is clickable, but I will ask you to tell me where you're gonna click before you click on it.

54
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.399
Participant 8: I understand, understand your structures.

55
00:05:50.560 --> 00:06:07.860
Moderator: Awesome. Okay, so on some of these pages, I'll ask you to click through to get you to the next part, just to kind of, like, move us along, and then on some other pages, I'm going to ask you to complete a task, or to answer some questions, or to talk me through what you're thinking, okay?

56
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:08.770
Participant 8: No problem.

57
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:17.560
Moderator: Alright, I just want to emphasize that you are the one testing the form, the form is not testing you, so please feel free to give us honest feedback.

58
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:38.749
Moderator: Okay, we're gonna go ahead and get started. So, this is the sign-in screen to help you imagine that you're logging in to start the Disability Benefits Forum as Jordan Jackson. And we're mostly going to be trying to understand how you navigate through the form, okay?

59
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.360
Participant 8: Yes.

60
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.630
Moderator: Alright, so go ahead and tap submit there.

61
00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.500
Participant 8: It doesn't do anything. Oh, it did. Nevermind.

62
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.020
Moderator: Okay.

63
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.259
Moderator: Yeah, there might be a little bit of a lag, since it's, like, not quite a real website.

64
00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:02.009
Moderator: Okay, so… Okay, we're gonna focus on this page, so go ahead and…

65
00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.649
Moderator: Read this page, and let me know what you're thinking and seeing as you… as you take a look at this page.

66
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.249
Participant 8: Okay, like I said, things are familiar. I'll file a disability claim, compensation. It asks for names and dates of birth.

67
00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:31.269
Participant 8: Then, of course, this is the first page of the application process. It's, like I said, you could continue. On the bottom, it did say your reference ID… your request ID number. So, it's saved. As I mentioned before.

68
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:38.790
Participant 8: It's safe, but if I want to continue my application, if I did so.

69
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:45.130
Participant 8: There's no way I could click it and continue that I'm aware of, but they give you an ID number, so…

70
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.390
Participant 8: Well, I don't know what that purpose would be.

71
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.450
Participant 8: So, I've seen this before.

72
00:07:49.770 --> 00:08:02.319
Moderator: Okay, okay, that's a good question about the purpose of the ID number. Okay, so I have some questions for you here. So, if you wanted to move to another part of the application, what would you do? And just talk me through, like, what you would do.

73
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.860
Participant 8: Oh, well, I mean, the name and the dates of birth are already here, so if I'm going to continue with the application, I simply click continue.

74
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:17.219
Moderator: Okay. So… Let's go ahead and do that. Go ahead and click continue.

75
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.739
Participant 8: Yes, I see the next page, it has phone numbers, email addresses, home addresses.

76
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.569
Participant 8: That's all there already, so…

77
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.799
Participant 8: Pretty straightforward.

78
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.949
Moderator: Alright, go ahead and click continue.

79
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.000
Participant 8: Okay.

80
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:37.059
Moderator: Alright.

81
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.719
Moderator: Tell me what you're seeing and thinking here.

82
00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:41.299
Participant 8: Oh,

83
00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:50.159
Participant 8: Yeah, from this point on, you want to click on the type of conditions you want to, to add, you know, you could type in

84
00:08:50.569 --> 00:08:54.819
Participant 8: like, your condition. Sometimes it populates some…

85
00:08:55.829 --> 00:09:04.649
Participant 8: familiar terms, like, you know, obviously the hypertension and the hearing loss, those would probably come up. But unless you had a…

86
00:09:05.259 --> 00:09:13.829
Participant 8: a health condition that's not, you know, popping up, then it might give you a little… might give you some errors. I haven't encountered that before.

87
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.020
Moderator: Okay.

88
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:26.359
Moderator: Alright, so on this screen, you're going to go ahead and enter the condition tinnitus, so go ahead and tap, yep, you got it, and go ahead and tap save.

89
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.660
Participant 8: Yes.

90
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.730
Moderator: Okay, so we're gonna pause here for a second.

91
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.010
Moderator: Or actually, go ahead and tap continue at the bottom.

92
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:51.209
Moderator: All right, we're gonna pause here for a second on this page before, you continue, answering these questions. So, Participant 8, I'd like to know, what step are you on here in the form?

93
00:09:51.500 --> 00:10:01.259
Participant 8: What step? We're on the part where you tell the VA your condition you're trying to, claim disability for.

94
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.000
Participant 8: Though I don't… I don't… I'm not sure what you mean by what step, or just…

95
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:12.620
Participant 8: We're in the beginning, steps of telling the VA what condition you're, reporting.

96
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:30.530
Moderator: Okay, that's fair. Alright, and let's say you wanted to, like, skip to another section of the form. What might you do? Don't… don't click on anything yet, but what might you do if you… you want… let's say you wanted to skip conditions, like, you don't want to answer these questions. What would you do here?

97
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:38.080
Participant 8: Well, it says required, if you didn't click on any of those three options, and you didn't answer these questions.

98
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:44.579
Participant 8: of… I'm actually not very clear on this. I could click on finish this application later.

99
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.620
Participant 8: And I don't know if I can move on to the next step, I don't see that.

100
00:10:49.000 --> 00:11:06.960
Participant 8: Not to my knowledge, I haven't… I haven't encountered something. I believe, from my experience, you have to, enter something. And if you enter something, you might be… you can move on to the next section, and you may be able to, go back and change your answers to different sections.

101
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:18.659
Moderator: Okay, that's totally fair. Alright, I'm gonna… I'm gonna direct your attention to something that we're trying out here for the first time. So go ahead and scroll back up on the screen.

102
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.250
Moderator: Alright.

103
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:29.750
Moderator: So from this view, tell me if there's anything on this view that, you think might let you, skip to a different part of the form.

104
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:38.110
Participant 8: Well, I haven't seen this before, I don't remember seeing this selected step, but if I'm not mistaken, this seemed to be new.

105
00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.220
Moderator: Okay, yes, Alright, and yeah, let's go ahead and keep that open.

106
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.099
Participant 8: I'm sorry?

107
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.220
Moderator: You can keep it open, so if you…

108
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.500
Participant 8: Watch it again? No problem. Okay.

109
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:54.549
Moderator: Alright, so now that you've discovered this, what step are you on?

110
00:11:54.950 --> 00:12:01.770
Participant 8: I'm on step 2. I don't think it shows what step I'm on, without this, option.

111
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:05.710
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know that you're on Step 2?

112
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.920
Participant 8: Well, you hit the… select a step, and it shows you the 6 steps you must complete to submit the application.

113
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:20.769
Moderator: Okay, and tell me a little bit more about, the word step. Like, what does that let you know about the form?

114
00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.639
Participant 8: That lets me know how many different

115
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:32.379
Participant 8: forms I have… how many different steps I have to do, which, without… without that, I wouldn't know.

116
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:38.499
Moderator: Okay. And, what steps have you already finished?

117
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:40.810
Participant 8: 1 and 2.

118
00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.219
Moderator: 1 and 2? Okay. And how many steps do you still need to do?

119
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.249
Participant 8: Four more steps.

120
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.910
Moderator: Alright, how do you know that?

121
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.809
Participant 8: Because, the ones that are done are in blue.

122
00:12:53.920 --> 00:13:01.789
Participant 8: The one that I'm on is, it's in, bold blue, and the ones that haven't been touched are in black.

123
00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.749
Participant 8: And not both. Well, yeah.

124
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:11.970
Moderator: Awesome. Okay, and let's say you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page.

125
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:12.370
Participant 8: Yes.

126
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:12.900
Moderator: that.

127
00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:18.540
Participant 8: I believe I just hit, number 6th step, and… I would hit 6,

128
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.989
Participant 8: And, it would… it would just go to that step, I believe.

129
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:25.340
Moderator: Okay, let's go ahead and try that out.

130
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:31.110
Participant 8: It's not letting me click on the one that says Step 6. It doesn't allow me to do so.

131
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.340
Moderator: Okay. And why do you think that is?

132
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:39.840
Participant 8: Why I think that is, it wants you to fill out these,

133
00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:49.930
Participant 8: steps, and because you really can't review anything without providing information to the VA, Are you…

134
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.340
Participant 8: They don't want you to move on to the last step, because…

135
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.859
Participant 8: It's kind of like a moot point, because without internal information.

136
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:05.670
Participant 8: Why… why would you want to go to the last step? Yeah, I just… I don't see,

137
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:11.230
Participant 8: I don't see the benefit of doing something like that, but… but at least I know what step I'm on right now.

00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:01.979
Participant 8: Okay, you want me to read this, this information? You want to ask me certain information, is that correct?

147
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:08.130
Moderator: I'm not gonna ask you anything about it, I just want you to be able to read it enough to just know what this page is about.

148
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.629
Participant 8: Okay, we're…

149
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.899
Participant 8: Okay, I understand what it's telling me.

151
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:40.150
Moderator: All right, so for this page, we are gonna focus on this page. So, go ahead and just talk me through what you're seeing here. What's this page about?

152
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:50.310
Participant 8: Well, in order the VA to decide, you know, if you have a condition, they need to,

153
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:57.789
Participant 8: Tests with a medical professional So you go to get tested, and make sure

154
00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.310
Participant 8: The information you provide is correct.

155
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:13.960
Participant 8: So, if you have any other, like, medical records, that the VA doesn't have already, you can, add that, those documentation,

156
00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:20.499
Participant 8: Here, and I believe you could even, upload medical documentation from this point on.

157
00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:36.189
Moderator: Yeah, awesome. Okay, so imagine you got to this page on the form, and you realized that you might have entered in an old email address, and you wanted to double-check it so that you could update it if that's the case. What would you do from here?

158
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:41.160
Participant 8: You, you said update my, my email address or my physical address?

159
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.919
Moderator: your email address, like, on this form. So, like, imagine you had entered in a wrong email address.

160
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.970
Participant 8: Oh, okay, I got you. Okay, okay.

161
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:49.310
Participant 8: Yeah, because…

162
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:55.940
Participant 8: Like I said, I believe this is new, as a prototype. We didn't have this before, where you had steps.

163
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:04.300
Participant 8: Simply, if I went to step, I could go to Veteran Detail, and it goes back to your, whatever you enter.

164
00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:09.209
Participant 8: I don't see an option for edit here.

165
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.180
Moderator: Did you say address?

166
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.020
Participant 8: Okay, hold on.

Moderator: Just pause here.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:19.829
Participant 8: I would have thought it would… it would have been on the first step.

Participant 8: address,

172
00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:29.609

173
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:44.680
Moderator: Okay, don't, don't tap on that. Okay, let's just focus on this page. So, you're looking for your email address. What's another way that you might be able to find your email address?

174
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:49.519
Participant 8: Oh, okay, well, so, like I said, a menu with a hamburger, option.

Moderator: And tap the continue button.

178
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:21.719
Participant 8: Well, one step on my arm, actually? Step 1. Okay, I was still on step one. I was on the first page of step one. It was actually page two of step one that this information was listed.

179
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:29.219
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Awesome. So yeah, so now how would you go about, editing your email here?

Moderator: Awesome. Alright, we're gonna pause here for a second.

190
00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:18.379
Moderator: Okay, so now you… you thought about editing your email address, you went back, you edited it, and now let's say you wanted to return to the part of the form that you were previously on. What would you do now?

191
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:24.650
Participant 8: The part of the form I was on was probably step two. Scroll back up, where's the selected step?

192
00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:32.279
Participant 8: Go back to conditions. Actually, it's… it shows I was on step 4, so I hit Supporting Evidence.

194
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:37.669

Moderator: I'm just referencing my notes here.

196
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:51.360
Moderator: Okay, so when you tap supporting evidence, what let you know that, supporting evidence was available?

197
00:19:53.380 --> 00:20:01.390
Participant 8: let me know that supporting evidence was available. I'm not exactly sure what your question is referencing.

198
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:11.530
Moderator: Sure, go ahead and open the Select a Step, menu there. Yes. Yeah, so… so you knew that you were going to go back to supporting evidence when you opened it? How did you know that?

199
00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:22.920
Participant 8: Oh, okay, that was in blue, but… but it wasn't in bold blue, but it was in blue. Blue means that you're already on it or completing it. That's… that's the last thing that you use.

200
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.579
Moderator: Okay. Awesome.

207
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.190
Participant 8: Oh, shit.

208
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.250
Moderator: Alright, so we're gonna pause here for a second.

209
00:20:53.880 --> 00:21:02.150

Participant 8: whether it be, adding form, you click on edit if you want to change… make a change to that information, supporting evidence, if you want to change it, click edit.

216
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:40.840
Participant 8: And additional information you could change. That's your, payment account. If no further information, you type in your

217
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.190

Moderator: Okay, don't submit yet. Don't tap on anything just yet. All right, so awesome. I'm glad that you were able to, see all the information that you can edit there. So, let's say you wanted to add another condition in addition to tinnitus. Talk me through how you would do that.

219
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:07.840
Participant 8: Oh… Whoa… I don't believe… I guess I would hit tinnitus and click on edit.

220
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.599
Moderator: Okay, let's try that.

221
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:20.940
Participant 8: Update page. No, it only allows you to update that one condition, I don't see…

222
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:28.570
Participant 8: An option to add From my understanding, it's… you have to only submit each condition individually.

223
00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.349
Participant 8: Whether that's true or not, I don't recall.

224
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:38.860
Moderator: Okay, alright. Is there another way that you imagine you might be able to add a new condition? .

225
00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.839
Participant 8: Maybe hit… well, wasn't I on…

226
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.360
Participant 8: Was it on conditions already? Let me see.

227

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.219
Participant 8: Mike, I don't… I don't see an option where it says add additional condition.

233
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:17.769
Participant 8: Oh, wait a minute, adding VA form to support new mental health condition. Well, that's a mental health, no, that's not it, never mind.

234
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:27.459
Moderator: Sure. Yeah. So, we're gonna try to add the conditioned ankle replacement. So, I'm gonna direct you back to, like, the top of the form, where it says select a step.

235
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:29.510
Participant 8: Yes.

Moderator: I…

244
00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.750

255
00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:48.619
Moderator: You're not missing anything. Remember, you're testing the form, the form is not testing you.

256
00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:59.309
Participant 8: Oh, you're saying something has changed, and I didn't… I didn't… I didn't… it wasn't there before, and now… now this is there. Maybe, because I thought it was my imagination, and I don't remember seeing it.

257
00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.979
Moderator: Okay, yeah, no, no worries. We're… you're giving us really good feedback right now.

260
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:29.480
Participant 8: So we just added ankle replacement, but you didn't add additional information to that, condition. I thought, for each condition, you have to expand on, but regardless.

261
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.059

Moderator: Yeah, go ahead and tap that top button there. That's the only one that's…

267
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.680
Participant 8: That's typically the first one you choose, otherwise it wouldn't be,

268
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.380
Participant 8: A claim that you could submit.

269
00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:05.080

Participant 8: Well, I recall in previous forums, there was a little green box. It had a…

277
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.520
Participant 8: A reference number, a 5-digit reference number.

278
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.020
Moderator: Oh, it's right here!

279
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.430
Participant 8: It says, your request ID number 15428.

280
00:26:48.210 --> 00:27:07.880
Participant 8: You're saved, but again, I think I mentioned this, I don't recall, if I don't want to submit now, how'd I come back to this form, but I'll finish later, but if I did finish later, how'd I come back to this exact form if I haven't submitted it yet? Anyway, that's part… I'm not part of this study, or maybe it is, I don't know.

281
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:15.420
Moderator: It's not, but that is a really good question. So, our… Bianca will be note-taking that, for later.

282
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.360
Participant 8: Okay.

283
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.650
Moderator: Okay, so go ahead now and click Submit.

284
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.720
Participant 8: Okay.

285
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.980
Moderator: And we're gonna pause right here for a second, okay?

286
00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.660
Participant 8: Yes.

287
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:31.219
Moderator: Alright, so I'm gonna ask you some questions about, this, concept that you just tested. So…

288
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:35.320
Moderator: What were your overall impressions of navigating through the form?

289
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:45.270
Participant 8: Okay, so there… if I remember correctly, this is not actually in place right now. There's some modifications, I think.

290
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:54.069
Participant 8: I don't have a very good memory, but with this new modification, I think it's more user-friendly.

291
00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.160
Moderator: Okay?

292
00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.030
Moderator: And why is that?

293
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.120
Participant 8: Why is that?

294
00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:00.750
Participant 8: Whoa.

295
00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.799
Participant 8: I didn't… I didn't have the option to jump to different steps in the past, and it… I didn't know that…

296
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:25.450
Participant 8: it tells me how many steps I have completed, and how many more I have to complete. Without the steps, I could be like, oh, I'm on step 20, or 50, or whatever it could be. We don't know. We don't know how many steps there are to submit this application. This will give the user an idea, oh, I have to do

297
00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:28.630
Participant 8: Each step and tells me what the step involves.

298
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:34.720
Participant 8: Oh… As far as adding additional condition, I don't recall that before.

299
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:42.289
Participant 8: I don't, but it's good if I can submit multiple conditions, like.

300
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.530
Participant 8: I mean, I could add, like, 5, 7 different conditions, and…

301
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.649
Moderator: And expand on each one.

302
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:58.320
Participant 8: And if possible, I could even upload documents for each condition, for each condition in that section.

303
00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:03.370
Moderator: Absolutely. Yeah. You can. Absolutely.

304
00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:07.489
Moderator: Alright, was there anything confusing about how the navigation worked?

305
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:13.899
Participant 8: No, I'm used to the… where you click the plus signs and it expands out each one of them.

306
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:19.670
Participant 8: So, I… I do… I think that's something I've seen before, and mo… What?

307
00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.510
Participant 8: It's very… the word is…

308
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:29.669
Participant 8: user-friendly, I imagine the word is. For me, it is. I don't know for other veterans, but for me, it was.

309
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.760
Moderator: Okay.

310
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:43.319
Moderator: Alright, I'm gonna ask you some questions now on a scale from 1 to 4, and 1 would be not helpful or not effective at all, and 4 would be very helpful or very effective.

311
00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:51.070
Moderator: So on a scale from 1 to 4, how helpful was that navigation menu at the top in helping you to complete the tasks?

312
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:54.049
Moderator: One is not helpful, four is very helpful.

313
00:29:54.440 --> 00:30:12.520
Participant 8: Well, with the new change, I would say, if there's additional improvement, that's even better, but I can't think of anything, but you guys are the one who designed this, but I would give this… let me just get to the point. It is a 4 from compared to the previous, being that I could,

314
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:18.639
Participant 8: I think I'm gonna reiterate again, you could jump to different steps, you could see what step you're on, and…

315
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.509
Participant 8: And then it lets you know how far along you are.

316
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:27.609
Participant 8: And it tells you what the next steps are, and what you'll be doing as a next step.

317
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.799
Participant 8: Because without the navigation, you don't know what the next steps are and what's gonna ask you.

318
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:46.299
Moderator: Okay. Alright, next question here. On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you have completed? So, 1 being not effective, and 4 being very effective.

319
00:30:46.720 --> 00:31:01.709
Participant 8: for being very effective, and I believe that's the case here. Again, the blue signifies that I'm on it, or completed it. If it's highlighted in bold, that's the section I'm on. If it's black, I haven't even touched it yet.

320
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:07.079
Participant 8: I know that because, you know, it's just pretty intuitive for me.

321
00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:09.030
Participant 8: So, yeah.

322
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:16.869
Moderator: Okay. On a scale from 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you're currently on?

323
00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:22.789
Participant 8: It's a 4, because, I think I answered that question, but I must…

324
00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:31.140
Participant 8: From the… from the color of the steps, you know, okay, which step you've already done, and what step you're on.

325
00:31:31.610 --> 00:31:34.649
Participant 8: So, yeah, I… I don't know what else to tell you about that.

326
00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:43.620
Moderator: Okay, no, you're doing great. On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you need to complete?

327
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:50.320
Participant 8: Four, again, being that the black parts are not been touched.

328
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:51.720
Moderator: So.

329
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:54.319
Participant 8: If it's blue, then you already filled it out.

330
00:31:54.740 --> 00:32:02.189
Moderator: Okay, and then on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you go back and change your answers on the form?

331
00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.559
Participant 8: That was pretty easy,

332
00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:08.630
Participant 8: It's a 4, you want me to tell you the number? Because I could edit…

333
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.749
Participant 8: And go back to a different section.

334
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.189
Participant 8: Hit edit and change anything in that section.

335
00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:16.640
Moderator: Awesome.

336
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.920
Moderator: Okay.

337
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:25.780
Moderator: Alright, so thank you for all of your responses there. We have another, concept that we'd like you to take a look at.

338
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:38.489
Moderator: And we should be able to end on time at 2.15, so I'll be able to let you go on time and, go about your traveling. So, go ahead and, tap that continue to the next prototype.

339
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:39.260
Participant 8: Okay.

340
00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.999
Participant 8: It doesn't respond. Oh, it did. It's slow.

341
00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.320
Moderator: Got it. It'll take a little bit to load.

342
00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.110
Participant 8: Okay.

343
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.420
Moderator: Alright.

344
00:32:47.420 --> 00:33:00.509
Participant 8: I don't know if this is part of the subject, but I think this Figma thing is like a concept, designing, tool for most… a lot of different web page designers. Anyway, listen, I'm just putting my two cents in there.

345
00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:09.389
Moderator: No, absolutely, it is. It is a tool that designers use, and I can tell that you've done a lot of studies, because you seem pretty familiar with all of the lingo and, like.

346
00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:10.070
Participant 8: Yeah.

347
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:11.699
Moderator: So, that's awesome.

348
00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:12.140
Participant 8: Okay.

349
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:22.409
Moderator: Okay, so, I'm just gonna let you skim this page for a second. I'm not gonna ask you any questions about it. When you're ready, you can tap continue.

350
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:32.800
Participant 8: Okay, so… this is the same form. You don't want me to tell you anything about it, but I'm just gonna read it. You don't need me to tell you anything that… you don't need any feedbacks from me, right? Right now?

351
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.819
Moderator: Yeah. No, I just… I just want you to know, like, this is, like, kind of the same… it's gonna be similar to what you just looked at.

352
00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.980
Participant 8: Yeah, I see that part,

353
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.760
Participant 8: Nothing sticks out as being different.

354
00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:45.870
Moderator: Okay.

355
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:54.750
Moderator: All right, we're gonna pause on this page for a second before you get too far, so just take a few seconds to skim it, and then I'm gonna have some questions for you.

356
00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:56.990
Participant 8: Okay, we can act… we can continue.

357
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:03.209
Moderator: Okay. So, from this page, if you wanted to move to another part of this form, what would you do?

358
00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:06.109
Participant 8: Click on Step.

359
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.560
Moderator: Okay. Select a step.

360
00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.570
Moderator: Alright, tell me a little bit about what you're seeing here.

361
00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:27.199
Participant 8: Okay. All right, in that last demo, it didn't say… it's in blue, but it didn't say completed or any type of verbiage, whereas in this version, it says completed or in progress.

362
00:34:27.479 --> 00:34:29.619
Moderator: Yeah, so that's the difference.

363
00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:33.859
Moderator: Okay, and what are your overall impressions of this,

364
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:37.379
Participant 8: Navigation design versus the other one you just saw.

365
00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.859
Participant 8: I like this one better.

366
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:41.830
Moderator: Okay, and why is that?

367
00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:50.159
Participant 8: Well, it's… I… Yeah, the fluid, it tells you… yeah, it's… it's… More information is better.

368
00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:58.010
Moderator: Okay, alright, so let's try it out. So here, what step are you on when you're looking?

369
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.710
Participant 8: 2.

370
00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:02.889
Participant 8: It's in black instead of blue, but it says in progress.

371
00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.430
Moderator: Okay, and what steps have you completed?

372
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:09.060
Participant 8: What steps? Step 1.

373
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:11.429
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know that?

374
00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.640
Participant 8: It's in blue, and it says completed.

375
00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:18.829
Moderator: Okay, awesome. And, what steps do you still need to do?

376
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.000
Participant 8: 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

377
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.299
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know that?

378
00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:31.900
Participant 8: Because it's in black, and it didn't have any verbiage about Progress or anything like that?

379
00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.450
Moderator: Okay.

380
00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:37.949
Moderator: Let's say you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

381
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.790
Participant 8: Review and submit page.

382
00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.839
Participant 8: Well, it's not clickable, so you can't jump to that.

383
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:46.360
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know it's not clickable?

384
00:35:48.560 --> 00:36:03.769
Participant 8: Typically, it's highlight… what's… typically, it's underlying, is not. So I can… I know I can click on step one because it's underlined. Because it's not underlined, that's not clickable. And it's grayed… I guess the word is grayed out.

385
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:10.979
Moderator: It is, the word is grayed out, yup, absolutely. Okay, so you can go ahead and scroll down now.

386
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:18.450
Moderator: And we're gonna do something very similar to what we did. You're gonna go ahead and tap in that box. Tinnitus is going to appear. Go ahead and tap save.

387
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:19.200
Participant 8: Yes.

388
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:23.160
Moderator: And then you can go ahead and, scroll down.

389
00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:25.610
Moderator: And tap Continue.

390
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:31.540
Moderator: Alright,

391
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:40.020
Moderator: Let me just check my notes here. Yep, you can go ahead and tap that first, button there, my condition. Yes. Go ahead and tap continue.

392
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:48.529
Moderator: Right. And then, go ahead and tap no here.

393
00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:50.760
Moderator: Continue.

394
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.769
Moderator: Alright, and now we're gonna pause on this page for a second.

395
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:58.510
Moderator: So here, what step are you on?

396
00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:04.710
Participant 8: By hitting the up and… yeah, that step, it shows me. I'm step 4 in progress.

397
00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:10.170
Participant 8: Hasn't finished, but I'm… hasn't finished, but I'm on that page of Step 4.

398
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.289
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know that?

399
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.620
Participant 8: There's, the word says, in progress.

400
00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.080
Moderator: And what steps have you done already?

401
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.170
Participant 8: Step 1, 2, 3.

402
00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.250
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know that?

403
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:26.850
Participant 8: Because, 123 says completed. Complete.

404
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.990
Moderator: Okay, and what steps do you still need to do?

405
00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.879
Participant 8: Steps 4, 5, and 6.

406
00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:34.820
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know that?

407
00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:45.680
Participant 8: Because those are not in blue, and not underlined. And the only one that says… number 4 says in progress, so you're on that page of number 4.

408
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.920
Participant 8: Awesome. Okay.

409
00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.840
Moderator: Go ahead and, you can scroll down.

410
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.830
Participant 8: Yes.

411
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.589
Moderator: And you can, tap no, and continue.

412
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.979
Participant 8: No. Okay.

413
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.750
Moderator: And then same thing here, you can tap continue.

414
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:02.710
Participant 8: Okay.

415
00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.729
Moderator: Alright, and then we're gonna focus on this page.

416
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:10.800
Moderator: So you can go ahead and explore this page a little bit.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.440
Moderator: I'm just…

418
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:13.160
Participant 8: Yes.

419
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.560
Moderator: Tell me what you're seeing here?

420
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:15.880
Participant 8: Yep.

421
00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:17.480
Moderator: Okay?

422
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.370
Moderator: Alright, so…

423
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:26.250
Moderator: Similar to last time, let's say you wanted to add another condition. Without clicking on anything, tell me how you would do that.

424
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:31.279
Participant 8: I believe I clicked the plus sign next to the conditions.

425
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:33.869
Moderator: Okay, let's go ahead and try that.

426
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.620
Participant 8: Okay.

427
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.240
Moderator: Alright, so, what would you do here if you wanted to add another condition?

428
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.410
Participant 8: I guess you had to edit those tinnitus part.

429
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:51.579
Moderator: Okay, go ahead and try it.

430
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.550
Participant 8: Well, this part already filled out, so…

431
00:38:56.670 --> 00:39:03.439
Participant 8: this is, you know, you already filled this part out, so I need to add another condition. I believe…

432
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.469
Moderator: If not… well, it implies on the next page.

433
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.510
Participant 8: I don't know. I click on update page.

434
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:13.310
Participant 8: Would it allow me to add another condition? I don't recall.

435
00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:21.160
Moderator: Okay. Alright, is there another way that you might be able to add another condition? Let's say you wanted to add ankle replacement?

436
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:27.890
Participant 8: Yeah, I think we went through this before, I'm gonna expand all.

437
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.750
Participant 8: to see if I find it.

438
00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:42.919
Participant 8: Agu… Yeah, this part seems to be not very helpful for me to figure out.

439
00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.839
Participant 8: I don't know if it's something I'm doing wrong or not, but I don't see that.

440
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:56.650
Moderator: No, you're not doing anything wrong. We're trying to figure out, how helpful some of these, components on the screen are. Okay. So,

441
00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:02.709
Moderator: Just so that, like, you can have some closure here, you can go ahead and, expand that select a step button.

442
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.509
Participant 8: Okay, step, syllabus, step, okay, there you go.

443
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:14.220
Moderator: And then, looking at this, is there a way from here, do you… that you would think that you'd be able to add a condition?

444
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.770
Participant 8: Okay.

445
00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:22.690
Participant 8: very in detail. I don't know… I don't… it wouldn't be there, it should be under conditions.

446
00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:28.979
Participant 8: If I hit step 2, it just brings me back to the second step, which is, tinnitus.

447
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.560
Moderator: Let's try it. Let's go ahead and… and try that.

448
00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:40.290
Participant 8: Add another condition is here, though… the navigation…

449
00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:45.419
Participant 8: Unless I'm mistaken. Looks a little… a little awkward, I didn't see that before.

450
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.019
Participant 8: Unless… Okay.

451
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:55.680
Moderator: Yeah, tell me a little bit about that. Tell me a little bit about, what… what you're thinking here.

452
00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:09.779
Participant 8: I don't recall how I navigate before. Did something change or not? But obviously, you have to go to conditions in order to report additional conditions. I see it now, where it says add another condition. Before.

453
00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.090
Participant 8: I think I went to conditions, but I don't see where it says add another condition.

454
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.999
Moderator: Okay, so let's try it out. Let's go ahead and, tap add another condition.

455
00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:22.800
Participant 8: Yes.

456
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.310
Moderator: Okay.

457
00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:26.620
Moderator: And then, yep, you got it.

458
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.760
Moderator: Alright, and then you can go ahead and click continue.

459
00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:33.790
Participant 8: Okay.

460
00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:39.980
Moderator: Okay, go ahead and tap that top button there.

461
00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.490
Moderator: Alright, and now from here,

462
00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.420
Moderator: How would you get back to the previous section that you were on?

463
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:53.530
Participant 8: The previous section… I believe every… every step was already done, so…

464
00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.059
Participant 8: I guess you were walk… you're watching me anyway. Click on Step.

465
00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:03.740
Participant 8: I see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is complete. I'm gonna jump right to 6.

466
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.240
Moderator: Awesome.

467
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:06.630
Moderator: Okay.

468
00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:14.289
Participant 8: expand all to see everything I enter as a quick way, instead of adding… clicking each individual plus sign.

469
00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.370
Moderator: That way you can look over everything you already entered.

470
00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:23.649
Moderator: Awesome. Alright, and how confident do you feel that, your responses have been recorded here?

471
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:34.270
Participant 8: Okay, we just want to add a secondary condition from the first. I see conditions, I see tinnitus, I see what I typed in.

472
00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:38.580
Participant 8: I see ankle replacement, I see what I typed in.

473
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:44.419
Participant 8: I feel confident everything I wanted to put in is there.

474
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:45.820
Moderator: Awesome.

475
00:42:45.820 --> 00:42:46.220
Participant 8: Beautiful.

476
00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:53.560
Moderator: Okay, we're gonna pause here now for this, concept, and now I'm gonna have some follow-up questions for you about this design, okay?

477
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:54.540
Participant 8: Yes.

478
00:42:54.820 --> 00:43:01.300
Moderator: Alright, so what are your impressions of this version in comparison to the previous version that you used?

479
00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:14.180
Participant 8: You mean the one that's not in place, or the… are you saying the one we just looked over before, it's not exactly as the same as the one we're just looking at now?

480
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:18.859
Participant 8: The two demos, there's… there's actually two demos. Okay, so…

481
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.340
Participant 8: I'm not very… I don't recall exactly,

482
00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:31.720
Participant 8: too much of the difference, except that you saw that I had difficulty in, looking to add additional condition.

483
00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:38.899
Moderator: Okay, so, just to clarify a little bit, go ahead and scroll up.

484
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:44.129
Moderator: Yeah, all the way up.

485
00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.510
Participant 8: Okay.

486
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:48.660
Moderator: Keep going, keep going.

487
00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:53.010
Participant 8: We're gonna go to the Select a step. Yeah, go ahead and open that select a step.

488
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.160
Moderator: You can tap on select a step there.

489
00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.690
Participant 8: It's… it's not letting me do so.

490
00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.880
Moderator: Huh. Okay.

491
00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:10.279
Moderator: Okay, well, the questions that I'm going to be asking you are about, the… what was contained in that Select a Step box.

492
00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:15.229
Moderator: So, do you remember, kind of, like, what it looked like?

493
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:21.679
Participant 8: Yes, I recall it's six steps, so one is your contact information, two is your conditions.

494
00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:24.830
Participant 8: The three I don't.

495
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:25.779
Moderator: That's okay.

496
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.879
Participant 8: I don't remember the three, four…

497
00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.530
Moderator: Yeah.

498
00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.269
Participant 8: Some, supporting evidence, yeah.

499
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:32.550
Moderator: So, like.

500
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:42.040
Moderator: this design of this, of this navigation menu, what were your impressions of it in comparison to the one that we had used previously?

501
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:58.449
Participant 8: I dropped the one that we just tested out. Okay, the major difference between that one and this one is it had the steps we could go to. It didn't tell you completed or in progress, didn't have that verbiage. Now this one does.

502
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:04.149
Moderator: Okay. Was there anything confusing or unexpected about how this one worked?

503
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:12.099
Participant 8: Well, you prompt me to add an additional condition. I think I had a little difficulty to do so, though…

504
00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:21.070
Participant 8: From your, you were leading me to the way of doing that, and… I must have missed it.

505
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.849
Participant 8: I don't know.

506
00:45:21.850 --> 00:45:28.869
Moderator: Okay, yeah, okay. Is there anything you would change about this navigation menu, or not?

507
00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:37.230
Participant 8: Well… If I… if… Obviously, if you want me to add additional conditions, and I want to submit them.

508
00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:42.670
Participant 8: I would like to have an easy way to, to, add additional conditions.

509
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:45.740
Moderator: Okay.

510
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:50.389
Participant 8: I think we did that when I hit select a step, and it did that.

511
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.790
Moderator: Okay.

512
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:55.780
Participant 8: But if… I mean, without doing so, there…

513
00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:06.159
Participant 8: If there was a… next to edit, there's… if you want to just add another condition, it should be around the, you know, edit, maybe, around there, add another condition.

514
00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:08.590
Moderator: Yeah.

515
00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:18.610
Moderator: Okay. Participant 8, could you… could you scroll back up a little bit? I want to try something again. Go ahead and tap select a step at the top and see if it… if it opens for you.

516
00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:19.820
Participant 8: It won't.

517
00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:21.869
Moderator: It won't. Okay, that's okay.

518
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:39.829
Moderator: Alright, so, I'm gonna ask you some scaled questions now, one being not helpful, and four being extremely helpful. So, on a scale of 1 to 4, how helpful was the navigation menu? So this, this new navigation menu, the one that had, like, the completed, in progress.

519
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.379
Moderator: In helping you to complete the tasks.

520
00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:58.989
Participant 8: Well, you know, I was shown one version, and it was improvement from what I'd been doing, so I gave it a 4. Well, this one is even better than the one I just gave you a 4 for, because it even has some verbiage, so I'm gonna mark that a 4 again.

521
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:09.840
Moderator: Okay, so 4 again, okay. The next question is, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you have completed?

522
00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:14.780
Participant 8: 4, because I can go to… click on step, and it shows me

523
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:19.100
Participant 8: In progress or completed, yeah. Even, even more detail.

524
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:26.189
Moderator: Okay, and then on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you are on?

525
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.750
Participant 8: It's a 4, because it tells me, what step I'm on.

526
00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:32.200
Moderator: Okay?

527
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:39.290
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you still need to complete?

528
00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:48.110
Participant 8: Again, it's a 4, because if I haven't done it, or that part, it didn't even say that it was completed, or…

529
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.439
Participant 8: I think it didn't say anything, it just…

530
00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.219
Participant 8: If it's in progress, it'll be in progress, or…

531
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.869
Participant 8: If it's complete, then it shows complete.

532
00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:01.559
Participant 8: But if it hasn't… it don't show any words, it means it hasn't been touched.

533
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:12.900
Moderator: Alright, and then on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective do you think the navigation menu was at helping you go back and change your answers on the form?

534
00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.690
Participant 8: Whoa.

535
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:29.399
Participant 8: Now that you walk me through the conditions, it was pretty simple. I could click on edit. It's a 4. If I could give a high rating than the previous one, I would, but I had nothing to compare it to before you showed me the newer version.

536
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:46.860
Moderator: Sure, absolutely. Okay, awesome. Those were all the questions I had for you, Participant 8. Just to close this out now, before we finish, I'd like to reconfirm that you're okay with us having recorded today's conversation, and we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us.

537
00:48:47.310 --> 00:49:01.969
Participant 8: Oh, absolutely, you guys can use the, you know, the recording to, capture everything that we spoke about, hopefully make new improvements, and make things easy for veterans to make… submit their claims, absolutely, no problem.

538
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:15.420
Moderator: Awesome. Okay, I have another last note here. So, we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site, like you said, and make sure it really works for veterans.

539
00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:26.530
Moderator: And lastly, Paridian will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future studies like this.

540
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:32.249
Moderator: So that's… that's all we have for you today, Participant 8. Do you have any, like, last notes or questions for me?

541
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:42.750
Participant 8: No, you said I'll receive a follow-up email about the session, and there's a way to share with other veterans to participate. Is that what you said, in the email fashion?

542
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:44.710
Moderator: Yes, yeah, yeah,

543
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:45.919
Participant 8: Okay, no problem.

544
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.469
Moderator: Awesome. Okay. Yeah.

545
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:56.469
Moderator: Participant 8, really appreciate you, this was really fun for me, I hope it was fun for you, and happy holidays, and I hope that, you know, your travels are.

546
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:58.819
Participant 8: Yeah, sorry about the little delay, but .

547
00:49:58.820 --> 00:49:59.200
Moderator: No worries!

548
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:05.900
Participant 8: Glad everything worked out. Actually, it wasn't going to be available next week, so I'm glad we were able to finish this session today.

549
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:08.829
Moderator: Yeah, awesome. You too, thank you so much. Bye.

550
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:09.939
Participant 8: Alright, bye, bye.
