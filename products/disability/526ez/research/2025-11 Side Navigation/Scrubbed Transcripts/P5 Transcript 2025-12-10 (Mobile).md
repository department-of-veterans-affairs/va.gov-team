00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:26.890
Moderator: Can you tell me about your experience filling out the disability benefit form? You said that you did it, on paper. Did you do it by yourself, or did you have any assistance?

6
00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.769
Participant 5: The first… the very first time, I had assistance from a VA rep.

7
00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.979
Moderator: Okay.

8
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.130
Participant 5: the next… I done did it, like, I don't know how many times. I filled out that form.

9
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.850
Participant 5: The next times I've done it, I didn't have any assistance.

10
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:57.410
Participant 5: And recently, last year, I think it was last year, I had… a VA non… Profit.

11
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.610
Participant 5: Help me.

12
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.040
Moderator: Okay.

13
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.920
Moderator: So, it looks like you've submitted the form 3 times. What was your experience overall?

14
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.100
Participant 5: Oh, I've submitted them more than 3 times, probably about 5 to 6 times.

15
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.940
Moderator: Okay.

16
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.990
Participant 5: Yeah.

17
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.180
Participant 5: What was my experience?

18
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:26.600
Participant 5: Well, submitting it, I didn't know… that… You could… well… I could fax it.

19
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.419
Participant 5: That's the way I thought to submit it.

20
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.770
Participant 5: But you can send it in to, Jamesville, or wherever it's called, some odd.

21
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.219
Moderator: Yeah, there's an address there. Yes.

22
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.819
Participant 5: And… it seems to get lost.

23
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.370
Moderator: I see.

24
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.569
Moderator: Why do you feel that it gets lost?

25
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.370
Participant 5: Because I've submitted it, and they didn't receive it.

26
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.599
Moderator: I see, okay. So, what we did, and… And you didn't hear back.

27
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.349
Participant 5: Yeah, when I call them, they tell me… when I call that 800 number.

28
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.929
Participant 5: That 1000 number, they hadn't received it, so…

29
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.479
Moderator: Okay.

30
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.419
Moderator: Hmm, I'm sorry about that.

31
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.619
Participant 5: Fax, and get a receipt.

32
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.520
Moderator: Like a confirmation number that it was sent, I see.

33
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.770
Moderator: And so you said you've filed that a few times.

34
00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.530
Participant 5: Whoop.

35
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.089
Moderator: Can you tell me the last time That you filed in.

36
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.819
Participant 5: Last time I filed, It wasn't… it wasn't the,

37
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.999
Participant 5: the initial form, this was like an appeal, I guess, so it was a shorter form. It was…

38
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.379
Participant 5: A real short form.

39
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.180
Moderator: Okay.

40
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.820
Participant 5: And that was last year.

41
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.990
Moderator: Last year, okay. Thank you for that. So you said that you've done it,

42
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.620
Moderator: On the paper, but also online.

43
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.559
Participant 5: No, I've never done it online.

44
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.559
Moderator: I've never done that only, I'm so sorry, never mind.

45
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.809
Moderator: Okay, never mind. No, I… I.

46
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.830
Participant 5: I didn't even know they had it online for you to do. I thought you still had to print it.

47
00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:17.960
Participant 5: and write all the information out, which I thought was obsolete, but I know the VA is out of date anyway, so…

48
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:26.799
Moderator: Okay, that's fine. But, have you fill out other forms, not necessarily a VA, but other forms online.

49
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.880
Participant 5: Oh, yes.

50
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.200
Moderator: Okay.

51
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.619
Moderator: And you should knock out.

52
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:41.660
Participant 5: I filled out other VA forms, not the form to initiate for claims, but I filled out the travel form, and I filled out the,

53
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.820
Participant 5: Oh, what is it called? Uniform Alliance Form.

54
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.390
Moderator: Hmm.

55
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:55.680
Participant 5: And it's another one I filled out. Yeah, I filled out other forms online for VA, but never the… but never the.

56
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.610
Moderator: ability.

57
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.470
Participant 5: Yeah.

58
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:05.660
Moderator: Okay, that sounds good. So how do you usually keep track of where you are, or what's left to do when you're doing an online form?

59
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.090
Participant 5: Well, I just… I complete it. I don't wait.

60
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:18.209
Participant 5: I continue. I just… in one day, I'll continue the whole thing, because if I don't, I may forget.

61
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.189
Participant 5: Or, if I go back in, I may not remember how to get back to it.

62
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:33.930
Participant 5: And I don't know if there's a link. I don't trust it, so I don't know if there's a link, because when you do the travel form, you really do get

63
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.000
Participant 5: kicked out, or whatever, and I start off.

64
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.059
Moderator: Interesting. Okay, so do you just prefer to do it in one sitting?

65
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.200
Participant 5: Yes.

Participant 5: That's when you just hit stand, or complete, or whatever it is that is at the end.

70
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:14.989
Participant 5: If you don't have anything to show or prove, you can't say you really did it, unless you screenshot it, which that is what I do.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:24.090
Moderator: I'm trying to see, because it might be in your phone, you might not see all of the icons for Zoom, so you might need to click on the more…

120
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:29.229

121

Participant 5: Okay.

169
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:48.990
Moderator: Trying to share the screen on your phone is sometimes a little challenging. Okay, let's go back to the screen where you

170
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.689
Moderator: where we had, like, sign in on the ed.gov that I sent.

171
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:57.709
Moderator: Can we navigate back to that screen?

172
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.020
Participant 5: The which screen?

173
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:06.179
Moderator: The one, the link that I sent on the chat, you can click on the chat again if you want, and click on it again.

174
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.020
Moderator: To open it.

175
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.119
Moderator: Yeah, that link, that's the… not the first one, the second one, yeah.

176
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.969
Moderator: Let's see, and I…

177
00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:15.440
Participant 5: Okay.

178
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:15.755
Moderator: G.

179
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.099
Moderator: Yay! I'm here. Perfect.

180
00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:26.159
Moderator: Okay, so now… At least, yeah.

181
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:41.249
Moderator: So we… we are here on the demo page. It's going to look like the VA.gov, but like I mentioned, it's going to be a little bit different. For the remainder of the session, I'd like you to imagine that you are a veteran named Jordan Jackson.

182
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:53.260
Moderator: I'm gonna be asking you, like I said, a short version of the disability benefit form, and like, there's gonna be things that you're gonna fill in, it's just gonna fill in for you, so you don't have to type anything.

183
00:14:53.810 --> 00:15:01.610
Moderator: And I might prompt you to move to the next… if we want to go to the next topic, I might prompt you to just continue.

184
00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.440
Moderator: Okay.

185
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:17.719
Moderator: And as we're going through the site, please make sure to think out loud, and we want to hear your thoughts and your feedback, and like I said earlier, we're not testing you, we are testing this prototype.

186
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:23.490
Moderator: Alright, so, I'm gonna have you,

187
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:30.259
Moderator: Yeah, for the next 15 minutes, we're gonna test this one concept. So go ahead and click Submit.

188
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.630
Participant 5: Okay.

189
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:43.479
Moderator: Perfect! Alright, so we're gonna have you pause here, don't click anything yet, I just want you to sort of observe this page, and just think out loud.

190
00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:47.260
Moderator: And then I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

191
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:54.329
Participant 5: Okay, it's… It's the form, that long form that I always fill out.

192
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.910
Moderator: Hand written, correct? Yeah.

193
00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.959
Moderator: Date of birth, if you need to update.

194
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.459
Participant 5: So now you can click on…

195
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:14.109
Participant 5: Well, I don't know what it means. I don't know if you can click that form there, is that what you click, or you click the next step when you go in the file?

196
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.990
Moderator: Where would you think you can click to the next step?

197
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:28.490
Participant 5: Well… really, I would want to click that form, since it's up there. Click the name of the form.

198
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.690
Participant 5: Yeah, VA Form 21-526EZ.

199
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:39.910
Participant 5: I would think… I would think you could just, since you have the form there.

200
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:48.260
Participant 5: I see you have select next step, but since you have the form already there, why not just click the form?

201
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.929
Moderator: What makes you feel like you're not on the form?

202
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.769
Participant 5: Well, it doesn't have anything here.

203
00:16:59.070 --> 00:16:59.580
Moderator: Okay.

204
00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.590
Participant 5: Except for the name, Jordan Jackson.

205
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:04.180
Moderator: Okay.

206
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.250
Participant 5: This is to initiate Acclaim, correct?

207
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:26.140
Participant 5: It could be yes, but… Okay. If I'm… if I'm initiating a claim, and I know that to initiate it, I need to fill out this form right here.

208
00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:29.390
Participant 5: So, I would… Think.

209
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.749
Participant 5: Hitting this name of this form will take me to the form.

210
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.060
Moderator: Okay.

211
00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.859
Participant 5: Knowing VA.

212
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:42.369
Participant 5: It's most likely select a step.

213
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.740
Moderator: Okay.

214
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.270
Moderator: So…

215
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:55.749
Moderator: You mentioned… so the things that sort of stood out for you were the name and the form name.

216
00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:58.140
Moderator: Yes. And the select a step.

217
00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.530
Participant 5: That my name is already here because,

218
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.310
Participant 5: Oh, can I go back for a minute?

219
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.210
Moderator: I don't think it will let you go back to.

220
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:09.080
Participant 5: No, no, no, I'm just talking.

221
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.419
Moderator: Oh, okay, okay, good, so sorry.

222
00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:15.590
Participant 5: When we first came on, and you said,

223
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:21.250
Participant 5: Hit submit. It had my name, had my information there already.

224
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.960
Moderator: Jordan Jackson.

225
00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:29.500
Participant 5: And my social. I guess that was my social, because I didn't see where it said… Social.

226
00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.690
Participant 5: Only.

227
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.349
Participant 5: It may have, but it had.

228
00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.490
Participant 5: I don't know if that was password, or if that was social.

229
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:47.499
Moderator: Oh, I see. That was just the signing screen. It doesn't look like our signing screen right now on VA.gov, but it was just an email and a password there.

230
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:54.849
Participant 5: Okay, so it was your name, email, and the password. So, like it does now.

231
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:55.900
Moderator: Oh.

232
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.780
Participant 5: When you…

233
00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:57.950
Moderator: You're just worried.

234
00:18:58.450 --> 00:19:02.280
Participant 5: You go into it, you, when you hit…

235
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.539
Participant 5: Whatever it is, it brings you up, it says your name up top.

236
00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:15.399
Participant 5: I mean, it has a whole lot… it has a whole lot of things down in the bottom, not just for disability.

237
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:26.510
Moderator: Right, right, right, that's correct, but we're jumping into the disability. Let's say that you wanted to, move to another part of this

238
00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.189
Moderator: form. What would you do?

239
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:31.979
Participant 5: Select a step.

240
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:40.970
Moderator: You do select a step, okay. So… Go ahead and,

241
00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:45.949
Moderator: Go ahead and click on that and see what you see there.

242
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.780
Participant 5: Okay, veteran… okay.

243
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:58.059
Participant 5: So the first step. …that it says is Veterans Details, that's where it just showed my name and my birthday.

244
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.539
Participant 5: Then it says conditions.

245
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:09.300
Participant 5: Mental health, supporting evidence, additional information, review and submit.

246
00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.020
Moderator: Okay, what are your thoughts with this?

247
00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.979
Moderator: With what you're seeing.

248
00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:22.549
Participant 5: I'm still going back to where it says that name of the form.

249
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.699
Participant 5: Okay, this is the form that I want to fill out.

250
00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:28.200
Moderator: I don't underst…

251
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:34.920
Participant 5: I guess the next step is really what you want us to do, but… Just seems to me, if…

252
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:38.419
Participant 5: I would think, if you clicked that form.

253
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.310
Participant 5: Then it will say, next step.

254
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.719
Moderator: I see. Okay.

255
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.539
Participant 5: Okay, so we're in these next steps.

256
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:53.349
Participant 5: And… I got my veteran details, which to me is not enough details about myself.

257
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.280
Participant 5: It doesn't say my last 4.

258
00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:02.580
Participant 5: Normally, things will say your last four are social.

259
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.009
Participant 5: Maybe they don't want that on the form.

260
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:16.579
Moderator: Yeah, we did not want to include that social, but normally, yes, so we are on the first step of the form, so we are on the disability benefit form.

261
00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.100
Participant 5: Okay.

262
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:21.360
Moderator: But, as you have this opened,

263
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:30.129
Moderator: how are part of the forms… you said, like, you didn't mention all the different pages. How do you interpret the word step here?

264
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:32.270
Participant 5: Worse?

265
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.420
Moderator: the word step. Like, what does it mean to you?

266
00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.729
Participant 5: Oh, what I'ma do next…

267
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:55.290
Participant 5: The next thing, after I see that it is me, my vet, you know, my ID, myself, my birthday, and everything, the next step, where am I gonna go? The next step, the conditions. What conditions do I have that I want to put on the form?

268
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.980
Participant 5: So I will go to step 2.

269
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.540
Moderator: Okay.

270
00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:09.840
Moderator: Good, thank you for that. Okay, so we're gonna, like, close this form. Let's see if you can close this, select this step. Thank you! Alright, so let's…

271
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:14.970
Moderator: Scroll down, and I'm gonna have you, click continue.

272
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.500
Participant 5: Okay.

273
00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:25.929
Moderator: Now, talk to me through what you're seeing here. I won't ask you anything about this page in particular, but go ahead and scroll up and down.

274
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:39.970
Participant 5: Sweet.

275
00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:43.960
Participant 5: I don't… I'm not trying to be difficult.

276
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:47.000
Moderator: No, no, it's okay. But… What are your thoughts?

277
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.220
Participant 5: seems like…

278
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.370
Participant 5: to me, That this information should have been on there first.

279
00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.689
Moderator: Okay. Like, on the previous screen.

280
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:03.740
Participant 5: Yes, on that first page, because when I… when we came to this page.

281
00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.010
Moderator: And it said the VA form.

282
00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.300
Moderator: -

283
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:14.530
Participant 5: It didn't say veteran details or anything. It just had, at the bottom, Jackson and my birthday.

284
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.180
Participant 5: That didn't explain anything to me.

285
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:18.900
Participant 5: I didn't…

286
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:19.600
Moderator: Got it.

287
00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:25.120
Participant 5: Why… why would we have that? But then, when you come here, you have veteran details.

288
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.989
Moderator: And you have all of my information, except my birthday.

289
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.480
Participant 5: You have everything here. This is more explanatory to me.

290
00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:35.990
Moderator: Okay.

291
00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:39.709

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:24.709

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:03.529
Moderator: Great. And then… this is the same page, so it's…

307
00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:10.579
Moderator: Alright, and now we're gonna have you, continue.

308
00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.050
Participant 5: That was a good page.

309
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.229
Moderator: But I'm glad you worked that one, that one wasn't confusing.

310
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:25.759
Moderator: Just take a minute and, like I said, just, you know, scroll down and talk to me through what you're seeing here.

311
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.930
Participant 5: Don't click on anything yet.

312
00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:31.319
Moderator: I do have some questions about this particular page.

313
00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:43.729
Moderator: Alright, so… What step are you on?

314
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:50.669
Participant 5: the cause of my condition. Well, the tendonitis is one of the conditions.

315
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:55.890
Participant 5: And I think I'm still in step 1.

316
00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.389
Moderator: You're still in step… why do you think you're still on step one?

317
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.979
Participant 5: If I remember the steps, I can't remember the steps!

318
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.100
Moderator: I know.

319
00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.340
Participant 5: It might be, because it's a second step, I'm not sure. Whatever conditions is.

320
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:16.850
Moderator: Okay, it might be the second step.

321
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.339
Moderator: Is there any way to know how many steps you've finished?

322
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:22.840
Participant 5: No.

323
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:25.250
Participant 5: I have to go back, I guess.

324
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.530
Participant 5: and hit Select Step.

325
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:33.520
Participant 5: And take myself back to see where I, you know, was at before.

326
00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:38.529
Moderator: You said that you would hit select step,

327
00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:39.170
Participant 5: Yes.

328
00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:41.500
Moderator: On a different page, not on this page.

329
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.720
Participant 5: On this page right here.

330
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.340
Participant 5: Okay.

331
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.840
Participant 5: Next step…

332
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:46.880
Moderator: Alright.

333
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.330
Participant 5: And see where I'm at.

334
00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:49.530
Participant 5: Okay.

335
00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.940
Participant 5: Oh, step two, okay, because step one is the details.

336
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.210
Moderator: Okay.

337
00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.099
Participant 5: Okay, step 2.

338
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:02.899
Moderator: So, do you know… Looking at that, you can… let's expand it again.

339
00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:04.180
Participant 5: Okay.

340
00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:05.610
Moderator: They'll select the step.

341
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.799
Moderator: Yeah, leave it open. So how do you know which steps you have finished?

342
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.119
Participant 5: It… it's not bold.

343
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:17.640
Moderator: Okay.

344
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:22.250
Participant 5: If I'm working on something, it must be bold.

345
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.180
Participant 5: Well, blue, bro.

346
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.719
Participant 5: It's not black, yeah.

347
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.760
Moderator: Okay.

348
00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.550
Participant 5: Light blue is finished.

349
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.679
Moderator: And what are the steps that you still need to do?

350
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:39.679
Participant 5: 3, 4, 5, and 6 need to do all of those.

351
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.189
Moderator: And how do you know you need to do those?

352
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.790
Participant 5: Because they're not bold blue, nor are they bold light.

353
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.190
Moderator: I see.

354
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:49.719
Participant 5: Black, still in Black.

355
00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:55.600
Moderator: Okay, so it's because of the different color of the text that you notice that you can click on.

356
00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.010
Participant 5: Alright.

357
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:57.340
Moderator: You can't, sorry.

358
00:27:57.770 --> 00:28:06.129
Moderator: That those are the steps that you need to do. Let's say that you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

359
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.870
Participant 5: Just go down and select it. Step 6, I suppose.

360
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:15.889
Moderator: Okay, let's try doing that.

361
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:18.739
Participant 5: I don't know if that's gonna work.

362
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:26.930
Moderator: Like, why do you think those steps are not available yet?

363
00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:33.940
Participant 5: Because you haven't finished the previous ones, or haven't submit… put anything in the previous step.

364
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:38.990
Participant 5: So I suppose you have to put something, if not

365
00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:44.610
Participant 5: If not completed, because when it says review.

366
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:51.909
Participant 5: That don't mean you have to submit it, you're just reviewing it, but you got to put something in there to review.

367
00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.360
Moderator: Yes.

368
00:28:54.030 --> 00:29:00.320
Moderator: Was there anything else that helped you, understand that that step was not available to you?

369
00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:05.210
Participant 5: No.

370
00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:13.930
Participant 5: no explanations here. You, you know, you don't have any little… paragraph.

371
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:16.580
Participant 5: Still needed, or whatever.

372
00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.270
Moderator: Okay.

373
00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.520
Participant 5: Not done, or unfinished.

374
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.330
Participant 5: You're, like, doing this on your own.

375
00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:33.860
Participant 5: without any assistance, if you don't have any knowledge about the VA at all, this is your initial

376
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:37.269
Participant 5: Contact and doing a claim.

377
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:42.900
Participant 5: You might have a little confusion, especially as an older veteran.

378
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:48.589
Participant 5: You might have a little confusion. You're definitely gonna need some help.

379
00:29:49.340 --> 00:29:54.770
Moderator: So you would want some help, some additional content that tells you that it's done or not done?

380
00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:55.900
Participant 5: Yes.

381
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.620
Moderator: Okay.

382
00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:05.800
Moderator: Thank you for that. Alright, let's, scroll down, and, we're gonna have you select…

383
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.930
Moderator: My condition… the first… the first option there.

384
00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.030
Participant 5: Okay.

385
00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.039
Moderator: And then we're gonna click Continue.

386
00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:15.600
Participant 5: Okay.

387
00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:23.889
Moderator: I can take a few seconds to read this page. I'm not gonna have any questions for you on this page.

388
00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.610
Moderator: Once you're done, we can…

389
00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:40.170
Participant 5: I'm glad… I'm glad you have.

390
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:49.099
Participant 5: Do you want to add VA Form 210781? So, yes, a person most likely would need to add that form.

391
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:55.469
Participant 5: And you hit yes, will the form… Automatically come up?

392
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:06.610
Participant 5: What would you think would happen? I think it would. Yes, I want to fill out a PDF to upload, so you say yes.

393
00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:08.720
Moderator: Yes, I want that.

394
00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.420
Participant 5: Online.

395
00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:11.730
Moderator: Yeah.

396
00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:18.759
Moderator: I think it should. We're gonna just click, no here, and we're gonna continue.

397
00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:20.340
Participant 5: Okay.

398
00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.340
Participant 5: Supporting empathy.

399
00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.109
Participant 5: Yeah. This one, that's weird.

400
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:38.519
Moderator: Go ahead and build… you can, you know, take a look at this page from top to bottom. As you're thinking out loud, don't click on anything yet, because I do have some questions on this one.

401
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.109
Participant 5: My answer would be yes.

402
00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:57.470
Participant 5: And then, how do I submit the forms.

403
00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:04.710
Participant 5: Because it doesn't have… Well, I guess when you hit yes, maybe something else may come up.

404
00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:11.400
Participant 5: and say, Submit your additional evidence, I don't know.

405
00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:14.469
Moderator: Yeah.

406
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:15.520
Participant 5: ANC.

407
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:22.679
Moderator: Yes, it should, it should, but we won't click anything yet, so let's imagine that…

408
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:38.369
Moderator: you realize right when you got to this page, that you enter an old email address, and you wanted to double check, so you could update it in case it was an old one, and you wanted to update your email. What would you do from here?

409
00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:41.729
Participant 5: Oh, what?

410
00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:44.130
Participant 5: An old email address?

411
00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:48.849
Moderator: Yeah, like, you realize that you have an old email address, and you want to update it.

412
00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:52.449
Participant 5: I have no clue. Where would I go?

413
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:59.760
Participant 5: Because unless I go back to where it says Jordan Jackson.

414
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.199
Participant 5: All the way at the top.

415
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.380
Moderator: Okay, so you will go all the way at the top.

416
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:08.420
Participant 5: the name.

417
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:13.190
Moderator: Jackson with the name next to the menu, is that where you would click?

418
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:17.159
Participant 5: Yeah. I will click, because it has an arrow there.

419
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.220
Participant 5: George Jackson, and since that's me and my.

420
00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:21.720
Moderator: Hmm.

421
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.300
Participant 5: Information is most likely there.

422
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.509
Participant 5: I can go and update my email address.

423
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.300
Moderator: I see. Okay.

424
00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:40.640
Moderator: Is there any way… any other way you would think to update your email address in this particular form?

425
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:49.639
Participant 5: I will go back to, if I'm allowed, to go back into the next step, and go back to number one, veterans details.

426
00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:50.910
Moderator: Okay.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.239

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:18.919
Moderator: Oh, okay, well… Yeah, it's okay. We jumped ahead, but it's okay, it's okay. You're here.

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.179
Participant 5: No.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.170
Participant 5: That's not the one. I forgot where it was at.

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:31.199
Participant 5: I was in… Right.

438
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.869

00:34:37.449 --> 00:34:38.229

444
00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:02.649

00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:06.549
Participant 5: and hit continue, then I will come up the phone and email, edit it, then I'll change my email address.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:16.459
Moderator: Alright, so, yeah, it sounded that you… it was hard to remember, like, what would help you remember the… the section name?

460
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.620
Participant 5: Well, veteran details is fine.

461
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.230

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:31.610
Participant 5: On the veteran detail, It only has my name and my birthday. Remember I told you?

Moderator: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

464
00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.390
Participant 5: That was kind of confusing.

465
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:43.230
Participant 5: Because… That first page… Like I said, It had that.

466
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.289
Participant 5: I thought it should have had it all.

467
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:49.540
Moderator: Right, right, right.

468
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.230

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.700

472
00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:23.450
Moderator: Alright, let's pause for a second. If you wanted to return to the part of your… of the form that you were previously on.

473
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.900

474
00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.799
Participant 5: Hit select step.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:39.359
Moderator: Oh, don't click on anything yet.

477
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.970
Participant 5: You know, we were on conditions at first.

478
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.600
Participant 5: And we selected tendinitis.

479
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.910
Participant 5: I feel we would just select Oh, no, because…

480
00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:58.710
Participant 5: It doesn't work that way, I see. Remember when we tried to select before, and I went into this select step?

481
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:06.159
Participant 5: it wouldn't… at that time, I don't know, maybe you guys did something since I said that, but…

482
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.659
Participant 5: I couldn't select anything.

483
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:19.059
Participant 5: you know, hit whatever next, and here, I had to go back, like when I did for veteran detail, and go down and hit continue.

484
00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:21.310
Moderator: Okay.

485
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:26.119
Participant 5: That's the way you got to the next page, hitting continue.

487
00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:39.489
Moderator: at all of the steps here. Do you remember which step you were… you were last on?

488
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.940
Participant 5: We were on conditions. We didn't get to mental health.

489
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:48.680
Moderator: We didn't get… oh, no, we got to… yes, we did. We got the supporting evidence. I'm sorry.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.149
Moderator: How can you tell that some of the steps are completed?

495
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:12.670
Participant 5: they're highlighted, they're in light blue, and the two that I haven't finished is in black.

496
00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.120
Moderator: Okay.

497
00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:23.360
Moderator: Alright, so let's go and, and then how many steps you still have to do?

498
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.240

Moderator: Hmm.

539
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:45.689
Moderator: Can you think of any other way to add a condition?

540
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:52.479
Participant 5: I would just have to go all the way back to the select step and see.

541
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.469
Participant 5: Go to Condition.

542

558
00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:10.369
Moderator: Okay. Alright, so you've added your new condition, let's say that you wanted to go back to that page, the last page you were before.

559
00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.000
Moderator: The review and submit page.

560
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.809

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:18.450
Participant 5: I'll hit continue.

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:32.890
Participant 5: do you include it?

566
00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:38.799
Moderator: Review and submit. Okay, you'll hit continue to make sure everything… why are you hitting continue first before you jump to…

567
00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.540
Participant 5: Because I want to make sure this is recorded.

568
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.600
Participant 5: The new condition that was added.

569
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:56.210
Moderator: Sounds good. Okay, let's assume that we did click continue and everything's saved. Let's… let's go back to the review and submit.

570
00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.320
Participant 5: Before, don't hit continue.

571
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.049
Moderator: Yeah, don't hit continue.

572
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.190
Participant 5: Okay.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:09.000

00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:17.070
Moderator: Awesome! Now you can fill out your name, and we're gonna submit this form!

576
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:26.700
Moderator: You can… oh, wait, before we do… I went, just kidding. I'm so sorry. Yes, yes, yes, I just wanted to make sure that,

577
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:32.509
Moderator: That, you know, how… if you were confident that everything that you changed was there.

578
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:37.900
Moderator: But I don't think… If I don't… That's a… It's okay.

579
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:43.999
Moderator: Alright, now we have a few questions before, don't click on anything yet. Okay.

580
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:48.160
Moderator: What were your impressions of navigating through the form?

581
00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:53.680
Participant 5: It was… somewhat… complicated.

582
00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.279
Participant 5: The, back and forth.

583
00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:04.730
Participant 5: I love the last… well, I don't know if it's the last, whatever that page is, with the plus signs.

584
00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.430
Moderator: The review page?

585
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.090
Participant 5: Yes.

586
00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:16.340
Participant 5: I like the plus sign because you can… you can see that you can go straight, too. The other ones with the lighted shade and the darker shade.

587
00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:20.890
Participant 5: I know one time we clicked on it, and it didn't click.

588
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:29.280
Participant 5: I'm not sure if that was because we hadn't submitted anything. I can't remember.

589
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:30.740
Participant 5: Well, I knew…

590
00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:32.479
Moderator: Probably at that beginning.

591
00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:34.499
Participant 5: We couldn't select a step.

592
00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.940
Participant 5: Because we hadn't put anything in the step.

593
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.240
Moderator: That's correct.

594
00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:45.740
Participant 5: GOAT. You have to go… Hit continue.

595
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:49.070
Participant 5: At the bottom of the page to go to the next step.

596
00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:55.939
Moderator: Was there anything confusing about how the navigation worked?

597
00:46:57.770 --> 00:47:01.370
Participant 5: Yeah, that continue. You can't just go to a step.

598
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:05.549
Participant 5: Suppose you didn't… suppose you didn't have your…

599
00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:15.860
Participant 5: documentation or whatever you wanted to, add, like, your layperson your witness statement.

600
00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.390
Participant 5: If you didn't have that yet.

601
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.900
Participant 5: Or, if you didn't have… know about your condition, whatever your condition is.

602
00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:35.630
Participant 5: And that extra form to fill out. If something you didn't have, and you wanted to skip it for right now, you're gonna go back and fill it out.

603
00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:38.580
Participant 5: But you want to skip it.

604
00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:41.459
Participant 5: Are you allowed to do that?

605
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:48.109
Participant 5: It seems like… On the form, you have to finish what you started.

606
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:54.129
Participant 5: Don't seem like you can… pause and come back. I'm not sure if he can.

607
00:47:54.490 --> 00:48:04.679
Participant 5: Okay, so you would… it sounds like you would want to… some… some steps you would want to skip, because you're going to get back to them later, and you want to continue filling out the form.

608
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:05.960
Participant 5: Yes.

609
00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:16.990
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. Anything else about the way you navigated from one page to another, how you jumped back to one page to another?

610
00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:27.060
Participant 5: To go back, you have to… you have to know that you have to go back to that select step.

611
00:48:29.690 --> 00:48:35.279
Participant 5: I'm just wondering… That last page with the plus signs.

612
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.559
Moderator: I don't know why. Yeah, the review page.

613
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.660
Participant 5: the review page, I would rather go from here.

614
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.290
Participant 5: Select everything, and then go make changes.

615
00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:54.550
Moderator: Go there. You said you would want to go there to… Enter everything.

616
00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:58.390
Participant 5: No, to make changes, I would want to…

617
00:48:58.390 --> 00:48:59.460
Moderator: Changes. Okay.

618
00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:02.499
Moderator: And not go back to the page.

619
00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:03.650
Participant 5: Correct.

620
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:12.680
Moderator: I see, you want to make all the changes there. Okay, sounds good. All right, now we're gonna have, a few questions regarding,

621
00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:19.950
Moderator: Just like a… rating questions. So on a scale from 1 to 4,

622
00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:28.750
Moderator: One being not helpful, and four being very helpful. How helpful was the navigation menu on helping you complete the task?

623
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.219
Participant 5: Hmm, maybe a 3.

624
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:35.330
Moderator: A 3. Why is that?

625
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.240
Participant 5: Because, like I said, you have to know to hit continue.

626
00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:45.380
Participant 5: Or you can't select the next step.

627
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:51.680
Participant 5: It needs to be something to say.

628
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:56.820
Participant 5: Select next step here from continue or something.

629
00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:00.710
Participant 5: Because you can't just go to the next step, I don't know why.

630
00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:05.470
Moderator: I see. Yeah, you couldn't jump ahead. Yeah.

631
00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:14.550
Moderator: Alright, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you have completed?

632
00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:17.179
Participant 5: Oh, it's fine, it's 4.

633
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:18.540
Moderator: 4. Okay.

634
00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.660
Participant 5: And yeah, you can see the highlight.

635
00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.829
Moderator: You can see the highlight, okay.

636
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:30.189
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you were on?

637
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:35.950
Participant 5: Well, it was a 4-2. Well, no, not… What you was on?

638
00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.510
Participant 5: You had to go back.

639
00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:44.460
Participant 5: So, I would say 3, because it was a little bit confusing.

640
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.099
Moderator: Okay, it was a little bit confusing.

641
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:49.770
Moderator: you…

642
00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:56.829
Moderator: So, you said to go… so, to know which step you were on, you said you needed to go back?

643
00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.670
Participant 5: Yes.

644
00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:00.410
Participant 5: You have to go back.

645
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.299
Participant 5: Well, I guess… I think, if I recall correctly.

646
00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:09.060
Participant 5: The step you were on was highlighted in dark blue.

647
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.079
Moderator: In dark blue. Okay.

648
00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:13.539

Moderator: Yeah.

653
00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:23.050
Participant 5: Yeah, that makes sense. Alright.

654
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:27.200
Moderator: From scale to 1 to… 1 to 4, how effective

655
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.469
Moderator: Once the navigation menu, or helping you know which steps you need to complete.

656
00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.750

657
00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:38.870
Moderator: Okay.

658
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:47.520
Moderator: And on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you go back and change your answers on the form?

659
00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.090
Participant 5: Hmm.

660
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:55.100

Participant 5: Okay. When I went in the steps.

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:45.410
Participant 5: So when I went down to review and submit, I selected… I hit that, tapped that, and it did nothing.

713
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:53.940
Moderator: I see. You had to click on it, you know, to make sure that you… okay, so you had to click to know.

Participant 5: But no, no instructions.

715
00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.860

Participant 5: I am continuing to put conditions.

726
00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:54.289

Moderator: A 4, okay. And on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you have completed?

776
01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.220
Participant 5: Or…

777
01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:27.050
Moderator: Or… and how effective was the navigation menu helping you know which steps you were on?

778
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:28.430
Participant 5: 4…

779
01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.769
Moderator: And how effective was the navigation menu, helping you know which steps you still need to complete?

780
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.070
Participant 5: Or…

781
01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:46.049
Moderator: And lastly, how effective do you think the navigation menu will be at helping you go back and change your answers? I know we didn't do this in this form, but…

782
01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:47.340
Moderator: Hmm.

783
01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:50.460
Participant 5: It most likely is 4, because… It…

784
01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.019
Participant 5: It shows you where you're at.

785
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.759
Participant 5: And you can go back. I mean, it's self-explanatory, really.

786
01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:07.119
Moderator: Yes, thank you for that, and I think we only have one minute left. Is there anything else that you want to say?

787
01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.029
Moderator: When will VIN be, available?

788
01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:11.969
Moderator: What was that?

789
01:02:12.330 --> 01:02:14.420
Participant 5: When will this be available?

790
01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:23.509
Moderator: Oh, this particular version. Well, we are working on it, so hopefully soon. Definitely not this year.

791
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:24.130
Participant 5: Oh, wow.

792
01:02:24.790 --> 01:02:26.080

793
01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:30.510

795
01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.250

796
01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.450
Participant 5: for us.

797
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:53.040
Moderator: Awesome, yeah, thank you for sharing your thoughts and your feedback. Perigion should be sending you a thank you note, with the blurb that you can pass along to other veterans, that you may know, and, just so that they can help us with other research studies like this one. But yeah, thank you so much again, and have a nice day.

798
01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.580
Participant 5: Bye-bye, everyone. Bye-bye.

799
01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.149
