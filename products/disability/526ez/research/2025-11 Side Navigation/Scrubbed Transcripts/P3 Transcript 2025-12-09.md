00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.050
Moderator: Perfect. Is it okay if we record this session today?

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.720
P3: Yes.

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:23.890
Moderator: Perfect! Alright. So, before we look at the demo website, we'll start with a few warm-up questions. You said that you had filled out the disability benefit form last year. How was your experience filling that, that, form?

4
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.520
P3: It's been a while, I don't remember the specifics.

5
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.420
Moderator: But it…

6
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.830
P3: But I don't… I don't remember any… any significant problems. I mean, it was… it seemed… Everything…

7
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:54.409
P3: everything I do with the VA.gov, and I use HealthEVET, too, and I don't experience any problems, I mean, the main complaint… I do have a main complaint with the VA, internet,

8
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.359
P3: interface, I guess I can say.

9
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:11.450
P3: get too many doggone emails from them, and there's no way of shutting it down, and there's no… no, if you talk to one person, if you… even if you go to the number on the email you get.

10
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:24.630
P3: It doesn't bring you to anybody that can calm your frustration down of getting all these crazy emails. I mean, it's just ridiculous how many emails you get from them to remind you of appointments.

11
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.110
Moderator: Yeah, I'm so sorry about that, yeah.

12
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.390
P3: that's… Nothing can… nothing can be done. I've talked to different people, and

13
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.990
P3: No one seems to, you know… there's not a good central point for, for, help.

14
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.860
Moderator: Yeah, I'm not familiar with that side of the site, but yeah, I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.079
P3: Right, right, right. That's… and everything else, everything's pretty straightforward, you know, it's…

16
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.840
Moderator: Okay. Do you remember if you fill it out, like, online on VA.gov, or was it… Yes.

17
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.219
Moderator: shape or form.

18
00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.940
P3: Oh, it was online, yeah.

19
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.430
Moderator: Okay, perfect.

20
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.190
Moderator: Alright.

21
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:10.650
Moderator: I think right now, I can share the link, and,

22
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.099
Moderator: I'm gonna send you the link through the chat.

23
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.810
P3: Okay.

24
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.860
Moderator: And as you open the link, it's gonna load for some time, we're gonna ask you to also share your screen.

25
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.360
Moderator: Okay.

26
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.849
Moderator: And if you are… if you go back, because I know it's going to open your…

27
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:48.599
Moderator: a browser. But if you go back to Zoom on the bottom of Zoom, you should be able to see, like, audio, video, and then, like, there should be a share, button with the arrow up, so if you can click that, and then…

28
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.809
Moderator: Share the page that you just opened. Perfect.

29
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.160
Moderator: Awesome.

30
00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.720
P3: shit.

31
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.869
Moderator: We have entered this demo page, so you are going to be this demo person called,

32
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.509
Moderator: I forgot it was, like, Jackson, yes. Alright, so,

33
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:28.209
Moderator: for the remaining of the session, like I said, you're just gonna be this fake veteran, we're gonna go, you're gonna be filling out the disability benefits form as Jordan Jackson, and like I said, things are gonna be pre-filled, some things may not function the way you should on the website, but,

34
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:44.759
Moderator: But yeah, I'll be… I'm gonna be taking you through the session, the different pages throughout the session. Okay. Yeah, and like I said, remember as we're going through the pages, to think out loud, and, I'm gonna emphasize that we're testing the form.

35
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.639
Moderator: And we're not testing you. So, feel free to give us your honest feedback.

36
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.769
Moderator: Okay. Alright, so, we're gonna have you sign in!

37
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.480
P3: Okay.

38
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:08.270
Moderator: Sign in, and now you are in the Disability Compensation form. Okay. We're gonna pause here and ask you a few questions, so don't click on anything yet.

39
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.930
P3: Okay.

40
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.990
Moderator: As you look around this page, what stands out to you first?

41
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.710
P3: Oh…

42
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:32.690
P3: I can see right away I'm on the right, the right page, because right at the very top, file for disability compensation is there, and it's telling me which form that I'm using.

43
00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.139
Moderator: Anything else that stands out?

44
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:47.670
P3: Anything else? It's showing me I'm the right person, and my date of birth would, you know, I can verify that I'm…

45
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.999
P3: That it has, informa-

46
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.440
P3: basic information about me, that I'm in the right record for me. It's showing me that here.

47
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.460
Moderator: Perfect. If you wanted to move to another part of this application, what would you do?

48
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.809
P3: I'd, use my, track, my, my mouse, roller thing.

49
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.599
P3: This… my… my roller, that's how I normally get around on a page. The roller on my mouse.

50
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.930
Moderator: If you wanted to move to another page, what would you do?

51
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.120
P3: Oh, I would, well, I… let's see. I mean, I… since I would,

52
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.100
P3: If I was following this, I'd hit continue.

53
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.080
Moderator: And, why would you choose that?

54
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:46.810
P3: You know… you know what? In fact, this looks similar to what the one I did, because I do remember, and I did… I remember hitting finish this application later.

55
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:53.570
P3: Oh, yep. Because I knew I needed more information, so I had finished the application later.

56
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.840
Moderator: Yes, yeah, that's a… I think that's in all of our forms, in case you want to pause and stop. Yeah.

57
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:11.559
P3: So, yeah, if I… you know, now that I know I'm in the right… on the right thing for, you know, filing for disability, I'd hit continue to see what's next.

58
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.540
P3: Okay.

59
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:20.720
P3: I would just follow the website's guidance, you know, which, of course, is right here, it's saying to continue on. I'd love to click on that.

60
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.160
Moderator: Alright, let's go ahead and, click on continue.

61
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.060
P3: Okay.

62
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:38.469
Moderator: Alright. So, is there anything, just talk me through what you're seeing on this page.

63
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:49.120
P3: Oh… It's kinda… it's kinda… so I guess I'm still in step one, even though I changed the page.

64
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.520
P3: That's kind of.

65
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.840
Moderator: Okay.

66
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.669
Moderator: weird thing, you know, you continue on, and you're on the same step. That's kind of weird, but…

67
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:06.429
P3: But, yeah, again, I can see that this information applies to me. My… my phone number's correct, my email address.

68
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.380
P3: Money dresses correct.

69
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.309
P3: Yeah. If it was up to me.

70
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.280
P3: I think I'd have… I'd have,

71
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:33.259
P3: I… right now, I'm interested in going back to see if the last place I said… said veteran details like this, because, you know, when you go to a new page, you would think that you'd see something different. You'd be in a different step over here. It would show you something different over here, like maybe Step 1A or something.

72
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.810
Moderator: contact information.

73
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.920
P3: You know, because that, that la- did the last page say contact information, too?

74
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.480
Moderator: Actually, you can go back, you can go back and check.

75
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.140
P3: Okay, no, it's still on Veteran Details. Okay, so yeah, that's just…

76
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.079
P3: Two pages of veteran details is all we got.

77
00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:02.060
Moderator: Okay, let's go back to the other page, and then you said you noticed the steps on the right-hand side.

78
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.320
P3: right-hand side?

79
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.489
Moderator: Oh, sorry, on the left-hand side.

80
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.110
P3: Right?

81
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.059
Moderator: What do you notice about how the parts of the form are labeled?

82
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.440
P3: Let's see, it's… Veteran details, condition… minimums.

83
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:24.960
P3: It seems pretty, pretty simple and straightforward, veteran details, so that's what we're looking at right now.

84
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:25.980
Moderator: Hmm?

85
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:32.179
Moderator: How do you interpret the word step here? Like, what does it mean to you?

86
00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.300
P3: Barron's form steps.

87
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.599
P3: I kind of initially would think it's…

88
00:08:53.310 --> 00:09:07.780
P3: the page, you know, that it'd be a separate page. Like, that's why I said I would have thought this would be, you know, since I clicked continue, that I'd be on, you know… I'd be progressing here. That's…

89
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:28.390
P3: You know, so that step, I kind of think of step, I think, a different page. But, I mean, you know, there's different ways of looking at it. I mean, I could see it being this way, being a major heading. Veteran details is like, you know, one major heading, and then you continue on, and eventually we'll get to the next major heading.

90
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:43.050
P3: conditions, so I can understand doing it this way, but personally, my first think, when I hit continue, I think I'm going to a new page, I think I should be progressing in what would be the steps, you know?

91
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.030
Moderator: I agree.

92
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.960
Moderator: Alright, thank you for your feedback there. Let's click continue.

93
00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:09.059
Moderator: Yeah, you can take a look and skim this page. And I'm gonna have you, add a condition in this page whenever you're ready.

94
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.590
P3: Okay.

95
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:26.330
Moderator: And feel free to think out loud as you're, like, viewing the page, but whenever you're ready.

96
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:35.310
P3: What I was thinking is, you know, it's very laid out very good, the way it's got, you know, if you're having problems.

97
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.780
P3: With the form, if something doesn't… doesn't look right, or doesn't work right.

98
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.670
P3: You gotta, you know, as long as that brings you to the right place.

99
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.710
P3: Oh, and hopefully it isn't, well, nowadays, every time you call anywhere, it's like a…

100
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.800
P3: You get the big runaround going different… it just takes forever to…

101
00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:01.760
P3: That's frustrating for older people. My ma's 10… my ma's 10 years older than her… me, and…

102
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.810
Moderator: Life is tough. Yeah, no.

103
00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:06.569
P3: To get assistance, you know?

104
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:12.150
Moderator: So… So let's start in,

105
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.210
Moderator: enter a condition, it's gonna pre-fill for you, and… and it's gonna.

106
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.190
P3: Okay.

107
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.470
Moderator: So go ahead and do that.

108
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.260
P3: Oh.

109
00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:29.089
P3: Okay, so, oh, so, you want me to use tinnitus? You don't want me to put my own in there? Okay.

110
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.749
Moderator: No, no, no, it's just gonna, like I said, this is gonna pre-filled for you, so you can click save, and we'll continue.

111
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.920
P3: Ringing or hissing in ears, okay.

112
00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:41.850
P3: So…

113
00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:42.460
Moderator: Yay!

114
00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:46.750
P3: air conditions. You want me to try to edit and see what it does?

115
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.570
Moderator: No, no, we can click continue.

116
00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:51.889
P3: Okay, continue on with tinnitus.

117
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:57.889
Moderator: Yes, and talk me through what you're seeing on this page.

118
00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.139
P3: It's wanting to know if this is…

119
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.479
P3: This condition is pertaining to my service.

120
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:06.869
P3: Or not.

121
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.819
P3: It was caused by exposure during service.

122
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:21.190
P3: existed before I… but it got worse because of my service. My condition was caused by an injury that happened while I was receiving VA care.

123
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.209
Moderator: Yes, so.

124
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:28.800
P3: Huh.

125
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:34.600
P3: So, caused by an RV event. An injury or event.

126
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:54.559
P3: Interesting. Well, you know, I thought tinnitus is something… I didn't think it was an event that caused… don't you just… as you get older, isn't it… isn't that something you can just expect to eventually get, you know, possibly get… getting tinnitus? It's not an event.

127
00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:56.910
P3: Or an injury, you know?

128
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:13.459
P3: So, these two, in other words, when I'm looking at it, because now… now I'm in this state of conditions, I'm kind of wondering, is this something that could be considered,

129
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:19.740
P3: Something that would, authorize me a disability?

130
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:35.919
P3: That would be my thinking right now, and this one, of course, yes, my condition was caused by an injury or exposure during my military service. Obviously, that's gonna be, you know, and injury or exposure, yeah.

131
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:40.980
P3: Yeah, if you were working in an engine room with a loud noise, yeah.

132
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:41.570
Moderator: attention.

133
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:45.550
P3: you're gonna get disability in that case. This one, like.

134
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:55.910
P3: my condition existed before I served in the military, but it got worse because, again, yeah, I could see you would get some disability for that.

135
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:09.680
P3: this, I don't see why you would get disability. My condition is caused by an injury event that happened when I was receiving VA care. I don't see… that would be… at this point, I'd be like, well, why am I doing it if I would be selecting that?

136
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:21.749
Moderator: Yeah, so these are the questions that I think we asked for all the conditions. I'm gonna go back to what you said earlier. You said that your Step 2 conditions. How do you know that you are on the step that you're on?

137
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.090
P3: Because of that right there.

138
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.780
P3: This is highlighted. It's highlighted.

139
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:30.510
Moderator: Okay.

140
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:43.700
P3: And it's got this little bar here to let you know you're on step two. So yeah, I'm satisfied, I'm in the right… you know, I've moved on to the right step now, I'm in conditions, you know, at this point.

141
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:51.849
P3: How would it… let's see, would it be easy to… to add more? Oh, yeah. Would it be easy to add more at this point? I don't…

142
00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:58.709
Moderator: Yeah, don't click on anything yet. I'll have a few more questions before we move to the next one.

143
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:12.429
P3: I'm saying? Here, I don't see anything that would make it easy to add other, other conditions if I've come to the point where I… that I'm like, well, wait a… well, I guess I would hit back if,

144
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:25.450
P3: If I… if I came… if I got here, I selected tinnitus, and I looked at these things here, and I said, wait a minute, I probably… they're not going to give me disability for this, so I'd probably head back and see if there's something else.

145
00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:31.910
Moderator: Anything else? Okay. Alright, let's go back to… well, let's not click on anything yet.

146
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:32.240
P3: Right.

147
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.609
Moderator: So what steps have you finished?

148
00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.450
P3: I did the details, and I'm working on conditions right now.

149
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:45.089
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know that you finished the… the veteran details, step?

150
00:15:45.090 --> 00:16:04.240
P3: Well, because, because it's, I guess, number one, it has changed colors. I imagine that when I'm done with conditions, this will look like that one. It'll be a light blue, not bolded. So, once I'm done with conditions, I'm sure it's gonna look like this light blue one.

151
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:09.630
P3: But the fact that the bar's here, it's no longer here.

152
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.080
P3: That tells me that this is done, you know?

153
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.540
Moderator: Okay. And what steps do you still need to do?

154
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:29.499
P3: The mental health statement, I gotta finish conditions, I'm not done, I'm on that. I still gotta do mental health statement, supporting evidence, additional information, and review and submit.

155
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.339
Moderator: And how do you know that you still need to complete those steps?

156
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.290
P3: Because they're a different color. They're all, you know, black. They haven't turned blue yet.

157
00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:54.549
P3: They haven't turned light… I know this… I know I finished this. That's how, you know, I know this is finished, and it's light blue, so I'm… I'm imagining that when I finish each step, it's gonna look like this one here. Light blue.

158
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.190
P3: Once I'm completed with each step.

159
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:05.829
Moderator: Sounds good, and let's say that you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

160
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:17.210
P3: I'd see if, when I move my pointer over it, if it allows, if it shows a… that it's a clickable link, which here it doesn't, so I wouldn't, I wouldn't try.

161
00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:18.630
Moderator: Okay.

162
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.619
Moderator: And, so if it doesn't, then how would you move?

163
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:25.719
Moderator: to that.

164
00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.220
P3: What's that?

165
00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:37.240
Moderator: you said that you would… you said that you hover on the, left hand, and you noticed that it wasn't clickable, so, what would you do to navigate to the Rivian?

166
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:56.570
P3: Well, you… you… you can't, you can't jump to it. You'd have to just go to continue, then. You'd have to continue through until you got there. But, I mean, if you… if I saw that I could, jump ahead by hovering over it and seeing it's a clickable link, then I… then I'd jump right to it, but…

167
00:17:57.020 --> 00:18:02.300
P3: But, you don't have that ability with this, with this, online form.

168
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:12.939
Moderator: Yeah. Alright, so thank you for that. Now we're just gonna have you, you're just gonna click on the options, it's just gonna pre-fill, and we're gonna, click continue.

169
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:16.359
P3: Okay, you wanted me to select one of these?

170
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.050
Moderator: Yep.

171
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:27.130
Moderator: it's just gonna pre-select one of them, don't worry, it's not gonna… yeah, and then you can… I think you're gonna have to… oh, yep, it allows you to go. Perfect. Alright, so now we're on the.

172
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.490
P3: Mental health statement. Mental health statement.

173
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.710
Moderator: Yeah.

174
00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:43.999
P3: Oh, so they're gonna put a form that says they're adding a form to support the new mental health conditions, to support new mental health conditions, if I had such a thing.

175
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.029
Moderator: We're just gonna select no here.

176
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:55.910
P3: And then, yeah, I mean, you immediately could just say, no, I don't… I don't have any mental health conditions, so I'll just hit no.

177
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:57.930
P3: You could do that.

178
00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:58.880
P3: You know?

179
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.819
Moderator: Alright, so yeah, let's do that. Let's select no and continue.

180
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:15.520
P3: Okay, so… but now they're saying, okay, you're gonna need to have evidence to support this, so now we're at this point now.

181
00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:16.570
P3: Which…

182
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:27.850
P3: You can see that here with the, the bar here, and it's bold blue. We know we finished all these steps because they have changed to a light, a light blue.

183
00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:30.800
P3: You know what?

184
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:48.219
P3: I don't… I don't know, if you… you may be able to go back, even though, just by the fact that it's, changing colors, if you needed to go back, you might be able to go back just by left-clicking on this right now, if I wanted to go back to conditions.

185
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.250
Moderator: Yeah, sorry.

186
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.160
P3: Here.

187
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.959
Moderator: Perfect, let's not click…

188
00:19:52.120 --> 00:20:01.219
Moderator: anything yet? Right, right. So imagine that you realize that you have entered an old email address, and you wanted to double check

189
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.800
Moderator: If you need… if you could update it, if that was the case. What would you do from here?

190
00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:14.999
P3: I just… because I can hover on… not… when I hover on this step one, which is the details for a veteran.

191
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.210
Moderator: It actually…

192
00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.610
P3: Oh, in this case, it's actually…

193
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:32.579
P3: it's actually changing into this, different, pointer, mouse pointer. That indicates to me that I could left-click on it, and it would bring me back there so I could take a look at it.

194
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.439
Moderator: Alright, let's see.

195
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:43.070
P3: Whereas this one, it don't look like I could go back to conditions. I mean, I try just because, you know, because it's…

196
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:57.769
P3: why not? Why not try? But, the fact that the pointer doesn't change like it does here, I would… I would assume that I can't go back to conditions or mental health, but I could go back to veteran details because of.

197
00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:58.700
Moderator: Yeah.

198
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:09.450
Moderator: So this is, again, because it's a prayer tab, you should be able to go back to all those steps that you mentioned. Okay. Yeah, let's… let's click on that step one.

199
00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:10.920
P3: Okay.

200
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:19.980
P3: And… Let's see, now… Yeah, it wasn't on the first page, the email address, so…

201
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.160
P3: I'm gonna have to continue on to the next page.

202
00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.120
Moderator: Yes, let's do that.

203
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:34.139
P3: Okay, and then, if I wanted to, if this was wrong, I'd just hit on edit.

204
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.830
Moderator: Okay.

205
00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:46.989
Moderator: Alright, let's see if you can, yeah, let's go ahead and click if you can edit.

206
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.920
P3: See if I can edit, okay.

207
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:58.469
P3: Okay, email address required, okay. So, you want me to left-click in this field and try to change it?

208
00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:00.139
Moderator: Yep!

209
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:01.270
P3: Okay.

210
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:04.500
P3: Okay, it jumps in there, let's…

211
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:10.999
P3: Nope, it's not letting me change it. It's not letting me get into the field to change it. If I left-click.

212
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.199
Moderator: Oh, okay.

213
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.580
P3: It's not.

214
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.950
Moderator: That's okay. That's okay, yeah.

215
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:21.480
Moderator: Alright, so it looks like we can change and update the email here.

216
00:22:21.770 --> 00:22:30.370
Moderator: So we're gonna pause here for a second. If you wanted to return to the part of the form that you were previously on, what would you do?

217
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:36.859
P3: I would, let's see…

218
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:56.770
P3: So, it looks like it changed the email address. That's part of the… part of the, scenario here. It changed it, right? So, I would hit save, and then I would go back to supporting evidence. I'd left-click on here and go back to Supporting Evidence to go right back to it. I wouldn't step back through the continuing.

219
00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:09.599
P3: I would just save this so it would save my new email address, see where it brought me, and if it didn't bring me right to supporting evidence, back to supporting evidence, then I'd just left-click on here to get there.

220
00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:13.180
Moderator: Got it. That sounds good.

221
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:20.000
Moderator: And, so you explained that. What tells you, that this… that that step is available?

222
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.850
P3: Supporting evidence?

223
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.729
P3: The pointer. The mouse pointer.

224
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:26.530
P3: Yep.

225
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:30.719
Moderator: Perfect. Okay, let's do that. Let's click the save, and then let's click on Step 4.

226
00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:31.750
P3: Okay.

227
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:34.629
P3: Back to supporting evidence, okay.

228
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:42.329
Moderator: Perfect. I'm not gonna ask you any questions on this page, we're just gonna select no and continue.

229
00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:54.490
Moderator: Alright, and then no questions on this page either, and, yeah, we can click continue too.

230
00:23:56.770 --> 00:24:02.229
Moderator: Perfect. Now take a minute and talk me through what you're seeing on this page.

231
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.920
P3: Okay, this is, this is,

232
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:14.979
P3: A normal thing for the internet nowadays, when you've, when you're doing any kind of online form.

233
00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.199
P3: It's given you a chance to look at

234
00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.270
P3: What you entered to try to avoid making a mistake.

235
00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:35.329
Moderator: Perfect. So let's say that you wanted to add another condition. How would you do that, without clicking on anything?

236
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.459
Moderator: I guess you could click if you want to expand the things.

237
00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:54.519
P3: Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay, you mean without clicking on anything right now? Yeah, I would… I would verify, first off, I did verify my conditions by clicking on the expand all to see what conditions it listed for me.

238
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.239
Moderator: Alright, let's do that.

239
00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:02.539
P3: Okay, I'll do that first, and and then if I, if I wanted to…

240
00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:20.150
P3: add something. Now, edit to me here means, that I want to get rid of this, do something with this. If I wanted… I wouldn't take that edit to mean to go back to the conditions page. I would go back up here to go back to my conditions.

241
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.960
Moderator: I would use this.

242
00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.450
P3: I wouldn't use… I wouldn't use that.

243
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:38.560
P3: I don't know, I might click on it, see what it does, but chances are, if I wanted to add another condition, I was like, oh yeah, I needed to… I wanted to add my heart problem to it, I'd come up to conditions.

244
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.840
Moderator: Okay, let's do that. Let's go…

245
00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:50.000
Moderator: Click there. Back to conditions. Let's go back to conditions, and we're gonna add… Ankle replacement.

246
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:51.700
P3: Okay.

247
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.589
P3: Add another condition…

248
00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:01.000
P3: And color replacement, then save that.

249
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.840
P3: Okay.

250
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.750
Moderator: And then…

251
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:13.260
P3: Now it's showing two of them. There we go. And I'm guessing that this edit here, all it will do is allow me to remove this out of there.

252
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:21.449
Moderator: Yeah, that's correct. Alright, let's click continue, and you're gonna answer the same question that we answered for tinnitus.

253
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.160
P3: Just hit continue.

254
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.469
P3: Oh, okay.

255
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:34.590
Moderator: Yeah, we're gonna click the same thing.

256
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.959
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, let's…

257
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:41.140
P3: Oh, okay, jumps you right back down to review.

258
00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:41.500
Moderator: Yeah.

259
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.350
P3: man.

260
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:54.779
Moderator: I mean, it shouldn't have done that, yeah. It shouldn't have done that. But it's okay. We needed to go back to the review page, and you can double-check to make sure that everything applied.

261
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:55.400
P3: Yep.

262
00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.750
Moderator: Perfect!

263
00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:02.440
Moderator: Awesome, I'm gonna ask you to click submit.

264
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.640
P3: Submit.

265
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.770
Moderator: And then we'll have a few questions, because we're gonna go to another… .

266
00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:11.930
P3: Submit application.

267
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:12.560
Moderator: Yep.

268
00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.340
P3: Do I need to do this up here?

269
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.980
Moderator: You can.

270
00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:21.879
P3: I certify… let's see… there we go. Submit, I did it. Submit application.

271
00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:33.700
Moderator: Okay. Before you click continue, I have a few questions. Alright, now that you've finished all the tasks, what are your impressions of navigating the form?

272
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:41.269
P3: Oh, that was easy. In fact, I think that's… that's probably how I did it last time. It's… it looked, similar to, you know.

273
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:45.330
P3: It's… it's pretty straightforward. It's… it's pretty simple to use.

274
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:50.470
Moderator: Okay, was there… you said it was simple, so I'm assuming, was there anything confusing?

275
00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.400
P3: Nothing confusing.

276
00:27:52.750 --> 00:28:11.240
Moderator: Alright, so now I'm gonna ask you, on the next few questions, I'm gonna have you rate from 1 to 4, okay? 1 being not helpful at all, and 4 being very helpful. Okay. So how helpful was the navigation menu on helping you complete the task?

277
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.629
P3: Number 4. Very helpful.

278
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:24.709
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, the next one, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you have completed?

279
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.880
P3: Very helpful for four.

280
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.390
Moderator: Okay.

281
00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:39.240
Moderator: And on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu, or helping you know which steps you were on?

282
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.169
P3: Number 4, very helpful.

283
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:50.490
Moderator: Okay, we have two more. How effective was the navigation menu helping you know which steps you needed to complete?

284
00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:57.829
P3: Very helpful. Number 4.

285
00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:06.649
Moderator: Okay, and last one, how effective was the navigation menu helping you, go back and change your answers on the form?

286
00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.609
P3: Very helpful, number 4.

287
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:09.620
Moderator: Okay.

288
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:23.870
Moderator: Perfect! Alright, so now we're gonna start, the next 15 minutes, hopefully, will be having the time. I think we have time. We're gonna go ahead and click the continue to the next prototype.

289
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.870
P3: Live there.

290
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.260
Moderator: Perfect.

291
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:43.760
Moderator: And we're gonna start, the same way. I don't think you need to sign in. Let's see, it's gonna load. Okay, perfect! We're gonna pause here and just focus on this page and see if you notice, anything different or anything that stands out.

292
00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:51.980
P3: Oh, yeah, the step, form steps, our…

293
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:56.559
P3: I like that better, this style better, the way it is.

294
00:29:57.130 --> 00:29:59.660
Moderator: What about the style that you like better?

295
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:15.110
P3: Well, the fact that it's got that progress, basically a progress bar, but in a vertical format. It's a progress bar, you know, that lets you know… lets you know how far you are. I like… I like that better than the other one.

296
00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:23.760
P3: The one… the last one we did. It's just, it's easier to see where you're at in the process when you have a progress bar.

297
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:33.280
Moderator: Perfect, anything else that you like about this particular, design.

298
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:45.019
P3: I like the colors, I like that, the stuff in the future that needs to be done is very, you know, almost difficult, almost difficult to see. It's very light in color.

299
00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:51.689
P3: And the one you're on is very, very bold, it's dark in color, I like that.

300
00:30:52.110 --> 00:31:03.259
P3: And it also actually says you're in progress where you're at in the process of filling out the form. It's really clear that you're in the debtor details area.

301
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:05.630
Moderator: Okay.

302
00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:12.990
Moderator: Perfect! Okay, let's go ahead, and click, continue.

303
00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:26.170
Moderator: And, yeah, it's gonna take you the same thing. So let's go ahead and click continue again.

304
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:38.220
Moderator: And… Let's pause here, what are your, overall impressions of this page?

305
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:43.880
Moderator: And is there anything different on this version?

306
00:31:50.810 --> 00:32:06.450
P3: Yeah, it's the same color as it was before. The step that's complete, it's that light blue color saying it's done. It's very obvious, you can go back to it because it's underlined like a link would be, so…

307
00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:09.549
P3: Seems very clear that you can left-click on it.

308
00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:20.640
P3: And it's obvious done… obviously done, because you got complete right below it. So, yeah, it's… it's much more,

309
00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:27.930
P3: Much more clear on, where you at… where you're at on this form. It's much more clear.

310
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:42.810
Moderator: Perfect. Yeah, you answered the first… I was… I had some follow-up questions regarding, like, what steps have you done? And you've answered that already. Let's say that you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

311
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.389
P3: I don't think you could.

312
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:55.220
P3: I don't think you could. I mean… I'm not sure…

313
00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:01.110
P3: Why you would try, but it's showing you you can't hear, because…

314
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.620
P3: You know, you can't… there's… it's not possible.

315
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.569
P3: The pointer to just this, the normal pointer, it hasn't changed to let you know…

316
00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:17.189
P3: It's a clickable link. So the only way you could go forward is by, at this point, is by the continuing.

317
00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:24.919
P3: But, I don't… I don't know, I don't know, you know, I'd be surprised that it even lets you go for it if you don't have a condition here.

318
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.820
P3: Yeah.

319
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.990
Moderator: have something.

320
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:27.930
Moderator: Yeah.

321
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:37.140
Moderator: I agree, and and what help you understand that, what steps are available for you?

322
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:41.799
P3: The fact that the point… the mouse pointer, that's the main.

323
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.280
Moderator: Same thing.

324
00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:52.159
P3: The mouse pointer is showing that there's no change from… if you have it over here, to if you have it over here, the fact the mouse pointer doesn't change in any way.

325
00:33:53.130 --> 00:34:03.809
P3: And it doesn't even change here on the one that, we're currently on, because we're on that page. But it does change if we try to go back to a previous step, so that's how…

326
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:04.210
Moderator: Okay.

327
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.470
P3: That's how I can tell, by the mouse pointer.

328
00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:14.439
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, let's add tinnitus again, and we're gonna do the same thing that we did on the other one.

329
00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:20.629
Moderator: And answer those questions that, those follow-up questions regarding tinnitus.

330
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.520
P3: Save.

331
00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.500
Moderator: Yep, go ahead.

332
00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:27.080
P3: It doesn't… I'll continue.

333
00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.470
P3: That seemed like it had an extra step on that one.

334
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.009
Moderator: Oh, really? Hmm.

335
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:33.459
P3: Yeah, yeah, look.

336
00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:35.710
Moderator: Southern half…

337
00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:37.739
P3: Back, okay.

338
00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:41.299
Moderator: Oh, I… it won't… yeah, let's not go all the way back, it's okay.

339
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:43.420
P3: So, continue… to…

340
00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.180
P3: And then you select… you select tinnitus, and you hit save.

341
00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:54.900
P3: It should come right up to the page, that asks you the three questions. It didn't do that. It went to.

342
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:55.779
Moderator: Yeah.

343
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:58.119
P3: Why? Save. Save.

344
00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:00.510
P3: and…

345
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:02.080
Moderator: Yes, we can continue.

346
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:07.960
P3: Could it continue? Okay, maybe it did, maybe I… okay. Yeah, it might… Maybe it went back…

347
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:08.790
Moderator: Thank you.

348
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.130
P3: It went back…

349
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.770
Moderator: Bill.

350
00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.750
P3: It went back to allow you to add a condition, I guess.

351
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.749
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

352
00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:25.019
Moderator: And then let's enter that, yeah, let's select the first one, or… yeah, it's just always gonna select the first one. Perfect.

353
00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:33.080
Moderator: And then, just go back to the mental health one, and then select no there too.

354
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:46.210
Moderator: And then, let's pause here, and we have a few more questions. So, what step are you in?

355
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:52.350
P3: Supporting evidence. It's wanting to… it's wanting to tell you

356
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:56.280
P3: That you have to submit supporting evidence for your claim.

357
00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.780
Moderator: And, how do you know that you're on the supporting evidence, step?

358
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.299
P3: Over here, it tells you in progress.

359
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:10.359
P3: Up here, it's pretty clear. It's up at the very top that you're on the supporting evidence page.

360
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:14.709
Moderator: So, which steps do you… have you completed?

361
00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:20.760
P3: The veteran details, conditions, and the mental health statement, they're all complete.

362
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.640
Moderator: No.

363
00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:29.489
P3: shows that they're complete. They're all that light blue color, indicating that they're complete, but it…

364
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.300
Moderator: Hmm.

365
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.059
P3: It doesn't look like he can go back to him, though.

366
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:40.879
Moderator: Yeah, it's… it's a prototype, you should be able to. And what steps do you still need to do?

367
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:51.209
P3: I gotta finish this supporting evidence, and then once I finish that, I'll have to do the additional information and review and submit.

368
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:57.879
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, let's select, no and continue.

369
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:08.160
Moderator: And… and you can… Continue again.

370
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:19.039
Moderator: And… feel free to interact with this page, and let's… we're gonna ask you again, let's say you wanted to add another condition.

371
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:23.840
P3: Again, I would go back to conditions here.

372
00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:25.120
Moderator: Okay.

373
00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:28.710
P3: Actually, I'd like to hit edit to see what… Oh, go ahead.

374
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.269
Moderator: Yeah, you can do that.

375
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.850
P3: Okay, so you could… that's what it does. It allows you to change it.

376
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:38.229
Moderator: But it doesn't allow you to delete it here.

377
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.059
Moderator: It does not.

378
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:51.550
P3: So maybe you have to go… maybe you'd have to go back anyhow to conditions to delete it if you decided that, no, I don't want to put that in there.

379
00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:52.970
Moderator: Yeah.

380
00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:54.760
P3: Hold on.

381
00:37:55.310 --> 00:38:15.019
Moderator: Awesome. And I think, yeah, this is the end of, this one, this particular, prototype. Now I'm gonna ask you, the same questions that I asked you before. Overall, what are your impressions of this version in comparison to the previous one?

382
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.410
P3: I like this better.

383
00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:20.260
Moderator: And Ryan.

384
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:30.120
P3: I just, I, I, like, per- personal, my personal, feeling is I like…

385
00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:33.400
P3: I like having a progress bar. It's,

386
00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:44.009
P3: Either vertical or horizontal. I like… I like a progress bar that shows where you are in the process of… of doing an online form.

387
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:57.500
P3: The other… the other one was okay, but I… I prefer this. I prefer to be able to, at a quick glance, see where I'm at in the… in the… in the… in the,

388
00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:04.180
P3: I've always liked it that way. I actually like most… a lot of forms, they have percents, you know?

389
00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:16.299
P3: 20%, 30%. I like that better. It lets you know how… how much farther you got, especially when it's accurate. I like that. So a lot of times they're not accurate when they're… when they're showing the percentage.

390
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:17.520
Moderator: Yeah, yeah.

391
00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:20.880
P3: All of a sudden, you jump to 90%, you know?

392
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.290
Moderator: Agree.

393
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:30.890
P3: Yeah, I mean, not… nowadays, I mean, it's kind of what… it's nice to, it's nice to stick with

394
00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:44.079
P3: what everybody's using right now, and that's… it seems like everybody that's got you filling out online forms uses the, the percentage and the progress bar. That's…

395
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:49.879
P3: So that's why I prefer it, I guess. I mean, the other one is simple, also, you know.

396
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.520
Moderator: Okay.

397
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:59.440
Moderator: That's good. Alright, anything that you found confusing or unexpected about how this one worked?

398
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.130
P3: Other than what, you know, that… when we added that condition,

399
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:16.619
P3: It seemed, it seemed like it threw another page in there, you know.

400
00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.130
Moderator: Perfect.

401
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.799
P3: That confusion there, that's the only thing that…

402
00:40:20.090 --> 00:40:23.580
P3: That I… that seemed, you know, different, but

403
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:26.949
P3: And we went back and did it over.

404
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.399
P3: It seemed like the reason it did that was so you could add another condition.

405
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:34.890
Moderator: Yeah.

406
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.059
P3: Didn't realize it.

407
00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:42.090
Moderator: Yeah, no, that's okay. Is there anything that you would change or add?

408
00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.939
Moderator: You did mention the percentages, anything.

409
00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.090
P3: Yeah. Yeah.

410
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.800
P3: You know, you know.

411
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:13.499
P3: Personally, the one thing I don't like about it, how it uses that same light blue color as the other one, I… I would like it to either…

412
00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:19.060
P3: put an X to show that it's completed, some… .

413
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:19.860
Moderator: Oh, my God.

414
00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:36.489
P3: Or a line through to show it's completed, instead of just seeing complete up there. Something that definitely shows that that's done. That… personally, that… I think that would be better, to… to put an X through it all together to show that it's done.

415
00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:42.150
P3: An X normally is helpful to show that something has been… that's been… it's been done.

416
00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:48.310
Moderator: Yeah, so you like additional visual, Yeah.

417
00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:58.229
P3: to let you know that it's been completed. Yeah, the complete is nice, but it's not as good as, having, something that shows that it's been done like a check mark or something.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:00.139
Moderator: Oh, like a checkmark, okay.

419
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:04.510
P3: Yeah, a check mark or an X, something like that. Better, yeah.

420
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:07.469
Moderator: to just another visual cue. Okay.

421
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:16.060
P3: Yep, yep, a visual cue, yep. Better than putting complete. The complete is nice, though, you don't see that often. That's kind of nice.

422
00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.590
Moderator: Okay.

423
00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.320
Moderator: Perfect.

424
00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:29.720
P3: And the in-progress is really nice, too. The words itself are nice. They're very helpful to see that, yeah, I'm in progress with this right now.

425
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.620
Moderator: Perfect.

426
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:39.089
P3: I like to… so, yeah, in summary, The wording is good.

427
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:53.839
P3: But the actual, like you said, a visual clue is nice, too. Instead of just having a progress bar showing that, you know, we're… that actually you can quickly glance at that first step and see something to say, yeah, that's done and out of the way.

428
00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.689
Moderator: Sounds good.

429
00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:12.790
P3: And what's… and also… also what's really nice about this format is the fact that you use the underlines to show it's a clickable link. I like that, where you don't actually have to put your pointer over it to know that you can go back to that. That's nice.

430
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:15.090
Moderator: Yeah. That it looks like a link.

431
00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.059
P3: Yep, yep.

432
00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:23.839
Moderator: That sounds good, it looks like you like the labels, the bar, those are good, alright.

433
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:38.029
Moderator: Now, we're gonna have this… the scaling questions again, the 1 through 4. So, from 1 through 4, how helpful was the navigation menu in helping you complete the task?

434
00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:39.490
P3: 4.

435
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:48.570
Moderator: Alright, extremely helpful. Okay, and then, how effective was the navigation menu, or helping you know which steps you have completed?

436
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:50.620
P3: Four, extremely helpful.

437
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:57.449
Moderator: Okay, and how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you were on?

00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.919
P3: 4. Extremely helpful.

439
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:07.169
Moderator: Perfect, and how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you still need to complete?

440
00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.380
P3: 4. Extremely helpful.

441
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:19.870
Moderator: And, how effective do you think the navigation menu would be at helping you go back and change your answers on the form if you used it?

442
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.460
P3: 4. Extremely helpful.

443
00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:27.770
Moderator: Perfect! I think this is…

444
00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:39.910

Moderator: And, let me know if there's any… I'm gonna see if there's any questions, if [Notetaker] or [Observer], you guys have any questions.
