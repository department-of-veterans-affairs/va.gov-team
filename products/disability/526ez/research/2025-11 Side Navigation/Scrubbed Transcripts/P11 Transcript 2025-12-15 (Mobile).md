00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.759
Moderator: Alright, so once again, are you comfortable with us recording your screen and audio for today's session?

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.410
Participant: Yes.

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.750
Moderator: Alright.

4
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:26.759
Moderator: So, before we get into the prototype, we have a few, kind of, warm-up questions. So, you mentioned that you have filled out the disability benefits form before. Can you tell me a little bit about how your experience was doing that on VA.gov?

5
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.190
Participant: The experience was easy,

6
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.299
Participant: The directions to download all the forms you needed were there. How to fill out the forms, it told you. If you didn't fill out

7
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.180
Participant: If you… say if you missed a spot, it would let you know before you could go to the next page.

8
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:58.620
Moderator: And when you mentioned, kind of, downloading, did you, like, download a PDF, like, of the disability form, or are there other forms that you're, kind of, alluding to?

9
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.049
Participant: I wanna say I downloaded the buddy letter.

10
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.300
Participant: from my laptop.

11
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.230
Participant: Yeah, I downloaded it to the VA from my laptop.

12
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:21.310
Moderator: Got it, okay. Were there any kind of challenges that you experienced throughout the application process, in terms of kind of filling it out online?

13
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.280
Participant: Not to my knowledge, I…

14
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.459
Participant: It was, it was, like I said, it was very fluid and very easy.

15
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.130
Moderator: No, that's great to hear.

16
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:53.629
Moderator: Alright, I'll actually ask… sorry, I'm making sure I'm looking at my notes here. I'm curious, throughout the experience that you had, if you remember, especially since we know that the disability benefits form is, you know, pretty long, especially in comparison to some of the other forms.

17
00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.629
Moderator: Do you remember, kind of, how maybe you kept track of, like, where you were, or how much was left to do?

18
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.870
Participant: If I wasn't able to complete it, whenever I would log in, it would take… it would take me back to where I stopped at.

19
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.490
Moderator: So you had to kind of complete it in more than one session?

20
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.039
Participant: Yeah, but it wasn't…

21
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.710
Participant: For the form being so long, it was for me being distracted and drawn somewhere else.

22
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:33.730
Participant: No, that's… But yeah, I can finish the form in one sitting, but something else catches my attention. But it automatically saves every time you update something.

23
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:41.760
Moderator: Got it. So you have some experience with the fact that it kind of saves where you were, and then you can log back in. Okay, got it.

24
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:59.760
Moderator: Alright, so, I think now we can go ahead and get started. So, I'm going to send a link in the chat, and then later going to ask you to share your screen so that we can see how, you're going to be interacting with

25
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.310
Moderator: the page that you're gonna open up. Are you familiar with screen sharing on Zoom?

26
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.999
Participant: I can figure it out.

27
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.860
Participant: Yeah.

28
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.480
Moderator: Yeah, that's what we're here for as well, so… I see share.

29
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.019
Participant: Yeah, I see screen, okay, yeah, I see it.

30
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:28.449
Moderator: Okay, perfect. So, what I'm gonna do is send a link in the chat, and, feel free to open that.

31
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.369
Moderator: And then, once it's open, we would love for you to share your screen, and I can kind of walk you through

32
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.650
Moderator: That process.

33
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.989
Participant: Alright, share screen…

34
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.470
Moderator: You'll have to…

35
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.450
Participant: Broadcast.

36
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.080
Participant: Okay.

37
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.890
Moderator: Perfect! Oh my god, that was, like, record time. No joke.

38
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.769
Moderator: This is usually, to be honest, the hardest part.

39
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.490
Moderator: Really?

40
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:09.679
Moderator: So one thing you can do here is actually the… the window where my face shows, you can kind of swipe that to the left or to the right, so… there we go, perfect. You can see your full screen.

41
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:20.870
Moderator: All right, okay, let's see, I'm just making sure… Alright, so, before you click on anything, before we kind of start,

42
00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:34.289
Moderator: a few notes is that since you've now kind of entered our demo page, you'll see that it looks very familiar to VA.gov. This is a demo website, and so I want to kind of reiterate that, and so…

43
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.330
Moderator: This won't work entirely like the real website, but will be as close to real as possible, to put it that way.

44
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.970
Participant: Okay.

45
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:49.320
Moderator: For the remainder of the session, I'd like you to imagine that you're a veteran named Jordan Jackson.

46
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.700
Participant: Okay.

47
00:04:50.700 --> 00:05:04.160
Moderator: Jordan is not a real person, and obviously this is for making sure that we're kind of just using data that will help with the process, since we don't need to necessarily get, like, your information for what we're testing.

48
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.800
Participant: Okay.

49
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:23.229
Moderator: And so, on some pages, as I mentioned, we're going to have you kind of click through to the next part, or kind of help move us along, and then there are going to be other pages where I may ask you to kind of, like, stop and complete a task, or complete a task, and also share out loud kind of what you're thinking and what you're seeing.

50
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.190
Participant: Okay.

51
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:40.450
Moderator: And so, last but not least, I want to emphasize that you are the one testing, kind of, the form and the experience of completing the form. The form is not testing you. So, again, at any point, please feel free to give us your honest feedback, because that's what we're here for.

52
00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:41.330
Participant: Okay.

53
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:56.739
Moderator: Alright, so now we can, I think, go ahead and get started. So you'll see that this is the sign-in screen, and for the next, like, 15 to 20 minutes, we're going to be testing the first concept, and as I mentioned earlier, then we'll move on to another one.

54
00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:57.710
Participant: Okay.

55
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.940
Moderator: When you're ready, you can go ahead and click Submit.

56
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:11.880
Moderator: All right, and so on this page, as you kind of read through this, can you say out loud what you're seeing and what you're thinking?

57
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.440
Participant: Is that a new form number?

58
00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:18.849
Moderator: It is not, actually.

59
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:26.410
Participant: Oh, really? Okay, I see, as I mentioned, it said we saved your application.

60
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.720
Participant: It pretty much all looks the same.

61
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.990
Moderator: Alright, is there anything that stands out to you as you go through this page?

62
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.700
Participant: The selective step.

63
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.389
Participant: The drop-down right here, over file for disability compensation.

64
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.840
Participant: That… that looks new.

65
00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:02.150
Moderator: you've actually pinpointed exactly what is new and what we're testing today. So, if you want, actually, you can go ahead and kind of tap on that navigation button, and then you can tell me a little bit about what you're seeing and thinking here.

66
00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:06.099
Participant: Right on the details. It easily lets you go to the steps.

67
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.249
Participant: that you… Probably need to edit.

68
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.609
Participant: Before you, submit everything, it looks like you can usually go to your steps.

69
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.870
Participant: If you forgot to support any information, you can go back to step 4.

70
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.340
Participant: I like it.

71
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:34.189
Moderator: And what do you notice about how, some of the parts of the form are labeled? Like, the way that it says, kind of, step, and then the number, what are…

72
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.140
Moderator: What does that kind of language, like, tell you about the form?

73
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.119
Participant: It gives you precise directions.

74
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.469
Moderator: What do you mean by that? Can you elaborate a little bit?

75
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.420
Participant: It kind of gives you an order of what you need.

76
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.229
Participant: Instead of just waiting to see the next page.

77
00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:00.870
Moderator: So it's almost like an overview, or kind of… it lets you know ahead of time what.

78
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.579
Participant: Yeah, kind of like a… kind of like an index, maybe.

79
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.280
Moderator: Mmm, love that. That's a great term.

80
00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:15.510
Moderator: Alright, and so the term, kind of, step here that's being used, what do you think that means?

81
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:19.399
Participant: This is the first thing you need to do, is give your details.

82
00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:23.530
Participant: And then, for step 2, you need to tell us your conditions.

83
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.689
Participant: And step 3, you need a mental health statement from your doctor.

84
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.260
Participant: or a physician.

85
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:37.839
Participant: And step 4 is your supporting evidence as your buddy statement, or… Your doctor's notes.

86
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:44.070
Participant: Step 5 would be… any additional information about your conditions?

87
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:49.570
Participant: And step 6, you review your final form and submit.

88
00:08:52.630 --> 00:09:00.340
Moderator: Alright, so once you're ready, you can go ahead and kind of go through the bottom of the page and tap continue.

89
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:11.799
Moderator: Alright, so for, this page, I won't ask you any questions, but you can kind of just skim through it, and then once you're ready, click continue.

90
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:39.620
Moderator: Alright, so same here. I won't necessarily ask you any questions about this page, but you can kind of read through the content of the page, and then at the very bottom, when you're adding your conditions, you can go ahead and kind of tap the box, and it'll populate automatically.

91
00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:54.990
Participant: It's safe.

92
00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.099
Moderator: Yes, you can tap save.

93
00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.600
Moderator: And then tap continue.

94
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:12.820
Moderator: And at any point, feel free to kind of… even though I may not ask any questions, if there's anything that comes to mind as, like, something you notice, or a recommendation you have, always feel free to say those.

95
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:14.440
Participant: Okay.

96
00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:26.809
Moderator: All right, so here, actually, I would love for you to kind of talk through what you're seeing on this page, and to not click on anything yet, since I'll have a couple of questions for you about this page.

97
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.060
Participant: Okay.

98
00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:34.480
Participant: It starts with the condition that was saved, and it's asking you what caused your condition.

99
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.260
Participant: And then it gives… Three different options.

100
00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:46.440
Participant: My condition was caused by an injury or exposure during my military service. It existed before I served.

101
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:51.720
Participant: And it got worse because of my service, and the condition was caused by an injury.

102
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.970
Participant: And then under that, it asks for a brief description of what caused your condition.

103
00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.290
Participant: For example, as gunshots, or… Wow, machinery.

104
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:14.190
Moderator: So, if I were to ask you what step are you on right now, how would you answer?

105
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.560
Participant: I would go to the select a step.

106
00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:25.739
Participant: drop down, and it would highlight, or it would make the step on that I'm… the step that I'm on bold.

107
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.889
Moderator: That was gonna be kind of my follow-up question, like, how do you know that, what step you're on right now?

108
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.259
Participant: And then also, I'm noticing as you go through the steps.

109
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.889
Participant: The ones that have not been touched yet are still black.

110
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.129
Participant: And the other ones are blue.

111
00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:53.419
Moderator: You're getting ahead of my questions, because that would be the next thing. No, this, that's perfect. Makes my job easier. I was about to ask, kind of, what steps, have you finished?

112
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.279
Participant: Finished step one, and currently on step 2.

113
00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.109
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know which steps you've finished?

114
00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.560
Participant: It changes the colors.

115
00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:19.869
Moderator: Okay, and actually, just to kind of follow up again on, knowing what step you're on right now, is there anything that lets you know what step you're on right now in the, kind of, accordion? The selective step that you just opened?

116
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:26.850
Participant: There is also a blue bar.

117
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.689
Participant: Besides Step 2?

118
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:31.930
Moderator: Alright.

119
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:37.650
Moderator: And, also for note-taking purposes, what steps do you still need to do?

120
00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.499
Participant: Step 3, 4, 5, and 6.

121
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.970
Moderator: And how do you know that those are the steps that you still need to do?

122
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.060
Participant: Because… they are not blue.

123
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.890
Moderator: X.

124
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:55.990
Moderator: Alright, so let's say that you wanted to kind of skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

125
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.999
Participant: I would hit the Select a Step drop-down and click on Step 6.

126
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.660
Moderator: Okay, and if you were to try to do that right now, kind of what happens?

127
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.809
Participant: So, try to do it?

128
00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:08.760
Moderator: Yes.

129
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.320
Participant: Alright.

130
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:11.409
Participant: Nothing.

131
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.689
Moderator: And why do you think nothing is happening there?

132
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:18.049
Participant: Because this is a test.

133
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.140
Participant: A test website.

134
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.250
Moderator: Hmm.

135
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.759
Participant: And nothing is expected to happen.

136
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:27.370
Moderator: Got it.

137
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:35.230
Moderator: And so, let's say for, especially since you can't kind of move forward,

138
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:40.020
Moderator: Is there any reason why those steps, like, would not be available for you?

139
00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:43.909
Participant: More than likely because they have not the…

140
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:49.390
Participant: previous steps have not been completed, so I don't have access to those steps yet.

141
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.669
Participant: Until I go through all of them, and then I can go back and review.

142
00:13:55.390 --> 00:14:09.750
Moderator: All right. Okay, so when you're ready, you can go ahead and scroll down to select the radio button that says, my condition was caused by an injury or exposure. It's that first, option there.

143
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:15.040
Moderator: Perfect, and then go ahead and click continue.

144
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:26.279
Moderator: So here, I won't ask you any questions about this page, but just kind of skim through, and then, once you're ready, you can select the radio button that says no.

145
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:27.780
Participant: Okay.

146
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:34.330
Moderator: Alright, go ahead and click continue.

147
00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:46.089
Moderator: All right, and so on this page, we're gonna have a few questions here. So, once again, just tell me kind of what you're seeing on this page, and don't click on anything yet.

148
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:50.690
Participant: This is asking for supporting evidence as to why you have tinnitus.

149
00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.349
Participant: And it gives you the different types of forms you can submit.

150
00:14:55.750 --> 00:15:00.170
Participant: You can submit records from providers, like your doctors.

151
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:05.059
Participant: Official incident reports from the military, or buddy statements.

152
00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:24.480
Moderator: And so, let's say that you've gotten to this point in the form, and you realize that you might have entered an old email address, and you wanted to double-check and maybe see if you had to update it. What would you do from here? Kind of talk me through your process.

153
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.900
Moderator: I haven't done anything yet, sorry.

154
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:33.080
Participant: Okay. I would scroll up and go to select a step, and click… Step one, I believe.

155
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.380
Moderator: Okay.

156
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.599
Moderator: And so, you mentioned… you can actually go ahead and kind of click the select a step.

157
00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:46.690
Moderator: You mentioned, going to where to be able to check your email?

158
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.930
Participant: Step one to change veteran details.

159
00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:55.320
Moderator: Okay, and what would you expect to happen after selecting Step 1 Veteran Details?

160
00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:01.380
Participant: Hopefully, being that I've gone through that step already, it would take me back to that step.

161
00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:03.790
Moderator: Right?

162
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:12.580
Moderator: All right, so, you can actually then go ahead and do so. Feel free to click on Step 1, Veteran Details. All right.

163
00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.280
Participant: It worked.

164
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:23.219
Moderator: So, without clicking on anything, you've landed on this page. What are your first thoughts on being able to update your email address as you scroll down?

165
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.190
Participant: Huh, it's not there.

166
00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.950
Participant: So, is it on the second page?

167
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.160
Participant: Second step?

168
00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.089
Moderator: Actually, that's exactly what you can go ahead and do.

169
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:41.040
Participant: Okay.

170
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.810
Participant: Oh, second step doesn't work.

171
00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.770
Moderator: Okay.

172
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:56.010
Moderator: And so then, for the purposes of this prototype, I'll actually have you scroll down and click continue.

173
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:56.820
Participant: Okay.

174
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.479
Participant: Oh, there it is.

175
00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:10.109
Participant: Okay, so step… One is two pages.

176
00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.440
Participant: Okay.

177
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:18.319
Moderator: Tell me a little bit about the, kind of, the experience of step one being two pages, in this case.

178
00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:21.900
Participant: A little confusing.

179
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:31.540
Participant: I would ex… Yeah, I would have expected it all to be on the same page.

180
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.599
Moderator: Is there anything about…

181
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:49.030
Moderator: Kind of either the… how it's written, or just your, opinion of why you would think everything would be on a single page.

182
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.320
Moderator: In terms of your phone, email, your, full legal name.

183
00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.439
Moderator: What would make you think that that would be all in one page?

184
00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:02.949
Participant: I don't know, I feel like it'd just be…

185
00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:10.450
Participant: One quick step that could be filled… that could be knocked out at the same time, as far as it being…

186
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.480
Participant: Contact information and with veterans' details.

187
00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.860
Moderator: That makes sense.

188
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:31.719
Moderator: Alright, so, for kind of following the hypothetical scenario that we were just mentioning, you can kind of scroll down and click on edit there in the phone and email section.

189
00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:37.880
Moderator: And it'll automatically kind of change once you tap on the email address, box.

190
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.680
Moderator: And then you can tap save.

191
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:49.790
Moderator: Alright, and so let's say that, now you…

192
00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:56.069
Moderator: would like to kind of return to the part of the forum that you were previously on. What would you do?

193
00:18:56.530 --> 00:19:02.760
Participant: I would go back up to… also, something else that's weird is that the select the Step box stays open.

194
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:09.759
Moderator: Yeah, I just realized that, too, as you were going down, I think that might be an error on our end.

195
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.470
Participant: Okay.

196
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:17.420
Participant: But if I wanted to go back to the step I was on, I would click on Step 4, Supporting Evidence.

197
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:23.430
Moderator: And what makes you kind of know or think that that was, where you were?

198
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.360
Participant: Because that is the last one that is blue.

199
00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.020
Participant: And I have step 5 and Step 6 left.

200
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:38.509
Moderator: Alright, then you could go ahead and do that, so please tap on Step 4.

201
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:48.230
Moderator: Alright, and so here, I won't ask you any additional questions, so, once you're ready, you can tap the no option and then tap continue.

202
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:53.829
Participant: I did notice that when I went to the current page, the select… the drop-down went away.

203
00:19:54.350 --> 00:20:07.919
Moderator: Yeah, I think it might be something where if it's left open, it, like, stays open, which that… that might be an error, like, a bug on our end, because it's supposed to kind of close back up again. Okay. Good point.

204
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:26.149
Moderator: Actually, since you mentioned that, is there anything that, is… let's say, if it stayed open, would that be kind of more helpful, or is it distracting? Kind of what would be your reaction there, since you experienced, kind of, it staying open, even when you didn't want it to?

205
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:28.220
Participant: It's a little distracting for me.

206
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:37.069
Moderator: Okay, good to know. So once you're ready, you can go ahead and click continue.

207
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:45.619
Moderator: Same here, I won't ask you any questions, but just feel free to kind of skim through and then tap continue.

208
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:57.330
Moderator: All right, so we're gonna kind of focus on this page a little bit. Just take a minute to kind of talk me through what you're seeing on this page, and then I'll ask you some questions.

209
00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:04.040
Participant: I see this is a review and submit page where it has each drop-down.

210
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.159
Participant: For each step that we just did.

211
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:10.849
Participant: Actually, was there 6 steps?

212
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:12.380
Participant: Or 5.

213
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.970
Participant: Okay, so there's 6 steps right here.

214
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:20.799
Participant: And I only see 5 drop-downs.

215
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:28.790
Participant: Weird. Well, I guess because the review and submit drop-down isn't right there. Okay.

216
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:38.999
Participant: Yeah, it's every step we did, and each drop-down is all the information that was typed in.

217
00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.390
Participant: Before you hit the submit button.

218
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:47.869
Participant: But I don't… none of this can be changed right here, it's just for final review.

219
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:59.240
Moderator: Right, interesting. You told us actually a couple things that I want to dig into there. So you mentioned first, kind of a… it seemed that there was…

220
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.839
Moderator: some… a difference between how many steps are in that select a step and how many, kind of, accordions you see here.

221
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:21.829
Moderator: Is there anything that you think would be, more helpful or less confusing when it comes to seeing, kind of, 6 steps in the accordion, but then only seeing 5, kind of, drop-downs here?

222
00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:32.660
Participant: No, it kind of caught me off guard, but after looking at it and realizing that this is the last step page that I'm on, I can see why it wouldn't be on there.

223
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:42.489
Moderator: And then, you just mentioned also, kind of, the fact that this is a review and submit page.

224
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:57.309
Moderator: So I'm actually gonna have you go through, an exercise here. Kind of another hypothetical. Let's say that you wanted to add another condition to kind of this claim. Talk me through how you would do that.

225
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:03.859
Participant: I would go to select a step, and go to Conditions.

226
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:06.650
Participant: You want me to go ahead and click on it?

227
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:19.640
Moderator: Actually, not yet, but I will have you do that in just a second. Could you actually take a minute and go, like, go through the review and submit page as a whole?

228
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.039
Participant: Okay. Expand all?

229
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.799
Moderator: Yep, or each individual one, however one you would kind of typically do.

230
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.860
Participant: Okay.

231
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:33.729
Participant: Alright, so here… You have your veteran's details.

232
00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:41.470
Participant: Which is… So, on here… It's only one part.

233
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:47.140
Participant: But… and the step… Step-by-step, there's two parts.

234
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.060
Moderator: Hmm,

235
00:23:50.620 --> 00:24:02.669
Moderator: And you're alluding to the fact that, here the veteran details, part, that when you actually fill out that section, or that step, it's two pages, but here you're only seeing information from one page, correct?

236
00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.400
Participant: Yeah, from the second page.

237
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.440
Moderator: Okay.

238
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.089
Participant: And the email didn't change.

239
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.169
Moderator: Oh, it actually did, it's just that it's pretty similar. I think we just…

240
00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:15.149
Participant: Oh, I thought it was Gmail.

241
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:25.400
Moderator: Oh, that's actually a great point. No, I think you're totally right. Wait, now that I think about it, you're totally right. Okay, that's definitely something for us to note.

242
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:33.650
Moderator: on our end to double check. So, actually, thanks. See? Even though we've been doing a couple of these, I think you're the first to realize that

243
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.630
Moderator: incorrect. Okay.

244
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:37.780
Participant: Okay.

245
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:47.769
Moderator: So, kind of as you're seeing these parts, what are you kind of seeing here that's available?

246
00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.359
Participant: Pretty much everything that was filled out in this step-by-step.

247
00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.300
Participant: scenario.

248
00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:02.300
Participant: It all seems to be correct, except for the email.

249
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:10.769
Participant: But yeah, it's just the review of everything that was done to make sure everything is correct.

250
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:31.379
Moderator: Right. So, kind of following that hypothetical again, and you can choose kind of the first answer that you mentioned, which is, in the scenario that you needed to add another condition, go ahead and kind of click through how you would do that.

251
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.340
Participant: Okay.

252
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:44.209
Moderator: Alright, and so now we're on the conditions page. You can go ahead and tap Add Another Condition.

253
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.940
Participant: Okay.

254
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.879
Moderator: And here, similar to how you did before with tinnitus, you can just tap on the box.

255
00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.909
Moderator: And it'll show us ankle replacement, perfect. And then tap save.

256
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.910
Moderator: And then tap continue.

257
00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:15.100
Moderator: Right here, similarly, you can select the radio button, the first one there that says my condition was caused by an injury or exposure.

258
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.480
Moderator: Perfect.

259
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:21.220
Participant: Something else that's, grabbing my attention when…

260
00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:29.940
Participant: Whenever I click on… well, it… yeah, whenever I click on something, it automatically repopulates a new page.

261
00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.260
Moderator: Can you tell me a little bit about that?

262
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:41.279
Participant: So, when I clicked on the… my condition was caused by an injury, it refreshed to a new page.

263
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.990
Participant: And it went straight back up to the top, and then I have to re-scroll all the way back down.

264
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.850
Moderator: Got it.

265
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.020
Participant: It won't just highlight it and stay where it is.

266
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:57.950
Moderator: I see what you mean, yes. So that it, like, kind of forces… it scrolls all the way to the top, and you have to kind of constantly scroll down back to…

267
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:58.420
Participant: Yes.

268
00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.520
Moderator: Got it.

269
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.929
Moderator: That definitely makes sense. Yeah, that's definitely kind of a loading…

270
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.870
Moderator: Situation, so that's actually good to know.

271
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:08.910
Participant: Okay.

272
00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:24.400
Moderator: Alright, so, we're actually going to focus on this page for a second. You know, now that you've added the second condition, let's say that you, similar to before, wanted to, like, return to the review and submit page. Can you tell me what you would do next from here?

273
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:34.340
Participant: Being that this automatically saves, I could just select… hit select a step for the drop-down.

274
00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.320
Participant: And go back to the review and submit page.

275
00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.329
Moderator: Well, that's perfect, let's actually do exactly that.

276
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.960
Participant: Okay.

277
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:49.919
Moderator: Alright, and so here you can kind of go ahead and review your responses again.

278
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.539
Participant: So the email did change to Gmail.

279
00:27:55.250 --> 00:28:01.079
Moderator: Yeah, that… that one was… that one's an error from our end, but I'm glad that you caught that.

280
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:05.169
Participant: And the ankle replacement is on there.

281
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:07.439
Participant: So that did update.

282
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:20.130
Moderator: And since you mentioned that it did kind of save that ankle replacement condition, how confident do you feel that your responses, especially the ones that you edited, were saved?

283
00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.639
Participant: I feel very confident now.

284
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.520
Moderator: And how come?

285
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.300
Participant: Well, the email did fix itself, and the ankle replacement also saved.

286
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:35.669
Participant: And it's showing in the review and submit.

287
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:51.499
Moderator: Perfect. So you can go ahead and, once you're ready, sign your name at the bottom and click submit, and I'll ask you then a couple of questions about how this kind of experience was like.

288
00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:52.260
Participant: Okay.

289
00:28:53.910 --> 00:29:04.679
Moderator: Alright, so don't click on anything yet. I have a few questions about, kind of, this, last, or this first kind of concept that you were just testing.

290
00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:10.239
Moderator: So what would you say are your overall impressions of navigating the form?

291
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.370
Participant: The impressions were good.

292
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:22.059
Participant: The small bugs, they weren't too… they weren't too bad, just as far as the, like, the page refreshing back to the top.

293
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.619
Participant: Yeah, everything else was good.

294
00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:32.250
Participant: I like how you can't move forward until you complete What you're on.

295
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:36.149
Participant: You can't get ahead of yourself, you can't skip anything.

296
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:40.529
Moderator: I'd love to hear what… what makes you say that you like that?

297
00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.379
Participant: It keeps you… it keeps you in order.

298
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:51.129
Participant: You can't rush it, you really can't have any excuse for missing anything, because…

299
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.500
Participant: If you don't have everything you have, then you can't move forward.

300
00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:06.600
Moderator: And then any impressions on, especially the parts of, kind of, going back and forth between different parts of the form? How was that experience?

301
00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:13.390
Participant: It's very easy. I would prefer that other than having to hit a back button all the time.

302
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:29.660
Moderator: You actually hit the nail on the head of kind of exactly why we've, why we've created this navigation, because we definitely know that, especially for a long form, it can be pretty tedious to hit a back button a lot, so I'm grateful.

303
00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.210
Participant: Definitely.

304
00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:31.989
Moderator: that out.

305
00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:40.679
Moderator: Was there anything that was confusing or challenging about how that, like, select-the-step navigation worked?

306
00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:44.010
Participant: Nothing was confusing at all, it was perfect.

307
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:53.559
Moderator: Alright, so now I'm going to ask you a couple of, scaled questions, so it'll be on a scale of 1 to 4, 1 being the least, 4 being the most.

308
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.330
Moderator: So, for the fir- and I'll have, like, 5 of those, yep.

309
00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:08.469
Moderator: Alright, so how helpful would you say was the navigation menu in helping you complete the tasks? One being not helpful at all, to four being very helpful.

310
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:09.430
Participant: War.

311
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:21.269
Moderator: Okay? Similarly, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you had completed, one being not effective, for being very effective?

312
00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.250
Participant: Or.

313
00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:29.240
Moderator: Similarly, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you were on?

314
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.670
Participant: 4.

315
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:38.579
Moderator: Alright, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you still needed to complete?

316
00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:39.590
Participant: Or.

317
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:47.839
Moderator: Alright, and last one. How effective was the navigation menu at helping you to go back and change your answers on the form?

318
00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:48.700
Participant: 4.

319
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:51.020
Moderator: Alright.

320
00:31:51.260 --> 00:32:01.079
Moderator: So, once you're ready, you can actually go ahead and click on a top where it says continue to the next prototype. We're now gonna look at a different version.

321
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:13.359
Moderator: Okay, once it loads, you'll see that it looks kind of pretty similar to the version that you tested before in terms of the page itself.

322
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:21.629
Moderator: So just take a few seconds, again, to just, like, skim through. I won't ask you any questions about this page, so then you can go ahead and tap continue.

323
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:22.440
Participant: Okay.

324
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.800
Participant: Continue to do this one, too.

325
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.400
Moderator: Sorry, could you repeat that again?

326
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.939
Participant: Do I continue through the second, step, too?

327
00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:48.209
Moderator: Oh, you can click continue at the bottom, yes.

328
00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:48.780
Participant: Okay.

329
00:32:52.920 --> 00:33:02.059
Moderator: Alright, so now I'm gonna ask you to pause here. So, again, kind of take a few seconds to skim this page, and then I'm gonna ask you a couple questions.

330
00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.860
Participant: Okay.

331
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:23.679
Moderator: Right? So, let's say if you wanted to move to another part of the form, what would you do?

332
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.079
Participant: Go to select a step.

333
00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.340
Moderator: Okay, feel free to tap on that.

334
00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.900
Moderator: Alright, so what are your overall impressions of this navigation design?

335
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:40.689
Participant: It tells you… More detailed, tells you…

336
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:44.699
Participant: When you've completed the first step, and the step two is still in progress.

337
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:57.459
Moderator: Is there anything about this, version that's, you know, different to the previous one? You mentioned the kind of status there, is there anything else?

338
00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:04.070
Participant: Instead of the words… well, the words that are underlined.

339
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.629
Participant: It's still highlighted in blue.

340
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:14.940
Participant: Instead of just that line, it has… dot.

341
00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:17.050
Participant: I guess the period, the dot?

342
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:18.410
Moderator: Beside of it?

343
00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.330
Participant: Showing completion.

344
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.840
Participant: Filled in blue.

345
00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.829
Participant: This one is actually better than the first one.

346
00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:27.729
Moderator: Wonderful.

347
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:31.510
Participant: As far as showing progress being made, it actually lets you know.

348
00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:37.169
Moderator: And what would you say is kind of better about this one?

349
00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.879
Participant: That it shows that Step 1 is complete.

350
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:45.099
Moderator: So that language of, like, having the actual word complete on there?

351
00:34:45.290 --> 00:34:45.960
Participant: Yes.

352
00:34:47.999 --> 00:34:56.089
Moderator: Right, so, similar to before, I'm gonna ask you kind of a couple of questions. So, what step are you on right now?

353
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.139
Participant: Right now, I'm on step 2.

354
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:01.150
Moderator: And how do you know that you're on step 2?

355
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:05.340
Participant: Because it says under it that it's in progress.

356
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.200
Moderator: Okay.

357
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.939
Moderator: And what steps have you done?

358
00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:11.750
Participant: Step 1.

359
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:15.480
Moderator: And similarly, how do you know that you've done step one?

360
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.269
Participant: It tells you it's complete.

361
00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:18.939
Participant: Under Step 1.

362
00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:29.540
Moderator: And similar to the previous design, let's say that you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

363
00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:36.410
Participant: You would clip step 6 for review and submit.

364
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:38.380
Moderator: Nope.

365
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:44.200
Moderator: And so, if you were to do that now, what is happening, and why do you think that that's happening?

366
00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:50.849
Participant: Nothing's happening because… You have not completed Step 2, 3, 4, and 5.

367
00:35:52.440 --> 00:36:01.149
Moderator: Is there anything that lets you know or helps you understand that, as you just said, steps 3, 4, and 5 are kind of not available yet?

368
00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:07.639
Participant: They're not in progress, nor are they highlighted in black or blue.

369
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.620
Participant: Or bold.

370
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.130
Moderator: Alright.

371
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:26.080
Moderator: All right, so you can then go ahead and close the navigation, and I'm gonna have you go ahead and do the same as before. Scroll down and kind of tap that enter your condition box, and tinnitus will automatically

372
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.160
Moderator: Populate, alright, and tap save.

373
00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.209
Participant: This one refreshes back up to the top as well.

374
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:40.370
Moderator: Yeah, it's one of those things where, since we're mimicking how the form

375
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:56.630
Moderator: actually works, that's how it's set up right now, and so that's one of those things. But we've noted that that's… that that could maybe be something that, we can work on. Is there, I guess, a different experience that you would want to have instead of it, like, scrolling all the way to the top?

376
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.199
Participant: Yeah, just for it to pretty much stay where it is.

377
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.319
Moderator: And by stay where it is, actually, if you go ahead and tap continue, can you, like, show me what you mean?

378
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:15.309
Participant: So, alright, which bubble am I hitting on this page? The first one?

379
00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:16.640
Moderator: The first one, yep.

380
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:21.600
Participant: So, when I go to hit this one, instead of it just… Oh, or it stayed there.

381
00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:26.870
Moderator: Oh, this one did, interesting. Okay, yeah, that might be also, like, a demo.

382
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.160
Participant: Okay.

383
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.679
Participant: Alright, well, I won't speak on that anymore.

384
00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:46.359
Moderator: No, actually, that's a great point, like, so, let me clarify. For… let's say when you then, tap continue, that it does kind of load back up to the top, for the next page. Is that okay?

385
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.050
Participant: Yeah, yeah, that's expected, because I'm finished with this one.

386
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:58.420
Moderator: Okay, got it. So it's when you, or when you make a change or select something on the same page, the fact that it scrolls all the way to the top is not.

387
00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:01.509
Participant: Yeah, yeah, and I'm not done with the page.

388
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:09.899
Moderator: Got it. Okay, now that makes a lot of sense. As in, it did before, but now we've kind of better understood the issue here.

389
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.530
Participant: Okay.

390
00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:11.970
Participant: Say, continue.

391
00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:12.890
Moderator: Yes.

392
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:13.460
Participant: Okay.

393
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:26.290
Moderator: Alright, and then, so same here, you can just go ahead and tap that, no, I don't want to add this form to my claim, and then tap continue.

394
00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:38.870
Moderator: And so, we're gonna pause here for a second. Similar to before, I'm gonna ask you a couple questions. The first being, what step are you on right now?

395
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.740
Participant: Step 4.

396
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:47.010
Moderator: And how do you know that you're on step 4?

397
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:53.990
Participant: Hit the drop-down for selected step, and… it shows that Step 4 is in progress.

398
00:38:56.210 --> 00:39:03.690
Participant: Also, something small that I noticed. When you hit select a step, the arrow stays pointing up instead of pointing down.

399
00:39:06.240 --> 00:39:07.899
Moderator: Is there anything you would want?

400
00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:10.190
Participant: Oh, it's reversed, never mind.

401
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:11.839
Participant: I get it.

402
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.269
Participant: Oh, my God.

403
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:14.490
Moderator: All good.

404
00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.830
Participant: Yeah, never mind. Disregard.

405
00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.120
Moderator: Okay.

406
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:23.440
Moderator: Actually, on the note of,

407
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:35.889
Moderator: you were, you know, the question of what step are you on? Let's say that you had not kind of clicked on the select a step, those collapsed. How would you answer, like, what step you were on?

408
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.150
Participant: I wouldn't know.

409
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:48.639
Participant: It doesn't tell you which step you're on, on the selected step until you click it down.

410
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:57.369
Participant: So maybe… Instead of having selective step right there, I actually have which step you're on?

411
00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:05.910
Moderator: Hmm, like, actually have the… the term, like, step 4 supporting events, is that what you mean?

412
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:06.680
Participant: Yeah.

413
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:07.560
Moderator: Okay.

414
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:14.430
Moderator: Duly noted. That's actually something that we've been kind of debating, so that's great to note.

415
00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:21.039
Moderator: Alright, so similar to before, what steps have you done thus far?

416
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:27.460
Moderator: And you can click on the coordinator to kind of get that insight.

417
00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.400
Participant: I've completed 1, 2, and 3.

418
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.869
Moderator: And, same as before, how do you know that you've completed 1, 2, and 3?

419
00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.410
Participant: Under… under each step, it says complete.

420
00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.530
Moderator: Okay, and what steps do you still need to do?

421
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.110
Participant: I need to do… step 4 is in progress, and I need to do step 5 and 6.

422
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:54.300
Moderator: And similarly, how do you know that you still need to do 4, 5, and 6?

423
00:40:54.600 --> 00:41:00.860
Participant: Under Step 4, it says in progress, and 5 and 6 are not highlighted at all.

424
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.340
Moderator: Right.

425
00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:09.789
Moderator: You can then go ahead and scroll down and select No, and then tap Continue.

426
00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:20.059
Moderator: And then here, I won't ask you any questions, so you can feel free to scroll down and tap continue.

427
00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:25.390
Moderator: And now we're gonna focus on this page.

428
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:39.729
Moderator: So, you don't have to go through the full exercise, this is just kind of the hypothetical, for right now, so just kind of talk me through it, but let's say that you wanted to add another condition. Without clicking on anything, how would you do that?

429
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.940
Participant: I would go to Select a step.

430
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.910
Moderator: And…

431
00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:48.150
Participant: then go to the step that has… that is labeled Conditions.

432
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.930
Moderator: Alright.

433
00:41:51.360 --> 00:42:08.000
Moderator: And then here you… similar to before… oh, actually, no, we can skip this part, because we already addressed it. Sorry, I'm making sure I'm checking my notes here. Alright, so if you… actually, you can go ahead and tap on select a step to… to have that open there.

434
00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:14.140
Moderator: So now I'm gonna ask you kind of just some overall questions, similar to before.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:19.720
Moderator: What would you say are your impressions of this version in comparison to the previous one you tested?

436
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:27.810
Participant: This version gives better details on what steps have been completed, need to be completed, and are in progress.

437
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:30.050
Moderator: Nope.

438
00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:34.530
Moderator: Is there anything that's confusing or unexpected about how this one works?

439
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:37.049
Participant: Nothing at all.

440
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:51.330
Moderator: And is there anything that you would change or add? And definitely feel free to give any recommendations. We want to make sure that any design that we create is kind of the best that it can be.

441
00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.340
Participant: I would just change the selected step to where it tells you which step you're on.

442
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.409
Moderator: That's… that's the only thing.

443
00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.060
Participant: That I would change about this.

444
00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:17.150
Moderator: Okay, perfect. And so, to kind of round out here, I'm gonna also ask you a couple of scaled questions. So, same as before, one being on the low end, or the lowest, and four being the highest.

445
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:22.719
Moderator: So, how helpful was this navigation menu in helping you complete the tasks?

446
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.740
Participant: Fort.

447
00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:25.480
Moderator: Hmm.

448
00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:32.890
Moderator: How effective was this navigation menu at helping you know which steps, you had completed?

449
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.050
Participant: War.

450
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:40.069
Moderator: How effective is this navigation menu at helping you know which step you are on?

451
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:41.140
Participant: Or…

452
00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:49.009
Moderator: How effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you still needed to complete?

453
00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:49.860
Participant: War.

454
00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:58.240
Moderator: And how do you effective do you think this navigation menu would be at helping you to go back and change your answers on the form?

455
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:10.660
Moderator: All right, before we close out, since, I know you had also answered four for the previous version, what… do you think that both of them are…

456
00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:19.079
Moderator: A 4, kind of, on all of those questions, or would, kind of, anything change, in terms of your preference between the two versions?

457
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:28.270
Participant: They're… they're both fours, but as far as the selective step, but the second one go… does go into further detail and is more…

458
00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:29.970
Participant: more accurate.

459
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:35.360
Participant: Not more accurate, but it just makes it easier… easier to see where you are.

460
00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:46.769
Moderator: And so, they're both, they both kind of do the job well, but this version, has more information that's relevant to you.

461
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.630
Participant: Yes.

462
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.580
Moderator: Right.

463
00:44:49.890 --> 00:45:04.479
Moderator: Alright, well, before we kind of close out here, I'll actually open it up to, our note-takers and observers, if there's any questions that you all had before we finish today's session.

464
00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:08.940
Notetaker: No questions from me, thank you so much.

465

Participant: You're welcome.

466
00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:18.840
Observer: No questions from me, but I really enjoyed hearing, in your own words, the cues that you were using and your insights, so thank you.

467
00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.310

468
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.920

470
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:40.230
Moderator: All right, well, we have actually finished a little early today, which is great. So, before we kind of close out, I'd like to just kind of reconfirm that you're okay with us having recorded today's conversation.

471
00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:41.210

472
00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:57.530

473
00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:12.639
Moderator: Just a last-minute note is that Paridian will be sending you a thank you note, and then even a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know, to give them a chance to participate in other future research studies.

474
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:14.440
Participant: Okay, cool.

475
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.539
