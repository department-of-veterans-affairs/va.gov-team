<h1>Participant 9 Side Navigation - 12/12/2025 (Desktop)</h1>


1
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.279
Moderator: All right, so asking once again, are you comfortable with us recording your screen and audio for today's session?

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.010
Participant 9: Yes.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.900
Moderator: Perfect.

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:20.360
Moderator: All right, so we have a few warm-up questions, and then we're gonna go ahead and take a look at that demo prototype that we just mentioned.

5
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.459
Moderator: So, this is the part where…

6
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:42.539
Moderator: as we were kind of joking earlier, the only times I will ask you kind of about recollection or memory are here in the warm-up questions. So, can you tell me a little bit about the experience that you had when you last filed for the disability benefits form, or when you applied for disability benefits?

7
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.930
Participant 9: Last time I filed, I got help from another… from a VSO.

8
00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:04.410
Moderator: Do you remember what that experience was like, in terms of how did they assist you? Do you remember if there were any kind of challenges in completing the form?

9
00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.679
Participant 9: No, she…

10
00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:16.149
Participant 9: There were no challenges in completing the form per se, as much as getting information from third parties.

11
00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:17.709
Participant 9: Bum…

12
00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:27.269
Participant 9: she's been doing it for, I don't know, well over 10 years, so she really knows what she's doing. So, it didn't take her very long at all.

13
00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:36.029
Participant 9: So, we… and she knew me from having completed another form, so a lot of the information…

14
00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.209
Participant 9: From the software that she was using, it kind of auto-populated, and…

15
00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.359
Participant 9: Made some of it go quicker, so that was kind of nice.

16
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:56.340
Moderator: And then you had mentioned that, you had probably filed for disability benefits online, like, on VA.gov. Do you remember what that experience was like?

17
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.779
Moderator: If not, it's totally okay, with no problem.

18
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.620
Participant 9: I only remember filing… honestly, I only remember filing…

19
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.650
Participant 9: The intent to file online, not the full-blown-out claim.

20
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.199
Moderator: Got it. Okay, that makes total sense.

21
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:30.130
Moderator: Alright, then I think we can go ahead and then get started. So, I'm going to ask… are you familiar with screen sharing on Zoom?

22
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.410
Participant 9: I'm familiar with the concept. How about that?

23
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:49.059
Moderator: All good. Okay, so I'm going to send you a link in the chat, and then, I'm going to ask you to share your screen, so that we can be able to see…

24
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.330
Moderator: what, you're opening now. So, you'll see that in the chat, I just sent the link.

25
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:05.070
Moderator: And then when you're ready, you can go ahead and start sharing your screen so that we can be able to see the link that I just sent.

26
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.819
Moderator: And let me know if you need any help, with screen sharing, I can kind of walk you through.

27
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.510
Participant 9: What I need help with is taking my Mac out of dark mode.

28
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:28.809
Participant 9: Because the room I'm in only has one window, and the light is on… you know, I had… I did the things, but it's still… it's kind of dark in here, and then with dark mode, it makes it darker, and…

29
00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:40.160
Moderator: And at least from our end, however you use your Mac normally is more than fine. Like, if it is in dark mode and you prefer it that way, that's not a problem.

30
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.069
Participant 9: Am I clicking submit on the sign-in thing?

31
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.830
Moderator: Oh, no, so, okay, have you opened the link already, it seems?

32
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.020
Participant 9: Yes.

33
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.790
Participant 9: I did. Click the link.

34
00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:08.969
Moderator: So, now what I need you to do is, going back into Zoom, I need you to share your screen, and so there's gonna be a button at the very bottom that's, like, a green arrow, that says share.

35
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.720
Participant 9: Oh, there you are. Sorry, it's…

36
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.749
Participant 9: The problem with it being dark is that I can't see things.

37
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.569
Participant 9: Okay, anyway, the green arrow, I'll click share.

38
00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:30.009
Moderator: Yep, once you click on share, then select the window that shows that VA, kind of, sign-in,

39
00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.959
Moderator: Screen that you were just referencing.

40
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.850
Participant 9: I don't know which one of the options is the thing.

41
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:49.550
Moderator: Do you know what browser the link opened into? Like, maybe a Google Chrome, or a Microsoft Edge?

42
00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.920
Moderator: Safari…

43
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.510
Participant 9: No, I don't.

44
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.890
Moderator: All good, no worries.

45
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.399
Participant 9: I was like.

46
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.550
Moderator: So…

47
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.709
Participant 9: It said entire screen, so I'm just gonna click that. Is that okay?

48
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:20.869
Moderator: that's more than fine. There, it's just more of kind of what you're comfortable with, sharing. We really only just need to see you testing our prototype, so if sharing the entire screen is kind of the easiest way, that's perfectly fine.

49
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.110
Participant 9: Yeah, because I don't know, I'm either in Safari or DuckDuckGo. I don't know.

50
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.439
Moderator: Oh, and now it's saying I have to allow access. Oh my gosh.

51
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.819
Moderator: Okay, I see what it is. Yeah, sometimes you have.

52
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.850
Participant 9: Here we go.

53
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.649
Moderator: Make sure you have your settings, so that it… we can be able to share… see your screen.

54
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.229
Moderator: Is it able to guide you to how to change that setting?

55
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.930
Participant 9: Yes, and that wants my stupid password.

56
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.110
Moderator: I see. Okay, no worries, take your time.

57
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.270
Participant 9: Like, well, you're driving me nuts.

58
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:02.829
Participant 9: I may?

59
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.820
Participant 9: Can I just… Oh.

60
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.950
Participant 9: I'm like, I don't know what to do.

61
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.990
Participant 9: Okay, so…

62
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.100
Moderator: What are you seeing on your screen right now?

63
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.509
Participant 9: The login thing. We're gonna go back, we're gonna try this again.

64
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.340
Participant 9: We're gonna hope that it's in Safari.

65
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:01.469
Moderator: I can also walk you through how to make sure that you're screen sharing the right thing, if that's helpful.

66
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:14.219
Participant 9: It says I might need to quit.

67
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.149
Participant 9: and reopen Zoom.

68
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:33.089
Moderator: Okay, that's not a problem. So yes, you'll probably have to go into, like, close out this session, like, leave the Zoom call, make sure that you change your settings so that Zoom is allowed to be able to see your screen, and then you can rejoin.

69
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:41.330
Participant 9: Okay. And on this time, I didn't need to remember the password, because it let me do it on my watch, so that was nice and helpful.

70
00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.020
Participant 9: Alright, I'll be right back.

71
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.310
Moderator: Sounds good.

72
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.519
Participant 9: Okay, can you hear me now?

73
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:09.530
Moderator: Yes.

74
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.320
Participant 9: Okay, that went a lot faster.

75
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:19.739
Moderator: Perfect. Okay, so let's try this again. Do you still have the link open on your browser?

76
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.570
Participant 9: Or do you need me to send it again?

77
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.090
Participant 9: I need you to send it again, because I closed out of it, because I was closing out of things to make this easier.

78
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:34.400
Moderator: Eva. No, that is perfectly fine. Yeah, we've gone through that exact issue ourselves, so it is not a problem.

79
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.990
Participant 9: Yes.

80
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:40.060
Moderator: link again… And so,

81
00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:47.500
Moderator: Once you're ready, if you could then share your screen, and let me know again if you need me to walk you through that.

82
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:13.889
Participant 9: Okay, now I can't find you at all.

83
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.299
Moderator: What are you seeing on your screen right now?

84
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:25.920
Participant 9: Well, I have my Gmail, and I have… it says, join from Zoom Workplace, and…

85
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.180
Moderator: Do you remember?

86
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:35.869
Participant 9: post-attendee Zoom, and then there's, like, it just says… there's just this big white screen that says Zoom in the middle.

87
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:44.230
Moderator: Okay, so do you know if you have Zoom installed in your computer, or did you join via a web browser?

88
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.649
Participant 9: I think I joined from a web browser, but I'm not sure.

89
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:49.210
Participant 9: Hold on.

90
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.980
Participant 9: Command Tab. There we go.

91
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.149
Participant 9: Thankfully, I know some of the shortcuts.

92
00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.409
Moderator: That's always helpful.

93
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:06.309
Participant 9: See, I made the screen bigger, which was good, but then I… then I lost the ability to see the other things.

94
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:11.879
Moderator: Ugh, trust me, I get it. We… that's why most of us have, like, multiple monitors, because we get lost, too.

95
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:20.819
Moderator: Okay, so if you're back onto the Zoom, you'll see again that share button at the very bottom that's green.

96
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:38.470
Moderator: Once you click on it, you can select to share your entire screen, or a specific window. Make sure that you're selecting, for example, entire screen, like your desktop, make sure that that's highlighted, and then you click the blue share button, at the bottom.

97
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.770
Moderator: Perfect!

98
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.689
Moderator: All right, we are in. We can see… perfect. We are good to go.

99
00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.140
Participant 9: Now I know why this takes an hour.

100
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.170
Moderator: Cheers.

101
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.829
Participant 9: An hour to get the technology straightened out.

102
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:58.299
Moderator: Literally. No, what's funny is that anytime that we plan for any of our sessions.

103
00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:16.630
Moderator: We set up a good amount of time just for, you know, getting the screen share going, because to be honest, that's usually the part that takes the longest, and that is very common, and even from our end, it's something that we always try to kind of make sure that we have instructions to make sure that we're doing it the right way.

104
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:28.159
Moderator: Alright, so now that we're, in the demo, I'm gonna kind of just repeat a couple things, and then we're gonna go ahead and get started.

105
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:41.779
Moderator: So you're seeing right now, something that looks very similar to the VA.gov website that you may be familiar with. Once again, this is a demo version, so none of what you're seeing here is

106
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:58.839
Moderator: real, and the information that will be presented, is also just not from a real person. So, for the remainder of the session, I'd like you to imagine that you're a veteran named Jordan Jackson. So you're seeing here that there's, like, information as if you were Jordan Jackson.

107
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:06.700
Moderator: And I'll be asking you to fill out a shortened version of the disability benefits form, as if you were Jordan Jackson.

108
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:22.739
Moderator: And so, throughout the session, I'll ask you to go through a couple of different screens, and on some pages, you'll be asked to kind of click through so that we can get to the next part, and that'll help us kind of move along. And then there's other parts where I'm going to ask you to just

109
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:29.780
Moderator: Not click on anything, take a look at the page and tell me what you're going… what you're thinking, and what you're… what you would do.

110
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:36.949
Moderator: So for majority of the session today, we really want you to kind of think out loud as you're going through different pages.

111
00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:48.439
Moderator: And then once again, I'm gonna emphasize that, you are the one testing the form. The form is not testing you, so please give us any honest feedback that you have at any point.

112
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.270
Participant 9: Okay.

113
00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:53.309
Moderator: Alright, we can go ahead and get started. So…

114
00:13:53.480 --> 00:14:13.449
Moderator: For this first concept that you'll be testing, we're… we really want to know that we're trying to get your feedback on a new navigation, that we're testing for this form. So, once again, we really want to understand the experience of kind of going back and forth

115
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.130
Moderator: Between different sections of the form.

116
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.539
Moderator: So, once you're ready, you can go ahead and click Submit.

117
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.150
Moderator: As if we're starting… the process.

118
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:39.740
Moderator: All right, so, just taking a moment to kind of pause. As you see this page, can you kind of tell us out loud what you're seeing, what stands out to you?

119
00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:45.229
Participant 9: So there's a menu on top, and then… off?

120
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.550
Participant 9: To the left is,

121
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.489
Participant 9: The different steps that you need to complete in order to fill out the form.

122
00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:05.650
Participant 9: And then, kind of like the main part of it, it says file for disability compensation. It tells me the name of the form, and then details about me, Jordan Jackson.

123
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:11.390
Participant 9: I have aged several years since I got up this morning, apparently.

124
00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:21.869
Moderator: So, let's say in the hypothetical that you wanted to move to another part of this application, what would you do?

125
00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:28.770
Participant 9: I would go to the menu on the left, like, maybe they needed supporting evidence.

126
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.960
Moderator: Okay.

127
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.489
Participant 9: So then I would click on Supporting Evidence.

128
00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.789
Moderator: And what happens when you tried to do that?

129
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.270
Participant 9: Nothing. It's very frustrating.

130
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.390
Moderator: Interesting. Tell me a little bit about that.

131
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.590
Participant 9: So, I click it, and nothing is happening.

132
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.250
Participant 9: It's very annoying.

133
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.409
Moderator: And why do you think, you can't click on it?

134
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:58.150
Participant 9: So, I think it's because they want me to do things in order.

135
00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:07.980
Participant 9: So maybe they want me to, like, do step 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. So is this my first time going in there?

136
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.980
Moderator: Can you explain a little bit what you mean in your question?

137
00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.850
Participant 9: So, I put in my email and my password.

138
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:22.729
Participant 9: Is this the f- Like, is this my initial time filling out this form?

139
00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.970
Moderator: In this case, yes.

140
00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.050
Participant 9: Oh, okay.

141
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.060
Moderator: No, that's a great question, because one thing that we definitely want to gauge is

142
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.609
Moderator: Whether veterans understand that now they are kind of entering the form.

143
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:41.979
Moderator: Did it not seem kind of, clear that you are now kind of starting the process of filling out the form?

144
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.480
Participant 9: No.

145
00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.040
Moderator: Okay.

146
00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:49.109
Participant 9: But that's okay, but that's how… because I… maybe how I interpreted how you said it.

147
00:16:49.540 --> 00:17:08.379
Moderator: No, that's all good. I think it's also because on our end, we've kind of shortened the process a little bit more. The typical way would be that you would have to log in, and then click on filing for disability compensation, and so, you know, there are a couple of other screens that you have to go through before you get to this point, so that's actually a great note for us.

148
00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.250
Participant 9: Okay.

149
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:23.469
Moderator: Alright, so you mentioned that you notice kind of that left, side there that, says the different steps. What do you kind of notice or think about how the parts of the form are labeled?

150
00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:27.119
Moderator: The fact that it says, like, step one, veteran details.

151
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.050
Participant 9: I like that it tells you, like.

152
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:38.700
Participant 9: I don't think… I don't know that step is necessarily the best word to use there, but, right off the top of my head, I can't think of a better one.

153
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.709
Participant 9: But I like that it's grouped into different, like, categories of…

154
00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:49.489
Participant 9: like, step two, you're gonna put in your conditions, like PTSD or schizophrenia or whatever, and then…

155
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:56.110
Participant 9: 3 mental health statement. I don't have any idea what that is from there, but I assume I would figure it out when I got there.

156
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.810
Participant 9: And then it just kind of lists through, like.

157
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.539
Participant 9: the different things you have to go through, I guess.

158
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:11.859
Moderator: No, that's perfect, because you actually answered my next question, which was, how do you interpret the word step here? Like, what do you think that means?

159
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.660
Participant 9: Piper.

160
00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:29.199
Participant 9: I don't know. Like, in some ways, I think it's a good word, and then other ways, I think it's, like, it falls short of describing what's… what I think is actually happening. Like, because step one, veteran details, it looks like that's just it, like, your name and your birthday.

161
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.900
Participant 9: But…

162
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:41.709
Participant 9: I'll know more about it, like, when I… when we kind of go… as we go through, I'll be like, oh, this seems more like it should be this way, or whatever.

163
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:51.039
Moderator: Okay, perfect. Yeah, I was gonna ask you to kind of elaborate a little bit on what you mean by fall short, but I think you could probably better answer that as we go through, so that sounds good.

164
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.140
Moderator: Alright, then when you're ready, you can go ahead and click the continue button.

165
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:02.729
Moderator: Alright, so here, just kind of talk me through what you're seeing on this page.

166
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:09.650
Participant 9: Okay, so there's the same menu on the left, and then we hit… then it says File for Disability Compensation.

167
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:21.000
Participant 9: And then, details about the veteran, so that would be my details, so phone and email.

168
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:27.180
Participant 9: And then my mailing address next door in Iowa.

169
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.069
Participant 9: And then a continue button.

170
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.310
Participant 9: So this is more details about me.

171
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.399
Participant 9: And then there's a way to edit them, also.

172
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:47.719
Participant 9: And then, you can finish the application later, which I'm assuming brings you to a save.

173
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:49.110
Participant 9: Thing.

174
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.080
Moderator: Oops.

175
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:54.930
Moderator: I'm just kidding.

176
00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.449
Participant 9: Keep scrolling, I can… Call people for help.

177
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.980
Moderator: Perfect.

178
00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:08.519
Moderator: So kind of going back to the question that I had, now that you've kind of gone through this second page,

179
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.280
Moderator: What would you say the… The menu on the left kind of falls short of…

180
00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.399
Participant 9: Well, I just don't like the word step, is…

181
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.570
Participant 9: Because to me, it makes me think, like, there's 6 things I'm gonna do, and…

182
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:30.250
Participant 9: or look at, and there's already… you know what I mean? Like, I already know that that's not accurate. So…

183
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.769
Participant 9: I don't know. I'll keep thinking, I'll see if I can come up with a better word by the time I get done.

184
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:55.340
Moderator: Do not worry about it. That's… that's technically our job, so don't worry about having to come up with a new word. Unless you have a specific recommendation, we definitely want to hear it. But, you mentioned kind of knowing that that's not accurate. Is that kind of based on your previous experience having filed for disability compensation before?

185
00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:56.460
Participant 9: Yes.

186
00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:04.780
Moderator: Okay, so now we can kind of go ahead and click continue here, and we're going to go on to the next page.

187
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.450
Participant 9: Oh, can I go back? Can we go back for a second?

188
00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.260
Moderator: Yeah.

189
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:16.600
Participant 9: So… Contact information, phone, and email. Okay, so this says primary phone.

190
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:22.070
Participant 9: I like that, because… In other VA stuff.

191
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.230
Participant 9: it'll say home, so, you know what I mean? Like, it lists these different things, and I'm like.

192
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:38.049
Participant 9: These are both cell phones. They're… it's not one at home and one a mobile, they're both cell phones. So I… so that's a good thing. Like, I like that it says…

193
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.760
Participant 9: primary phone.

194
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:44.210
Moderator: Got it, good to know. Thank you for catching that.

195
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:56.009
Moderator: Alright, so now that we're on, this page, don't click on anything yet, just kind of talk me through, again, like, what you're seeing, and then I'm gonna have some questions for you about this page.

196
00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:03.669
Participant 9: So now we're getting into the nitty-gritty, talking about the conditions that we want to file for, and then…

197
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:10.290
Participant 9: What to do if the condition isn't listed, examples of conditions.

198
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.419
Participant 9: And then the new condition that I want to file for.

199
00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.900
Moderator: Alright, and if I were to ask you what step are you on?

200
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.769
Moderator: What would you say?

201
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:24.710
Participant 9: two conditions.

202
00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.800
Moderator: And how do you know that that's the step you're on?

203
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:36.210
Participant 9: Because on the… well, two reasons. At the top it says conditions, and then off to the left,

204
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.919
Participant 9: in the menu, slash table of contents, whatever you want to call it.

205
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:45.349
Participant 9: It's highlighted, and that's where the…

206
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:48.669
Participant 9: Well, it's not a cursor, but whatever that bar is.

207
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:56.410
Moderator: Got it. So just to make sure that we note that correctly, the bar kind of lets you know that that's the step that you're on?

208
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:58.909
Participant 9: Yeah, the bar end is bolded.

209
00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.630
Moderator: Got it, so the barn is folding.

210
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.509
Participant 9: Bold and blue, and you made it stand out.

211
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.639
Participant 9: So… Perfect, alright. The only thing not there is a neon sign.

212
00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.440
Moderator: I mean, who knows? That could be a good idea.

213
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.400
Participant 9: No. No.

214
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.629
Participant 9: Well, as long as it's not flashing.

215
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.490
Moderator: Yes, very much so.

216
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.719
Moderator: Alright, and so if I were to ask you what steps have you finished?

217
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.549
Participant 9: One, because I didn't finish Step 2 yet.

218
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.269
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know which steps you have finished?

219
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.960
Participant 9: Well, because the forum step thing moved down to step 2.

220
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:41.090
Moderator: Got it.

221
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:45.070
Participant 9: So I assume that there's no more things, no more parts to Step 1.

222
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:48.100
Moderator: And what leads you to assume that?

223
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.929
Participant 9: Because now it moved me to step 2.

224
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.869
Moderator: And what steps do you still need to do?

225
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:00.220
Participant 9: 3, 4, 5, 6.

226
00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.830
Moderator: And similarly, again, how do you know that those are the steps that you still need to do?

227
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:14.240
Participant 9: because I can see them, and they're not highlighted, and I know… like, I know I haven't done them yet, because I'm on step 2, and I haven't done any of the other things, because it won't let me click there.

228
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.190
Moderator: And when you say highlighted, what do you mean?

229
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.540
Participant 9: Or the bulk blue thing.

230
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:31.769
Moderator: Okay. Let's say that you, in a hypothetical, wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

231
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.549
Participant 9: I would try to click it, but it doesn't work.

232
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:42.419
Participant 9: So… I don't think you can, because… It won't let you.

233
00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:51.439
Participant 9: And here, on part 2, it, like, it says, where it says enter your condition, it says required, so I'm guessing if I hit save and I leave that blank, it's not gonna let me do it.

234
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:53.460
Moderator: Got it.

235
00:24:53.740 --> 00:25:02.349
Moderator: Alright, well, let's actually go ahead and do that. You can, click the, enter your condition box, and it'll auto-populate, perfect. And then you can click save.

236
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.250
Participant 9: Oh.

237
00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:07.490
Participant 9: Jordan also has tinnita, tinnitus.

238
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:15.790
Moderator: It's a… it's probably actually one of the most common conditions that veterans file for, so we like to use it a lot for some of our examples.

239
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.719
Moderator: Alright, you can go ahead and kind of scroll down.

240
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.759
Moderator: And click continue when you're ready.

241
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:36.980
Moderator: Alright, and so you can then go ahead and select the radio button that says my condition was caused by an injury.

242
00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:46.340
Moderator: There we go, during my military service, and then you can select the box below, and a description will kind of show up automatically.

243
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.670
Moderator: And you can click continue when you're ready.

244
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.230
Participant 9: I type really fast.

245
00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:56.149
Moderator: It makes it so much faster and so much easier for all of us, you know?

246
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.550
Participant 9: Yes!

247
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:58.840
Participant 9: Yes.

248
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:11.789
Moderator: All right, so take a second to just kind of read through this page. I won't ask you any questions specifically about this page, but once you're done reading, then you can go ahead and select the no option below.

249
00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:16.909
Participant 9: So now we're apparently getting new mental health conditions.

250
00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.929
Participant 9: Is this a new form, the 210781?

251
00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.590
Moderator: New as in new to VA, or… Yeah.

252
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:51.040
Moderator: Technically not, in that the mental health form has existed kind of for a while, but it is kind of new to have the form be a part of the disability benefits application experience.

253
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:55.319
Participant 9: Gotcha. Okay, so there's not a lot to do here.

254
00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.330
Participant 9: So I might… so, do I just hit, no, I don't want to add this forum?

255
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.130
Moderator: Yes.

256
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.900
Moderator: And go ahead and click continue.

257
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.440
Participant 9: Now we're gonna go to step 4. See?

258
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:18.319
Moderator: Alright, and so on this page, we're gonna take a few moments, so don't click on anything yet, just talk me through, kind of, what you're seeing on this page.

259
00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:24.919
Participant 9: So, we moved to, step four, I say highlighted, but really it's bold and blue.

260
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.650
Participant 9: It's highlighted in that it's, easier to… nope, like…

261
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.360
Participant 9: At a glance, you can see where you are in terms of how far along you are in the process.

262
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:42.890
Participant 9: And then, so it says supporting evidence, and then it says supporting evidence on the top…

263
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:51.170
Participant 9: And then it tells me about the type of evidence that I can submit, and then it asks if there's any evidence that I need.

264
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.770
Participant 9: Or that I would like to send in.

265
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.739
Participant 9: Because… Sometimes you need to send in the buddy statement.

266
00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:16.920
Moderator: So without clicking on anything yet, let's say that you realize you might have entered an old email address, and you wanted to double-check to see if you needed to update it. What would you do from here? Kind of talk me through what those steps would be.

267
00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:32.189
Participant 9: I would go back to Veteran Details, because that's where it was. Like, I would… I'm not gonna actually do it, but I would go up here, and I would click Veteran Details.

268
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.179
Moderator: So you would use that left menu to go back to Veteran Details.

269
00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:38.650
Participant 9: Yes.

270
00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:46.439
Moderator: Alright, and so, what would you expect to happen after you click on Step 1 Veteran Details?

271
00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:50.479
Participant 9: I would expect to go to that first screen where,

272
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:53.879
Participant 9: See? You're asking about my memory again.

273
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:59.560
Participant 9: I think it had date of birth and email, was on the very first screen.

274
00:29:01.270 --> 00:29:03.900
Moderator: So it's meant to take me back there.

275
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.300
Moderator: Got it.

276
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.880
Moderator: All right, so let's actually go ahead and do that. Go ahead and select Step 1 Veteran Details.

277
00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:26.769
Moderator: Alright, so without clicking on anything, you've just landed on this page, so what are your first thoughts on being able to update your email address?

278
00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:34.899
Participant 9: So, I was wrong. The first page is the date of birth, it's not the email, but I would hit continue, because I'm pretty sure it's on the next page.

279
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:43.520
Moderator: And so… One thing I would… we want to kind of make sure to understand is

280
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:52.949
Moderator: before you got onto this page, you thought that by clicking on Step 1 Veteran Details, that you'd be able to see your email address on this page, correct?

281
00:29:53.310 --> 00:30:00.840
Participant 9: On this page, yes, but… If it's not on this page, I'm 98% sure it's on the next page.

282
00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:05.759
Moderator: Alright, so actually, let's go ahead, you can click on continue.

283
00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:18.210
Participant 9: So now, I believe I would hit edit, and then change my email address.

284
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:27.399
Moderator: That's exactly right, that's actually the instruction I was, gonna give, but, you can actually then go ahead and click on Edit.

285
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:33.759
Moderator: And you'll see that it'll change automatically once you click on the email address box right there.

286
00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:38.999
Moderator: Alright, and you can click Save.

287
00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:42.499
Participant 9: Oh, that's a real email address, maybe.

288
00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.949
Moderator: It maybe could be, that's actually a good point.

289
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.170
Participant 9: Oh my god.

290
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.100
Participant 9: This is probably somebody's email address.

291
00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:58.810
Moderator: That's a good point. We should probably come up with something that, doesn't look or sound as real.

292
00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:12.929
Moderator: All right, so, now we're going to kind of pause for a second. If you were to return to the part of the form that you were previously on, before kind of having to update your email, what would you do?

293
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:16.660
Participant 9: I would click, Step 4, Supporting Evidence.

294
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:25.639
Moderator: Okay, and, what do you think would happen after you click on, Step 4 Supporting Evidence?

295
00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:33.800
Participant 9: It would take me back to the… where I just was, where it was asking if I wanted a buddy to add, like, a buddy statement or something from a doctor, or…

296
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:42.490
Moderator: Perfect. And then, what tells you that that step is available, that you can actually, go to step 4?

297
00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:47.640
Participant 9: Oh, it's like… It's blue, it's not black.

298
00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.440
Participant 9: And also, I've been there before, which makes me think that you can go back there.

299
00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:01.710
Moderator: Great. Okay, then you can go ahead and click on Step 4, Supporting Evidence.

300
00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:11.580
Moderator: And so, once again, you can just kind of take a few seconds. When you're ready, you can click no, and then click Continue.

301
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:26.599
Moderator: All right, similarly here, you could just take a few seconds to kind of read through this page. I won't ask you any questions about this page, and then when you're ready, you can click continue.

302
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:46.470
Moderator: All right, and so now we're going to focus on this page. Talk me through what you're seeing, and then I'll have some questions for you.

303
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:53.030
Participant 9: Alright, so we've got the menu on the left, and everything is now blue, and the review and submit is

304
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.860
Participant 9: Balded.

305
00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:01.930
Participant 9: And then, the main part is, review and submit, and so all of the…

306
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:15.759
Participant 9: like, steps on the left, or on the main part of the page, and then I can click each one to expand, and then review all the information before I submit it to make sure that everything is accurate.

307
00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:28.879
Moderator: So I'm gonna throw kind of another hypothetical at you. So let's say that you wanted to add another condition. How would you do that?

308
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:36.490
Participant 9: I would click Conditions, I would click it right here.

309
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.389
Moderator: Okay, let's actually go ahead and do that.

310
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.280
Participant 9: But maybe a better way would be to click it over here. I don't know.

311
00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:52.689
Moderator: Talk me through that. What makes you think that clicking on that left menu would be better?

312
00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.450
Participant 9: Because…

313
00:33:56.830 --> 00:34:08.349
Participant 9: Here, it says review and submit, which makes me think I might not be able to edit it, although I… although after I clicked it, I see that I can edit it. But if I go over here…

314
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:17.420
Participant 9: I… for me, I just intuitively think that if I click it on the left-hand side, it might be…

315
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.180
Participant 9: For sure, easier to edit there.

316
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:26.539
Participant 9: Like, I feel like I wouldn't have to hit and edit. You know, having clicked on the plus button.

317
00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:36.740
Participant 9: over here, I… I… I just feel like if I clicked the conditions on the left, that it… I wouldn't have to click edit, like, it would be faster to do it that way.

318
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:39.679
Moderator: No, that makes total sense.

319
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:44.599
Moderator: So actually, let's go ahead and do that. You can go ahead and click on, Step 2 Conditions.

320
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:55.189
Moderator: Alright, and so here you're going to go ahead and click on Add Another Condition.

321
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:03.889
Moderator: And do the same thing that you did with tonight's, yep, perfect, and then click save.

322
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.400
Moderator: And you can scroll down, and then click continue.

323
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:25.940
Moderator: And here, similarly, you can select the button that says, my condition was caused by an injury or exposure. Yep, perfect.

324
00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:27.790
Moderator: And same below.

325
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:34.279
Moderator: And so, actually, before you click continue, we're gonna focus on this page for a second.

326
00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:44.109
Moderator: let's say that then you, you know, have added this second condition, and wanted to go back to the review and submit page. What would you do?

327
00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:53.360
Participant 9: Well, first I would hit continue, because otherwise I feel like it wouldn't, save it.

328
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:58.769
Participant 9: And then I would go over to the review and submit and click that.

329
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.259
Moderator: Alright, perfect. Let's actually do exactly that, then.

330
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.579
Moderator: Oh, is it not working?

331
00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.040
Participant 9: The continue button is not working.

332
00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:11.970
Moderator: Okay.

333
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:27.010
Moderator: But we made sure to note that you would click the continue button. So let's say that then there would be kind of a different approach to it. So you mentioned kind of using the menu on the left to go back to review and submit. So let's go ahead and do that.

334
00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:36.620
Moderator: Alright, and now that we're on the review and submit page, let's say you are then gonna, reviewing your responses.

335
00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:41.590
Moderator: Go ahead and kind of go through that process, and then I'll ask you a question.

336
00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:50.329
Participant 9: I'm still Jordan Jackson. I would just change it to at email.com.

337
00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.320
Moderator: Will do.

338
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:59.370
Participant 9: Otherwise, Jordan Jackson may be getting a bunch of email he doesn't want, or she doesn't want.

339
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.249
Moderator: As you're reviewing this information, can you talk me through a little bit about what you're seeing?

340
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:16.749
Participant 9: Oh, okay. So, in the veteran details, there's my, phone number and my email.

341
00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.050
Participant 9: And,

342
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:27.460
Participant 9: Yeah, there's no changes that need to be made there. And then the conditions, I have the tinnitus, or tinnitus, however you want to say it.

343
00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.110
Participant 9: And the ankle replacement, and then there's the,

344
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.580
Participant 9: Like, the mini-statement about… that kind of explains what's happening there.

345
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:44.539
Participant 9: And then, for the mental health statement, I did not add a mental health statement.

346
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:54.879
Participant 9: And then for supporting evidence, I'm not adding any supporting evidence.

347
00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.610
Participant 9: Oh.

348
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:09.519
Participant 9: And then additional information, this is where the, direct deposit information is?

349
00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:15.630
Participant 9: This going into my checking account, my Chase checking account.

350
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:20.829
Participant 9: And then here at the bottom, is my…

351
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:27.820
Participant 9: Where else… where I'll electronically sign it and say that everything is correct.

352
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:38.469
Moderator: And so, now that you've reviewed your information, how confident do you feel that your responses, especially the ones that you edited, were saved?

353
00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.660
Participant 9: Fairly confident.

354
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.299
Moderator: Okay, and what makes you say that?

355
00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.550
Participant 9: Because it's here. Because I can see it.

356
00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.489
Participant 9: On this final, like.

357
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:59.339
Participant 9: On the review and submit page, everything that I put in is here, which leads me to believe that it's saved.

358
00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:06.009
Participant 9: Also, down here at the bottom, it says, we've saved your request, we saved it… well…

359
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:12.890
Participant 9: It keeps saying the exact same time, but I'm assuming that it auto-saves every so often.

360
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:25.529
Moderator: Yes, that's exactly right. Yeah, in our case, because it's a demo, obviously we couldn't have it to update to the real time, but yes, when you would typically be filing it, it would be updating to the current time.

361
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:35.730
Moderator: All right, well, we've actually then can… now you can assign your name there, so you can click on the… your full name box.

362
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:45.940
Moderator: And then click, submit, and then, to finish kind of this portion, I'm gonna ask you a few follow-up questions, and then we're gonna go into the next, demo that we have.

363
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.669
Participant 9: But wait, here's more.

364
00:39:49.410 --> 00:40:00.170
Moderator: Yes, but wait, there's more. So, for this first design that you kind of just went through, this first experience, what were kind of your overall impressions of navigating the form?

365
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.460
Participant 9: It seemed fairly straightforward.

366
00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.640
Participant 9: And it was actually easier than I thought it would be.

367
00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:14.329
Moderator: Tell me more about that.

368
00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:24.640
Participant 9: So… when I filled out the forms in person, it just… they just seemed kind of clunky. But,

369
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.630
Participant 9: Because this kind of guides you through, it seems…

370
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:33.330
Participant 9: Seems a little bit easier to use.

371
00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.869
Participant 9: Like, a little more straightforward.

372
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:42.920
Participant 9: More streamlined, I guess, would be a better adjective.

373
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.260
Moderator: No, that's a great word that definitely helps us.

374
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:55.599
Moderator: Especially in comparison, since you mentioned that you had, completed the form, like, in other ways besides VA.gov, so that's good to know.

375
00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:04.010
Moderator: And then was there anything confusing about how that kind of left menu bar for navigation worked?

376
00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:12.750
Participant 9: Confusing? No. But I had this thought that,

377
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.900
Participant 9: Where there's multiple pages for the steps.

378
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.980
Moderator: You might want to put, like.

379
00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.780
Participant 9: Park.

380
00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.340
Participant 9: So I think it should be more like Part 1.

381
00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.990
Moderator: Hmm.

382
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.189
Participant 9: And then, step one could be…

383
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:34.480
Participant 9: I think name and birthdate, or whatever it was, and then step two…

384
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:40.970
Participant 9: contact info, or email, or whatever it was, you know what I mean? Like…

385
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.619
Participant 9: Maybe you have the plus, like, where you can expand the menu.

386
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:49.600
Participant 9: So that if you need to go back to a particular thing, you can just go straight back there.

387
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.779
Moderator: That's perfect to know. That's actually something that we've been thinking about. So, just to kind of reiterate and make sure that we understood that correctly.

388
00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:11.159
Moderator: It would be helpful to have, kind of, each page and the information that you're filling out on each page, have that actually listed out in that, like, left menu bar.

389
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:13.090
Participant 9: Yeah, well, and…

390
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:21.120
Participant 9: it might be, like, where you have the… on the review and submit, where you have, like, the plus where you can expand it, like, that same kind of thing where…

391
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:30.669
Participant 9: I don't necessarily want to see this big, long menu, because that can be overwhelming, but if you have the steps, and then you click the plus, and then, oh, okay, this is where I want to go.

392
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:49.770
Moderator: That, you know, Ellen, that's the great part about doing this work, is that you've actually kind of helped, give us some really good direction on some of our next designs. We've actually been thinking about exploring something like that, so it's great to hear that that would be valuable, or, like, helpful for you.

393
00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:51.830
Participant 9: for me.

394
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.610
Moderator: For you, yes.

395
00:42:54.470 --> 00:43:08.249
Moderator: All right, so just to kind of close out this section, I'm gonna ask a couple of questions that are on a scale of 1 to 4, 1 being kind of the least and 4 being the most, and then we're gonna go into the next design that we have.

396
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:20.290
Moderator: So, on a scale of 1 to 4, how helpful was the navigation menu in helping you complete the tasks? One being not helpful at all, and four being very helpful.

397
00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:21.510
Participant 9: 3.

398
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.500
Moderator: Okay, through being helpful, perfect.

399
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:33.150
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you had completed?

400
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:38.269
Moderator: Same scale, 1 being not effective at all, 4 being very effective.

401
00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:40.080
Participant 9: 3.

402
00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:41.250
Moderator: breathes.

403
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:46.960
Participant 9: a little bit to figure out what, you know, the color coding, you know what I mean? Like, what that was.

404
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.060
Moderator: Oops.

405
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:56.219
Moderator: Similarly, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you were on?

406
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:57.490
Participant 9: 4.

407
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:08.549
Moderator: And then two more. On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you needed to complete?

408
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:11.420
Participant 9: 4.

409
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:20.260
Moderator: And last one, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you to go back and change your answers on the form?

410
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:22.470
Participant 9: 3.

411
00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:33.470
Moderator: Alright, perfect. So now we can go ahead and click on, the next prototype, so you can, whenever you're ready, you can click on continue to the next prototype.

412
00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:42.849
Participant 9: You know, Notetaker, Observer 2, and Observer 1 need to keep it down, they're being too loud there in the background.

413
00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:49.399
Moderator: I know, right? Like, they really are just kind of interrupting and being extremely disruptive to our session today.

414
00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:55.370
Moderator: Oh, I love it. Alright, so now that we're on this page,

415
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:58.120
Participant 9: At least they have good senses of humor, that's awesome.

416
00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:04.340
Moderator: Oh, 100%. If there's one thing that we have, Ellen, is a good sense of humor, because we gotta keep it light, especially on a Friday.

417
00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:23.910
Moderator: All right, just… and I'm only gonna kind of push this along because I want to make sure that we leave on time, but, now that you're kind of on our second demo, I want you to kind of take a moment, and as you go through this page, tell me out loud, like, what you're seeing, and what stands out to you first.

418
00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:44.249
Participant 9: Oh, well, here it says… okay, so the, like, the main part is… it looks the same, but the, like, form steps, it says step one, veteran details in progress, which leads me to believe that that's where I am, and then there I have to do other things. You know, this gives me a better indication of where I am in the process.

419
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:47.579
Participant 9: By looking at it, seeing, in pro- in progress, like.

420
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:50.390
Participant 9: I know that, oh, I haven't finished this, I need to take a look.

421
00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:52.429
Participant 9: I need to take a look at this.

422
00:45:53.360 --> 00:46:00.209
Moderator: Great. And so, can you describe what's kind of different in comparison to the previous demo that you just went through?

423
00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.200
Participant 9: It has the buttons.

424
00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.310
Moderator: Hmm, can you tell me what you mean by buttons?

425
00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.059
Participant 9: the… well, I don't know what to… how to describe the,

426
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:17.370
Participant 9: Well, okay, so it says form steps, and then there's the little circles, and for step one, it's…

427
00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:18.960
Participant 9: Filled in.

428
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:23.100
Participant 9: And it says in progress, which,

429
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:35.829
Participant 9: For me, that… for me, I like that setup way better, because it shows, oh, this is where you are, and, like, these are the other steps you need to go through.

430
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:40.850
Participant 9: And, we're on step one, but…

431
00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.959
Participant 9: It just… it just… it tells me where I am, and kind of what I need to do going forward.

432
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.250
Moderator: And so you mentioned that also the kind of circle is, filled.

433
00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:01.560
Moderator: We got the in progress, anything else on this before I kind of go into some of the other questions we have?

434
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.780
Participant 9: Okay, it's bold.

435
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:08.769
Participant 9: Oh, and it's, like, okay, now I can say it's highlighted, because I don't know what other word to use there.

436
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:14.850
Moderator: And by highlight, you mean kind of that, like, blue, like, bar?

437
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.329
Participant 9: A little box, yeah.

438
00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:16.920
Moderator: Huh?

439
00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:18.770
Moderator: Alright.

440
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:24.949
Moderator: So let's say that, you wanted to move to another part of the form, what we could do.

441
00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.190
Moderator: I know, I know.

442
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:32.880
Participant 9: Well, okay, now, I would scroll down and hit continue.

443
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:36.589
Participant 9: Because I know that if I try to hit step 4, it's not gonna let me.

444
00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:37.830
Participant 9: So…

445
00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:51.530
Moderator: And then, since you actually just, like, tried to do that, and it didn't let you, what lets you know that you weren't… that you're not able to kind of skip to that other step?

446
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.810
Participant 9: Well, when I clicked it, nothing happened.

447
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:59.440
Participant 9: So… but having been through the other…

448
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:04.409
Participant 9: setup, like, now I know, oh, hit, you know, verify the date of birth, and then hit continue.

449
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:09.480
Participant 9: Or, it doesn't actually matter, because you can't edit it right here.

450
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.850
Moderator: Alright, so let's go ahead and click continue.

451
00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:22.419
Moderator: And same here, I'm not going to ask you any questions about this page, but you can just take a minute to skim, and then click continue.

452
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:24.430
Participant 9: It's all the same.

453
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:37.130
Moderator: And so, okay, here, I'm going to ask you to kind of pause for a second, and as you kind of go through the page, tell me out loud, like, what you're seeing, what are your overall impressions of this page?

454
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:42.320
Participant 9: Alright, so on the, on the, on the menu on the left,

455
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:48.660
Participant 9: the veteran details, it says complete, which is awesome, because now I know, oh, this is done…

456
00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:55.220
Participant 9: it's not giving me a percent of, like, how far along I am, but, like, I know, oh, look, you completed something.

457
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:57.530
Participant 9: And it changed to blue?

458
00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:00.519
Participant 9: Which makes me think that I can go back and…

459
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.260
Participant 9: I can just click on that.

460
00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:13.320
Participant 9: And then the conditions is now bold, and it has that blue-gray box, and it says in progress, so now I know kind of, like, where I am in the process.

461
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.429
Participant 9: And then the rest of this looks like the same.

462
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:29.509
Moderator: And just to make sure that we, like, take note of it accurately, you mentioned, kind of, the blue. What do you think, kind of, the blue means or allows you to do?

463
00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.770
Participant 9: it means that that's where I am, and that I can, like.

464
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:39.410
Participant 9: potentially… well, and that I could edit what's on that page.

465
00:49:39.970 --> 00:49:44.270
Participant 9: In this case, that means I would be able to enter in my conditions.

466
00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:51.980
Moderator: Got it. Oh, then let's actually clarify, yep, the answer that you just gave is about, like, kind of the blue bar that tells you where you are, correct?

467
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:53.250
Participant 9: Yes.

468
00:49:53.570 --> 00:50:01.560
Moderator: Okay, and then, since you mentioned the blue text for the Step 1, what do you think that tells you that you're able to do?

469
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:05.579
Participant 9: And I can click on… oops, but I can click on it and go back there.

470
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.950
Moderator: Got it.

471
00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:13.079
Moderator: So similar to before, what step would you say you're on right now?

472
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:14.230
Participant 9: Who?

473
00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.509
Moderator: Alright, and how do you know that?

474
00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:20.510
Participant 9: because the… the box?

475
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.700
Participant 9: Man, it's bold?

476
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:31.380
Participant 9: And it says, well… It says in progress, which doesn't necessarily mean that that's where I am, but,

477
00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:37.459
Participant 9: like, it's an indicator that that could be where I am, but it doesn't necessarily, like.

478
00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:43.360
Participant 9: definitively say that that's where I am, but because of that, like, bluish box.

479
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.420
Participant 9: And, the bold Step 2 conditions.

480
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:51.789
Moderator: You could summon… oops, sorry, keep going.

481
00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:54.759
Participant 9: Also, it says conditions at the top of the…

482
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.170
Moderator: Here.

483
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:57.639
Participant 9: where I'm circling.

484
00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:11.080
Moderator: So actually, a quick question on… you mentioned the in-progress kind of not being, not necessarily letting you know that that's where you are. Could you expand a little bit on that?

485
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:27.910
Participant 9: In other forms that I've used.

486
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:32.839
Participant 9: Where I've, like, been able to bounce around, like some things have not been completed.

487
00:51:33.410 --> 00:51:37.779
Participant 9: So… In progress to me.

488
00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:44.159
Participant 9: like, I see what you guys are doing here, and I like this a lot better, but…

489
00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:50.049
Participant 9: to me, in progress doesn't necessarily mean that that's, like, where I am in the forum.

490
00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:53.089
Participant 9: So, back to the verbiage again.

491
00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:57.939
Participant 9: No, that's… I don't know how to change it.

492
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:08.610
Moderator: No, that's all good. Like, that's part of what, we definitely want to get your feedback on the verbiage. We want to make sure that things are clear. Oh, so sorry, getting notifications.

493
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:22.210
Moderator: Since technically we're close to being at time to the original schedule, I did want to kind of verify, since we started a little bit later, is it okay if we keep going for, like, the next 10 to 15 minutes?

494
00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.739
Participant 9: Absolutely. Yeah. Let's knock it out.

495
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:31.569
Moderator: Alright, and then… alright, I only have a few other questions left, so…

496
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:38.919
Moderator: Similarly, let's say that you wanted to skip ahead to that review and submit, how would you do that?

497
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:43.180
Participant 9: Well, I would try clicking on it, but I know it's not gonna work.

498
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.460
Participant 9: And look, it's like…

499
00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.110
Moderator: Alright, and so what… why do you think that those steps are not available?

500
00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.550
Participant 9: Because I haven't finished it.

501
00:52:57.930 --> 00:53:05.400
Participant 9: But… and I don't know if it's hidden by you guy, by your pictures, what is…

502
00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:10.019
Participant 9: Is there anywhere on here where it says, like, save and finish later?

503
00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:16.349
Participant 9: Oh, okay, I take that back. It says finish this application later, right down here.

504
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:28.170
Moderator: So you can then go ahead and add, a condition, so similar to before, it'll be tinnitus, and then you can click save.

505
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.980
Moderator: And then click Continue.

506
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.829
Moderator: And then, same as before, yep, you already know the drill.

507
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.120
Participant 9: I am teachable.

508
00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:44.399
Moderator: Oh, I love it.

509
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:47.730
Participant 9: No.

510
00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:58.319
Moderator: All right, and we're actually going to pause here for a second. I'm gonna ask you kind of the same questions as before. So, what step are you in right now?

511
00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:04.240
Participant 9: Step 4, supporting evidence, it says in progress.

512
00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:11.619
Participant 9: And then it has the bold with the blue box, and then also it says supporting evidence, like, on the main screen.

513
00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:18.389
Participant 9: Yeah, that's how I know where I am, because it tells me twice.

514
00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.030
Moderator: And similarly, what steps have you done?

515
00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:26.780
Participant 9: 1, 2, and 3, because they all say complete.

516
00:54:28.040 --> 00:54:31.210
Moderator: Perfect. And what steps do you still need to do?

517
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.540
Participant 9: 5 and 6, and I need to finish step 4.

518
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.090
Moderator: Okay, and what lets you know that those are the steps that you still need to do?

519
00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:44.880
Participant 9: Well, step 4 says in progress, it doesn't say complete, and 5 and 6 doesn't say anything.

520
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:49.310
Participant 9: They feel like they're up on an island somewhere.

521
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:55.090
Moderator: What do you mean by an island? Just kind of, like, floating, or something else?

522
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:58.250
Participant 9: And they're just… they haven't been completed yet, so…

523
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:59.080
Moderator: Got it.

524
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:04.300
Moderator: Alright, so you can go ahead and click no, and then click Continue.

525
00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:12.510
Moderator: And so here we're kind of, oh, yep, you can go ahead and click continue as well on this page.

526
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:20.480
Participant 9: Okay, just as a side note, that finish this application later.

527
00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:26.730
Participant 9: Like, I know you haven't asked me about that, like, directly per se, but…

528
00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:35.730
Participant 9: I think that's in a bad location.

529
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.580
Moderator: Hmm.

530
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:44.240
Moderator: I guess, also to just clarify, what do you mean by bad location?

531
00:55:44.570 --> 00:55:47.530
Participant 9: That's just me. I would,

532
00:55:50.170 --> 00:55:52.929
Participant 9: I would like it to be, like, in the upper right.

533
00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:54.110
Moderator: Hmm, I think…

534
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:59.110
Participant 9: What does it say?

535
00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:05.640
Participant 9: Finish this application later, or, like, save and finish later, or…

536
00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:07.810
Moderator: Something like that, but…

537
00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:18.169
Participant 9: Because, as I'm scrolling, I… I say that, and yet it is right above the, like…

538
00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:23.460
Participant 9: Okay, in this case, it says submit application, but usually it's right above the continue button, so that it's…

539
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:28.289
Participant 9: Also a good location, maybe put it in both places, because sometimes…

540
00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:41.700
Participant 9: like, the screens here are pretty short and quick, but sometimes when I see something, like, I'll get overwhelmed, and I'm like, I don't have time to finish this right now, let me just…

541
00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:45.380
Participant 9: Like, save it and get out of it now.

542
00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:47.350
Moderator: Okay.

543
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:51.389
Participant 9: But that's… So what was your question about this, Paige?

544
00:56:51.730 --> 00:57:11.409
Moderator: No, thank you for letting us know, Notetaker. We'll definitely take note of that. So now that we're kind of at the end, this is going to be a hypothetical, you don't have to go through this process right now, so you don't necessarily have to click on much, but, similar to before, let's say that you wanted to add another condition, how would you do that?

545
00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:16.039
Participant 9: I would go back to Conditions… I don't even remember what it is.

546
00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:20.049
Participant 9: I would click here, Do you want me to actually do it?

547
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:28.060
Moderator: Not for right now, only because we only have a few minutes left, but that's what we wanted to take notes, like, what you would choose, so that's great.

548
00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:31.490
Participant 9: I would click the conditions, and then,

549
00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:38.600
Participant 9: Go down to the bottom, and then add new condition, and then put in what the condition is, and what my statement is.

550
00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:57.749
Moderator: Good. Okay, so I'm gonna actually kind of end the demo kind of version right now. And then I have a few, questions similar to before to wrap up, and then we can go ahead and close out. So…

551
00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:10.450
Moderator: Now that you've kind of reviewed this other design, this kind of other demo, what would you say are just your overall impressions of this version, especially in comparison to the previous one that you went through?

552
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:12.190
Participant 9: I like this one better.

553
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:20.659
Participant 9: And… fits all because of the menu, because everything else was the same. But it just…

554
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.000
Participant 9: It seemed more intuitive.

555
00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:32.980
Participant 9: So… If you haven't had the opportunity, I suggest you read The Design of Everyday Things.

556
00:58:33.540 --> 00:58:36.950
Moderator: That's actually a great one, I know the book, it's so good.

557
00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:49.350
Participant 9: Because now things annoy me way more than they used to, because, like, why didn't they design it this way? It would be so intuitive, it would be so much easier. Don't make me think if I don't have to.

558
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:53.339
Participant 9: She read Reddit that, oh.

559
00:58:53.890 --> 00:59:09.049
Moderator: Yeah, no, we… I'm very familiar with Don Norman's work. He's very prominent in the design industry, and has written several books on how to best design for especially, like, a large population of people.

560
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:20.549
Moderator: So you mentioned that you preferred this version, to the other one. Were there… was there anything specific about this version, that you think worked better?

561
00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:26.489
Participant 9: Okay, some of it I thought I already said, but I'll just go over it again. So, the,

562
00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:35.960
Participant 9: I'm gonna call it the button menu, I don't know what to call it. So, the little circles with the line, as they're filling in.

563
00:59:36.610 --> 00:59:44.779
Participant 9: like, I'm a visual person, so that… that makes it so much easier. And then it says complete, like, you totally know, like, where you are.

564
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:50.069
Participant 9: For me, I was just like, oh, this is just…

565
00:59:54.380 --> 01:00:01.369
Participant 9: It reduced the cognitive load of figuring out what is happening. I'll use the big words.

566
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:07.870
Moderator: I was about to say, like, you said cognitive load and everything, that's the terms that we use when we're designing stuff, so that's great to hear.

567
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:12.179
Participant 9: I do have a master's in Instructional Technology.

568
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:14.400
Moderator: Oh, that's great to know, then.

569
01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:19.109
Participant 9: So, I do know some things about how things are designed, and how…

570
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:25.300
Participant 9: Some things are designed, and how well other things are, you know, like… There's both.

571
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:27.310
Moderator: 100%.

572
01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:34.999
Moderator: And then I wanted to also ask if there was anything confusing or unexpected about how this version worked.

573
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:37.420
Participant 9: No.

574
01:00:39.730 --> 01:00:48.129
Participant 9: No. But I am gonna say this, and then… it's a balancing act. So…

575
01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:55.899
Participant 9: like, on the veteran details, where you have, like, on the first page is just, like, the birthdate, I think, and then the next page…

576
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.570
Participant 9: Like, it's almost… Oversimplified?

577
01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:05.650
Participant 9: And yet, back to your point of it's a mixed popu- like, that's for me. But…

578
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:08.990
Participant 9: I know that I'm a young vet, they tell me.

579
01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:18.500
Participant 9: So I know that for older populations, like, it might need to be that simplified, where it's very simple per page.

580
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:27.630
Participant 9: So… That… you probably… you probably have to, like, leave it the way it is, in terms of…

581
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:31.130
Participant 9: And also, if people are doing it on their phone.

582
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.819
Participant 9: It,

583
01:01:39.010 --> 01:01:43.289
Participant 9: You might… it might be easier if you're doing it on your phone, if it's very short.

584
01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:46.249
Participant 9: Like, if the pages are pretty short.

585
01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:56.110
Moderator: No, that's a great note. Actually, part of the study is we're testing these designs on mobile devices, so that's great to hear.

586
01:01:57.030 --> 01:02:03.099
Participant 9: Yeah, well, maybe you do it different for the mobile devices, you know what I mean? Like, maybe on the mobile devices you do it this way, but for the…

587
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:06.750
Participant 9: This, you do it differ, I don't know.

588
01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:08.240
Moderator: Oh, good.

589
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:20.140
Moderator: Alright, and to kind of close out a little bit, is there anything that you would change or add to this kind of design that you think would make it better or easier to use?

590
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:28.489
Participant 9: So there's… An awful lot of white space on the left-hand side.

591
01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.060
Participant 9: Excuse me, and maybe…

592
01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:40.909
Participant 9: Move the steps, like, to the left a little bit, so that you can get more…

593
01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.840
Participant 9: In the main page.

594
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:54.200
Moderator: So just to clarify, you kind of wanted to, like, shift the menu a bit more to the left to give it some space?

595
01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:59.720
Participant 9: Yeah, well, not to give its space, but to give more space for the…

596
01:03:00.570 --> 01:03:06.529
Participant 9: the meat, so to speak, like, the main… the main page.

597
01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:07.490
Moderator: Got it.

598
01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:20.100
Moderator: All right, perfect. So, similar to before, I'm gonna ask you just a few, scaled questions from 1 to 4, and then we will wrap it up for today. So,

599
01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:28.509
Moderator: 1 being the least and four being the most. On a scale of 1 to 4, how helpful was the navigation menu in helping you complete the tasks?

600
01:03:28.730 --> 01:03:32.130
Moderator: 1 being not helpful at all, four being extremely helpful.

601
01:03:32.850 --> 01:03:34.310
Participant 9: Oh, I'm gonna go with 4.

602
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:36.150
Moderator: It doesn't matter.

603
01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:45.269
Moderator: Alright, similarly, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you had completed?

604
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:46.540
Participant 9: Oh, 4.

605
01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:48.750
Participant 9: Four and a half.

606
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:51.460
Moderator: Love to hear it.

607
01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:57.049
Moderator: And then, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you were on?

608
01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.010
Participant 9: 4.

609
01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:07.090
Moderator: And then, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you still needed to complete?

610
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.760
Participant 9: Poor.

611
01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:18.209
Moderator: And lastly, how effective do you think the navigation menu would be at helping you to go back and change your answers on the form if you used it?

612
01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:20.120
Participant 9: Sure.

613
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:36.079
Moderator: All right. Well, that closes all of the questions that we had on our end. Before we close out, I'd like to just reconfirm that you're okay with us having a recorded, or a recording of today's conversation.

614
01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.370
Participant 9: Absolutely.

615
01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:53.610
Moderator: Great. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts today and kind of go through our prototypes. Your feedback is extremely helpful as we continue to work on the site. We really want to make sure that it works as best as possible for veterans.

616
01:04:53.750 --> 01:05:04.779
Moderator: And lastly, Perigian will be sending you a thank you note and kind of a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know, to provide them the chance to participate in future studies.

617
01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:10.160
Moderator: So, before we close out, do you have any other kind of questions or comments, before we all leave?

618
01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:12.200
Participant 9: No.

619
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.520
Moderator: All right, well, thank you again so much, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.

620
01:05:17.930 --> 01:05:19.050
Participant 9: Thanks, you too.

621
01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:21.840
Participant 9: Bye, everybody!

622
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.550
Notetaker: Bye, thank you!

623
01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:25.620
Observer 1: Bye, thank you.
