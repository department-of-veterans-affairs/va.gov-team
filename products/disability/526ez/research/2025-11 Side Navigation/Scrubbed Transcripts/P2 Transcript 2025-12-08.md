00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.090
Moderator: Alright, so just to confirm, are you comfortable with us recording your screen and audio for today's session?

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.820
Participant: Yes.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.210
Moderator: Perfect.

4
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:29.969
Moderator: All right, so, a lot of prelude, but all-important stuff. Now we'll get to the warm-up questions that we have. So, you mentioned that you had experience filing, the disability benefits form. Can you remember what that experience was like, and how did you fill out the form?

5
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.499
Participant: Well… I have to say that, you know, I did have a,

6
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.339
Participant: A facilitator that helped with it a lot.

7
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.380
Participant: So… you know, the parts that I had to fill out, We're pretty lengthy

8
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.060
Participant: You know, they were more, like, just detailed, you know, experiences.

9
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.890
Participant: And,

10
00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:04.600
Participant: you know, stuff like that. So, like, the emotional challenge was probably as hard as the, administrative, to be honest. You know, and

11
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.390
Participant: if I recall, like.

12
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.530
Participant: You had to add, like, some additional sheets yourself, because there wasn't enough space on the form.

13
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.849
Moderator: And was it, via paper, through a VSO, on VA.gov?

14
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.629
Participant: The assistance that I received, or how… or the forms that I filled out?

15
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.820
Moderator: Both, actually.

16
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.769
Participant: So I've done… I've actually, you know, I did it when I initially retired from the Marine Corps, and that was done on… on physical paper.

17
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.510
Moderator: And then I believe this last time.

18
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.940
Participant: As I, as I, you know, as you deteriorate.

19
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.690
Participant: You know, other things popped up.

20
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.030
Participant: I filed again.

21
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.580
Participant: And it was done… it was also done on paper.

22
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.410
Participant: Yep.

23
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.670
Moderator: Got it. And for the assistance that you received, was that with a VSO or someone else?

24
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.129
Participant: Yeah, it was, it was, yeah, it was, a veteran's advocate.

25
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.980
Moderator: Productions.

26
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.420
Participant: Organization, yeah.

27
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.820
Moderator: Oh, so it was a separate organization, not a VA employee?

28
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.530
Participant: Yes.

29
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.690
Moderator: Oh, okay, got it, that's good to know.

30
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.410
Moderator: And then can you tell me a little bit about the last time that you filled out a government form, if you remember?

31
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.660
Participant: Oh, yeah.

32
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:30.320
Participant: I mean, I… just fairly recently, you know, through some VA appointments, I filled out some forms.

33
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.969
Moderator: Okay, perfect. Yeah, we just like to kind of assess, like, folks' familiarity with filling out government forms.

34
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.340
Participant: There was a lot of repetition, and then,

35
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.620
Participant: Yeah, there was a lot of, like, It was very repetitive.

36
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.909
Participant: Most of the time, yeah, most of the time it is. They have you fill out a bunch of information.

37
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.279
Participant: Prior to, when you get there, they ask you for the same information.

38
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.500
Moderator: Got it.

39
00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.589
Moderator: Alright, so as we get started, can I confirm, are you using a desktop or a mobile device today?

40
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.449
Participant: I'm on a, desktop today, laptop.

41
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:18.889
Moderator: Okay, got it. Then what I'm going to do now, is that I'm going to send a link in the chat, and then I'm going to ask you to share your screen. Okay.

42
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.670
Moderator: Alright, I'm adding the link below…

43
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.270
Moderator: And so once you open the link, if you can go back to the Zoom…

44
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:41.270
Moderator: application and share your screen, so that we can be able to see it. And let me know if you need any help. We're happy to kind of walk you through some of the steps if you're unfamiliar with sharing your screen.

45
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.240
Participant: Ugh.

46
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.809
Participant: We'll know in a minute.

47
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.909
Moderator: Have you been able to open the link?

48
00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.620
Participant: I'm waiting for it to open.

49
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:08.310
Moderator: In the meantime, if you could come back to the Zoom, and share your screen, there's gonna be a button at the very bottom of the screen in your Zoom.

50
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.969
Moderator: That says share, it's like a green box with an arrow.

51
00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.130
Moderator: And if you could then select…

52
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.360
Moderator: the link that we've… that you've just opened. It'll probably be in, like, a browser.

53
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.960
Participant: Okay, I'm waiting for that link to open, it's finally opening.

54
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.530
Moderator: Has it loaded yet?

55
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.110
Moderator: Nope.

56
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.829
Moderator: I think we might have lost Pat.

57
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.709
Moderator: Oh, Pat, do you hear me?

58
00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.329
Participant: It's working on it, you still there?

59
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.670
Moderator: I can hear you, but I think your video is… Frozen.

60
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.419
Participant: Okay… So, alright, here's the share button.

61
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.330
Moderator: Once you click the share button, if you could then select the screen that has the link that you just opened.

62
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.250
Participant: Okay.

63
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.709
Participant: Oh, let's see…

64
00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:17.270
Participant: So, hit the share button… And the screen with the link that I just opened.

65
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.329
Participant: The only ones I actually see… Are the sign-in…

66
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.299
Participant: screen for the… looks like a VA site.

67
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:44.300
Moderator: Yes, that's exactly it. So, when you hit share… Oh, that's it. Yep, select that screen, and then click, on share.

68
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.400
Participant: Okay…

69
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.950
Moderator: Still not able to see your screen.

70
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.690
Participant: Yeah, don't… it's like, oh, click on it and it hits your…

71
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.950
Moderator: There you go. Okay.

72
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.370
Moderator: Let's see.

73
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.419
Participant: Okay, sorry about that.

74
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.389
Moderator: Oh, no, you're good. It's… I realized, too, I was like, oh, right, you have to select the screen and then also hit share again, so…

75
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.910
Participant: It's a little…

76
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:27.670
Moderator: A little complicated sometimes, but, let's see… it's starting to share… it's, like, taking a minute to load.

77
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:36.860
Moderator: Alright, perfect. Okay. By any chance, are you using a screen magnifier?

78
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.810
Participant: No.

79
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.700
Moderator: Oh, interesting, okay. It's because we're seeing it a bit zoomed in.

80
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.290
Participant: You know, maybe I have it selected at a higher…

81
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.050
Moderator: Magnification, maybe?

82
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.460
Participant: I might.

83
00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:05.400
Moderator: Got it. And honestly, whatever is going to be the best magnification for you to be able to read the information. So, if this is how you normally would be interacting with the site, then this is perfectly fine.

84
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.849
Participant: It's probably B.

85
00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:15.339
Moderator: Alright, perfect. So, now we can, actually go ahead and get started. So…

86
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:29.530
Moderator: just kind of, again, giving you some more information before we have you kind of interact with this demo, is that, as I mentioned earlier, this is just a prototype, and so it's going to look a lot like the VA.gov website.

87
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:40.730
Moderator: And so you may be, like, familiar with certain parts of it, but there may be certain elements that, don't work exactly as the VA docup site, typically does.

88
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:55.830
Moderator: And any of the information you see is not from a real person. So, for today's session, I'd actually like you to imagine that you're a veteran named Jordan Jackson, just so that we're able to kind of complete tasks that we have for you today.

89
00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:04.499
Moderator: And so you'll be actually going through a shortened version of the Disability Benefits Form as if you were this veteran named Jordan Jackson.

90
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.420
Participant: Okay.

91
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:16.470
Moderator: And so when you click on certain areas, there's going to be some text that, like, will automatically appear. That's kind of what I was mentioning earlier about, oh, you not having to literally type out certain answers.

92
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:27.819
Moderator: And so we're going to be going through a couple of different screens. I'll ask you to click through, kind of, to the next part, or I'll prompt you with some instructions of what you should be doing on certain pages.

93
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:42.499
Moderator: And then on others, I'll probably be telling you to complete a task, and then you share your thoughts as you go. So we really encourage that you out loud say, like, what you're thinking, maybe questions that you have.

94
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.940
Moderator: As you're going through, the form and through today's, tasks.

95
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:48.970
Participant: Okay.

96
00:09:49.630 --> 00:10:04.330
Moderator: Alright. So, to get started, this is the sign-in screen to just kind of imagine that you're logging in. So, for the next, like, 15 minutes… oh, actually, no, more like 25 minutes, we'll be testing our first concept.

97
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:09.800
Moderator: So as you can see here, it says if you're signing in, so, you can click Submit.

98
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:27.700
Moderator: All right. So, we're going to pause and kind of focus on this page. As you read through this page, can you say out loud, like, what you're thinking and what you're seeing?

99
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:39.069
Participant: Okay… Let's see… I'm actually gonna try to reduce this, there we go.

100
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:45.190
Participant: Okay, I filed for compensation… You saved your app?

101
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.560
Participant: Occasionally change.

102
00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:55.220
Participant: Details, conditions, supporting evidence, savior, this is personal, we have on file, okay.

103
00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:02.170
Participant: Personal… I think it's kind of strange, you gotta… Coal.

104
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.370
Participant: Make a phone call to update.

105
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.459
Participant: Personal information, and you can't just, like, go to link to it and do it right then.

106
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.640
Participant: Okay, so other than that… It looks pretty straightforward.

107
00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:25.429
Moderator: As you look around the page, is there anything that stands out to you first?

108
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.670
Participant: Not really, I mean, it's, it's pretty clear…

109
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.580
Participant: That it's filed for disability compensation, which… Is… would be my goal.

110
00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.190
Participant: The details, there's not a whole lot of veteran details listed.

111
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.730
Participant: So, I guess it just wants to confirm your date of birth, it looks like.

112
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:59.020
Participant: But again, like I said,

113
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.160
Participant: Having a, like… it looks like the whole process is stopped.

114
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.770
Participant: If, for whatever reason, you need to update your personal information.

115
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.300
Participant: Because of the limited hour, or the hours…

116
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.590
Participant: And a phone call is required to be made to update it.

117
00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:21.990
Moderator: So, let's say you wanted to move to another part of this application, like, of the form, what would you do?

118
00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.540
Participant: Like, hit continue.

119
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:41.870
Moderator: Okay, got it. And what would make you do… like, choose continue? What would… what about the continue button would make you think that that's, like, the way to move across the form?

120
00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:43.370
Participant: Oh.

121
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:52.270
Participant: Well, it just makes sense that, you know, gives you back and continue, and I, you know, it's… it seems like a pretty common…

122
00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:01.029
Participant: Way of… of doing on most applications, or on most electronic-type forms that you're trying to process.

123
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:05.120
Participant: And of, you know, also the fact that

124
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.520
Participant: in this case, that I've confirmed that the birth… that the personal information is correct.

125
00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.989
Participant: So I'd automatically be looking for

126
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:17.319
Participant: The next process, or the next step to take and continue to look like.

127
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.289
Participant: The most obvious one.

128
00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:30.380
Moderator: Alright, sounds perfect. So, now I'm going to go ahead and ask you to tap that continue button, and we're going to go through a couple pages.

129
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:43.009
Moderator: Alright, so talk me through what you're seeing on this page. I won't really ask you any specific questions about this page, but just to kind of understand what you're seeing.

130
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:53.490
Participant: Okay, so I see that it is giving you an option to… correct your… Personal information or contact information.

131
00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.740
Participant: and address.

132
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:01.209
Participant: There's still that same note.

133
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.899
Participant: That, to me, could end… could end my…

134
00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:09.069
Participant: My attempt at doing it, because of the requirement for the phone call.

135
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:18.289
Participant: Other than that, You know, everything else looks pretty straightforward. This left side column looks the same as

136
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.109
Participant: On the last page…

137
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.150
Moderator: Hmm.

138
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:33.010
Moderator: So, actually, since you just now mentioned that left-hand column, I guess what comes to mind when you see the content that's, like, on that?

139
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.430
Moderator: bar.

140
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:41.220
Participant: Well, I like how, as opposed to, you know, it gives you a way to confirm

141
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.830
Participant: All the steps that are required.

142
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:49.010
Participant: And maybe allows you to, To be better prepared.

143
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.960
Participant: Because you can kind of get an idea of what you're going to need to complete the process.

144
00:14:53.590 --> 00:15:00.380
Participant: If it was… if that wasn't it, and it only had, like, we're on step one, and all it had was veteran details.

145
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:04.870
Participant: you know, by the time I got to step 4, I may not have the supporting evidence I need.

146
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.100
Participant: Because I didn't realize it until, you know, I got to that point.

147
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:21.120
Moderator: And actually, just about what you've just mentioned, what do you notice about, kind of, how the parts are, like, labeled? Is there anything there that.

148
00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.609
Participant: Is helpful, or what do you think they mean?

149
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:33.040
Participant: Let's see here… additional information… I think it's pretty self-explanatory.

150
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:37.300
Participant: I don't quite understand what the mental health statement is, just by…

151
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:46.330
Participant: you know, seen it as step 3. I understand what the conditions will be. Supporting evidence makes sense, additional information.

152
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.070
Participant: Review and submit.

153
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.959
Participant: But yeah, the mental health statement.

154
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.830
Participant: I don't really know what that is.

155
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.019
Participant: So I'd have to wait until I actually got to that step.

156
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.780
Moderator: To figure it out.

157
00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:09.170
Moderator: Got it, that's definitely good to know. And, since you mentioned, especially the fact that they start with step, how do you interpret the word step here? Like, what do you think that means?

158
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:14.779
Participant: Based on the number, it's the,

159
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.880
Participant: And in this case, you know, step one indicates to me it's the first thing I have to do.

160
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.349
Participant: In the process of filling out this form.

161
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:36.919
Moderator: Alright, that's perfect. Alright, so now we're gonna go ahead and go to some of the next sections. So you can go ahead and click that continue button.

162
00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:42.930
Participant: Okay.

163
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:59.880
Moderator: Alright, and so take a few seconds to similarly kind of skim this page. I won't ask you any questions yet, but once you're done reading, you can then go ahead and select a radio button later on.

164
00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.819
Participant: Okay, you can claim a condition that isn't listed.

165
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:11.790
Participant: Okay, so… Looks like they must have some preloaded conditions. If yours isn't on there…

166
00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.940
Participant: And you can go ahead and, let's like, manually enter it.

167
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:24.910
Participant: There's some, examples of conditions… New condition…

168
00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:32.010
Participant: Alright, looks pretty… It looks self-explanatory.

169
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:44.009
Moderator: Right, so actually here at the bottom, we're going to have you enter the condition tinnitus, so if you click on the box, it'll populate automatically, yep, perfect. And then you can click save.

170
00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.870
Participant: Okay.

171
00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.690
Moderator: Perfect. Alright, and you can go ahead and click continue.

172
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:12.960
Moderator: Alright, so on this page, before you click on anything, so don't click on anything yet, take a minute to just kind of talk me through what you're seeing on this page, and here I'm going to ask a couple of questions.

173
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:20.520
Participant: Okay, so it looks like… Based on the tendonitis that I selected, Previous, it's…

174
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:26.640
Participant: Asking… going into more detail on that particular… Condition.

175
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:33.240
Participant: So I see it's asked me what caused it… And given me some options.

176
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.600
Participant: Like, right off bat, without reading those 3 options.

177
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.350
Participant: I feel like I'm already limited.

178
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:45.300
Participant: On what may or may not cause a condition.

179
00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.440
Participant: But, you know, again, I haven't read through all 3 of them.

180
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:53.430
Participant: So, caused by an injury during my military service, just the before.

181
00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:59.009
Participant: The worst… It was caused by an injury event that happened when I was receiving VA care.

182
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.240
Participant: Okay.

183
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.340
Moderator: Alright, so, on this page, I'm gonna ask you a couple questions. So, what step are you on?

184
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:16.570
Participant: I am on… A sub-step of step two.

185
00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.710
Moderator: And how do you know that you're on step 2?

186
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.929
Participant: Because it's highlighted in that left-hand column.

187
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:30.049
Moderator: Okay, is there anything about, or actually, I should say, what do you mean by highlighted?

188
00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.650
Participant: It's in… it's bold.

189
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.609
Participant: Compared to the rest of the… on the list.

190
00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.080
Moderator: And then, what steps have you, finished?

191
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.550
Participant: It looks like step one is finish, not…

192
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:50.010
Participant: And I'm assuming it is because it's… blue.

193
00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.239
Participant: So the font, yeah, the color of the font's different.

194
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.179
Moderator: Okay.

195
00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:00.110
Moderator: And similarly, what steps do you still need to do?

196
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.879
Participant: 3, 4, and 5, and 6.

197
00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.260
Moderator: Okay, and how do you know that those are the steps that you still need to do?

198
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.989
Participant: Because they're in that order.

199
00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.599
Participant: And knowing, due to, the…

200
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.289
Participant: being bold, as well as this bar right here, that I'm on step 2.

201
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.700
Moderator: Got it.

202
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:31.809
Moderator: And so, is there anything around, how step 3, 4, and 5 are that lets you know that those are the ones that you still need to do?

203
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:36.120
Participant: Other than… You know, not being blue in color.

204
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.700
Participant: No, not really. And actually.

205
00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:45.689
Participant: for, like, step one, since I'm not familiar with the form.

206
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:49.139
Participant: Like, I'm assuming that is completed?

207
00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:52.909
Participant: But I'm not sure if I could go to, like, step 4 right now.

208
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:56.710
Participant: You know, or go to step 5.

209
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.259
Participant: Without completing Step 1 or 2.

210
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:09.140
Moderator: you kind of beat me to it already, because the next question I was going to ask was, let's say that you wanted to skip ahead to that review and submit page. How would you do that?

211
00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:13.700
Participant: First thing I would do is just try to click on it.

212
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.830
Moderator: I don't think it…

213
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:22.770
Participant: really has given me that option. So, I would probably… sounds like I'd have to just hit continue several times till I got to it.

214
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:33.659
Moderator: Alright, and so, sorry, I'm just reviewing here some of my questions.

215
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:48.969
Moderator: Alright, so I think we can kind of go ahead towards the next part. So here, the follow-up questions about tinnitus, you can go ahead and select the radio button that says, my condition was caused by an injury or exposure.

216
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:49.990
Participant: Okay.

217
00:21:50.100 --> 00:22:01.719
Moderator: Alright, and then you can also click on the box below, and the description will show up. There we go. And you can go ahead and click continue.

218
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:19.480
Moderator: Alright, so similarly, you can just take a few seconds to kind of read this page. I won't ask you any questions about this page, and so once you're done reading, you can then go ahead and select, one of the options below.

219
00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.819
Moderator: And I'll wait until you're kind of finished reviewing this page.

220
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.170
Participant: Hmm.

221
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.070
Participant: Okay…

222
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.220
Participant: Yes…

223
00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.580
Moderator: So here, you can go ahead and select the no button once you're done reading.

224
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:47.960
Participant: Okay.

225
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.720
Participant: I'm surprised that it gives you that option.

226
00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:58.190
Moderator: Oh, good.

227
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:59.759
Participant: For tendonitis.

228
00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.780
Participant: That it's going into…

229
00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:03.930
Moderator: Hmm.

230
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.529
Participant: a mental health… or a metal… Yeah, mental health statement.

231
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.710
Participant: for tinnitis.

232
00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.330
Moderator: That's a great point.

233
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:20.840
Participant: Considering, like, even the paragraph that, you know, under where to consider, when to consider adding it.

234
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.369
Participant: pretty much tells you you don't need it for 10… it doesn't seem to fall into…

235
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:34.300
Participant: So it's almost like… Has nothing to do with what you're trying to do.

236
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:40.030
Moderator: And so, would you say, because of…

237
00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:44.870
Moderator: Not kind of understanding the relationship between the two,

238
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.130
Moderator: Going through this step, do you still understand that, like, how to fill it out?

239
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:53.610
Participant: Yeah, I do.

240
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.889
Participant: But I would be… I would say that…

241
00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:00.120
Participant: Because it's given you the option to add it.

242
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:02.939
Participant: You know, part of you is reserved

243
00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:10.369
Participant: on whether you should add it or not, even though, you know, it gives you a description up here. It just feels like, okay…

244
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.000
Participant: If I don't add this… like…

245
00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.910
Participant: I think it leaves you… with some questions.

246
00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.140
Moderator: Makes sense.

247
00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.639
Moderator: Alright, so now you can go ahead and click continue.

248
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:37.209
Participant: Alright, so we're going to focus on this page, similar to before, just talk me through what you're seeing, but don't click on anything yet.

249
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.560
Participant: Okay, supporting evidence.

250
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.979
Moderator: If you could talk out loud, just kind of any thoughts or questions that you have.

251
00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.100
Participant: Okay, I think, I mean, I like how it gives you some ideas of

252
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.869
Participant: Of, supporting evidence to… to submit.

253
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.700
Participant: So I think that's a good thing.

254
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.039
Participant: And it's pretty self-explanatory, other than that, yes or no.

255
00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:17.940
Participant: I'm assuming if you hit yes, that's gonna give you an option to either attach You know,

256
00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.189
Participant: A statement, or whatever… whatever supporting documents you have.

257
00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.500
Participant: Or it's gonna ask you that when you hit continue for the next…

258
00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:46.070
Moderator: Right, so let's say that, you know, imagine that you realize that you might have entered an old email address, and you wanted to double check and see if you needed to update it, if that was the case. What would you do from here? Like, kind of talk me through it.

259
00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:49.450
Participant: I would go back to Veterans Details.

260
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.220
Participant: And I remembered on, on the second… Page of that.

261
00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.379
Participant: It gave you an option to edit your point of contact information.

262
00:26:01.910 --> 00:26:07.460
Participant: So I would probably… Click on, Veteran Detail Step 1.

263
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:14.899
Participant: And look at that, and then hit the continue button to the next one where it allowed… it gave you the option to edit.

264
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:22.829
Moderator: Got it, so you remember that it was on the second page of Step 1 Veteran Details.

265
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:23.660
Participant: Yes.

266
00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:32.980
Moderator: And so, if you were to click on Step 1 Better Details, what would you expect to happen after selecting that?

267
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.260
Participant: I'll probably go back to that very first page.

268
00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:44.619
Participant: Which would be kinda, like… You know, it'd be interesting that if, when you hovered over Step 1.

269
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:49.619
Participant: Or if you clicked on it, that it gave you a drop-down.

270
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.989
Participant: Or you could go directly to that second page of it, edit your details, but…

271
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:04.410
Participant: But yeah, I would expect it to go to that very first page, to where I would go… have to go kind of through that process again to get Step 2.

272
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:08.210
Participant: Or, excuse me, page 2.

273
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:14.940
Moderator: No, that makes a lot of sense, and I think that's a great idea. Has there been any form or any, like.

274
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:27.910
Moderator: process that you've done, that has done that kind of, like, drop-down opening up? Like, it seems like it's, something that you're familiar with. Have you seen that done other… in other forums?

275
00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:31.200
Participant: Yes, but not necessarily VA-related, but…

276
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.040
Moderator: Yeah, it seems like a pretty common practice, and…

277
00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:38.280
Participant: most… Most websites, or most apps.

278
00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:41.910
Moderator: That makes a lot of sense.

279
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.899
Participant: You know, especially, like, You see a lot when shopping, also.

280
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:49.900
Moderator: Hmm, and shopping, that's an interesting one.

281
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:56.350
Participant: Well, and because I, you know, I have a motorcycle shop, I sell products.

282
00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:03.720
Moderator: Oh, that makes sense. Then you're, like, familiar with, kind of, some of the other ways or best practices that are used.

283
00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.270
Participant: Yeah, and to a small extent, yes.

284
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:12.790
Moderator: Well, I'm glad that we have that recorded, because I think that's a great idea.

285
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:21.559
Moderator: Alright. So, you can then now actually go ahead and click on the Step 1 Veteran Details.

286
00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:29.180
Moderator: Kind of following that hypothetical scenario that you're going back and, updating that email address.

287
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:30.190
Participant: Okay…

288
00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:37.370
Moderator: So same here, kind of without clicking on anything yet. What are your first thoughts on being able to update your email address?

289
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.500
Participant: My first thoughts is that…

290
00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.770
Participant: If I'm not careful, I'll be trying to call this number right here.

291
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.800
Participant: Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 9pm.

292
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.240
Participant: Because I'm trying to update some personal information.

293
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:53.290
Moderator: Hmm,

294
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:58.290
Participant: Yo, I may not go back, like… You know…

295
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.420
Participant: I kind of felt like that was, a problem.

296
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.190
Participant: From the very first time we viewed this page.

297
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:16.070
Moderator: To clarify, it's, the problem is that the number is kind of conflicting with Actually completing the form.

298
00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:22.230
Participant: Well, yeah, if you have to use… if you have to actually, like, stop in the form and…

299
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.960
Moderator: Call a, you know, make a phone call to update your personal information.

300
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:36.570
Participant: And as a matter of fact, this almost… This almost, conflicts with… the next page.

301
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:49.400
Participant: Because this is telling you, you need to call this number Monday through Friday to update your personal information, but when I hit continue, it gives me to the next page where I can actually edit and update some information.

302
00:29:52.540 --> 00:30:09.820
Moderator: That's a great point. So, basically that, you know, the note seems to be primarily relevant for, kind of, this page, where you don't really have, kind of, much option to edit, but the fact that it's not telling you that on the next page there is personal information that you can edit is, like, misleading.

303
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:10.490
Participant: Dang.

304
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.830
Participant: And, and honestly,

305
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Participant: the fact that you gotta call the VA would be pretty discouraging, I think, to… like, I would probably… I might be like, you know what?

306
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.799
Participant: I'm not doing this right now, because it's probably going to take…

307
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:27.990
Participant: a long time, I'm probably gonna get…

308
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:33.170
Participant: you know, transferred several times, maybe disconnected. It's not… yeah.

309
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:38.650
Participant: So, if anything, I think it would discourage some veterans from Going forward.

310
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.340
Participant: If they feel… if you have to make a phone call to… Continue the process.

311
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.929
Moderator: Yeah, that's understandable.

312
00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:51.240
Moderator: Alright, so we're gonna have you go ahead and click continue so that you can edit that email address.

313
00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:51.900
Participant: Okay?

314
00:30:54.390 --> 00:31:00.149
Moderator: So here, when you click on the edit button, it will kind of do it automatically.

315
00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.899
Moderator: So you can go ahead and click save.

316
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.300
Moderator: Oh, is the save button?

317
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.330
Moderator: Not working, let's see.

318
00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:31.919
Participant: There we go.

319
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:37.979
Moderator: Alright, and so we're gonna pause here for a second.

320
00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:46.350
Moderator: So, if you wanted to return to the part of the form that you were previously on, what would you do?

321
00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:53.040
Participant: Let's see, I'll go back to this left column… And…

322
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.489
Participant: I think I was in, you know.

323
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.509
Participant: It's showing that I made it to step 4, so that's probably where I was.

324
00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:03.160
Participant: So, that's probably… I would click on that to get back to that.

325
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:09.479
Moderator: And what about it lets you know that you were probably on step 4?

326
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.790
Participant: The, the different colored font.

327
00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:18.480
Moderator: And by the different color, you mean kind of the fact that it's blue?

328
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:22.649
Participant: Yeah, the fact that it's blue and all the previous steps that were completed are blue.

329
00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.529
Participant: And then the, you know, the remaining steps are still black.

330
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:39.360
Moderator: Alright, and then… is there anything that makes you think that you would be able to go back to Step 4? You mentioned, kind of, the blue, is there anything else?

331
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.200
Participant: That would allow me to?

332
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:47.480
Moderator: That makes you think that you'd be able to go back to Step 4?

333
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:53.569
Participant: Well… basically, the fact that I was able to go back to step one.

334
00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.750
Moderator: From…

335
00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:55.940
Participant: Step 4.

336
00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:59.969
Participant: Tell, you know, answer the question that… that kind of arose earlier.

337
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.449
Participant: of whether I can go ahead, jump ahead.

338
00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.399
Participant: Or, you know, if I can switch between steps during, you know, without completing the entire form.

339
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:19.890
Moderator: So now we can go ahead, and you can go ahead and select Step 4, Supporting Evidence, to go back to where you were.

340
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:31.169
Participant: I was just double-checking if I had to, like, save anything from that last page before I went forward.

341
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:46.220
Moderator: So once again, here, I'm just gonna ask you to kind of skim through the page, I won't ask you any questions, and then when you're ready to go, you can click on the no option below.

342
00:33:55.770 --> 00:34:07.109
Participant: Is there… like, I feel like I have seen this… this actual… this app, or this… electronic process.

343
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.069
Participant: And I can't remember, like, if you were able to, like, link to your medical records.

344
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:14.980
Moderator: Yes, that is an option.

345
00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:15.949
Participant: Okay.

346
00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:34.939
Moderator: And for the purposes of kind of creating a shorter version, that's why we have you select no, but yes, if you were to actually select yes for this question, you would then be able to either link your VA medical records, or even upload or have the VA contact your medical provider for those records.

347
00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:36.609
Participant: Yeah, that's a great feature.

348
00:34:39.229 --> 00:34:42.429
Moderator: Well, whenever you're ready, we can go ahead and click continue.

349
00:34:45.579 --> 00:34:50.429
Moderator: Kind of similarly here, you can just kind of scan the page.

350
00:34:51.569 --> 00:34:53.869
Moderator: And then click Continue once you're ready.

351
00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:05.270
Participant: Oh, one thing that arises is if I have different account information, I'm not seeing an option to

352
00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:07.219
Participant: Edit it or change it.

353
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.000
Participant: I guess you'll just have to add a new account.

354
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.009
Participant: So that makes sense. Okay.

355
00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.599
Moderator: You can click continue when you're ready.

356
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:25.460
Participant: Okay.

357
00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:38.699
Moderator: Alright, and so here we're going to kind of focus on this page, so take a minute to kind of read through the page, and then I'll have some questions for you.

358
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:48.359
Participant: Okay, review and submit. Details, conditions… Don't click on anything, right?

359
00:35:50.090 --> 00:36:00.340
Moderator: In this case, you can actually click on, certain parts, just make sure to kind of not click on either the back or continue yet.

360
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:01.310
Participant: Okay.

361
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:06.919
Participant: Okay, that's good.

362
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.439
Participant: One thing I do like is how it doesn't leave the page.

363
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.690
Moderator: Hmm.

364
00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.219
Participant: That's just a drop-down.

365
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:27.429
Moderator: You always feel like if it leaves a page that, you know what?

366
00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.940
Participant: You're gonna have to click a hundred times to get back to where you were.

367
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.530
Participant: Or you somehow lose something.

368
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.730
Participant: Okay, it's pulling evidence…

369
00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.440
Participant: And it gives it… and I like how it allows you to have the edit option.

370
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.060
Participant: When you drop down.

371
00:36:50.380 --> 00:37:01.450
Moderator: So, actually, on that note, I'm gonna throw kind of another hypothetical scenario. So, let's say that you wanted to add another condition to this claim. How would you do that?

372
00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:10.769
Participant: I think I feel like I have two different options. I could either go back here to the left-hand column and click on Conditions.

373
00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:19.790
Participant: again, or… Under conditions here… No, actually…

374
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:22.859
Participant: I feel like the drop-down here…

375
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:26.350
Participant: Would be editing this particular condition.

376
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:30.700
Participant: So, if I wanted to add a condition, I would probably go back up here…

377
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:34.269
Participant: To the left-hand column, Step 2 Conditions.

378
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.990
Participant: And… kind of try to go from there.

379
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:53.709
Moderator: Got it. So just to confirm, when you kind of opened that, tinnitus, like, dropdown, and you saw the edit button, is that what made you kind of realize that you would have to go back to, Step 2 conditions?

380
00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:04.760
Participant: Yeah, because if, if I could… if I was editing, like, multiple, you know, conditions or adding one, I feel like, the edit button would be…

381
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:10.700
Participant: oh, no, next to conditions, as opposed to next to an actual condition.

382
00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:15.450
Participant: If that makes sense.

383
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:17.859
Moderator: Yes, no, it definitely does.

384
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:25.640
Moderator: Alright, so, what we're gonna have you do is actually go ahead and click on, Step 2 Conditions, so you can go back.

385
00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:26.820
Participant: Okay.

386
00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:42.670
Moderator: All right, and so here, we're gonna kind of go through the motions a little bit of… you're going to click, on add another condition.

387
00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.330
Moderator: She'll be further down.

388
00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:58.740
Moderator: And similar to tinnitus, you're going to click on the box that shows up for under enter your condition, and it'll show up. Perfect.

389
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.569
Moderator: You can click Save.

390
00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.210
Moderator: And then click continue.

391
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:10.910
Participant: Okay.

392
00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:18.410
Moderator: Alright, and similarly here, you can select the radio button that says, my condition was caused by an injury or exposure.

393
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:30.559
Moderator: Which is that first button… yep, perfect. And then here we're just… alright, so actually, yep, here. Well then, we're going to pause for a second. Okay.

394
00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:34.789
Moderator: Let me give me one minute to just reference my notes here.

395
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:37.390
Moderator: Right…

396
00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:48.520
Moderator: And so let's say that now that you've added this, like, second condition, let's say that you wanted to then return to the review and submit page. What would you do next?

397
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:58.149
Participant: I'd be a little hesitant to… to leave this screen. Like, I feel like there should be a save button.

398
00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.270
Participant: So maybe I would, like, have to hit continue

399
00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:05.570
Participant: If… if I didn't want this page.

400
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.950
Participant: I feel like I would lose this page if I went to another step.

401
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.030
Participant: Right now.

402
00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.180
Participant: Without hitting that continue button.

403
00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:18.130
Participant: So I would just have to, like, you know, Experiment and try it.

404
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.360
Participant: Go to Review and Submit.

405
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.490
Participant: See if it's there still or not.

406
00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.879
Moderator: And I wouldn't expect it to be there, because it's like, you've…

407
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:38.050
Participant: like, you haven't… I don't feel like you've completed the process of, like, supporting documentation or the other steps that might be involved with another condition.

408
00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:51.650
Moderator: That makes perfect sense. Yeah. And so, what we're gonna do now is that we're actually going to have you go ahead and, click that review and submit button.

409
00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:08.540
Moderator: And so here, you're going to kind of review your responses, and then I'll have, like, one last question.

410
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.279
Participant: Probably the first thing I would jump to is conditions to see if that other condition showed up in there.

411
00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:20.340
Participant: Oh, there it is. Okay.

412
00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.140
Participant: Okay…

413
00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.740
Participant: I… I almost feel like…

414
00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.509
Participant: It shouldn't let you go on, add another condition.

415
00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:42.010
Participant: Unless you somehow answered whether you have supporting documentation or not.

416
00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.999
Participant: Because I feel like you'd be a, like…

417
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.939
Participant: If you… if you really wanted to include another…

418
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:57.600
Participant: Condition, you would need supporting documentation to have your best chance of getting you know.

419
00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.870
Participant: Getting it recognized and treated.

420
00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:06.629
Participant: But now you're just kind of… like, You're submitting something.

421
00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:12.170
Participant: That's probably not gonna be… not go anywhere, because there's no supporting documentation.

422
00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:28.869
Moderator: Got it. So just to confirm there, you're saying that when you added that second condition, since you didn't kind of go through all the way to step four to add supporting evidence, that makes you feel like it's less likely to get approval?

423
00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:29.970
Participant: Yes.

424
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.560
Moderator: Got it. Just wanted to make sure I interpreted that correctly.

425
00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:46.350
Participant: you know, so, like, at least an option that, like, yeah, I have no supporting documentation, okay? So you know, and you don't, erroneously, you know, submit it without, without documentation, supporting docs.

426
00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:53.819
Moderator: Got it. No, that's a great point. So you're saying that if someone were to kind of do the process that you just did of, oh, like, they've…

427
00:42:53.970 --> 00:43:07.650
Moderator: Completed a certain part of the form, they maybe add another condition, and if they're not told that they should go through the supporting, like, adding supporting evidence, that they won't know that their likelihood is kind of lower.

428
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:12.500
Participant: Right, or confirming that you have supporting documentation or not.

429
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:19.089
Moderator: That makes a lot of sense, especially since you've kind of done that for that first condition that you added.

430
00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:19.780
Participant: Right.

431
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:29.689
Moderator: So just to kind of close out here, how confident do you feel that your responses, especially the ones that you edited, were saved?

432
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:49.209
Participant: Well, when, I guess it did, it did give you actually, you know, a save button to click on, so… I was pretty confident there, or pretty confident there. On some of the other stuff, I kind of felt like, the continue button…

433
00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:53.689
Participant: By selecting continue, was also acting as a save.

434
00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.800
Participant: And so I was, you know, wasn't 100% sure

435
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.810
Participant: By hitting continue, that it was saving what I did.

436
00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:02.909
Participant: Or what I entered.

437
00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:15.259
Moderator: And so here, to kind of close out, we're going to ask you to click on that box there to… as if you're signing your name, and then click on Submit.

438
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:33.000
Moderator: Alright, so before we go on to our other concept, like, first off, you did amazing. Like, you answered even the questions that I already had, kind of, as backup, you would already go ahead and answer them, so that's… we're doing great.

439
00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:34.150
Participant: Awesome.

440
00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:44.159
Moderator: And then I'm gonna do a quick time check, so we have about 25 minutes left. Alright, so, for that first experience that you just had with this,

441
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:50.080
Moderator: prototype. What were, kind of, like, just your overall impressions of navigating the form?

442
00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:54.020
Participant: I thought it was, pretty good. I thought it was easy.

443
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:59.540
Participant: You know, it wasn't so cumbersome.

444
00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.939
Participant: Yeah, I thought it was pretty clear, and I thought it was fairly easy.

445
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:12.080
Moderator: Was there anything that was confusing about how, especially the navigation, that sidebar on the left, worked?

446
00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:20.080
Participant: No. Like, I was able to figure it out, you know, due to the changes in color. I think kind of,

447
00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:25.929
Participant: You know, it may… it may behoove to…

448
00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:29.829
Participant: Maybe make it a more contrasting color?

449
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:30.370
Moderator: Hmm.

450
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.890
Participant: Because the black and blue are kind of similar.

451
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:35.490
Moderator: Hmm.

452
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.870
Participant: I mean, I was able to do it, but somebody might not. Yeah, it might be a problem for somebody.

453
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.600
Participant: Or, like, make them all bold.

454
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.689
Participant: You know, even though Bold is showing you which one you're actually working on, but you already know, because you're on that page.

455
00:45:55.010 --> 00:46:00.609
Participant: That's great, though, you kind of remembered that when it was bold, that let you know what page you were on. Right.

456
00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:16.640
Moderator: To kind of… to close out this part of today's session, I'm going to ask you a couple of, like, scale questions. So they're all going to be on a scale of, like, 1 to 4, 1 being the least or the lowest, and 4 being the most or the highest.

457
00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.140
Participant: Okay.

458
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:29.160
Moderator: So, for our first question, on a scale of 1 to 4, how helpful was the navigation menu in helping you complete the tasks? One being not helpful at all, to 4 being very helpful?

459
00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.920
Participant: I felt, 4.

460
00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:45.660
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you had completed? 1 being not effective at all, four being very effective.

461
00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:54.130
Participant: I would say…

462
00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:06.010
Participant: You know, because, I alluded to it earlier, that just because it was highlighted didn't necessarily… I wasn't completely sure that it was completed or not, it's just that I had been on that screen.

463
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:11.130
Participant: So, I would have to say…

464
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:20.229
Participant: a 2, at least a 2, while I was not familiar, you know, doing the form. After I'd done a form before, maybe I was doing it again.

465
00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:26.280
Participant: you know, at a later date, then I'd understood that, you know, what that truly indicated.

466
00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:30.840
Moderator: That makes perfect sense. So, two somewhat effective?

467
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:36.559
Participant: Yeah. So I would say if I could add, like, you know, something that actually says completed to it.

468
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:38.220
Moderator: Got it.

469
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:46.079
Moderator: So, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you were on?

470
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:49.870
Moderator: One being not effective, four being very effective.

471
00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:50.939
Participant: 4.

472
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.949
Moderator: Okay, so very effective.

473
00:47:53.580 --> 00:48:00.870
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you still needed to complete?

474
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:04.000
Participant: Yeah, I felt like that was 4.

475
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:05.340
Moderator: Okay.

476
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:11.050
Participant: Oh, actually, I take that back, because once again, to the same thing I just mentioned, before.

477
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.420
Participant: That just because it was a different color.

478
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:15.600
Moderator: means that maybe I hadn't been there.

479
00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:19.350
Participant: But the previous steps, you know.

480
00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:24.299
Participant: I wasn't necessarily sure they were fully completed, especially if I had bounced around a little bit.

481
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:29.089
Participant: Or, you know, I had to actually leave the app and come back later.

482
00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:34.569
Participant: Just because they were highlighted. It just showed that I would actually… that I'd been on that step.

483
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:41.310
Participant: But, I didn't feel like I was fully confirming that I had completed that step.

484
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.260
Moderator: Makes sense. So, to kind of summarize that, would you say that

485
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:55.430
Moderator: The difference in color isn't kind of enough to really feel confident that… to know what steps you have completed versus which ones you haven't yet.

486
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.180
Participant: Yes.

487
00:48:57.720 --> 00:49:07.349
Moderator: And last question for this part, so similarly, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you to go back and change your answers on the form?

488
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:11.840
Participant: Pretty easy.

489
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:17.689
Participant: Yeah, so I would say a 4. I'd say a 4. Like, if you click on it, you're going back through the process, so…

490
00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:19.890
Participant: And it'll allow you to make the changes.

491
00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:21.310
Moderator: first.

492
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:22.230
Participant: So, yes.

493
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:35.319
Moderator: Or very effective, alright? And so, now we're gonna go through our next prototype. So if you're kind of back on your screen, you can go ahead and click continue to the next prototype that's on there.

494
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:47.259
Moderator: Might take a minute to load.

495
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:36.060
Moderator: Alright, so it seems that it finished loading.

496
00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:48.460
Moderator: Okay, so we're going to start the same way. You can go ahead… oh, wait, actually. Oh, I realized that it kind of skipped the sign-in screen, so even better, we're going to be able to go through this a little faster.

497
00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:58.780
Moderator: So on this page, don't click on anything yet, we're just gonna pause, and what's kind of, as you look around, what's the thing that stands out to you first?

498
00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:05.360
Participant: So, the left-hand column is…

499
00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:12.120
Participant: it's highlighted what step I'm on, and also saying, in progress.

500
00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:19.040
Participant: So that's a different way of indicating where you're at, as opposed to… During the first one.

501
00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:31.609
Moderator: On that note, could you describe, kind of, what's different, in this version in comparison to the previous one?

502
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:39.630
Participant: So, the step that I'm on is actually, has a blue background.

503
00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:48.390
Participant: And it's in bold, and it also has an additional information stating in progress.

504
00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:56.970
Participant: Other than that, everything else looks… The same.

505
00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:03.720
Moderator: And so if you wanted to move to another part of the forum, what would you do?

506
00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:11.589
Participant: Of this… oh, okay, a different step in the form?

507
00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:15.339
Participant: Okay, I would probably try to click on…

508
00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.710
Participant: Over here in a different step.

509
00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:23.539
Participant: Which I see it's not really giving me that option, so then I would have to go down here and

510
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:26.540
Participant: Start hitting continue or the back button.

511
00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:33.319
Moderator: Right, and so we're actually then gonna go ahead and do that, so when you're ready, you can go ahead and click continue.

512
00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:39.020
Participant: Okay.

513
00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:52.029
Moderator: And so, same here, I won't ask you any questions about this page, so you can go ahead and click continue. This is… this'll all be the same as the previous one when it comes to the information that's on the page.

514
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.300
Participant: Good.

515
00:52:54.210 --> 00:53:03.829
Moderator: Alright, and so here we're going to pause for a second, and so what are your overall impressions of this page? Is there anything that's different in this version?

516
00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.299
Participant: Yeah, I like it because, it's actually showing that… it's telling me that I've completed that step.

517
00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:11.870
Moderator: And…

518
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:18.100
Participant: So, you know, it's also… In blue font, rice black.

519
00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:22.190
Participant: So, yeah, I mean, that was something that we talked about. I think that's a good…

520
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.460
Participant: I like that better.

521
00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:26.970
Participant: Especially if I had to, like.

522
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.839
Participant: You know, bounce around a little bit.

523
00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.459
Participant: On the form, for whatever reason.

524
00:53:33.100 --> 00:53:36.710
Participant: Other than that… Everything else seems the same.

525
00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:45.970
Moderator: And so, similar to before, I'm gonna kind of ask you a couple of questions. So, what step are you in right now?

526
00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.080
Participant: I'm in step 2 conditions.

527
00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.159
Moderator: And how do you know that that's the step you're on?

528
00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:56.689
Participant: It's got the blue… the blue background. It's, in bold.

529
00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:00.940
Participant: The font's bold, and it also says in progress.

530
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:07.480
Moderator: And so, similarly, what steps have you done already?

531
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.000
Participant: Step one has been completed.

532
00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:13.120
Moderator: And how do you know that that step has been completed?

533
00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:14.530
Participant: It says so.

534
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:17.890
Participant: On the left-hand column under Step 1, it says Complete.

535
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.750
Moderator: Alright.

536
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:23.349
Participant: As well as being in blue, the font… the color of the font's different.

537
00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:31.570
Moderator: And similarly, let's say that you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

538
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:39.260
Participant: I would… Have to go… like, so it doesn't give me the option?

539
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:46.320
Participant: If I hover over it on the left-hand column, so I'd have to go down here, to continue.

540
00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.130
Participant: Let me just start clicking continue until I got there.

541
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:55.210
Moderator: And what helped you understand whether that step was available or not?

542
00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:01.769
Participant: Well, usually, like, if a step's available, you know, you have the, the pointer.

543
00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:03.820
Participant: auction.

544
00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.709
Participant: And it, you know, it highlights it some way or form.

545
00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:16.120
Participant: If you hover over it, you know, it's doing nothing, so… Live link or anything.

546
00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:21.709
Moderator: And by pointer, you mean the cursor? Like, when you kind of hover over it?

547
00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:40.539
Moderator: All right, let's see, I'm doing a quick time check. We have a little over 10 minutes left, so, okay, we're gonna go ahead and have you, click on the, enter your condition box, so same as before, it's gonna then add tinnitus.

548
00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:42.939
Moderator: And then you can click Save.

549
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:54.480
Moderator: And then… What we're actually going to do, let's see… yep, just keep going through the rest of it.

550
00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.020
Moderator: So you can go ahead and click continue.

551
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:08.800
Moderator: On here, you can also click, again, the no, I don't want to add this form. Oh, wait, oh, because it added the…

552
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:16.530
Moderator: Yep, so actually here, same as before, you can click on that first option, that my condition was caused by an injury or exposure.

553
00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.600
Participant: Nope.

554
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:23.210
Moderator: Keep going…

555
00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:33.690
Participant: Okay, so we're back to this again, okay.

556
00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:45.189
Moderator: Yep, you can just go ahead and click no. Here, I'm just kind of having you go through the motions so that we get… can get to the end before… and have a couple questions before we have to kind of close out during today's session.

557
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.730
Participant: Okay.

558
00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:51.560
Moderator: And so here, similarly, for supporting evidence, you can select no.

559
00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.189
Moderator: Go ahead and click continue.

560
00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:12.300
Moderator: Alright, and so now that we're on the last page…

561
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:18.319
Moderator: Let's say that you wanted to add another condition. How would you do that?

562
00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:23.510
Participant: I would go back up here to Conditions.

563
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.810
Participant: Click on Step 2.

564
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:28.330
Participant: On the left-hand column.

565
00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:40.619
Moderator: Alright, and so similar to before, if you were to kind of review your responses here, how confident do you feel that your… the responses that, let's say, you would have edited were saved?

566
00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:49.609
Participant: Well, I guess I could just use the drop-down, you know, so…

567
00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.030
Participant: I did.

568
00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:57.819
Participant: Answers that question.

569
00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.410
Participant: I know I didn't select this, so… That's correct.

570
00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:09.610
Participant: Yeah, I think, the drop-down box is… actually…

571
00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:17.089
Participant: are good, you know, doing what they're supposed to do. They're allowing you to review and confirm

572
00:58:17.490 --> 00:58:20.749
Participant: That you've, submitted what you wanted to submit.

573
00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:22.840
Moderator: Alright.

574
00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:38.409
Moderator: Perfect. So, I have a couple of questions, similar to before, about this particular, design. So, what would you say are just kind of your overall impressions of this version, especially in comparison to the previous one that you used?

575
00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:40.810
Participant: I think it's better.

576
00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:44.120
Moderator: How come?

577
00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:49.220
Participant: I think… It doesn't leave,

578
00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:56.899
Participant: it doesn't leave you guessing on certain things, you know? It's, you know, you can quickly get a visual confirmation.

579
00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.520
Participant: That I completed every step.

580
00:59:01.290 --> 00:59:07.840
Participant: You know, I think the, you know, of course, the only difference really was that left-hand column, but I think that was a big enough difference

581
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.229
Participant: To, make it, you know.

582
00:59:11.410 --> 00:59:13.510
Participant: I think it's way better than the other option.

583
00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:21.339
Moderator: And what are maybe some of the things that this design does more successfully than the other one?

584
00:59:21.540 --> 00:59:26.389
Participant: I think the biggest thing was by letting you know in progress or completed.

585
00:59:27.180 --> 00:59:31.739
Moderator: So seeing that kind of, like, text that literally says, in progress and complete?

586
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:33.750
Participant: Yes, for me, definitely.

587
00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:35.520
Participant: And, yep.

588
00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:44.059
Participant: you know, I think the, the change of the color of the font is a good thing also, but the other one was doing that too, so…

589
00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.059
Participant: You know, I think that's something both of them did well.

590
00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:55.830
Participant: And it just seems a little easier to, like, so step 6, you know, that I'm in progress right now.

591
00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:01.109
Participant: As opposed to just having a bar on the side of it.

592
01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:07.890
Participant: you know, I guess the other one was bolded too, but I like the blue background. It just gives you a more quicker visual.

593
01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.280
Participant: a confirmation that… That's where you're at.

594
01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.279
Participant: Or that it's still not completed.

595
01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:26.740
Moderator: Got it. So, saying that, kind of, that this blue background is kind of more effective at letting you know where you are on the form in comparison to, like, the bar from the previous version?

596
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:34.060
Participant: Yes. They were both a bold, font, but yeah, this is, definitely easier.

597
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:38.290
Participant: That just feels more… More natural, more efficient.

598
01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.260
Moderator: Alright, was there anything confusing or unexpected about how that sidebar, like, navigation worked?

599
01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:51.130
Participant: No.

600
01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:53.270
Participant: No?

601
01:00:54.090 --> 01:01:13.120
Moderator: And then, is there anything that you would change or add to this design? You know, you gave us a couple of recommendations from the previous version. You actually mentioned, like, oh, it would be great if it said complete, and now this version actually does say complete. Is there anything here that you think could be better, or that you would add or change?

602
01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.570
Participant: I think,

603
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:21.080
Participant: You know, part of me still feels that it should have, like, a subcategory if, for whatever reason, there's

604
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:24.689
Participant: More than one page, or more than one step.

605
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.619
Participant: Under that initial step?

606
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:38.829
Moderator: On that note, what about having that type of, kind of, feature, would be helpful or useful for you?

607
01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:39.950
Participant: What about it?

608
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:42.470
Moderator: Like, why do you think that would be important to add?

609
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:47.759
Participant: I think it'd be quicker, like, if I wanted, like, so if I'm in the review right now, if I wanted to go back.

610
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:53.570
Participant: and look at that page, too, of those veterans' details, I think it was, or… or of the conditions.

611
01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.550
Participant: that I could easily get… get to it And save a step.

612
01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:03.079
Moderator: Alright, perfect, that makes a lot of sense.

613
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:18.380
Moderator: And so, to make sure that we close out with enough time left, I'm gonna go through the scale questions again, but for this design. So, similar to before, it's gonna be on a scale of 1 to 4, 1 being the least, 4 being the most.

614
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:25.399
Moderator: So, on a scale of 1 to 4, how helpful was this navigation menu in helping you complete the tasks?

615
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:27.410
Participant: I'd say 4.

616
01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:35.329
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you have completed?

617
01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:36.900
Participant: 4?

618
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:43.829
Moderator: And then, similarly, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you were on?

619
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:45.820
Participant: I would say a 4.

620
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:53.650
Moderator: And how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you still needed to complete?

621
01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.329
Participant: I would say a 4.

622
01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:05.019
Moderator: And last question, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you to go back and change your answers on the form?

623
01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:17.989
Participant: It worked the way, you feel like it should, so it seemed natural that if I wanted to make a change, I could just go, you know, click on Step 3.

624
01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.710
Participant: And… I was able to make the change.

625
01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:25.219
Participant: So it didn't actually, like, say you could do that, or…

626
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:28.379
Participant: But you could assume that it would, and it did.

627
01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:33.180
Participant: So, I think it was kind of like… it was… it was natural, and it worked the way…

628
01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:35.259
Participant: You would naturally think it would.

629
01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:47.229
Moderator: Actually, that's a great note, thank you for mentioning that, that it's like, that even though it didn't give you instructions or kind of tell you that you could, that based on your assumption, that's how it would work.

630
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:49.680
Participant: Yeah, it was intuitive, I thought.

631
01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.460
Moderator: Alright, great to hear.

632
01:03:52.790 --> 01:04:05.210
Moderator: Okay, and so that rounds out the questions that we have for today's session. Before we finish, I'd like to just reconfirm that you're okay with us having recorded today's conversation.

633
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.690
Participant: Yes.

634
01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:23.339
Moderator: Perfect. And so, first off, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is extremely helpful, especially as we're going to kind of continue to work on making the site and VA.gov as a whole, as best as it can be for veterans.

635
01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:36.989
Moderator: A couple of last-minute notes, Purigion will be sending you a thank you note with kind of a little message that you can then pass along to other veterans that you may know, to also give them the chance to participate in future research studies.

636
01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.190
Participant: Okay.

637
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:49.449
Moderator: Alright, so once again, thank you so much, Pat. I don't think there's anything else that we need on our end before we close out. Is there any kind of last thoughts or comments from your end?

638
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:53.669
Participant: No, I just want to thank you guys for all your hard work, and I think you're doing a great job.

639
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:55.120
Moderator: Amazing.

640
01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.320
Participant: Thanks for the opportunity.

641
01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:03.099
Moderator: Oh, and actually, I just realized, because thankfully someone let me know on the back end.

642
01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:18.280
Moderator: So for the last question that I asked about, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you to go back and change your answers on the form, I realized we didn't get to really complete, kind of, a task of you going back, so…

643
01:05:18.510 --> 01:05:24.970
Moderator: But if, let's say, you were to scale it on a 1 to 4, how would you rate it?

644
01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:26.010
Participant: 3.

645
01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:27.640
Moderator: Alright.

646
01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.120
Moderator: Sounds good.

647
01:05:29.370 --> 01:05:35.599
Moderator: All right, well, I think now we can kind of officially close out. Thank you so much again, Pat. I hope you have a good rest of your day.

648
01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.379
Participant: You too, man, thank you guys.

649
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.000
Moderator: Thank you.

650
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:43.140
Participant: Alright, goodbye.
