00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.910
Moderator: Alright, are you comfortable with us recording your screen and audio for today's session?

2
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.390
Participant 4: Yes, I am.

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.240
Moderator: Awesome, thank you.

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:23.290
Moderator: All right, so we'll go ahead and get started with some warm-up questions here. So you had mentioned that you filled out the disability benefits form in the past. Can you tell me a little bit about your experience filling out the form?

5
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:33.780
Participant 4: I didn't know what to expect when I started filling out the form, and so it's…

6
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.979
Participant 4: I was kind of relying on it to… to flow.

7
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.400
Participant 4: You know, things you have in the military, you have, like, a header, you have bullet comments, and you… you go down with the flow, and it,

8
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.800
Participant 4: Honestly, didn't always work like that.

9
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.900
Moderator: Okay.

10
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.230
Participant 4: You would have to go back and, and, and, go somewhere else.

11
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.299
Participant 4: To file this bit of information, or to find that bit of information, And it,

12
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.520
Participant 4: Actually, it took me longer than expected to navigate.

13
00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.499
Moderator: So it sounds like you filled it out online, is that correct?

14
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.210
Participant 4: Yes.

15
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.910
Moderator: Okay, and, did anybody help you fill it out, or did you fill it out by yourself?

16
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.859
Participant 4: No, I filled it out by myself.

17
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.930
Moderator: Okay.

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:36.870
Moderator: All right. And so you mentioned that it did take you a little longer than expected to navigate it. Can you tell me a little bit more about when you're filling out, like, a long form online, like the disability benefits form? How do you usually keep track of where you are and what you have left to do on the form?

19
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.169
Participant 4: Sometimes, believe it or not, I would print stuff out, sometimes I would use screenshots.

20
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.500
Participant 4: Just to track myself, because I would have…

21
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.310
Participant 4: I didn't do it all in one day. It took me, actually, about 2 weeks.

22
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.019
Participant 4: And so I would go and find this information in my medical records.

23
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.790
Participant 4: To get back to that, I would have to refer to a screenshot.

24
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.329
Participant 4: Click until I got to there.

25
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.350
Participant 4: Scroll down to find out, and then go ahead and enter this information.

26
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.660
Participant 4: That's pretty much how I kept track.

27
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.700
Moderator: Okay, absolutely, yeah, it sounds like that you want to be very thorough when you're filling out this form.

28
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.470
Participant 4: Yeah, you do, and that's part of the requirements of dealing with the government, or…

29
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.839
Participant 4: Or what, but you do, you want to give them all the information that they need to work with

30
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.939
Participant 4: So that they can evaluate you.

31
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.350
Participant 4: your claim…

32
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:43.490
Moderator: Absolutely. Okay, and what helps you feel confident that you're making progress when you're filling out, like, either the disability benefits form or any other form online?

33
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.370
Participant 4: Well, that's… To be honest, what I like sometimes is,

34
00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:02.340
Participant 4: Like a line, a line with a green marker or indicator that shows, you know, oh, you're about 50% done, or you're starting to get, you know, maybe there's light at the end of the tunnel, you know, and…

35
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.599
Participant 4: That's just what I like, but…

36
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.520
Moderator: Sure, absolutely. So it sounds like you're looking for, like, a percentage or some type of visual cue to let you know that, like, you're… you're moving along.

37
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.780
Participant 4: Exactly.

38
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.320
Moderator: Awesome.

39
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.550
Moderator: Okay.

40
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.379
Moderator: Alright, so, before we get started, are you using a desktop or mobile device today?

41
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.490
Participant 4: Desktop.

42
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.500
Moderator: Desktop. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and send you a link in the chat.

43
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:43.389
Moderator: And when you get it, you can go ahead and click on it, but don't click anything in it yet.

44
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.710
Participant 4: Okay.

45
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.719
Moderator: Let's just start with that.

46
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.510
Moderator: Okay, so you can go ahead and click on that link. It might take a little bit to load.

47
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.189
Moderator: And let me know when you can see it.

48
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.170
Participant 4: Okay, I have it, and I am going to click on it now.

49
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.200
Moderator: Okay.

50
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.929
Participant 4: You're correct, it's taking a bit to load.

51
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.070
Moderator: Okay, okay. It should look like a VA.gov website, so when you see that, just let me know.

52
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.549
Participant 4: I'm at the sign-in page.

53
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.239
Moderator: Okay, what browser are you using?

54
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.960
Participant 4: Jay Jackson, dotbit, email.com.

55
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:59.179
Moderator: Got it. Okay, so you see the signing page. Perfect. Alright, we're gonna pause there for a second. Okay, so in a minute, I'm gonna ask you to share your screen, but before we do that, please feel free to take a minute to hide anything, like your personal email or anything that you don't want us to see.

56
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:08.990
Moderator: And let me know if you need help. I'm more than happy to walk you through the steps to take to share your screen. So just take a minute to organize your desktop if you need to, and

57
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:17.379
Moderator: When you're ready, there should be a green share screen button at the bottom, and you can go ahead and click that and share the screen with that VA.gov

58
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.749
Moderator: Demo page.

59
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.720
Participant 4: Okay, now what did you need me to click on?

60
00:05:50.320 --> 00:06:06.569
Moderator: Alright, there should be a green button at the bottom of your Zoom screen that says share, so if you go ahead and click on that, and then it might ask you which screen you want to share, you're gonna select the… that VA.gov page that I sent you.

61
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.700
Participant 4: I'm not seeing the share button.

62
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:19.639
Moderator: Alright, let's see, maybe if you make your Zoom screen a little bit wider, there should be, like, a menu at the bottom with,

63
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.920
Moderator: Like, a chat, it says react, with a heart.

64
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.320
Moderator: And then there's, like, a… a button that says share, and it's green.

65
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.190
Participant 4: I'm not seeing that, let me…

66
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.420
Moderator: I'm gonna see if I can find some…

67
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.799
Moderator: Additional instructions, maybe your view might be a little bit different from mine.

68
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.299
Participant 4: No, I stop at the end of the VA menu.

69
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:44.929
Moderator: Oh, okay, so not on that screen, if you look on your, on your Zoom screen, at the bottom of, like, all of the black boxes, like, the black box, there should be a share button at the bottom of your screen to be able to share your screen so I can see what you're looking at.

70
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.069
Moderator: Alright, so as you… awesome, perfect, yes.

71
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.640
Moderator: Here we are Great! Okay.

72
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:08.240
Moderator: Alright, I'm just gonna go back here so I can take a look at what we're about to do next.

73
00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:28.849
Moderator: Okay, so, don't click on anything just yet. So here you've entered our demo page, and as I said, it's going to look a lot like the VA.gov website that you might be familiar with, and I just want to reiterate that this is a demo website, and none of the account information is from a real person.

74
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:35.149
Moderator: So, for the remainder of the session, I'd like you to imagine that you are a veteran named Jordan Jackson.

75
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:52.869
Moderator: I'll be asking you to fill out a shortened version of the disability benefits form as Jordan Jackson, and just to clarify, Jordan is not a real person, the demo or form that you are looking at is not a real application, and when you click on an area, text may automatically appear in the box.

76
00:08:53.940 --> 00:09:10.920
Moderator: So, during this session, I'll ask you to go through several screens. On some pages, I'll just ask you to click through to get to the next part, so that's going to be to help us move along, and then on other pages, I might ask you to complete a task or answer some questions, as you go.

77
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.259
Moderator: But I'll let you know, like, what we're gonna do on which screen.

78
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:25.930
Moderator: And then lastly here, I want to emphasize that you are testing the form. The form is not testing you, so please feel free to give us your honest feedback as you go.

79
00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:26.490
Participant 4: Correct.

80
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:45.679
Moderator: All right. Okay, so, we're gonna test our first concept here. So this is a sign-in screen, to help you imagine that you're logging in to the disability compensation form. And yes, and we're mostly going to be trying to understand how you navigate the form.

81
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.540
Moderator: So here, you can go ahead and click Submit.

82
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:59.330
Moderator: All right, so take a few minutes here, to talk me through, what your…

83
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.090
Moderator: What you're seeing on this page.

84
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.550
Moderator: So just share with me, as you're… as you're looking through it, what are you seeing, and what are you thinking?

85
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.540
Participant 4: Okay, having a flashback here, when I did this, it filed for disability, I see I got the right form.

86
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.800
Participant 4: We'll save your application on every change, that's good to know.

87
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.629
Participant 4: This is what we have in… on file on me.

88
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.330
Moderator: Okay.

89
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.070
Moderator: What else are you seeing here?

90
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.610
Participant 4: Yeah, and I was looking over the left, I see the…

91
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:42.259
Participant 4: form steps, and that's kind of a… lets me know where I'm at and where I'm going, okay?

92
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.650
Moderator: some pretty good information on there to have, I mean, that, you know, that it's gonna save…

93
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:55.339
Participant 4: Changes, that's important, because Some of this stuff is in-depth, and you don't want to have to do it.

94
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.610
Participant 4: Multiple times.

95
00:10:58.820 --> 00:10:59.510
Moderator: Sure.

96
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:09.959
Moderator: Alright, you mentioned the form steps there on the left side. Yes. What do you notice about how the parts of the… how the parts of the form are labeled here?

97
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:24.259
Participant 4: The veteran details, personal information, conditions, what's wrong with me, physically, mentally, and so… Mental health statement.

98
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.590
Participant 4: Got a little question mark on the… Supporting evidence, I understand.

99
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.569
Participant 4: Either gotta provide it, or…

100
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.719
Participant 4: They're gonna seek it, sending me to a doctor.

101
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:42.649
Participant 4: additional information, Not sure what that is. Review and submit.

102
00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.170
Participant 4: Okay.

103
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:51.670
Participant 4: Additional information, I guess, is with other… Info they would need, or… Beyond supporting evidence.

104
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:59.950
Moderator: Okay, and then, how do you interpret the word, step here? What does that mean to you?

105
00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:01.400
Participant 4: steps.

106
00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.330
Participant 4: Is that what you ask?

107
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.450
Moderator: Yes,

108
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.229
Participant 4: This gives me, like what we were talking about.

109
00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:19.670
Participant 4: Earlier, this gives me a visual cue as to… where I'm going… And, how my progress is.

110
00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:21.939
Participant 4: So I kind of like the steps.

111
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.290
Moderator: Okay.

112
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:33.860
Moderator: And then, don't click anything just yet, but if you wanted to move to another part of this application, what would you do?

113
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:39.049
Participant 4: What I would do is click on, like, step 3.

114
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.679
Participant 4: Step 4… And hopefully go there.

115
00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:45.260
Moderator: Okay.

116
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:46.510
Moderator: Alright.

117
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:52.890
Moderator: Okay, so… we're…

118
00:12:53.990 --> 00:13:00.010
Moderator: Okay, so we're good with this page, so you can go ahead and click continue here.

119
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.240
Participant 4: Okay.

120
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:14.860
Moderator: Alright, so now you can go ahead and take a few seconds to, skim this page. I won't ask you any questions about this page.

121
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.990
Moderator: And if you can just give me a summary of what you're seeing here.

122
00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.010
Participant 4: Okay, I'm going over my informa- contact information.

123
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:38.630
Participant 4: If you need to update your personal information, please call Veterans Benefits Assistance. Excuse me.

124
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.619
Participant 4: I can kind of understand that. At first, it's not… I don't want to say confusing, but…

125
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.750
Participant 4: you would think I could change it on here, like, if my email was…

126
00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.610
Participant 4: different or something, but I can understand that VA needs it.

127
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.649
Participant 4: And they probably need it through a central

128
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.900
Participant 4: collection spot, like Benefits Assistance 800-877-1000.

129
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.739
Moderator: But other than that, everything's self-explanatory, and it's what I would expect.

130
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.660
Participant 4: Phone and email, mailing address.

131
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:16.910

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.660
Participant 4: Okay.

135
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.860
Participant 4: Can I talk while I'm doing this? Is it…

136
00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:41.900
Moderator: Yes, absolutely.

137
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.539
Participant 4: Okay. First thing I noticed, I checked form steps, I'm in number 2.

138
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:47.660
Moderator: Okay?

139
00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:50.350

Moderator: Which is part of, like, what we're trying to gather feedback on. So, you know, you're exploring exactly as we would hope.

296
00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:11.309
Moderator: Alright, so go ahead and scroll down.

297
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.679
Moderator: Alright, okay, so we're gonna pause here for a second.

298
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.350
Participant 4: Okay.

299
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:22.409

301
00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:44.379
Moderator: And click in the box to populate it. Okay, and now we'll pause here for a second. So now you've added your second condition, and now let's say you wanted to return to the review and submit page. What would you do from here?

302
00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:47.529
Participant 4: I would click on Review and Submit, Step 6.

303
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.949
Moderator: Okay, let's go ahead and do that.

304
00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.120
Participant 4: Excuse me.

305
00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:02.339
Moderator: Alright, and now take a moment to go ahead and review your responses, and I'll have a question for you here once you do that.

306
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:08.159
Participant 4: Okay. First thing I'm gonna do is click on Conditions and see that my other condition was added. It was.

307
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:11.170
Participant 4: I'm gonna shrink that.

308
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:21.789
Participant 4: Just clicking through what's left, accounting, okay, additional information.

309
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.279
Moderator: Okay, my main thing was just to check.

310
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.100
Participant 4: That my other condition had been added to this page.

311
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:33.139
Moderator: Okay, and how confident do you feel that your responses that you edited were saved?

312
00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.370
Participant 4: Pretty good, actually.

313
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.190
Moderator: Okay, awesome. And why is that?

314
00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.490
Participant 4: Well, it, it showed up. It's, it's…

315
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.519
Participant 4: in two places. When I go Step 2 Conditions.

316
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:56.499
Participant 4: I added it, checked it, was there, saved, went on, came to review and submit, it was there as well. Gives me a warm fuzzy.

317
00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:10.910
Moderator: Awesome. Alright, we love warm fuzzies while filling out the form. We love to hear that. Alright, so go ahead, understatement of Truth, you can go ahead and click in that box, and it'll populate your name, and you can go ahead and click Submit Application.

318
00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:11.910
Participant 4: Okay.

319
00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:25.929
Moderator: Alright, so we're gonna pause here for a second. You've completed our first, prototype, or our first, concept that we wanted to test, and now I have some, post-task questions for you.

320
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.000
Moderator: Okay. So, what were your overall impressions of navigating the form?

321
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.789
Participant 4: Overall, it's easy. It flows well.

322
00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:45.149
Participant 4: if I get it, like, I started, just for example, expanding on the bullets.

323
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:51.160
Participant 4: the info wasn't there. Well, it was very easy to go back to my… Progress chart on the left.

324
00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:54.139
Participant 4: And go to the proper place, so…

325
00:30:55.370 --> 00:31:01.459
Participant 4: Like I said, I thought it was easy. It also gave me a way to check. I could go back to review after entering my other condition.

326
00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.769
Participant 4: To me, it made sense.

327
00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:10.290
Moderator: Okay. Was there anything confusing about how the navigation worked?

328
00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.880
Participant 4: Not really.

329
00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:13.220
Moderator: Okay.

330
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.720
Participant 4: like I said, other than me just expanding on those bullet comments, and then

331
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.810
Participant 4: Just exploring the page, but then being able to go back, no, that was easy, not confusing.

332
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.219
Moderator: Okay, sure.

333
00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:38.530
Moderator: Alright, so now I'm gonna ask you a few questions, on a scale from 1 to 4. 1 being, like, not helpful or not effective, and 4 being very helpful or very effective, okay?

334
00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.310
Participant 4: Okay.

335
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:45.210
Moderator: So, on a scale of 1 to 4, how helpful was the navigation menu in helping you complete the tasks?

336
00:31:45.390 --> 00:31:46.620
Participant 4: One beat.

337
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.420
Moderator: Yes, that left side navigation.

338
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:51.690
Participant 4: And one being what?

339
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:59.669
Moderator: One being it was not helpful at helping you complete the tasks, and four being it was very helpful at helping you complete the tasks.

340
00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.690
Participant 4: Or, I think it's essential in completing the task.

341
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.690
Moderator: Okay, so you said 4?

342
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.350
Participant 4: 4.

343
00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:16.600
Moderator: Okay. Alright, our next question here, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you have completed?

344
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:18.150
Participant 4: 4.

345
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.000
Moderator: Or, alright?

346
00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:28.360
Moderator: Okay, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you are on?

347
00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:29.410
Participant 4: 4.

348
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:31.320
Moderator: 4. Alright.

349
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:38.649
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you still need to complete?

350
00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.000
Participant 4: Or…

351
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.240
Moderator: 4?

352
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:50.179
Moderator: Alright, and then lastly, on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you to go back and change your answers on the form?

353
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:50.890
Participant 4: 4.

354
00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:52.480
Moderator: 4. All right.

355
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.360
Moderator: Okay.

356
00:32:54.540 --> 00:33:01.999
Moderator: So now we're going to move on to our second, concept that we're going to test.

357
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:10.399
Moderator: And we're gonna go ahead and start the same way. So, you're gonna go ahead and click on that link that says continue to the next prototype there.

358
00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.080
Moderator: And it's gonna open up another tab, yep.

359
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:37.439
Moderator: All right, so we're gonna, pause here and focus on this page. So as you read this page, can you, share out loud what you're seeing and what you're thinking?

360
00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:40.390
Participant 4: Okay.

361
00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:45.319
Participant 4: I'm trying to look at this like I haven't seen any of this before.

362
00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:49.079
Moderator: That's okay, we know you've seen it a little bit already, so

363
00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.169
Moderator: You can just be honest about what you're seeing.

364
00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.960
Participant 4: Everything looks pretty much the same. I've got this… the progress… On the left side.

365
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:10.929
Participant 4: We'll save your application. That's just important to me. We talked about that earlier.

366
00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:11.710
Moderator: Hmm?

367
00:34:11.719 --> 00:34:14.509
Participant 4: And this is the information we have on file, okay.

368
00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:19.019
Participant 4: I still have my progress on the left side, though, I see that.

369
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:25.129
Moderator: Okay, can you describe what's different on this page in comparison to the previous version?

370
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:31.650
Participant 4: Where it says Veterans Detail, there's a whole big blue block and a… a dot.

371
00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:34.580
Participant 4: Again, I keep using that thing, but it's…

372
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.870
Participant 4: We use it a lot in the Army, the bullet.

373
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.090
Participant 4: It's over there on the progress chart.

374
00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:44.939
Participant 4: And this one is different. It has a big black dot, that's where I'm at.

375
00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:49.789
Participant 4: Details in progress, okay. Haven't completed that yet.

376
00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.399
Participant 4: Looks like I haven't completed anything yet.

377
00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:58.889
Moderator: Okay, and if you wanted to move to another part of this forum, what would you do?

378
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:02.150
Participant 4: I would,

379
00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.959
Participant 4: Hopefully click on the…

380
00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:15.239
Participant 4: progress on the left side to go through it. If that doesn't work, I'd click continue and see where that goes.

381
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.310
Moderator: Okay, alrighty.

382
00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:23.640
Participant 4: just for example, if I wanted to go to mental health, I would click on Mental Health and.

383
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:28.940
Participant 4: Hopefully, it would take me there like we did before, with adding another Condition.

384
00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:30.720
Moderator: Okay.

385
00:35:31.020 --> 00:35:34.930
Moderator: Okay, go ahead and click on mental health and see what happens.

386
00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.370
Participant 4: Obviously, I was incorrect.

387
00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:43.080
Moderator: Okay, what do you think is happening there?

388
00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.459
Participant 4: I have to… do the… the…

389
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.499
Participant 4: Step one, the step that I'm on before I can move forward.

390
00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.250
Moderator: Sure. Okay.

391
00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:56.789
Moderator: Alright, go ahead and click continue here.

392
00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:07.810
Moderator: All right, you can take a few seconds to read this page. I won't ask you any questions about this page, and when you're ready, you can go ahead and click continue.

393
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.660
Participant 4: Okay.

394
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:26.330
Moderator: Alright, we are going to pause here and focus on this page. So, go ahead and read the page, and as you read it, you can, go out… go ahead and share out loud what you're seeing and what you're thinking.

395
00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.080
Participant 4: This is a little bit different, the, form steps.

396
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.380
Moderator: Okay?

397
00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.339
Participant 4: It tells me that I've completed Step 1.

398
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:43.220
Participant 4: I have not completed Step 2.

399
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.249
Participant 4: And I haven't been to any steps beyond Step 2.

400
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:49.800
Participant 4: Okay.

401
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:54.700
Participant 4: Conditions? About the same.

402
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:58.190
Participant 4: Conditions were listed, new conditions.

403
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:07.930
Participant 4: Kind of gives me a little more detail on the form steps this time.

404
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:12.789
Moderator: Okay, can you tell me a little bit more about that? Like, what details are you seeing?

405
00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:18.789
Participant 4: Okay, the big blue box is where I'm at. It's in progress, I mean, there's no doubt.

406
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:20.609
Participant 4: If I'm not paying…

407
00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:27.499
Participant 4: real good attention to that. It's a quick clue as to where I'm at and what I'm doing.

408
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:31.220
Participant 4: Shows me what I have left to complete and what I've already completed.

409
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:37.339
Participant 4: My opinion just seems to go in a little more detail than the first one.

410
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.840
Participant 4: The first one, I don't know if you recall, but we were… I was assuming…

411
00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:49.790
Participant 4: this. This is where I'm at, and this is what I would do, this is what I would click on, and this is…

412
00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:54.069
Participant 4: Just got the blue, the big black dot, in progress, complete.

413
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:58.099
Participant 4: There's… there's little doubt in my mind where I'm at and what I'm doing.

414
00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:07.300
Moderator: Okay. So you talked about, where you're at and what you've completed. How many steps have you… do you still have left to complete?

415
00:38:07.570 --> 00:38:09.430
Participant 4: I have 4.

416
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.149
Moderator: Okay. And how do you know that?

417
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:14.400
Participant 4: Oh, wait a minute.

418
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.300
Participant 4: I actually have 5.

419
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.720
Participant 4: Because Step 2 is in progress.

420
00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.710
Moderator: Okay. Alright, and how do you know that? How many steps you have left?

421
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:35.849
Participant 4: Because none of the, ones below step 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, are highlighted. Step 2 tells me I'm in progress, and that is not completed.

422
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:40.289
Participant 4: As, opposed to step one, where it says, complete.

423
00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:46.689
Moderator: Okay? And let's say you wanted to skip ahead to the review and submit page. How would you do that?

424
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:54.679
Participant 4: I was wrong last time I did this, you're really asking me to get in here. Okay, I'm assuming I would clip on…

425
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:57.219
Participant 4: Step 6, review and submit.

426
00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:58.670
Moderator: Okay.

427
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:02.920
Moderator: Alright, and I'm assuming you're clicking on it. Are you trying it out?

428
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:04.430
Participant 4: Yeah, I'm clicking on it.

429
00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:06.369
Moderator: Okay, and what do you think is happening there?

430
00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:10.420
Participant 4: It looks like the page is sleeping on me, it's not doing anything.

431
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:16.120
Moderator: You're right, it is. Okay, and why do you think that that's not available to you?

432
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:19.790
Participant 4: Once again, because I have not completed Step 2.

433
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:24.200
Moderator: Okay, Alright, so.

434
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.869
Participant 4: more stuff to review before I can go to review and submit.

435
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:39.579
Moderator: You're absolutely right. Okay, so, you can go ahead and, enter tinnitus in the condition box, so we're gonna do something very similar to what we did last time. You can go ahead and click save.

436
00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.250
Moderator: Alright, and you go ahead and click continue.

437
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:51.109
Moderator: Alright, same as before, you're gonna go ahead and click on that, first, button up there. Yep.

438
00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:51.780
Participant 4: Okay.

439
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.770
Moderator: Oh, and it's gonna pre-populate for you. Yep, go ahead and click continue.

440
00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:04.319
Moderator: Alright, and then also, same as before, for the mental health statement, you're gonna go ahead and click no.

441
00:40:08.610 --> 00:40:09.500
Participant 4: Continue.

442
00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:10.120
Moderator: Yep.

443
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:22.390
Moderator: Okay, and now we're gonna pause here for a second. So go ahead and take a few seconds to read what's going on in this page here, and then I'll have a few follow-up questions for you.

444
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:31.920
Participant 4: Okay.

445
00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.660
Moderator: Alright, what step are you on now?

446
00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:35.510
Participant 4: 4.

447
00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.209
Moderator: Alright, how do you know that?

448
00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:40.839
Participant 4: It has the big, big blue block.

449
00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:44.139
Participant 4: I round it in, it says, in progress.

450
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.969
Moderator: Okay. And, how many steps have you done?

451
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:49.570
Participant 4: Three.

452
00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:52.660
Moderator: Okay. And how do you know that you've.

453
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:54.019
Participant 4: Three of them stay complete.

454
00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.129
Moderator: Okay? And, which steps do you still need to do?

455
00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:01.899
Participant 4: I still need to do step 4, step 5, step 6.

456
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.150
Moderator: Okay. And how do you know that?

457
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.829
Participant 4: Step 4 is in progress.

458
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.640
Participant 4: It doesn't say complete like 1, 2, and 3.

459
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:10.550
Moderator: Hmm.

460
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.590
Participant 4: Step 5 is not blue, step 6 is not blue.

461
00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.230
Moderator: Okay.

462
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:21.270
Moderator: Alright, so you can go ahead and click continue here.

463
00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.180
Participant 4: Okay.

464
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:28.629
Moderator: And then you can go ahead and, scroll to the bottom there.

465
00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:30.610
Moderator: And click Continue again.

466
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:41.589
Moderator: Alright, and then we'll pause here for a second. So, you can take, a couple seconds here to, read the page.

467
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.649
Moderator: And then I'll have a few questions for you on this page.

468
00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.420
Participant 4: Okay.

469
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.709
Moderator: Okay, so let's say you wanted to add another condition, how would you go about doing that?

470
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.469
Participant 4: I'm going to go back to step two conditions.

471
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:15.689
Moderator: Okay, and why would you do that?

472
00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:23.110
Participant 4: Because I need to add another condition, and last time I clicked on to expand it, and it didn't… it didn't work.

473
00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:27.830
Moderator: Sure, sure, awesome. Okay, alright,

474
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:37.309
Moderator: Okay, those are all of the questions that I have for you here. So we're gonna pause here for a second.

475
00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:46.850
Moderator: And… So actually, if you go back to the review and submit page, yeah, so…

476
00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:53.679
Moderator: Last question here, how confident are you that your responses, here have been saved?

477
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.209
Participant 4: I'm very confident.

478
00:42:57.070 --> 00:42:58.890
Moderator: Okay, and why is that?

479
00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:10.389
Participant 4: Everything is… well, after I do step 6, but everything says complete. Veteran details are complete. I haven't left anything out.

480
00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.749
Participant 4: Same with 2, 3, 4, 5.

481
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:22.340
Moderator: Okay, awesome. So here you're looking at the form… the form steps list on the side there to… to see that everything is completed. Great.

482
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:32.809
Moderator: Okay. So, that's the end of our tasks, for this version, and now I have a few follow-up questions for you about this version.

483
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.410
Participant 4: Okay.

484
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:39.380
Moderator: So, what are your overall impressions of this version in comparison to the previous version?

485
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.310
Participant 4: I really like the form steps.

486
00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:46.240
Moderator: Okay, can you tell me a little bit, more, like, why?

487
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:51.170
Participant 4: Okay, the step I'm on, Big blue box, but has a black dot.

488
00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.040
Participant 4: I go to the next step.

489
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.319
Participant 4: That black dot goes to step 2.

490
00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.169
Participant 4: Step 1 has a blue dot.

491
00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.019
Participant 4: It turns blue.

492
00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.500
Participant 4: And it says complete. There's no doubt.

493
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.739
Participant 4: There's visual cues, there's the blue dot, there's the blue writing, there's the complete…

494
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:14.900
Participant 4: I mean, there is no doubt in my mind I'm really gonna feel good.

495
00:44:16.030 --> 00:44:26.449
Participant 4: excuse me, when everything says complete, and I move on, I have given all the information that needs to be… that is required. And the reason I know that is form steps.

496
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:28.939
Participant 4: I really like this one, this…

497
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:36.559
Moderator: Okay, awesome. Was there anything confusing or unexpected about how this navigation menu worked, this version?

498
00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.550
Moderator: Not at all.

499
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:44.469
Moderator: Okay. Is there anything you would change or add to this version?

500
00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.140
Participant 4: No.

501
00:44:53.460 --> 00:45:00.299
Participant 4: Nothing, I mean… like I said, it explains it, explains it more than once.

502
00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:03.590
Moderator: Okay.

503
00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:07.350
Participant 4: More detailed. Like I said, it says complete. I know I've completed it.

504
00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.150
Moderator: Okay.

505
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:12.930
Moderator: Alright, so I'm gonna ask you the scaled questions again.

506
00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:24.549
Moderator: So, I'm gonna ask you the questions on a scale from 1 to 4. 1 would be not helpful or not effective, and 4 is extremely helpful or extremely effective.

507
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:31.449
Moderator: So on a scale of 1 to 4, how helpful was this navigation menu in helping you complete the tasks?

508
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:35.319
Moderator: Was that 4?

509
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.080
Participant 4: Fourth.

510
00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:44.340
Moderator: 4, okay? On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you have completed?

511
00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.440
Moderator: Or?

512
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:54.020
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which step you are currently on?

513
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:55.270
Participant 4: 4.

514
00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:56.860
Moderator: Okay?

515
00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:03.450
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 4, how effective was the navigation menu at helping you know which steps you still need to complete?

516
00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:04.390
Participant 4: For…

517
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.720
Moderator: Yep.

518
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:15.399
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 4, how effective do you think the navigation menu would be at helping you go back and change your answers on the form if you had used it?

519
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.480
Participant 4: 4.

520
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:18.050
Moderator: Okay?

521
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:22.989
Participant 4: I actually think it'd be easier on this one for me to go back.

522
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.130
Moderator: previous one?

523
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:27.369
Participant 4: Yeah, the other one, I don't know if you…

524
00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:29.389
Participant 4: Really want to hear all this, but the other one.

525
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:29.760
Moderator: I do.

526
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.550
Participant 4: Landing and stuff, you know.

527
00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.660
Participant 4: Expand this, expand that… oh, that ain't working, so then I went back. This one…

528
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:41.539
Participant 4: Feels more intuitive. Go back, boom, you know?

529
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.560
Participant 4: That's just… My perception of it.

530
00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:54.440
Moderator: Okay, so it sounds like this one was, like, almost, like, more inviting for you to, like, go ahead and use it, or go back to, like, a previous section?

531
00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:55.880
Participant 4: Exactly.

532
00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.159
Moderator: Okay. Why do you think that is?

533
00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:05.119
Participant 4: I don't know. I think it's a combination of how the whole thing is set up.

534
00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:13.430
Participant 4: like I said, the colors, color code, black, blue, clear, it turned light…

535
00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.360
Participant 4: turn blue, it says complete, I mean…

536
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:23.530
Participant 4: whether I take a quick glance or whether I take time to read each step, I know what's going on, though.

537
00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.889
Participant 4: Okay. And it makes it easy, and I like that.

538
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.020
Participant 4: I like it better than the others.

539
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:31.400
Moderator: Awesome.

540
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:35.070
Moderator: Okay, great.

541
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:40.200
Moderator: Yeah, do you have any… so those were actually all of my questions, so do you have any other thoughts that you'd like to share?

542
00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.880
Participant 4: Yeah, I wish this was… this way when I did mine.

543
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.930
Moderator: We're working on it, we're working really hard, and you're contributing to that effort right now.

544
00:47:52.310 --> 00:47:53.530
Participant 4: I understand, but it…

545
00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:53.930
Moderator: Yeah.

546
00:47:53.930 --> 00:48:01.400
Participant 4: You know, it, it, this… like I said, this… because when I filled mine out.

547
00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.640
Participant 4: And they increased my… Mine, because of my…

548
00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:11.020
Participant 4: I had gotten worse, but it,

549
00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.670
Participant 4: After I… after I completed it, I…

550
00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:19.829
Participant 4: just, you know, step 6, and after I submitted, I was kind of wondering…

551
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:27.869
Participant 4: But with this, looking at complete, complete, complete, I have no one… I got it, I'm done, okay, they got the info.

552
00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.490
Participant 4: You know, and that's… That's important when you're doing this.

553
00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.380
Moderator: Okay.

554
00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:44.280
Moderator: Is there anything else that you'd like to share about how, like, what made it challenging to complete the form?

555
00:48:47.310 --> 00:48:55.390
Participant 4: One thing I think this takes away It's fear of the unknown.

556
00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.680
Participant 4: I mean, this is usually… like I said, when I first got it, I…

557
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:05.280
Participant 4: took a physical while I was…

558
00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.940
Participant 4: I want to say, well, I was… technically, I was still in the Army.

559
00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:19.580
Participant 4: I went and took a VA physical, and they actually did the filing and the… initial… findings.

560
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:25.020
Participant 4: And then later on, I had to file for… Compensation, like on this form.

561
00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:28.020
Participant 4: To get it increased.

562
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:36.850
Participant 4: So I had nothing to… Compare it to, or go by, since they had already done that.

563
00:49:38.110 --> 00:49:43.100
Participant 4: Like I said, this just makes… Makes it a lot easier.

564
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:44.690
Moderator: Okay.

565
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:55.410
Moderator: Alright, it sounds like maybe being able to preview the form steps before you, like, actually go through the form might be a little bit helpful, is that… is that right?

566
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:56.150
Participant 4: Yes.

567
00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:57.370
Moderator: Okay.

568
00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:00.160
Participant 4: It does, and it's a… it's a… you know what to expect.

569
00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:07.119
Participant 4: Gee, am I gonna have to prove that my condition has progressed?

570
00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:12.070
Participant 4: Oh, yeah, supporting evidence, yeah, I guess I do need to, you know, do that, so…

571
00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.359
Participant 4: I just like this.

572
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:15.410
Moderator: Hey.

573
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:19.659
Moderator: Yeah, thank you. Thank you for sharing that extra context there.

574
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:32.640
Moderator: Alright. So, before we finish, I'd like to reconfirm that you're okay with us having recorded today's conversation, and we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.

576
00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:58.429
Moderator: Awesome. Alright, so, before we close out, just want to thank you again for taking your time to share your thoughts with us today, Steven. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site, and make sure it really works for veterans like yourself, and hopefully we're going to be able to implement this version of the Forbes Steps navigation really, really soon.

577
00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:10.399
Moderator: And lastly, Peridian is going to be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies.

578
00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:11.510
Moderator: So…

579
00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:12.150
Participant 4: Okay, okay.

580
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.900
Moderator: So much.

581
00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.499
Moderator: Awesome. Yeah, thank you again, and…

582
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.059
Participant 4: Thank you, thank you for letting me have a voice.

583
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.930
Moderator: Awesome. Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day.

584
00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:22.039

585
00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:23.080
Moderator: Bye.
