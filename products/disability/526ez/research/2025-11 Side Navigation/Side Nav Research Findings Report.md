## Research Goals
*Provide context for this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey.*  
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey?  
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?  

[Example Research Goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals) 

## Research Questions

## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."

> 1. Duplicate the ***Template*** worksheet
> 1. Enter your participant information **(see the *Template Instructions* worksheet for details)**
> 1. Make a screenshot of the cells that you want to share and paste it into this report below
> 1. Generate an accessible version of those cells using Github Copilot Chat:
>    - Start a new Github Copilot chat
>    - Enter: "I want to convert these spreadsheet cells into a table in markdown:" 
>    - Copy and paste the cells from the recruitment checker spreadsheet that you've filled in
>    - Copy the resulting markdown table by clicking the copy icon in the Copilot chat, and paste it into this report below 
>    - (If Copilot returns an error, try using a different AI model, such as "Claude Sonnet 3.7 Thinking")

This research does not include the perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups:
