## Key Findings from Past OCTO research

  

### Finding 1  
**Before they submit, Veterans rely on the review/submit page to assure themselves that they have completed the form in its entirety. This creates confidence that what they are submitting is complete and correct.**
 **(526 Veteran Shadow Research)**  
      
    
### Finding 2
**A majority of participants who submitted their claim expected to immediately receive a confirmation email with a copy of the claim from VA**. **(526 Veteran Shadow Research)**  
      
    
### Finding 3
**Veterans want a record that shows they completed and submitted an application– in part because they do not trust VA.** **(526 Veteran Shadow Research)**  
  - “Ok, it says my application has been submitted. I was checking my email and I didn't get anything. So I'll take a picture of this page so I can see the claim number … I usually ‘favorite’ it, and check in like a week to see if it's in the system. If I had a printer I'd print it.”
  - “It was bred in to me a long, long time ago to believe in backups for everything, especially when it comes to the VA. I learned a long time ago that when it comes to voice messages and the mail that, if you don't keep a backup once, it's leaves your hands, there's really, there's no proof or record. And I guess that's why I fell in love with email cause there's always a paper trail.” **(Appeals confirmation page research)**  
      
### Finding 4 
**Veterans found the 'What to expect next' section of the confirmation page valuable, and would want to highlight the timeline for immediate expectations and the rest of the process.**(Appeals confirmation page research)**
   
-   “I would love to say, explain to me what those 7 to 10 days are those business days or those week days, you know. I know government holidays are quite extensive, I would imagine.”
    
-   “There's nothing about how long it takes. The only thing I saw was that it said 7 to 10 days to get it into the system, nothing, about 90 days. 5 years.”  
      
### Finding 5
**Veterans using screen readers expect multiple methods of contact for updates on their claim and prefer being notified by email. (Appeals confirmation page research)**
 
-   “Maybe there was a how and why would you contact it. You wanna know the status or don't agree with the status, so on so forth. I know I would. I would personally love a more direct phone number other than the general line. But I understand that that's not always possible. But yeah. The only part that I think is perhaps could be clarified a bit is the what to expect next. - P11”
    

### Finding 6
**More than anything, research participants want to know how long it will take for their claims and appeals to be decided. This is the question behind many of the other questions they have.

### Finding 7
**Veterans think about claim status in terms of what’s currently being done to the claim, the outcome of the claim, and actions standing in the way of gaining a favorable determination.****[(Claim Status Tool research)]**(https://dsva.slack.com/files/U04U1JZSY0H/F06RRET8EBX/claim_status_tool_brief_-_2024-03-01_-_rfd_ipt.pdf)  
      
    
### Finding 8 
**Veterans expect to be able to access all the data they submitted in their claim including downloading copies of files they (or VA) uploaded ([Claim Status Tool research - p24]**(https://dsva.slack.com/files/U04U1JZSY0H/F06RRET8EBX/claim_status_tool_brief_-_2024-03-01_-_rfd_ipt.pdf))
