# Known Deficiencies 
These are deficiencies that are non-blocking, in our opinion, but planned to be addressed prior to 100% release.

## Modal
We are missing a destructive action modal (alerts the user to a deletion of data that is a result of a choice that they are making/changing) in 1 area that was not identified in our original identification of areas needing destructive action modals.
