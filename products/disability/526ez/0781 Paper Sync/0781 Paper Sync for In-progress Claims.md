# 0781 Paper Sync for in-progress claims

---

## Overview
Notify Veterans with disability claims already in progress (before the 0781 Paper Sync online form release) that there is a new VA Form 21-0781 form for Statement in Support of Claimed Mental Health Disorder(s) Due to an In-Service Traumatic Event(s) that is available and what they can do if they want to answer questions to support their claim processing. 

## Problem Statement
Veterans with a 526 disability claim in progress prior to the release of the 0781 paper sync may unknowingly submit their claims without addressing new mental health-related questions included in the updated VA Form 21-0781. This issue also affects Veterans who initiated claims after the release but were not included in the canary rollout. Without awareness of the new online form, these Veterans may submit incomplete claims, leading to potential delays in claim processing. It is critical to notify impacted Veterans about the updated VA Form 21-0781, ensuring they have the necessary information to make informed decisions and avoid disruptions in their claims process. 

## Desired User Outcomes
- **Informed Decision-Making**: If notified about the updated form, Veterans will have the opportunity to make well-informed decisions regarding their claims submission.
- **Improved Claim Success Rate**: Proper notification could increase the likelihood of complete and accurate claims, ultimately reducing potential setbacks and speeding up the resolution process.
- **Enhanced Trust in the System**: Timely and clear communication about changes in the claims process may foster trust and confidence in the VAâ€™s commitment to supporting Veterans.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- **Delayed Claim Processing**: Without proper notification, Veterans may submit claims without including the necessary mental health-related information, which could result in processing delays.
- **Incomplete Claims**: Some Veterans might unknowingly submit incomplete claims, as they are unaware of the updated VA Form 21-0781 and its new requirements.
- **Frustration and Confusion**: Lack of awareness about the updated form might lead to feelings of frustration or confusion among Veterans who are navigating an already complex claims process.


## Desired Business Outcomes
- **Improved Outcomes with Proper Notification**: If the VA effectively notifies Veterans, it could result in smoother claims processing, reduced errors, and better resource allocation, leading to operational improvements and enhanced credibility.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- **Increased Claim Backlog**: If Veterans submit incomplete claims due to unawareness of the updated form, the VA may face an increase in processing delays, adding to the overall claim backlog.
- **Higher Administrative Burden**: The VA may have to allocate more resources to address incomplete claims, such as reviewing, contacting Veterans for missing information, or resubmitting forms, which could strain administrative staff and operations.
- **Reputation Impact**: Failing to notify Veterans about the updated form might result in dissatisfaction among claimants. This could impact the VA's reputation for supporting Veterans effectively and being transparent about changes.
- **Reduced Operational Efficiency**: Without proactive communication about the new form, inefficiencies could arise as claims require additional handling, leading to slower overall processing times.
- **Potential for Negative Feedback**: Unhappy Veterans who encounter delays or confusion might provide negative feedback or public criticism, which could affect trust in the organization.
