# 0781 Paper Sync Sub URLs
Below are the list of URLs that were used in the 0781 paper sync initiative.  
The user flow for filling out the 0781 data begins with the 0781 choice page and concludes after supporting evidence uploads. 
For the MVP release it used a combination of new sub-urls and existing urls from the 526 flow.
