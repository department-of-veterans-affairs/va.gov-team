# Postmortem for broken 526 wizard links

Date: 08/31/2020

Authors: Robin Garrison

Status: Resolved

## What happened?

In the afternoon (around 2 p.m. ET) of 08/27/2020, [Peggy Gannon reported](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C52CL1PKQ/p1598551064162900) that the "File a disability compensation claim" link on https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/ did not take her to the 526 form.

Within 15 minutes, the problem as relayed to Robin Garrison and he evaluated and determined that a `<button>` was being shown in the wizard instead of the expected link that directed the user to form 526's introduction page.

A [pull request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/14039) was made that checked for a "how-to" page url; but, immediately after merging the code, [John Hashimoto](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C0113MPTGH5/p1598555161047100) reported that the wizard was also broken on the eligibility page (https://www.va.gov/disability/eligibility/). So, a [second PR](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/14039) was created that instead detected if the wizard was open on 526's introduction page, and would then show the appropriate link or button.

Nick Sullivan requested an [off-schedule deploy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/compare/vets-website/v0.1.1032...184a2ec8727e4868815d78eb413c11de9a1fbf1a) that was kicked off at 4:48 p.m. ET on 08/27/2020, resolving the issue in production shortly after.

## Background

The 526 [wizard was moved into the form's introduction page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/13963) on 08/25/2020, and was put behind a feature flag. The form wizard contains three pages with links to the form's introduction page. If the wizard is visible on the introduction page, and the original link was shown to and used by the user, the link would have caused the introduction page to reload. Therefore, the wizard pages were modified to show a similarly styled button to set the wizard's visibility state instead of the link. The check for the feature flag can not easily be done on the wizard page, so the existence of a `setWizardStatus` function was (improperly) checked and if found, the button instead of the link would be shown to the user. This function is used to change a flag that hides the wizard.

## Detection

_How was the issue found?_ It was found by Peggy Gannon & John Hashimoto.

Peggy Gannon discovered the problem on the how-to page
John Hashimoto discovered the problem on the eligibility page

_Date/time of discovery_ 1:57 p.m. ET & 3:10 p.m. ET respectively

## Impact

_What was the impact on Veterans, business and team?_

Because these wizard links served as the gateway to the disability claims page, veterans would have been blocked from this path to form 526's introduction page from both the how-to page and the eligibility page. This broken link would only have prevented new users and users returning to the page without a form in progress. If the user had a form in progress, the wizard would have been replaced by the save-in-progress component with a link directly into the form.

In this time period from August 25 after 3 p.m. to August 27 around 5 p.m., there is a visible drop in the number of form 526 introduction page views on Wednesday August 26th. Around 1,000 users may have been effected.

## Root causes

_What caused this situation?_

This situation was caused by presenting the user with a button, which would only hide the wizard when visible on the introduction page, instead of a link to form 526's introduction page. The decision to show a button was made because the wizard should have already been visible on the introduction page, and having the user click a link would have caused the page to reload.

## Resolution

_What steps were taken to resolve the issue?_

The button was set to only appear on the introduction page by checking the location url.

Once the feature has been rolled out and the wizard is visible on the introduction page to 100% of users, the link to the introduction page can be completely removed.

_Date/time of resolution_ Approximately 5 p.m. ET on August 27, 2020.

## Lessons Learned

Prior to this implementation, other wizard move implementations did not include a change to that replaced the link. The link to the form introduction page would have caused a page reload. Since this change is behind a feature flag and meant to ramp up the wizard move, this change of a link to a button could have been put off until after the wizard is visible for 100% of the users.

### What went well

Root cause was discovered and resolved quickly once the issue was noticed.

### What went wrong

The issue was not noticed or flagged for almost two days. Our back-end engineer did notice a drop in submissions, but as there was a more significant drop in the previous week due to upstream services, it was thought to be related.

### Where we got lucky

Deployment resolving the issue when very smoothly and the involved engineers on VSA and VSP were all very supportive.

### Takeaways

Adding feature flags to a complicated component like the wizard isn't straight-forward. And adding unit tests to ensure all aspects of the wizard is functioning as expected behind the feature flag adds another layer of complexity; but it is a necessity to ensure that services aren't disrupted.
