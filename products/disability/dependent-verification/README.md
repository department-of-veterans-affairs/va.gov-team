# Dependent Verification
_I need periodic reminders to keep my dependent info up to date so I can avoid overpayments and related complications._

## Abstract

~5M Veterans receive C&P benefits, and 2.5M Veterans have dependents on file with the VA. The type and number of dependents affects the Veteran's C&P payments; errors in this data can lead to over or underpayments, the former resulting in debt and attendant debt management cycles. Currently VBA sends periodic paper mail to the veteran's last known home address prompting them to update their dependent info via form 21-0538; failure to respond can lead to cessation of benefits as per 38 CFR 3.500(v). VBA is proposing to modernize this process, and given completion of dependency claims work in Q4 2020, VA.gov is positioned to play a key role in this effort.

## Proposal

DEPO will run a 2-week discovery sprint which will produce 
- a prototype for a near term solution
- recommendations for a long term solution

The start date will be determined by priority against the Benefits Portfolio Roadmap, or sooner if funding is available.
