**686/Session #5/Friday, April 27, 2018, 3pm EST - Spencer**

 

Q: Can you tell me a little about yourself?

I’m 72 years of age, I’m a retired registered nurse, clinical director of a home care company. I spent my time in Vietnam as medic….1965, 67 and 68…total of 7 years in army. Upon getting out of service, got married, started school. Got my RN, my LPN, got my bachelor’s then I got my master’s I have 2 and 11 grandchildren. Grandkids are from 1 to 15. 

 

Q: Have you ever used VA for services?

I use the VA all the time...continual basis.

 

Q: What kinds of things do you use the VA for:

Primary doctor, eye doctor, podiatry, physical therapy, dermatology. That’s about it. 

 

Q: Do you ever go online to manage benefits?

Yes I do…I go on my health vet. ..I manage my appointments… my pharmacy….medication renewals, check on evaluations that I had done, download portions of chart for my records, and that’s about it. 

 

It sounds like you are a power user!

Well, it’s there so if you don’t use it, the government likes to takes things away.

 

Q: So, outside of going to the website, what kind of communication do you receive from the VA now?

I usually get phone calls prior to appointment. My appointments take place at St. Albans Hospital in Queens, NY. Which is a long time residential area…it’s an outpatient department….it’s not a regular hospital.  Also, I get messages from my primary doctor on secure messaging. 

 

Q: Do you currently have dependents on your benefits or have you before?

The only thing that I have….on 70% disability and wife receives stipend but as far as utilizing…she is unable to.

 

He filled out forms. Once she filled out…anything above 30% she would receive the small portion every month.

 

I worked with someone initially and filled out the forms prior to becoming a service officer. He’s past president of Vietnam veterans in Queens, NY. Has ben working with them since 1972.

 

Q:Has he helped fill out forms for someone?

A: Absolutely…he has done multiple tasks as far as filing out service requests and disability requests. 

 

Initially it’s declaring power of attorney…when you say ‘power of attorney’ they get scared…think you‘re taking away their rights. Fear of the unknown. Also how long it is valid before someone could go form one agency to another. Let’s say they don’t like service at legion, how long is this agreement binding with initial service contact?

 

Q: Have you ever used vets.gov?

A: Vets.gov? That I don’t remember…not sure. I’ve been on multiple sites….DOD and my health vets. I’m not sure if I’ve been on vets.gov.

 

(Shares screen)

A: Yes I have seen that on DOD. 

 

Q: Have you used it?
 No, I’ve seen it. I’ve never used it before.

 

Q: Where on page would you look?

A: Yea where it says disability benefits.

 

Q: What do you expect to find?

A: Requirements for benefits and the forms that need to be fill out or downloaded on the screen.

 

But I’ll tell you the truth…from what I have seen…vets filling out the form on the screen. They don’t know what they are filling out…they’re not cognizant they fill out form, but not sure if they what they fill out is correct. Once they fill out, they just want to see if was correct or not.

 

Q: What can we do to help this?

A: That’s a good question. When you’re dealing with someone to have initial  contact and you’re dealing to have a personal relationship…that builds repoire. So I really don’t know. 

 

Q: In your own words, what is the purpose of this page?

A: Apply to declare dependents…uh, I you’re married or have children under age of whatever, to show proof. Only problem is how w would you show proof other than birth or marriage certificate. When filling out in office you have to submit copies to validate married and have dependents.

 

Validate from online?

I don’t know how that world work…let’s say you have 5 children. You fill out for and give date of birth. Still have submit validated paperwork since you have 5 children. So if I’m filling out paperwork for passport still have to be in…don’t know how you do it online unless you scan or whatever.

 

Eligibility?

Uh….well…it says right there….please include the information..i want to see where you have to validate the information…I’m looking. 

 

It says complete the dependent forms and you can print it out…ok, you’re going the vet’s word and that’s it. 

 

Q: Surprising?
 A: Yes…very much so. 

 

Q: Anything else you would want to know?

A: The confidentiality of it. 

 

Making sure that no information is given to anyone who shouldn‘t have it. Especially now that you’re submitting social security number and so with people taking identities, we need to be careful.

 

Q: How could you be made to feel more comfortable?
 A: No the information is pretty direct….I don’t know. I myself would feel leery about giving a lot of information on the internet.

 

Q: How should we assure that site is secure?

A: Now I really don’t know. I really don’t know. If I was going to fill out form like this myself, I would want to do it in a 10-1 or hard copy …fill it out, put in an envelope, mail it whatever. I would feel more secure. 

 

Prototype page 1:

Now you want me to fill it out like I would. Fill for you or just go through it?

 

(goes over scenario)

 

It’s interesting that this goes first, middle, last name…every form, it’s last name first name then middle initial. 

 

Q: How does that make you feel?

A: Well, it’ s different…that’s for sure. 

 

What do you think of the question about relationship to veteran?

If I was filling out for spouse, I am the veteran.

 

Questions about this screen?

No not all

 

Why this question?

Because if you’re 30 and above and you’re applying for benefits, you have to validate you have married. Also if you have been married and divorced and your wife is still out there, she could still apply for benefits under you.

 

Click on married?
 They want proof that you’re married. 

 

How would you indicate that you’re married now and have been married before?

I would put 1+1..I would put plus one. 

 

How would you do that?

Good question….let me see. Or one over one ? Hmmmm

 

Do you see 2 arrows? (on UI)
 No I don’t see it. No I don’t see. The go meeting is blocking it unless you move scenario.

 

(elissa moves and clicks)

So what I did here…

 User:

It says 2 ok…

 

Elissa:

Would you have want it to be 2?

 

User:

I would want 1 plus 1.

 

Elissa:

Why?

 

User:

If you ‘re living in..let me see..out west…you might have 2 wives and there are vets that live there too. Polygamist society you might have 4 wives. 

 

So someway to indicate you hare married to one person…

 

Elissa:

Click continue

 

Elissa:

How would you answer these questions?

 

User:

Umm…that way you were married…now, most people would have their anniversary date and all that…but how would you validate it…that’s the only thing...having a copy or marriage certificate and a copy of divorce agreement. There again it’s in limbo because you need that information in order to process claim. 

 

Elissa:

Click continue.

 

Might not have this information…the social security information.

 

What would you do?

Uh…it depends. If you’re still paying alimony, you would have some sort of certification….if you’re paying childcare you would have certification from an attorney. Or you would have to contact the clerk where you got marred to get copy.

 

Elissa:

Any other surprising questions?

 

User:

No. Not at all. 

 

Elissa:

If you clicked continue, what would happen if add a marriage?

 

User:

It would not validate because on previous screen you said one plus one and now you’re going to one plus 2. 

 

What would you have to do?

Change this previous screen…go back.

 

Click continue.

What would happen if put down yes for Susan Saylor being a vet?

User:

Put down information why benefits for her and her benefit status…

 

User:

Do you live with Susan? Could be? 

 

Elissa:

Why asked? 

 

User:

Uh…why do you think…hmmm… to see if you’re paying her support? Otherwise, I wouldn’t know.

 

 

Elissa:

Click on yes. For purposes.

 

User:

Because even though she’s a dependent she could still be married and you don’t know if she could be getting benefit from her marriage.

 

Elissa:

If you click on yes, what else would it ask you?

 

User:

It would ask her marriage information.

 

Elissa:

How are you feeling about form?

 User:

It gives all the requirements. I’m just concerned about the reliability of the information that’s submitted. 

 

That’s my only concern.

 

Elissa:

Is there anything else (besides documentation)….

 

User:

I think form is fine.

 

Elissa:

After this question, any other information you expect?

 

User:

Yes, does dependent have medical problem or type of disability? Because if they do it would be aid to dependents. Let’s say child born with cerebral palsy or agent orange genetic disorder, they would be entitled to benefits. 

 

Elissa:

So we’ve just done work on spouse information, sounds like you’re expecting to be asked about children.

 

User:

Yes.

 

 

 

 

Elissa:

Take a look at page and let me know if anything confusing, unexpected, etc. 

 

User:

Sure…

I don’t know if they ask about income. That’s my only question…not for veteran for dependent.

 Elissa:

What information about income?

 

User:

Oh…I guess not. If they’re applying for benefit…I guess not. Has nothing to do with if they’re a millionaire or have nothing.

 

Elissa:

How would you fill out?

 

User:

Just information I have been given. Which might not be anything. 

 

If didn’t have info? I would have to obtain it somewhere. The only thing is time wise once you fill out app how long will it be an open file until the process is complication. You might write to clerk, but doesn’t mean clerk is going to getting it back to you. So how long is this process open?

 

Elissa:

Would you expect us to have info?

 

User:

No I wouldn’t expect you to have it. 

 

Elissa:

Click in the form. 

Any questions about this page (current spouse information)

 

Elissa:

How would you add another marriage for spouse?

 

User:

You have to go back to the beginning again. 

 

Elissa:

Where would you give that information?

 

 

User:

Add another marriage for your spouse….why is it relevant? Why is it relevant if you’re applying for spouse you’re married to at present not previous…not sure why that is relevant?

 

Continue…

 

There’s where…it would be important to have the copies of the birth certificates. 

 

Elissa:

Fill out as though you have one child who is 20 and not married.

 

User:

Got it. 

 

Elissa:

Is status..confusing?

 

User:

Nope, not at all. 

 

Elissa:

Why do you think VA is interested in (ages) 18-23?

 

User:

After 23, not entitled to benefits. Uh…it would go on to what schooling and if they’re entitled to benefits. 

 

Elissa:

There’s another form that goes with this form…if you have a child that is18-23 and in school….if there’s a possibility of filing out that form right now in this form? How would you feel about it?

 

User:

I think I’s relevant…I think it’s important. 

 

Elissa:

Does it make a difference about length?

 

User:

I don’t know if it would be done in one sitting. That’s for sure and also when you fill out form, what happens to form online…. so you can go back to it or can you go back to it?

 

At the end where you want to sign off…it would be submitting or no submission.

 

Elissa:

Can you save right now?

 

User:

I am looking at the form….I would be leery about it. I don’t see anything that says. I don’t see anything that says ‘saving it’. Is there a saved on here?

 

(sees it)

Is this automatic? If so, that’s super. I only wish I would see that on other forms scary to send those filing an application and then it never appears again. It’s the worst.

 

Elissa:

How could complete later?

 

User:

Uh….I guess to give it a file name. 

 

Elissa:

Where would it save it?

 

User:

Looking at this area here….I would say right there…don’t know if you can do that. That I don’t know. (JS note: wants to click saving message, I think?)

 

I would love to have a copy on my computer not knowing if one in limbo would disappear. 

 

Elissa:

Hypo…answered that …choose to fill out later. Would you have wanted VA to have some way to tell you to fill out extra form?

 User:
 Yes…to continue on, please complete for whatever…see attached. 

 

Elissa:

Click on see attached?

 

User:

Open up the form…fill it out…get to bottom. It would also say continue. 

 

For (our) purposes…the child lives with you. What would happen if add another child?

 User:

Depends on how many children you submitted initially. Let’s say you have 5 children, have to fill out form for each one. Each one is an individual.

 

Separate forms for every one.

 

Would think you have to do separate forms for everyone…doesn’t mean every child lives with you or attend school or doesn’t have disabilities. 

 

Would see another copy of same form that would pop up. 

 

Elissa:

Click continue.

 

What do you think you would do on this page?

 

User:

Review each line to see that you didn’t miss anything. Then, uh, you’re submitting a proxy stating you read it and accepting everything that’s there… you put legal liability. That would be it.

 

(Hits submit.)

 

Elissa:

What’s this page telling you?

 

User:

It’s your proof you submitted, you can make a copy for yourself.

 

Elissa:

What would you do?

 

User:

I definitely would print it out. Definitely would print it out and have it available not know knowing how long it would take before it’s processed.

 

Elissa:

What happens next?

 

User:
 That you get a receipt that it has been received and is in process.

 

Elissa:

How?

 

User:

Could be email. 

Elissa:

And you have said a couple times you don’t know how long this takes? Updates from VA?

 User:

That would be nice. I’m from old school and one time it took 2 years for claims to be processed. It took me that long. Heard nothing…had to continuously bother the VA. 

 

Oh every month to just get an email…still be processed, still working on something . to know it was there and not in trash.

 

Elissa:

Communication about other benefits from VA?

 

User:

Probably at the end. Could give synopsis. Just like it does here. 

 

 

I think the form is great.

 

Elissa:

Anything else to share?

 User:

Not at all.
