# Conversation Guide: 686 Usability Research and 674 Discovery

## Goals

1. Do Veterans understand who is and is not eligible for dependents' benefits?
2. Does the flow of form 686 make sense? Are Veterans successfully able to apply?
3. Do all the form labels make sense, and the Veterans aren't confused by what we're asking from them?
4. Are Veterans confused or frustrated by any questions on the form? What are their reactions to questions about their marriages and spouses' marriages?
5. Do they know what to expect after they apply?
6. Would Veterans prefer to fill out additional 674 questions here or at another time? How would they prefer to be alerted to fill out these forms?

## We will know we have been successful if:

1. We have a clearer understanding of whether Veterans are easily able to fill out form 686 online, and which sections require the most frustration or collection of information (if any).
2. We have a sense as to how Veterans would want to fill out additional forms related to 686.

## Who are our participants?

We would like to speak with 5 Veteran participants representing all branches of the Armed Forces, with an even split of men and women, and at least one person in each of the age brackets 18-30, 30-50, 50+.

All participants must have a disability rating of 30% or greater.

At least half (3) of the participants must have dependents who have in the past used or are currently using VA benefits through the participants' service.

Additionally, we would like to speak with one spouse of a Veteran.

## Key research questions

1. Are Veterans and their dependents able to fill out form 686c with as little frustration or confusion as possible?
2. What are the most difficult portions of the form for Veterans or their dependents to fill out? Why?
3. If Veterans or their dependents are able to remember their first time filling out this form, does this version compare more favorably to that experience?
4. Would Veterans or their dependents prefer to fill out the additional form 674 content at the same time? If not, how would they want to be prompted to return to this content?
5. Do Veterans and their dependents understand who is and is not eligible for dependents' benefits?

## Methods

- Remote usability testing of Invision prototype (mobile version) of introduction page and form flow for 686c form.
- Remote user interviews to learn about Veterans' previous experiences with filling out form 686c and expectations around online forms, to determine possible ways to link to 674 and 526.

## Conversation guide - Veterans and Current Servicemembers

### Introduction

Thank you for joining us today. My name is Elissa, and I'm joined on the line by some colleagues who are observing the session and helping me take notes. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn how to make one section of our website more useful to you.  

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work.

**We aren’t testing your ability.** In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.

**This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be respectful of your time, so I may move us along a little faster at various points.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Do you have any questions at this stage?

Are you comfortable if I record this session? We're only going to use it for internal purposes to make sure we capture your thoughts accurately.

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.

[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording.]

### Warm-up questions

Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)
- Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, are you considering using VA benefits in the future?
- How do you access your benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?
- Have you ever had a good experience with the VA? What made that a positive experience in your mind? If not, what would make a good experience?
- What kinds of communication do you currently receive from the VA? 
- Do you currently have dependents who are using benefits through your VA record, or dependents who used to use VA benefits?
  - If yes, do you remember applying for those benefits?
  - What can you tell me about that process?
  - If not, what do you know about dependents who can get benefits through the VA?

### Getting situated on Vets.gov

- Have you ever used Vets.gov before?

Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You'll see the Vets.gov homepage.

- If you were trying to apply for your dependents to get benefits through your VA record, where might you look?

### Form 686

Prototype: https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/M4H8VL3TY36#/

Feel free to take a minute to look around this page.

_Prototype page 1_

- What's the purpose of this page?
- Read through the content in this page. How would you go about finding out whether or not you are eligible to apply for dependents' benefits?
- Why would someone need to fill out this form?
- What information do you need to have on hand to fill out this form? Why do you think you need this information? 
- Is there any additional information you would want to know before filling out this form? If so, what?
- Do you feel ready to fill out this form? If not, why not?
- *Watch for how participants scroll on landing page and where they click to start the application*

*Prototype page 2*

As a quick note, this is a prototype of the form you'd fill out. We want to keep your information private, so we've put in some fake data which might not be exactly what you would put in if you were filling this out yourself.

For purposes of this research, I'm going to ask you to follow this scenario, which I'm pulling up now: please fill out this form as though you are married and have been married before, and your spouse has also been married. 

- Take a look at the last question on this page - what does it mean? How would you answer it? Why do you think someone would select "other"?

*Prototype page 3: marriages*

- Why are you being asked this question?
- If you selected "married," what do you think would happen?
- How would you note that you're married now and had been married before?

*Prototype page 4: current marriage*

- Do you have all of this information at hand?
- Why do you think you're being asked for this information?

*Prototype page 5: veteran's previous marriages*

- Why do you think you're being asked for this information?
- Do you understand what all of these question are asking? Are any confusing to you? Why?
- What would you do if you didn't have an ex-spouse's social security number?
- What do you think would happen if you clicked on "add another marriage"?

*Prototype page 6: Spouse's information*

- Why do you think you're being asked for this information? What do you think the VA will do with this information?
- What would you do if you didn't have this information at hand?
- Why do you think you're being asked whether your spouse has been married before?
- How are you feeling about this form so far?
- What other information are you expecting to be asked?

*Prototype page 7: Spouse's previous marriages*

- Were you expecting to be asked for this information?
- Why do you think you're being asked for this information?
- What do you think would happen if you clicked on "ass another marriage for your spouse"?

*Prototype page 8: children*

For purposes of this research, I'm going to ask you to fill out this form as though you have one child who is currently living with you, who is 20 years old, and who is currently in school.

- Why do you think you're being asked this question?
- What do you think would happen if you answered "yes"?
- Child's status: are any of these categories confusing to you? If so, which? What questions do you have about this page of the form?
- Why do you think the VA wants to know specifically about children between 18 and 23? Go ahead and check that box.
- If you are claiming a dependent between 18 and 23 who is in school, there is an additional form you'll need to fill out. How would you feel if you had the opportunity to fill out that form right now?
- Is there other information you would want to know before deciding whether or not to complete the form now?
- If you chose not to fill that form out now, how would you want the VA to tell you that you needed to fill out the form?

*Prototype pages 9-10: flow through quickly*

Invite participant to accept privacy policy and submit form.

*Prototype page 11: confirmation page*

- Take a quick look at this page. What is it telling you?

- What would you do with this information?

- What would you expect to happen next?

- Would you expect to receive any other communication from the VA saying they've received your application? What other kinds of communication would you want about your application, either now or while it's being processed?

- If you hadn't filled out form 674 here, would you expect to be reminded about it in the future? How?

- In an ideal world, how would the VA tell you about other benefits for which you were eligible, or other forms you would need to fill out?

  ### Wrap-up

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the team building Vets.gov based on your experiences today?

Thank you gift



- Wayfinding in the form: multiple pages in a part, do people care?
- A/B testing with different flows
