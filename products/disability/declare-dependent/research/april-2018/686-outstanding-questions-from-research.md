### Overall
* What will signing in pre-fill? 
* Does personalization have plans or the ability to pull in current dependent status or disability rating?
### Landing page
* Participants consistently did not treat the "Start" button as a button. The presence of the link to download the 674 form confused the matter further; some thought they had to download, print, and fill out the form as a result.
* Clarity is needed around dependent children being under 18 except in extenuating circumstances.
* There is specific information (your previous spouse's social security number, for instance) that is required on the form but not listed as required on the landing page.
### Section 1: Veteran's Information
* There are inconsistencies throughout the form as to the use of "Veteran" or "Your" in relation to the person filling out the form. The lack of pronoun on the radio button list ("your" relationship to Veteran?) was confusing to users; how were they supposed to answer this?
### Section 2: Veteran Marriage Information
* The name of this section is weird.
* The wording of number of marriages is also confusing and led some participants to fill it out incorrectly. This box could also stand to be shorter or restyled to more clearly indicate the ability to increase or decrease the number.
* In this and the next two sections, we might want to look at how the pensions form deals with current and previous marriages and dependent children. Participants expressed confusion as to whether to fill in their most recent or first marriage on the first page they saw, which is clarified by the pension pattern that clearly states "first marriage" on the first page, followed by "most recent marriage." The pension flow also populates form fields based on the number of marriages stated up front, obviating the confusion that was expressed around "add an additional marriage."
* Page 2 of this section does not have a header at all.
### Section 3: Spouse's Marriages
* It would be great to be able to clarify for Veterans why this information is needed.
* There is a similar pattern to follow from pensions about "how many times has spouse been married" and the number of fields that are populated on the next page.
* Page 2 of this section also does not have a header.
### Section 4: Children
* "Veteran's Unmarried Children" sounds really strange if we're talking about young children. Again, suggest borrowing from pensions flow that asks for birthdate before asking about marital status.
* The pensions application pattern also prepopulates the alert about form 674 if the child is between 18 and 23 based on the birthdate listed above.
* Also borrow pattern of radio buttons over check boxes for child's status.
