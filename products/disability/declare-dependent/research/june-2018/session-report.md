# Session Report

## Participant Description

We spoke with four Veterans representing all branches of the Armed Forces, three men and one woman. All participants had a disability rating of 30% or greater, and range in age from 30-50+. 

## Research goals and key findings

### Do Veterans understand who is and is not eligible for dependents' benefits?
- Generally, yes. The landing page sets their expectations appropriately
- However, half the participants were willing to input information about their spouse and/or children to find out if there were additional benefits they were eligible for that they were unaware of

### Does the flow of form 686 make sense?
- Overall, yes. All participants were able to successfully move from chapter to chapter
- The hang-ups occurred when participants were required to download form 674 (if their dependent is a child enrolled in school), if they needed to retrieve information they did not have memorized, or encountered an error message. These became significant roadblocks and cause enough frustration that 3/4 participants said they would abandon the application process entirely.

### Do all the form labels make sense, and the Veterans aren't confused by what we're asking from them? Do they know whose information we are asking for at any given time?
- Generally, yes. We introduced pronouns to the form labels which helped clarify whose information was required.
- One participant was confused by the category _Applicant Information_. He assumed it referred to the recipient of the benefits, rather than the person filling out the application.

### Are Veterans confused or frustrated by any questions on the form? What are their reactions to questions about their marriages and spouses' marriages?
- Half of the participants expressed frustration when asked about previous marriages. They did not understand why the VA would need that information if an ex-spouse was no longer receiving benefits.
- The other half of the participants did not have previous marriages to account for, and were willing to add information about their children and spouses in case there were benefits available they were unaware of.

### Would Veterans prefer to fill out additional 674 questions here or at another time? How would they prefer to be alerted to fill out these forms?
- All participants held the expectation that they would be able to fill out additional 674 questions as part of the 686 application
- All participants expressed frustration that there would be an additional step to filling out 674
- One participant said he would walk away from the application entirely if he could not complete 674 as part of the 686 process.

### Do they know what to expect after they apply?
- Only one participant was able to successfully submit her application, and she expected to receive a notice in the mail within 30 days.

### Are Veterans successfully able to apply?
- Sometimes. 
- Some encountered an error message they were unable to resolve which prevented them from submitting the application.
- One was able to submit her application, but felt it was incomplete because she still needed to fill out 674.
- Error messages spiked participants' frustration:
  - One participant mentioned he would abandon the application since he could not figure out how to resolve the error. 
  - Another participant said he would call the help desk for assistance resolving the error
