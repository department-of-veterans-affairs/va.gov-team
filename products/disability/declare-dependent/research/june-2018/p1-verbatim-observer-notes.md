# 686 Usability Research: Applicant P1 IS the Veteran

### Emily - Introduction

Thank you for joining us today. My name is Emily, and I'm joined on the line by some colleagues who are observing the session and helping me take notes. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn how to make one section of our website more useful to you.  
Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:
We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
We are not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.
I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

P1
Sure

Emily
I’ll be recording the audio as we talk today, so that we capture your opinions accurately. Only our conversation will be recorded. We are not sharing screens or using video recording.
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

P1
Sure

Emily
Great! Any questions before we get started?
I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)
- Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, are you considering using VA benefits in the future?
- How do you access your benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?
- Do you currently have dependents who are using benefits through your VA record, or dependents who used to use VA benefits?
  - If yes, do you remember applying for those benefits?
  - What can you tell me about that process?
  - If not, what do you know about dependents who can get benefits through the VA?
  
  P1
  I was Navy, San Diego in the 90s. I had fun, it was a good time.
  
  Emily
  Are you still on the west coast?
  
  P1
  Yeah Arizona. I've been going to the VA for 15 years. I have MS, I was diagnosed when I got out and have been going ever since. 
  
  How do you get your benefits?
  
  I use ebenefits. It's a harrowing experience. Yesterday I needed a medical record. Normally I can get it. I was planning on getting it but the websitewas down.
  I tried to sign in about 150 times and finally it printed at 2:30. It did finally work. 
  
  You pushed through
  
  Their website sucks. Their website is broken.
  
  That sounds really frustrating. Do you currently have any dependents enrolled in benefits? 
  
  Not currently. 
  
  Did you ever?
  
  Yes. I had 1 dependent for about a year. 
  
  What do you remember about that process?
  
  The only way we could get that done was by calling them. I don't remember why, but we couldn't use the website for all of it. 


### Getting situated on Vets.gov

Emily
Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You'll see the Vets.gov homepage.

P1
Ok

Emily
Tell me what the purpose of the page is.

P1
It will get me started.

How would you go about finding if you are eligible for dependent beneftis.

I suppose if I read this it says it somewhere. It tells you what you need to have on hand. I mean, it's here. It's explaining. 

Why do you think you would need the information it describes on hand?

Well, I hope to fill out the application.

If you're a dependent, have a dependent in college. It says if you have an applicant under 23, its a double process. A declaration of depend3ents and then a form for, there it is, for 
attending school. What is this? Approval for school attendance. Why are they two different forms? I should be able to apply 
with one form. It makes for sense to hit this, makes more sense with one form. If you're applying for your child to go to school,
who isn't between 18 and 24? It makes more sense that it would all be in one action.

We're going to use some fake information in the next section. You don't have to use your real name or anything like that. For this last question, why you do you think it's asking? 

I am a veteran? Because it could be filled out by numerous people. Not a huge chance of that. I suppose it could be filled out by other people
If you have a fiduciary, they can fill it out. 

What scenario do you think would prompt someone to select other?

I don't know, I can't think of anything. Maybe if you make a mistake. You're applying on behalf of the veteran filling out this application?

So for the field you filled out, whose info is it asking for?

Mine. Right away I assumed it because its on a VA website. 

Let's continue filing it out. Continue to the next page. How do you normally recall your ssn?

What do you mean?

Do you have your ssn memorized?

It's memorized. I'm the vet! (laughs)

Whose information are we asking for here?

Again, mine. It's implied that its mine. 
Oh it won't take that. No dashes allowed. Ok, I can change that. 

Ok, on this page, why are you being asked these questions?

That's a good question, I don't know why. Why would that matter?

If you selected married, what do you expect to see next?

I wouldn't expect it to say how many times have you been married. You can be married more than once. It doesn't apply, it doesn't
matter. I could have been marreid 18 times. Mainly this isn't a questin you want to ask the vet. 

If you didn't remember your wedding date, where would you retrieve that info?

I'd ask my wife or look up my marriage certificate. I might do that. 

When you applied for benefits in the past, have you done it with another person?

Yes, I've had her [my wife] with me the whole way,

So you clicked continue, whose information are we asking for?

Still mine, my wife's DOB. That's getting hard now (laugs) give me a minute. That's not, I'm kidding now. SSN again though
that's tough. I'd have to look at the files or something. 

What's that process like?

You don't like to be directed away from the keyboard from what you're doing online. It takes your atteniton away from what you're doing. There's a good chance I'm not coming back,
it might take me another week. I would hope it's in the smae place. If we logged in to the same spot it's ok. What's their VA file number? I don't know what that is. 

How are you feeling about this applicaiton so far?

It's pretty straight forward. Longer that it needs to be. If you need spouses name and SSN, that's probably all you need
goveerment wise. End of story.

If we had her VA file number, would you expect we knew if she was a veteran?

Yes.

What other info are we going to ask you for?

Well, the dependent. 

Let's keep going on this application.

I can hit no here a few times.

Unmarried. Children, yes. First name Fred. DOB is important, SSN. Add another child, but SSN is missing. So it asks here. My quesiton is, 
if I go back and I say add another child, an awakard placing for the remove button. 

Would you expect it to be somewhere else?

It's very logical this remove button would be next. 

How would you decide which child to enter here?

It might be the first name of the child or something, dependent one, there's no way to know what child. Oh I'm wrong. I din't see
the first name of the first dependent. I just didn't see that. Now here's sally. 

Was it clear this time whose information these fields are asking for?

It would help if this text was twice the size to draw my attention sooner. You miss it in forms. Biological child of your spouse? It's
very specific, clear. It's good though. 

Do these fields match the expectations of where they live?

Yes. 

What's been your review process when you apply for benefits?

It's all been paperwork, I reread to make sure the info is correct. The VA has never been viable online other than checking status. 

[reads error message]
I would expect the red to highlight what needs to be corrected.

How do you feel after seeing this?

Definitely frustrated. I expect to scroll up and see red for sections not complete yet. I'd call the 800 number. 

How would you find that phone number to get help?

I'd just google it.

How would you expect to get help from the number?

You could get the benefits help line after about 2 hours right there on the phone.

Have you done that before?

Yes, many times.

How did you feel over the phone?

Most of the itme they're good. It's frustating whether they're helping or not. It's a 3 hour phone call. 

Do you have any other feedback for me?

No, every thing makes sense.
