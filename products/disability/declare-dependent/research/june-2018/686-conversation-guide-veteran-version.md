# Conversation Guide: 686 Usability Research and 674 Discovery: Applicant IS the Veteran

### Introduction

Thank you for joining us today. My name is Emily, and I'm joined on the line by some colleagues who are observing the session and helping me take notes. We are doing this feedback session on behalf of the team at the Department of Veterans Affairs to learn how to make one section of our website more useful to you.  

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:

We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.

We are not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the application and meet Veterans' needs.

I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally interrupt you to move on to the next question.

I’ll be recording the audio as we talk today, so that we capture your opinions accurately. Only our conversation will be recorded. We are not sharing screens or using video recording.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we get started?

///

Great! I'm going to turn on screen and audio recording now.

[The moderator will begin audio and screen recording.]

### Warm-up questions

Before we dig in on the site, I'd like to ask you a few questions so we get used to talking togther.

- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work)
- Have you used the VA for services before? If yes, which? If not, are you considering using VA benefits in the future?
- How do you access your benefits? Do you use any online services to manage them? What was that experience like?
- Do you currently have dependents who are using benefits through your VA record, or dependents who used to use VA benefits?
  - If yes, do you remember applying for those benefits?
  - What can you tell me about that process?
  - If not, what do you know about dependents who can get benefits through the VA?
- Does anyone in the house have a DS logon dependent account? Have they used it on E-Benefits?

Extras:
- Have you ever had a good experience with the VA? What made that a positive experience in your mind? If not, what would make a good experience?
- What kinds of communication do you currently receive from the VA? 


### Getting situated on Vets.gov

Now I'm going to share my screen with you. You'll see the Vets.gov homepage.

- If you were trying to apply for your dependents to get benefits through your VA record, where might you look?

### Wrap-up

Thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us! Is there anything else you'd like to share with the team building Vets.gov based on your experiences today?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

#### If someone in the house has a DS logon, would they be open to us following up?

As a thank you for your participation, we'd like to offer you a $25 gift either as an Amazon Gift Card or through Paypal. Do you have a preference?

Great, is it ok for us to send that gift to the same address we used to communicate with you about scheduling this test? 
If no: Ok, we'll follow up with an email after this session to get the right email from you in writing.

Thanks! Lastly, would you like to share this feedback opportunity with other Veterans or Veteran groups you're a part of? If so, I can send you an email with a little blurb so you can easily connect folks to our team.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
