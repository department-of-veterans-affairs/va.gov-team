## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I’ll tell you about myself and what we’re doing today.

My colleagues and I work on VA.gov - making improvements to the site so that Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. What I hope to do today is to get a sense of how to best assist Veterans in deciding what claims to file. We will do that by looking at a prototype with made-up data and having you pretend your are a Veteran named Alex. What I don’t want to do is to add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits. We may look at things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation. However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the website in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.  

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure that we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
 - _If no:_ Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
 - _If yes:_ Admit observers.
 - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
 - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
 - _If yes:_ Once I start recording, I’ll ask again for your confirmation.
 
_Moderator note: Start recording, start the captions then hide the captions._

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

- Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov?
- Could you tell me about the types of benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 
If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:
- About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?
- If you’re comfortable sharing this information, what are some of those conditions?

Great! Now let’s get into evaluating some prototypes.
We’re going to show you a couple of screens that we’re working on.
These prototypes are not the real website, and they may not function exactly the way you expect. 
Some areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not. 
And, since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

Also, the screens you’ll see are designed for a mobile phone. If you’re using a laptop or a monitor, they’re going to look really narrow. Don’t worry about that, it’s just an effect of this being a rough prototype.

We’re going to go through 2 different scenarios. For both scenarios, I’d like you to imagine that you’re currently receiving disability benefits from the VA for several service-connected health conditions, and some of those conditions have gotten worse. You’ve come to the VA website today to learn about available compensation or ask for more compensation for those conditions.

Now, I’m going to put a link to the [prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/bf1a0cd3-1fae-4321-a081-82db48fa3d3a/p/E089E059-6A52-43B0-9D5D-8B3FE35E4667/canvas#About) in the Zoom chat. You can click on that link. Once you have that open, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. 
 Wait for screen sharing to work.

 Moderator note: review which scenarios to provide the participant in the spreadsheet beforehand

## Scenario 1: Review currently rated conditions - 15 minutes

**If this is the 1st task:** (add these instructions to chat in zoom)
Your Tinnitus and Arthritis has gotten worse, so you’re coming to the website to determine what you should do next. You’d like to review what disability benefits you are already receiving. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

**If this is the 2nd task:** 
In this scenario, your Tinnitus and Arthritis has gotten worse. You’re coming to the website to look for more information.

### Screen 1 (Start)
Do you have any questions before you start?
Go ahead and click Version 1.

_Note to modersator - switch between starting with 1 and 1a._

### Screen 2 (Authenticated Home) 
Talk me through what you would do on this screen if you wanted to learn more about your current condition ratings.

_Observe how the participant makes it to the rated disabilities screen…_

### Screen 3 (View my Rated Disabilities Screen)
I have a few questions for you on this screen.
- What is this screen telling you? What is your initial impression of it?
- What does this screen tell you about your conditions?
- What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Which conditions could you get more compensation for? 

_(1 only)_
- What does the phrase ‘highest schedular rating’ mean to you?
- What do you think would happen if you clicked that link?
- _Instruct participant to click on the link if they haven’t already_
  - What can you tell me about this explanation for maximum schedular rating?

_(1A only)_ 
- What does the phrase ‘highest standard rating’ mean to you?
- What do you think would happen if you clicked on that triangle symbol?
- _Instruct participant to expand the caret if they haven’t already_
- What can you tell me about this explanation of maximum ratings?

_(Both versions)_
- What do you think you would do after reading the message about ratings at the highest level?
- What do you think you might do after reviewing this screen?
- What if your migraines had gotten worse - what do you think you could do?
- What do you think you might do here to potentially increase your overall rating?
- This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

**Things to watch for:**
Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus and/or arthritis? 

## Scenario 2: Request CFI for Tinnitus - 15 minutes 

**If this is the 1st task:** 
Your Tinnitus and degenerative arthritis have gotten worse, so you’re planning to ask for more compensation. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

**If this is the 2nd task:** 
Similar to the last task, in this scenario your Tinnitus and degenerative arthritis have gotten worse and you’re planning to ask for more compensation.

### Screen 1 (Start)
Do you have any questions before you start?
Go ahead and click Version 2.

### Screen 2 (Veteran Details screen)
As I mentioned before, this is fake data. You can imagine this is your personal information. Go ahead and show me how you would get started.

### Screen 3 (New or Increase) → Screen 4 (New or Increase)
Talk me through what you would do on this screen.

### Screen 5 (Select conditions)
Thanks for that! Go ahead and show me what you would do on this screen, but pause before hitting ‘Continue’ as I will have a few questions for you on this screen.
- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
- What does the phrase ‘Maximum Possible Rating’ mean to you?

_Moderator note: Encourage participant to open expando if they have not already_
- What is this text telling you? What do you think you would do after reading it?
- This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

**Things to watch for:**
- Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus? 
- Do they find knowing the maximum possible rating for all conditions helpful/useful?

## Scenario 3: Request CFI for Tinnitus with Friction - 15 minutes 

**If this is the 1st task:** 
Your Tinnitus and degenerative arthritis have gotten worse, so you’re planning to ask for more compensation. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

**If this is the 2nd task:** 
Similar to the last task, in this scenario your Tinnitus and degenerative arthritis have gotten worse and you’re planning to ask for more compensation. 

### Screen 1 (Start)
Do you have any questions before you start?
Go ahead and click Version 3.

### Screen 2 (Veteran Details screen)
As I mentioned before, this is fake data. You can imagine this is your personal information. Go ahead and show me how you would get started.

### Screen 3 (New or Increase) → Screen 4 (New or Increase)
Talk me through what you would do on this screen.

### Screen 5 (Select conditions)
Thanks for that! Go ahead and show me what you would do on this screen, but pause before hitting ‘Continue’ as I will have a few questions for you on this screen.
- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Can you tell me about the messaging for Tinnitus and what you think it means?
- What do you think you would do after reading that message about Tinnitus?

_Moderator note: Encourage participant to select ‘Tinnitus’ even if they say they wouldn’t._
  
Go ahead and click on ‘Continue’

### Screen 6 (Tinnitus Friction)
- Can you tell me what this page is about?

_Moderator note: Encourage participant to open expando if they have not already_

- What is this text telling you? 
- What do you think you would do next?
- This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

**Things to watch for:**
Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus? 

## Compare prototypes
- Now that you’ve looked at the two different prototypes, can you tell me about the differences in how you experienced each of them?
- Between these two prototypes, which do you think would be more likely to influence your decision about whether or not to submit a claim for increase on Tinnitus or other conditions?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 
- In general, I’d love to hear what do you think about your overall experience - being scheduled for this research session, participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?

Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. I just want to check once more that you are still feeling good about us using your feedback or if you would like to redact anything we discussed today?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

**Emergency Exit**

Well, we have covered all of the questions I had for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback! 
[In case the session was activating for the Veteran and they need further immediate support afterwards, instruct them to dial 988 and press 1]
