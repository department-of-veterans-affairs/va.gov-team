# Current Condition Evidence: Veteran Discovery

## Intro
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to listen in. But before we get to them, I’ll tell you about myself and what we’re doing today.
My colleagues and I work on VA.gov - making improvements to the site so that Veterans can submit their strongest disability claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. What I hope to do today is to get a sense of how to best assist Veterans in putting together a strong case for their claim. We’ll look at some sample information to get your feedback.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
- *This entire session should take about 60 minutes.* I want to be sure that we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- *In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.* There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- *Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.* You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to listen in to this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
- Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I’ll ask again for your confirmation.

## Concept evaluation
### Introduction (5 min)
- We’re working on content to help Veterans understand what is needed when they file a disability claim. Today, we’ll look at a document with this content together. I’m going to share my screen with you.
- [share screen with content doc] Are you able to see my screen?
  - *if yes* Great. Let's take a look at our first scenario.
  - *if no: Troubleshoot*
    
### Scenario 1: Generic (All Conditions) (20 min)
*Focus doc on content for “Scenario 1”*
Imagine that you’re planning to file for a new condition for disability compensation. You can think about [x condition] you mentioned earlier.
- Read through this content. Verbalize your thoughts aloud as you read.
- *after reading*: What are your first impressions about this content? What information stood out to you?
  - *Possible follow ups:* are there any questions that came up for you when you read this content? Is there any content in particular that makes you feel more or less confident about what to submit with a claim? 
- *after discussing*: After reading this, what information would you try to provide to VA when filing for a new condition?
 - *Follow-up*: What kind of documents would you look for to submit when you file your claim?
- What would be your next steps before you file a new claim? Why?

### Scenario 2a: Hypertension (15-20 min)
For our next scenario, imagine that you’re filing hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, for disability compensation. You are on VA.gov researching the information you need to gather before you begin your claim.

Read through the text under “Scenario 2: Hypertension” and as before, share your thoughts out loud as you go through. 
- *after reading*: What are your first impressions about this content? What information stood out to you? 
- *after discussing*: After reading this, what information would you try to provide to VA when filing for hypertension? How has the content changed what documentation you would plan to submit?
  - *follow-up*: What kind of documents would you look for to submit when you file your claim?
- What would be your next steps before you file a new claim? Why?
- Would you feel confident in your ability to gather the necessary information to submit a claim for hypertension?


### Scenario 2b: Tinnitus (15-20 min)
For this next scenario, imagine you plan to submit a new claim for tinnitus. You are on VA.gov researching the information you need to gather before you begin your claim.

Read through the text under “Scenario 3: Tinnitus.” Again, think out loud as you go.
- *after reading*: What are your first impressions about this content? What information stood out to you?
- *after discussing highlights*: After reading this, what information would you be sure to provide to VA when filing for tinnitus? How has the content changed what documentation you would plan to submit?
  - *follow-up*: What kind of documents would you look for to submit when you file your claim?
- What would be your next steps before you file a new claim? Why?
- Would you feel confident in your ability to gather the necessary information to submit a claim for tinnitus? Why (or why not)?

### Comparison (5 min)
Of the two scenarios, which one was more clear to you? *(probe for details)*

Which one made you feel more confident in knowing what kinds of documents you’d need to submit with a claim? 
*As needed, show the different versions on screen so the Veteran can refer to them / remember their differences*


### Wrap-up (5 min)
Thank you for working through those scenarios with me. I have a few more questions for you, and then we’ll wrap up.
- Would this information change how you:
  - ...might’ve filed a claim in the past?
  - OR
  - ...might file a claim in the future?
*If yes*: What would you do differently?
*If no*: Probe for details

- That’s it for my questions. Is there anything else you’d like to tell me about what we discussed today?


## Thank-you and Closing
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 
In general, I’d love to hear what you think about your overall experience - being scheduled for this research session, participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?
Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. I just want to check once more that you are still feeling good about us using your feedback or if you would like to redact anything we discussed today?
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
Well, we have covered all of the questions I had for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback!
