# Research Plan for Max CFIs (Employee Experience Team), June-July 2023


## Background

The VA receives many claims for increase (CFIs) for conditions where a Veteran is already at the maximum rating for that condition. In most cases, the condition will be “confirmed and continued” by a claims processor. We’d like to reduce the amount of time claims processors spend on these contentions by reducing the number of claims for increase Veterans file in this situation.

Our first effort will target Tinnitus claims for increase. With nearly 25,000 claims filed in FY2022, Tinnitus represents the largest category of CFIs where the Veteran is already at the maximum disability rating. Tinnitus is also a good test case because it is virtually never (0.0001% of the time) granted over 10%.

Our hypothesis is that by educating Veterans during the claim submission process that they’re already at the schedular maximum for Tinnitus, we can reduce the number of claims for increase filed where the rating is already at the maximum, without unduly discouraging Veterans who might represent an exception to the rating maximum.

The intervention will be a small change to the existing 526 application on VA.gov, likely on the Rated Disabilities screen. 

This proposed study is part of a sensemaking and discovery phase to decide whether to expand the scope of the project. Our primary goals are to learn how Veterans think about claims for increase and to validate the concept of the intervention. If we get indications that the intervention might work and we proceed with the project, subsequent studies may consider additional conditions that would make good candidates for similar interventions.

### OCTO Priorities and Veteran Journey

This work supports [OCTO Priority](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) 7: Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims, and it fits into the [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) in the Living Civilian Life phase. It’s related to the Moment That Matters called “Managing primary care and chronic health issues.” 


## Research Goals

Goals for this research include:

1. Learn how Veterans think and speak about CFIs and tinnitus.
2. Assess whether our intervention could modify Veteran behavior as input to a go/no-go decision on the project. 
3. Evaluate early concept(s).


### Outcome

If the research shows no influence on Veteran behavior from the intervention we’re testing, we may decide not to proceed with the project. If the research does show a potential effect, we may proceed with the project. We’ll use the information gathered during this research to inform subsequent design of the intervention.


### Research questions

_Goal 1: Learn how Veterans think and speak about CFIs and tinnitus._

- How do Veterans think about asking for an increase on a disability claim?
- How familiar are they with the rating percentages for conditions they have? Do they know what the highest rating is?
- What do they think about when deciding whether to file a claim for increase?
- How do they prepare to file a claim for increase? Do they gather documentation? Do they work with a POA or other assistance? Are they less likely to seek assistance than they were when filing the original claim?

_Goal 2: Assess whether our intervention could modify Veteran behavior._ 

- What will Veterans in the study do when they try to file a claim for increase for Tinnitus, but find out that they’re at the maximum rating and should reconsider applying?
- How will seeing messaging around Tinnitus being at the maximum rating affect how they think about their other rated conditions?

_Goal 3: Evaluate early concept(s)._

- How well does the concept communicate to Veterans what their choices are?
- Does the concept help Veterans feel more confident in their choice?
- Does the concept make Veterans feel the VA is on their side?
- Does the information seem trustworthy?
- Is there additional information Veterans need when deciding what to do?


### Hypothesis

Our hypothesis is that we can use a relatively small intervention to reduce the number of claims that end up getting ‘confirmed and continued’ at the maximum rating for Tinnitus. Further, we hypothesize that by providing just enough information, we can help Veterans understand whether they still might want to request the increase even if they’re already at the maximum.

What we know about this problem space:

- We know that tens of thousands of claims for increase are filed yearly for conditions for which increases cannot be granted because the Veteran is already at the maximum rating.

What we think users could think of this feature: __

- We think some Veterans may be suspicious of the VA advising them not to request an increase.
- We think Veterans are fairly well acquainted with the idea of rating %s and maximum ratings, but that they consider “VA math” around maximum ratings, combined ratings, and IU to be opaque and somewhat untrustworthy.


## Methodology

We will combine a semi-structured interview format with two scenario-based concept tests. The scenarios will contain short sequences of a few screens, and they’ll be based on existing screens in the online 526 application. Prototypes will be available in a small-screen mobile (phone) format. 


### Location

The sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom.

## Recruitment


### Recruitment approach

We are looking for 6 Veterans to participate in this study. 

We’ll use a lean maximum strategy for inclusivity, targeting 2 demographic criteria (age and gender) as primary sample distribution criteria, and race/ethnicity as a secondary sample distribution criteria.

Note that in subsequent studies, we will try to include participants with cognitive disabilities.


### Recruitment criteria

List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study: 

6 Veterans

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

- All participants have used VA.gov to file a claim (disability, pension, or other)
  - Have you ever used VA.gov to file a claim for disability, pension, or any other benefits? 

- At least 2 but no more than 4 Veterans who identify as a gender other than male. 

- At least 2 but no more than 4 Veterans over 55 years old. 

- At least 3 Veterans have recently filed a claim for increase on an already rated condition that has gotten worse. ‘Recently’ as in the last 3 months, but we can broaden that definition if necessary.

  - Have you ever filed a claim for increase on a disability? (That is, you were already rated for the condition, but it got worse, so you asked for a higher rating.)
  - If yes, when did you file your most recent claim for increase?

    - April - July 2023 ← _This is the answer we want_
    - January - March 2023 ← _This would be ok as a fallback_
    - September - December 2022
    - January - August 2022
    - Before 2022

- At least 2 Veterans have been granted a claim for Tinnitus (ringing in the ears). (Does not need to be a claim for increase)

  - Are you currently receiving disability compensation for any of these conditions? \[Select all that apply]

    - Asthma
    - Hypertension (high blood pressure)
    - Irritable bowel syndrome
    - Migraine headaches
    - Scars
    - Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) ← _This is the answer we want_
    - None of the above

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

What criteria would strengthen your results? 

- At least 2 Veterans under 35 years old.
- At least 2 Veterans who are not White/Caucasian.
