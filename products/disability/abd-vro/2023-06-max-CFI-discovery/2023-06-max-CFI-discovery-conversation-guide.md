## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME] and \[NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to listen in. But before we get to them, I’ll tell you what we’re doing.

Today we're going to talk about helping veterans be more successful in deciding what claims to file.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans’ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- Feel free to ask any questions you may have at any point, but just know ahead of time that I may not be able to answer them until the end of the session.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?

  - _If no:_ Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - _If yes:_ Admit observers.
  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
  - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: Once I start recording, I’ll ask again for your confirmation.

_Kim starts recording._

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.
- Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov
- Could you tell me about the types of benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 
  - _If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:_
    - About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?
    - If you’re comfortable sharing this information, what are some of those conditions?

Great! Now let’s get into evaluating some prototypes.

We’re going to show you a couple of screens that we’re working on.

- These prototypes are not the real website, and they may not function exactly the way you expect. 
- Some areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not. 
- And, since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

Also, the screens you’ll see are designed for a mobile phone. If you’re using a laptop or a monitor, they’re going to look really narrow. Don’t worry about that, it’s just an effect of this being a rough prototype.

We’re going to go through 2 different, short scenarios. For both scenarios, I’d like you to imagine that you’re currently receiving disability benefits from the VA for several service-connected health conditions, and some of those conditions have gotten worse. You’ve come to the VA website today to ask for more compensation for those conditions.

Before I give you the link to the prototypes, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. 

_Wait for screen sharing to work._

Now, I’m going to put a [link to the prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/7b704520-bd67-4e58-8187-2164d7616bd4/prototype/a/ED02E01A-A80F-4F2B-AD6D-90B61B245AA8) in the Zoom chat. You can click on that link.

_Moderator note: switch between starting with Task A and Task B throughout the study_


## Task A : Request CFI for 2 conditions - 10 minutes - Orange

_If this is the 1st task:_ 

Your Tinnitus and your Migraines have gotten worse, so you’re planning to ask for more compensation. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. Also note that in the prototype, we are starting you in the middle of the claims process just to save time.

_If this is the 2nd task:_ 

We will now look at a similar scenario where you have already been rated for a few conditions, but in this scenario, you want to request an increase for **_two_** different conditions.


#### Screen 1 (Start)

Do you have any questions before you start?

Go ahead and click Start.


#### Screen 2 (New or Increase) → Screen 3 (New or Increase)

Talk me through what you would do on this screen.


#### Screen 4 (Select conditions)

_After participant has worked through the screen…_

I have a few questions for you on this screen before you proceed.

- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Can you tell me about the messaging for Tinnitus and what you think it means?
- What do you think you would do after reading that message about Tinnitus?
- Which of these conditions do you think qualifies for an increase in benefits?

This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell what that task was like for you? 


#### Things to watch for:

- _Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus?_ 
- _How do they react to seeing a condition (migraines) that’s also at the max rating but doesn't have a message?_


## Task B: Request CFI for Tinnitus only - 10 minutes - Purple

_If this is the 1st task:_ 

Your Tinnitus has gotten worse, so you’re planning to ask for more compensation. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. Also note that in the prototype, we are starting you in the middle of the claims process just to save time.  

_If this is the 2nd task:_ 

We will now look at a similar scenario where you have already been rated for a few conditions, but in this scenario, you only want to request an increase for Tinnitus.


#### Screen 1 (Start)

Do you have any questions before you start?

Go ahead and click Start.


#### Screen 2 (New or Increase) → Screen 3 (New or Increase)

Talk me through what you would do on this screen.


#### Screen 4 (Select conditions)

Thanks for that! I have a few questions for you on this screen before you proceed.

- What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
- What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
- Can you tell me about the messaging for Tinnitus and what you think it means?
- What do you think you would do after reading that message about Tinnitus?
- Which of these conditions do you think qualifies for an increase in benefits?

<!---->

- This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell what that task was like for you? 


### Things to watch for:

- _Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus?_ 


## Compare prototypes

Now that you’ve looked at the two different prototypes, can you tell me any differences that stood out to you?

You can probably guess by now that our project is about conditions that are already at the maximum rating. From that perspective, how was your experience with the two different prototypes?


## Post-Task Interview

### Most recent CFI - 15 minutes

Thanks so much for sharing all of that with me. You can go ahead and stop sharing your screen. Now that we’ve been through those scenarios, let’s talk about your actual experience with your own disability claims. I’d like to just let you know up front that if you do not wish to answer any of these questions, just let me know and we can skip them. If there are conditions you’d rather not discuss, feel free to leave them out of our conversation. 

- Can you tell me about your most recent experience filing a claim on VA.gov?

  - Tell me about any resources you used or people that helped you?

- Have you ever requested an increase for any of your rated conditions? 

<!---->

- _If yes, go to Section A_
- _If no, go to Section B_


#### A. They have filed a claim for increase…

- When was the most recent claim for increase you filed? 

<!---->

- What was your rating when you filed?

- Can you tell me why you decided to ask for an increase, and what went into your decision?

- Did you get any outside advice? From whom? What did they tell you?

- How did you file? Step by step, what did you do?

- Did you submit any new evidence?

- After you filed the claim, what did you expect to happen?

  - Was there a specific % rating you were hoping to get? Why?

- What has happened so far?

- Have you gotten a decision back?

  - If yes, what was the decision?

    - What do you think of the decision? 
    - Do you know why they made that decision?

  - If no, What do you think are your chances of success?

(If they haven’t already discussed the rating schedule for the condition)

Thinking about \[the condition they filed an increase for], do you know what the different possible percentage ratings are?

- What is the highest rating you can get?
- What does it take to get the highest rating?


#### B. They have not filed a claim for increase…

Have you thought about filing a claim for increase on the any of the conditions you’re already been rated for?

If yes:

- What has prompted you to think about asking for an increase?

- What are the possible percentages you could get for this?

  - What’s the highest rating the VA gives for this?
  - What do you think it takes to get to the highest rating?

- Are you still considering requesting an increase, or did you decide not to?

  - If still considering: What will go into your decision?
  - If not: What went into your decision not to?

_If no: go to section C_


#### C. (Skip here if) They’re not comfortable discussing a specific condition during the session

If one of your disabilities got worse, would you consider asking the VA for more compensation?

- Why or why not?

- How would you know if you might be eligible for more compensation?

- How much do you pay attention to what the different possible rating percentages are?

- Can you describe briefly how the rating system works?

- Are you at the maximum rating for any of your disabilities?

  - If that disability got worse, would you still consider asking the VA for an increase?
  - Why or why not?
  - Do you think it’s possible to get  more compensation if you’re at the highest rating already? If so, how?


### Their Tinnitus rating - 5 minutes

_If they haven’t already mentioned they’re rated for Tinnitus:_ 

Are you getting disability compensation for Tinnitus?

_If yes or they mentioned it earlier:_

- At what percent?
- How long ago did you get rated for Tinnitus?
- How severe is your tinnitus now? 
- Is it better or worse than when you first filed a claim for it?

_If no, go to next section._


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. I just want to check once more that you are still feeling good about us using your feedback or if you would like to redact anything we discussed today?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## Emergency Exit

Well, we have covered all of the questions I had for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback! 

_\[In case the session was activating for the Veteran and they need further immediate support afterwards, instruct them to dial 988 and press 1]_
