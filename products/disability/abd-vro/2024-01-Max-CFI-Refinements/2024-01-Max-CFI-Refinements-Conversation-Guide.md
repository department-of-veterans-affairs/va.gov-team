**Zoom logistics**

In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked

Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.

When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

**Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to listen in. But before we get to them, I’ll tell you about myself and what we’re doing today.
My colleagues and I work on VA.gov - making improvements to the site so that Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. What I hope to do today is to get a sense of how to best assist Veterans in deciding what claims to file. We will do that by reviewing a prototype with made-up data and having you pretend your are a Veteran named Alex. What I don’t want to do is to add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits. We may review things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation. However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the website in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.  

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure that we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people join us during this session?
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
     - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
     - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 

Optional further explanation if they express hesitation:  After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I’ll ask again for your confirmation.

Start recording & start the captions, then hide the captions..

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions  - 5 minutes

Before we review the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

- Talk to me about your past experience using the VA.gov website? 
- Could you tell me about the types of benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 
    - If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:
    - About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?
    - If you’re comfortable sharing this information, what are some of those conditions?


Great! Now let’s get into evaluating some prototypes.

We’re going to show you two prototypes that we’re working on.

These prototypes are not the real website, and they may not function exactly the way you expect. 

Some areas of the prototype will allow you to access other pages and some will not. 

And, since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

We’re going to go through a few different scenarios. For both scenarios, I’d like you to imagine that you’re currently receiving disability benefits from the VA for several service-connected health conditions, and some of those conditions have gotten worse. You’ve come to the VA website today to learn about available compensation or ask for more compensation for those conditions.

Now, I’m going to put a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat. You can navigate to open that link. Once you have that open, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. 

Wait for screen sharing to work.

For JAWS screen reader users - You will want to hit Alt S to share your screen with us.

## Scenario Yellow: Review 526 with accordions - 20 minutes
**If this is the 1st task:** (add these instructions to chat in zoom)

Your Tinnitus and Migraines have gotten worse, so you’re coming to the website to try and get more compensation. We will start you on step 2 of the application to file for disability compensation and from there, I’d like you to walk us through what you would do in this prototype. We’re skipping some of the earlier steps in the process to save time. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

**If this is the 2nd task:** 

In this scenario your Tinnitus and Migraines have gotten worse. You’re coming to the website to try and get more compensation.

**Screen 1 (Start)**

Do you have any questions before you start?

Go ahead and navigate to the Yellow prototype.

**Screen 2 (Select new or existing condition)**

**Screen 3 (View my Rated Disabilities Screen)**

I have a few questions for you on this screen.

- What is this screen telling you? What is your initial impression of it?

- What does this screen tell you about your conditions? 

- Do you think you are eligible for more compensation?
    - For which conditions? 

- What does the phrase ‘maximum standard rating’ mean to you?

- What would you do on this screen?

- (If they haven’t noticed the gray boxes) If you wanted more information about the maximum rating for Tinnitus, what would you do?

- What do you think those gray boxes are about with the plus sign?

    - (If participant selects first question) What can you tell me about this explanation for maximum standard rating?
    
    - (If participant selects second question) What can you tell me about this explanation for if you’re at the max rating and your condition has gotten worse?

- What do you think you would do after reading that/those message(s)?

- What do you think you might do here to potentially increase your overall rating?

- This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

**Things to watch for:**

Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus and/or migraines? 

**After reviewing both A & B prototypes:**

After reviewing the two different versions of this screen, which do you prefer and why? 

## Scenario Purple: Review 526 with link to additional info - 20 minutes

Instruct participant to select the link if they haven’t already

- What can you tell me about this explanation for highest standard rating?

- What do you think you would do after reading this information?

- Okay, now let’s continue with the application. How would you move forward from here? 

- What do you think you might do to potentially increase your overall rating?

## Compare prototypes

- Now that you’ve reviewed at the two different prototypes, can you tell me about the differences in how you experienced each of them?

**Best Explanation**

- Between the prototypes you saw, you can probably tell that we want to figure out a way to better inform Veterans about this concept of maximum rating. Which version explained the concept the best in your opinion?

**Explanation display**

- Between the two prototypes, which explanation worked better for you - the accordions on the screen or the link to a new page? 

**Dissuaded vs Not Dissuaded (two themes)**

- Between these two prototypes, which do you think would be more likely to influence your decision about whether or not to submit a claim for increase on Tinnitus or other conditions?

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 

- In general, I’d love to hear what you think about your overall experience - being scheduled for this research session, participating in the research session. Could we have done anything differently/better?

Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. I just want to check once more that you are still feeling good about us using your feedback or if you would like to redact anything we discussed today?

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

Well, we have covered all of the questions I had for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback! 
[In case the session was activating for the Veteran and they need further immediate support afterwards, instruct them to dial 988 and press 1]
