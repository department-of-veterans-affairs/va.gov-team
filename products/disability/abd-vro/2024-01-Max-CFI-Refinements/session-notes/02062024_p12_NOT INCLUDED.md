Could you tell me about the types of benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time?

**Screen 1 (Start)**

**Screen 2 (Select new or existing condition)**

**Screen 3 (View my Rated Disabilities Screen)**

- Scrolls down, selects Tinnitus 
- The only selection for Tennitus isn’t allowing me to do anything further... If my condition is worse, how do I get care?” 

What is this screen telling you? What is your initial impression of it? 

What does this screen tell you about your conditions?  

Do you think you are eligible for more compensation? 
- Yes 

For which conditions?  
- For Asthma, related to lung condition 

What does the phrase ‘maximum disability rating’ mean to you? 
- As far as the VA is concerned I am at the limit of what they can do for tennitus 

What would you do on this screen? 

(If they haven’t noticed the blue link) If you wanted more information about the maximum rating for Tinnitus, what would you do? 
- Clicks on link 

What do you think would happen if you selected that link? 

Instruct participant to select the link if they haven’t already 

For AT users - make sure their screenreaders are able to pull up the content on the explainer page. They may need to have them read out the headers. 

What can you tell me about this explanation for maximum disability rating? 

- "Not enjoying this session at all." Wants to leave the session.  
- The explanation of what he’s seeing doesn’t allow for much feedback other than reading the entire screen.
