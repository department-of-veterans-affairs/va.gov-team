# Research Plan: Current condition evidence, Veteran discovery
**Employee Experience Team, July 2024**

## Background

The employee experience team is exploring ways we can improve evidence submission for disability claims submitted on va.gov, in order to make claims processing go more smoothly. Through our initial research we learned that evidence of a current condition is critical to moving a claim forward, and yet it is often missing in disability claims. However, Veterans seem to lack understanding of what kind of evidence is required to prove a current condition. Some Veterans think they go to a C\&P exam to get a diagnosis, but in fact they need a diagnosis (or sufficient evidence of a current condition) in order to get an exam in the first place. 

Our previous research identified this problem through interviews with VSOs, VSRs, and RVSRs. However, we currently do not know if we can influence Veteran behavior to provide better evidence of a current condition. 

This study will explore how Veterans understand what’s required and what kind of content might influence the evidence they submit. The results will inform our decision on whether to proceed with a project around evidence of current condition.


### OCTO Priorities and Veteran Journey

This research supports [OCTO Objective 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md): Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits. In the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), it’s related to the Living Civilian Life phase, and the Moment that Matters: Managing primary care and chronic health issues.


## Research goals

Our research in this phase focuses on answering one core question: 

>Can we influence Veterans to provide better evidence of a current condition when they file a claim?


### Outcome

Findings from this research will inform OCTO’s evaluation of whether to move this project forward from Shaping to Pilot (Building). If the study suggests we could potentially influence Veteran behavior, we’ll use what we learn in this research to:

- Solidify the problem statement and benefit hypothesis

- Identify design opportunities where we can influence Veteran behavior

- Inform the next rounds of design and research work


### Research questions

We’ll specifically seek to learn: 

1. How do Veterans currently think about what information they need to provide for a new condition they’re claiming?

2. Can we provide information that will give Veterans a better understanding of what is required?

3. How useful is it to have information specifically related to the Veteran’s claimed condition?

4. If Veterans do gain a better understanding, are they more likely to provide evidence of a current condition? 

5. What else might be getting in the way?


### Hypothesis

In additional to the discovery questions outlined above, we’ll also test the hypothesis:

>Providing better information around what evidence of a current condition is required will influence some Veterans to provide the evidence needed to move their claim forward.  


## Methodology

This study will use a semi-structured interview around two primary objectives:

1. Understand how Veterans think about the topic. We'll ask them in detail about a recently filed claim or a claim they are planning to file in the future.

2. Get feedback on design concepts focusing on informational content. The first concept will show generic content. The second will include content related to specific conditions. We'll also vary the details of the information presentation to test out different approaches to explaining the topic.


### Location

Remote, via Zoom

## Recruitment

We’ll recruit Veterans who have recently filed a disability claim with the VA or who plan to file in the next 3 months.

- Target: 6 sessions (recruit for 10 to cover no-shows/cancellations)

We’ll use a lean maximum strategy for inclusivity, targeting 2 demographic criteria (education and ESL/immigrant origin) as primary sample distribution criteria, and several others as secondary criteria.
