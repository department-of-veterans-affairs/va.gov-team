# PACT Act and presumptive claims conversation guide

## Intro [0:00 - 0:05]

Thanks for joining us today! My name is *[Name]* and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the process for submitting disability claims related to toxic exposure.

I have with me on the line *[introduce note taker and observers]*.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about one hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your knowledge. We just want to improve the claim application process to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. None of your responses will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You can also skip any questions you don’t want to answer, just let me know and we’ll move on to the next one. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - *[If veteran is not sharing video, also ask if they’re willing/able to share, but don’t insist]*
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

### *Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm up [0:05 - 0:10]

Tell us a little bit about yourself.

What branch of the military did you serve in?

Are you fully retired from service? When did you retire or separate from service?

## PACT Act [0:10-0:20]

Are you familiar at all with the PACT Act?

- [If YES …]
    - What about it stands out to you as significant?
    - Do you believe you have any conditions that will be considered presumptive if it passes?
    - If so, do you plan on submitting a claim for those conditions?
- [If NO … explain at a high level what the PACT Act is, and get their response]
    - [About the PACT Act](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/vaabdvro/EdBSqOnCWdZKoD6M4P5mgusBfg-_AAfX0wLSo_geMRigSg?e=EScRqI)
- [if the veteran served in the Gulf War, War in Afghanistan or related territories]
    - Are you familiar with the Burn Pit registry? *(probe thoughtfully)*
        - [if YES] What is your understanding of what that is?
        - [if NO, move on]
- Did you register for it?
    - [If YES] What do you expect will happen when PACT Act goes into effect?
    - [If NO, move on]

## Understanding of presumptive claims [0:20-0:25]

- Are you familiar with the term ‘presumptive claim?’ What does that mean to you?
- To the best of your knowledge, were any of the conditions that you’ve submitted a benefits claim for considered a ‘presumptive’ condition?

## Disability benefits history [0:25 - 0:40]

Do you currently receive any VA benefits or services? Which ones?

Do you currently receive or have you previously applied for disability benefits from the VA?

- [If YES … ]
    - How many times have you applied for disability benefits from the VA?
    - For the most recent time you submitted, did you submit a paper application on your own, apply online through va.gov, or apply through a VSO?
    - Was it the first time you were submitting a claim for those conditions?
    - What do you remember about that process?
        - How did you know which form to use?
        - Did you get help from anyone in filing that claim?
        - Do you remember getting a notice to schedule a C&P exam? What did meaning did you make of that in regards to your claim?
    - On the claim form, it asks you to list which disabilities you are claiming benefits for. How did you think about what to enter in that section?
        - *(Note: If needed, the moderator can screen share that section of the 526ez as an aid or read aloud the specific prompt for that section)*
    - I’m going to ask you to imagine that you are submitting another claim, this time on va.gov. Imagine that the online form shows you which specific conditions you are already service-connected for. What would your reaction be?
- [If NO, ask the above but about the claim they’re planning to submit.]

## Partial ratings (if time) [0:40-0:50]

- What if you got your rating but you didn’t have to go to a C&P exam?
    - What would be good or bad about that?
- What if you had a choice whether to go to an C&P exam for the VA to decide your claim?
    - What are your reactions to this? What’s good or bad?
- What if the VA granted your claim at a certain rating level, and you had a choice of going to a C&P exam to see if you could get a higher rating?
    - *(If needed, use as an example: imagine that you have submitted a claim and you received a response from the VA. The response says that they’ve granted that claim at 20 percent based on the medical evidence about you that they already have on file. It also says that if you choose, you can go in for a C&P exam to see if your condition warrants a higher rating, but they are not requiring it and you’ll still get the 20 percent if you don’t go to the exam.)*
    - What are your reactions to this? What’s good or bad?
- What if you had a claim with a lot of different conditions on it, and the VA could decide some right away (either grant or deny) but others would take longer. What would be good or bad for you if the VA decided some right away while still working on the others, versus holding all of them until they were ready to decide on all the conditions?

## Closing Interview  [0:50-0:55]

- Do you have any comments or questions about the disability claims process that we have not yet covered today?
