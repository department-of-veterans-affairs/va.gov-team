# Product Outline: [Form 21-10210 Lay/Witness Statement](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-21-10210-are.pdf)

## Overview
As part of the [IDEA Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/
), we are prioritizing forms that have the low complexity to build / high frequency of use and high impact to Veterans. Form 21-10210 is a high impact for Veterans. The 526 Disabiity Benefits Crew is taking over ownership of this form from the VFF team. More specifically, the Pathways team.


## The lay/witness statement (VA Form 21-10210) is for statements in support of a claimed issue.

Veterans, non-veteran claimaints can submit a statement in support of their claimed issue, or a witness may submit a statement in on behalf of a Veteran or non-Veteran claimaint. People also sometimes call this statement a “buddy statement.”

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- A Veteran has a better experience using the online form than the paper form 
- A Veteran waits a reasonable time for the application tbe processed by VA business lines

## Desired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* DOMO Dashboard (TBD)
- KPI:  Measure Find a Form downloads have decreased
- KPI:  Measure digital submissions on a monthly basis


#### Baseline KPI Values

- Submissions by Mail: 28,877 (Previous Year #'s from Centeral Mail)
- The above baseline numbers are outdated at this time and new baselines need to be set
---

## Assumptions
- Providing a digital experience for this form will not overwhelm the Central Mail processing team as this team is currently managing the PDF process.
- Any future enhancements needed, the Pathways team will perform

## Solution Approach
- Focus the next iteration of the lay/witness statement to utilize V3 components (In Progress by VFF at this time; details to follow)
