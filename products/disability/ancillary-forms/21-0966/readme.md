# Product Outline: [Form 21-0966 Intent To File A Claim For Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0966-ARE.pdf)



## Overview
As part of the [IDEA Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/
), we are prioritizing forms that have the low complexity to build / high frequncy of use and high impact to Veterans. Form 26-455 has a high impact for Veterans. The 526 Disabiity Benefits Crew is taking over ownership of this form from the VFF team. More specifically, the Pathways team.
The Intent to File a Claim for Compensation and/or Pension, or Survivors Pension and/or DIC ([VA Form 21-0966](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0966-ARE.pdf) 

## What is this form
This Form Is Used to Notify VA of Your Intent to File for the Compensation, Pension, Survivors Pension, and DIC Benefit(s). The Intent to File a claim process allows applicants additional time to gather all of the information and evidence needed to support their claim(s).  

- Service Connected Claim
- Pension / Survivors Pension
- DIC Benefits

This form **does not** trigger a claim, only informs the VA of your intent to file a claim.  Would need to complete 21-526EZ(disability compensation), 21P-527EZ (Pension Claim) or 21-534EZ (Survivors Related Pension)
These forms above need to be filled out 1 year from the date of 21-0966, the intent to file a claim. This form establishes the start date of compensation of benefits if the Veteran or Claimant is awarded compensation based on the two applications above. 

This form is not required to complete the other applications, it does establish the effective date of the claim, so a Veteran can take their time in completing the lengthy application

## When to use this form
Use this form if you plan to file a disability or pension claim. If you notify us of your intent to file and we approve your claim, you may be able to get retroactive payments. Retroactive payments are payments for the time between when we processed your intent to file and when we approved your claim. An intent to file sets a potential start date (or effective date) for your benefits.



## Questions & Answers
- Q: Would an intent to file get submitted to predate the claim itself (ie if 527 was already filed could the user submit the Intent to back date the benefit date?)
- A: No, if they submit the 527 they don’t need to submit the Intent because they already filed their claim.  The Intent is an optional step if they don’t want to start the 527 but want to get the date for retro pay. 

Can the VBMS API be used to handle the Intent or was it only built to support 526?
- TBD

What are all the forms that need this Intent?
- The Veteran or Claimant would need to complete 21-526EZ (disability compensation), 21P-527EZ (Pension Claim) or 21P-534EZ (Survivors Related Pension) applications to actually receive benefits.

Does it make more sense to just make the Intent a part of those workflows instead of stand alone?
- TBD
