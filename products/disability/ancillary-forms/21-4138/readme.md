## Problem Statement
Veterans, non-Veteran claimants can submit a statement in support of their claimed issued or provide additional information needed from other Larger forms.  This form needs to be brought into the VA.gov digital experience and be made available quickly and easily.
Currently this form is a catch-all form used for many different scenario, examples below.

- If you want to support someone else's claim with a "buddy statement" use [VA Form 20-10210, Submit a Lay / Witness statement (opens in a new tab)](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/lay-witness-statement-form-21-10210/introduction).

- If you want to request your own personal records, use [VA Form 20-10206, Request personal records (opens in a new tab)](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-20-10206/)

## Assumptions
- Providing a digital experience for this form will not overwhelm the Central Mail processing team as this team is currently managing the PDF process.
- Any future enhancements needed, the Pathways team will perform


## Solution Approach
- Focus the first iteration of Form 21-4138 on enabling users to submit a singular user submission
- Digitize the existing form question set and send PDF to Central Mail for processing
- Create a sub-task at the beginning of the 4138 flow that redirects claimants to other forms if their type of statement has an alternative application/request process
- Priority processing requestors: If a user selects qualifying circumstances for priority processing in the 4138 subtask, and they continue in the same session to [the 10207](https://staging.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/request-priority-processing-form-20-10207/introduction), we will carry-over any selection or input they provide into the 10207.
