## Service Level Objectives
Our objectives are codified in the alert thresholds we've set for performance monitoring:
- [Grafana](http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/d/000000066/form-526-disability-compensation?orgId=1l)
- [Pagerduty](https://dsva.pagerduty.com)
In general, excessive latency or high error response rates from upstream services will trigger pagerduty alerts.
