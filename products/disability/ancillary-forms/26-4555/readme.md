## Overview
As part of the [IDEA Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/
), we are prioritizing forms that have the low complexity to build / high frequency of use and high impact to Veterans. Form 26-455 has a high impact for Veterans. The 526 Disabiity Benefits Crew is taking over ownership of this form from the VFF team. More specifically, the Pathways team.

## When to use this form 
The Specially Adapted Housing Grant form (VA Form 26-4555) is a transactional form to submit a request for money to modify a home for special needs. Use VA Form 26-4555 to apply for a Specially Adapted Housing grant or a Special Home Adaptation grant. The information provided helps determine or verify eligibility for these disability housing grants.
