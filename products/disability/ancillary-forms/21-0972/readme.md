# Product Outline: [Form 21-0972 Alternate Signer](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-0972-ARE.pdf)


## Overview
As part of the [IDEA Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/
), we are prioritizing forms that have the low complexity to build / high frequency of use and high impact to Veterans. 
The 526 Disabiity Benefits Crew is taking over ownership of this form from the VFF team. More specifically, the Pathways team. 

This is a low volume form

## Form 21-0972 allows a person to sign on behalf of the Veteran or Claimant
Persons are eligible to sign the form as an alternate signer if:
- You’re responsible for caring for the person with the claim
- You're appointed by the court to represent the person with the claim
- You’re authorized to make decisions for the person with the claim under durable power of attorney
- You're a manager or principal officer representing an institution that's caring for the person with the claim

And you must be able to verify that one of the following descriptions is true for the person you're signing for:
- They're under 18 years old
- They have an illness, injury, or other health condition that prevents their ability to make decisions for themselves or provide the information needed to complete forms.
