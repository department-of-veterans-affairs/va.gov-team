## Current Status
### 03/07/2024

Met with Lorri Glover and team plus Michael Harlow to discuss disrepancies between `individual_ratings` from Lighthouse and EVSS. I observed cases in production where EVSS and LH were returning ratings with the same `rated_disability_id`, but differing attributes, which is unexpected, as the previous assumption was that as long as the `disability_rating_id`s were the same, that all other attributes would match up as well. One specific case was a rating from EVSS that had no `rating_end_date` (EVSS only returns ratings with `rating_end_dates` that are in the future or null), an effective date in 2001, and a `rating_percentage` of 0, but the rating with the same ID from Lighthouse had a `rating_end_date` in the past, an effective date in 1995, and a `rating_percentage` of 10. Michael Harlow pointed out that the same ratings can have multiple "Disability Evalutations" and that Lighthouse was picking a different evaluation for that disability rating than EVSS was. We discussed the logic that EVSS does in order to derive the disability evalutation that end up in it's final response and what Lighthouse would need to do to emulate that same behavior. They are expecting to release an update the week of 03/11-03/18 to include this new logic

#### Next steps
Once Lighthouse has pushed their changes to production, the plan is to turn the feature toggle back on and incrementally increase it daily until it hits 100%. If there are no logs produced by the discrepancy controller at any time leading up to the point where we have been at 100% for a few days, then I will update the discrepancy detection logic to check that the attributes coming through (Decision, Diagnostic Type Code, Effective Date, Rating End Date, and Rating Percentage) all match for Ratings with the same IDs. If there are any logs at any point before or after hitting 100% for the feature toggle, then I will disable the featurel toggle, gather information on the discrepancies and report back to LH so that we can perform root cause analysis and they can implement another fix.
