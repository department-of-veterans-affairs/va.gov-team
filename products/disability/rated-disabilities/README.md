# Executive Summary
Rated Disabilities is a common function among the veteran community to see what their Total Calulated Disability Rating is, what has factored into that calculation and what is currently pending from the Claim Status Tool.  These data are important as they inform the Veteran what their service connected rating is and what benefits they might be elegible for.  

## User Problem Statement  
As a Veteran, I want to be able to view my Rated Disabilities quickly and easily after logging in to VA.gov.  Currently, a user might login to VA.gov, but then need to go over to ebenefits.va.gov and that might not be intuitive.  

## Solution Goals  
As with several other features within eBenefits, the effort primarily involves migrating the Rated Disabilities feature into VA.gov so that it can be viewed easily from a link from within their profile.  

### User Goals  
Presenting the Veterans Rated Disabilities information quickly and clearly without logging in, or visiting, another page.  

### Business Goals
The VA will see an added benefit in that a significant percentage of its traffic looking for this information will be better informed and receive the benefits they deserve.    

## Assumptions
The migration will be a critical strategy in getting this feature into a modern development environment and its new location will provide smoother access at the user level.    

## Requirements and Constraints
Since this feature uses the `vets-api` via EVSS, most of the endpoints are relatively easy to call and display, however, the Total Combined Disability Rating is proving to be a challenge to get a hold of.  

## Discovery Takeaways
For the most part, users use Rated Disabilities as intended, to ensure they have the correct rating.  If not, they can simply go to the Claim Status Tool and see the status.

## Solution Approach
Primarily, the solution has consisted of migrating this tool from the `ebenefits` subdomain over to VA.gov, linking from a place that makes sense (dashboard or MyVA) and implementing the VA.gov's new design system.

## Value Propositions
#### User Value  
Having Rated Disabilities closer to the VA.go experience should allow the user to feel more connected to their rating and their statuses.  

#### Business Value
Keeping the Veteran engaged should also in create an environment where benefits are transferred faster and smoother.

## KPIs  
Once a feature is moved, comparing its exposure and usage will be insightful from its old location to its new location.

# Implementation Info
## Status
- **September - October 2019:** Currently in development, designs approved, moving towards staging.
- **November 2019:** Finalizing TCDR, preparing for launch

## Solution Narrative
- **October 8, 2019:** new design elements were introduced and were re-worked into the existing mockups and frontend
- **October 2019:** Once TCDR endpoint is accessible, or at least scaffolded, Rated Disabilities should be made code complete and moved to staging
- **November 2019:** TCDR needs .yml files then integration into API.  Preparing for launch.  Moving away from EVSS with next feature.

## Error Handling
There are a few types of errors depending on the component.  The components should all reflect the state whether: the data cannot be displayed, the data cannot be reached by our system, or the data simply does not exist.
