Subject: SR-1916 VA.gov Integration with VA MPI (MVI) - Complete
 
VA.gov Team,

 

This email serves as formal notification that SR-1916 VA.gov has successfully completed its integration with VA MPI (MVI).

 

It was my pleasure assisting you in reaching this goal!

 

Please note the following processes should you have issues with VA MPI in the future:

 

·         For issues in your Production environment:

Create a ServiceNow ticket in YourIT Click here or via phone (855-673-4357)
Be as descriptive as possible, including screen shots if available
Assign the ticket to ACS Tier 3 Support
 

·         For issues in your lower environments (DEV, iDEV, SQA, PreProd):

Create a Lower Environment Trouble Ticket (LETT) Click here
Be as descriptive as possible, including screen shots if available
Your ticket will be assigned to an IAM technician for review and response
 

·         Additionally, please reach out to IAMProjectManagers@va.gov for any of the following:

There is a need to turn off VA MPI functionality
There is an expected increase (or decrease) in your application user population
 

And, of course, reach out to me if you have questions or need additional assistance.

 

Thanks,

 

Venus Lewis | MBA
