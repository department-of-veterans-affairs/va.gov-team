# Release Plan Template
## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: [April 15- April 30]
- Desired number of users: 5
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: Personal contacts, work contacts
- How you'll conduct the testing: With front end and back end support to ensure the technical aspects of the original claims integration with MVI is working.
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: On production it is live but it the veteran has to "lie" in order to get to the original claims section.

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning:
- Desired date range: April 30th to mid-May
- Desired number of unique users: 20-30
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: Using the flipper UI
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): All of the new original claims are successful at establishing a new user in MVI.

### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

More phases? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above.

1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
