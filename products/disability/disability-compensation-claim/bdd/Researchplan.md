Research Plan Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) 
(First of two usability tests)
VSA B&M1 Team, BDD, Christian Valla, February 2020
 
Background
This is part 1 of 2 for the BDD research process. 
Part 1 will be an interview about previous BDD experiences + usability testing of an Invision prototype of the BDD flow. 
Part 2 will be a usability test of the finished BDD flow in Staging. 
Service members (SM) who are separating and plan to file for disability can file their claim before separation. This is done through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. This program allows Service members to apply for VA disability compensation benefits prior to separation. Claims must be filed between 180 to 90 days prior to separation. 
Currently the BDD process is done through paper forms, by the SM and/or VSO. This requires a lot of management and processing time for VA. 
Transferring this process to a 100% online process will save VA time and resources and will also present a possibility to create a better user experience for the SM. 
 
 
Goals
To fully understand the current BDD process. What are the current necessary steps, forms, documentations? 
Understand the current user experience, when going through a BDD process using paper forms and / or VSO. How do Service Members (SM) experience this process? How is the process perceived, including: the workload, the timelines/deadlines, the complexity of the process, the pain points, the need for support/info.
 
Questions for stakeholders
What info is absolutely necessary to capture from SM in the online BDD version? 
What questions from form 526ez are necessary? Confirm with Paul’s documents. 
What questions from New Claims Form is necessary? 
 
Research questions
For the interview part about former BDD experiences
What are the current steps for submitting a BBD claim? 
How (and when) do SM find out about the BDD process? 
What are the necessary info and documentation they need? 
Do SM file alone or with a VSO?
What are the current timelines for BDD claims?
What percentage of SM starting a BDD claim is registering at VA.gov for the first time? 
What was most confusing in the process?
What is the workload and time commitment for the SM?
What were the pain points in the process? 
What was the most helpful in the process?
Did the SM have the info and documentation necessary? 
 
For the usability test of the BDD prototype
How do users expect to get to this flow / process?
What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD flow?
Are there any confusing steps in the flow of the HLR submission process?
Are the steps clearly defined or self-explanatory?
Does the user organically move from step to step?
Does the user need more information to move forward?
Is there any confusing or ambiguous language that exists in the HLR content?
Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?
Are there other questions or concerns the user has while completing the HLR process?
What do veterans think will happen after the form is submitted?

Hypotheses
The current BDD process is time consuming and requires a lot of effort from the Service Member. 
The Service Members want to have the opportunity to do the BDD process 100% online. 
The BDD flow can to a large degree be based on New Claims format, and the questions taken from 526ez form highlighted by Paul Shute. 
Method
We will conduct a usability test with 8-10 active Service Members. 
We will be using remote, moderated usability studies.
The first interview round will also include a 10-15 min part about their former BDD experiences. 
We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.
We will ask Veterans to navigate to an Invision link (provided in the Zoom chat) and share their screens with us via Zoom.
Participants & Recruiting
 
We would like to interview 8-10 participants.
In order to get 8-10 participants, we will schedule 15 participants total, with the expectation that there will be a max of 7 no-shows
Paul Schute, our stakeholder, will recruit and schedule 7 people
We will need Perigeon to schedule an additional 8 people
 
For the participants Perigeon recruits:
All must have completed a BDD claim. (Or at least started one?)
Variation in: age, gender, location, tech savviness.
Must be able to describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing and what they are thinking as they move through the prototype.
Must be able to use Zoom, chat and share screen through Zoom, and navigate the Invision prototype.
