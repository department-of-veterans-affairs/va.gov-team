**General Process Notes**

- We’ve required the veteran to submit a service record - It’s impossible for them to upload the record package

- AHLTA Web Print - this is the foundational basis for the service record - get from DoD

- Then we would move forward with the claim

**AWP (AHLTA Web Print) 15 days of notice**

- VA wants this record - get the record within 15 days 
- May 1st 2020 for that process

**Some Friction Points**

- It’s difficult for them to speak with someone  - they run out of time - they need to do this process quickly

- Looking forward to the streamlined process

- Top counselors expressed issues with ebenefits pushing to va.gov - then they get pushed back to ebenefits

- Ebenefits one of our struggles - trouble capturing certain EPs - we don’t have a true picture of all those claims coming through ebenefits

- It’s submitted as a BDD claim but it’s excluded by the claim label in the EP

**Other Considerations**

What info do we capture from the 526? How does that help the claim? Passing that data over and how that might expedite the process in other systems?
