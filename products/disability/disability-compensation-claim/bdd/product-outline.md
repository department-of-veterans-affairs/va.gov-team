# Executive Summary

## Abstract

The BDD program allows Service members to apply for their disability benefits before separation. This provides time for VA to schedule exams, review treatment records and evaluate the claim before separation, with most claimants receiving their decision the day after leaving active duty.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program has made significant improvements in disability claim processing over the past year, with most service members who submitted claims through the program receiving decisions within 30 days of discharge.

BDD allows service members to file a claim for disability between 90 and 180 days prior to discharge from active duty, which provides time for paperwork review and medical exams prior to leaving. 

“This is an important program for our service members as they transition to Veteran status,” said VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. “The faster we can connect our Veterans with the benefits they deserve, the smoother their transition.”

In fiscal year (FY) 2018, the first full year of the revamped program, more than 36,000 service members submitted claims through BDD and about 53 percent of completed claims received a decision on their claim within 30 days. In the first month of FY 2019, 3,437 claims were completed with 57.7 percent completed within 30 days.

Throughout FY 2018, the program made continuous improvements, which include:

- Expanding BDD claim review from two locations, to processing at any regional office 
- Enhanced software partnerships with the Department of Defense to improve record transfers
- Additional claim training and performance standards for military service coordinators.

## Terminology/Glossary

- BDD: Benefits Delivery at Discharge
- Separation/Discharge Date: Date when service member becomes a veteran

## User Problem Statement
Currently the service member needs to go through eBenefits to access the BDD process.  When navigating to eBenefits and searching for "BDD" and/or "discharge" the search results do not provide a link to how to apply for this benefit.  Therefore, we want to move this capability to the VA.gov website and make it easy to fine and apply for the benefit.

_I am a Service Member who is in need of filing a Disability Claim, but since I have not yet been discharged I and have never filed one before I am not able to do so on VA.gov and am forced to have to complete it on the eBenefits website instead, which is an upfavorable user experience._

## Solution Goals

### User Goals

- **Veterans:** Submit a Benefits Delivery at Discharge claim on VA.gov

- **Intake Admin Professionals:** Review and approve or further develop the BDD claim

### Business Goals

- Make it easier for the Veteran to find the BDD claims process
- Reduce cost by reducing paper form (526) submissions
- Reduce turn around time over paper forms
- Ensure our new veterans have little or no lag between their separation and receiving their benefit

## Assumptions

- Market validation: There is an express and present need for a self-service disabilty claims capabilty for service members with their separation date in the next 90-180 days.
- Veterans will submit disabilty claims online with or without representation
- Digital submissions will not create an undue burden on VBA/ Compensation/ other LOB case workers
- Product will use existing Vet360 integration to pre-populate known information
- Product will use existing claims API to pre-populate known claims and appeals information
- Notifications about application state are out of scope
- The BDD fact sheet will be updated to show the VA.gov experience for BDD claims

### Product Assumptions: Veteran User Group

-	I can log in to va.gov
-	I am separating in the next 90-180 days
- I file the claim between 180 and 90 days prior to separation
- I can provide a copy of their service treatment record
- I can be available for 45 days from the date the claim is submitted to attend VA exams
-	I can find out about additional limitations of this claims process under the BDD Fact Sheet
-	I can select or enter the contention I would like submitted for consideration of a benefit
-	I can make all the selections online that I can make on the paper forms
-	I can complete and submit a BDD claim
-	I can understand whether the submission was successful, and what I need to do to correct it if not
-	I can easily resubmit a BDD claim request if it was unsuccessful the first time

### Product Assumptions: Claims Assistant User Group

- TBD

## Requirements and Constraints

Major changes happened recently, section will be updated.

## Discovery Takeaways

Luke has this data, needs to update.

## Solution Approach

This is being filled in after the fact.

## Value Propositions

### User Value

"You don't have to deal with paper forms, potentially making mistakes that will cost you and your family years of cycling with the VA. If you feel like you have a handle on the appeals process, you can file one yourself, all online, in the time it takes to brew coffee."

### Business Value

"You can reduce the burden on Intake staff significantly by providing them fact-checked information directly from VA partner systems." WIP: this will be further developed when the existing metrics are better understood (see KPIs, below).

## Objectives and Key Results

Objective 1: Greater number of service members applying for benefits as they transition from active military to veteran status.
- KR1: Tableau data shows an increase statistically significant over current growth patterns of BDD claims.

Objective 2: Shorter gap between separation from service and receiving claims.
- KR1: New veteran is receiving disability benefit within 30 days of separation.
- KR2: Tableau data backs up claim digital < paper in terms of speed of processing.

Objective 3: Application process is simpler than paper form.
- KR1: BDD process pulls in veteran data from VA-accessible military database.
- KR2: BDD process only asks questions that are essentially or greatly helpful for purposes of filing/deciding on a claim.

Objective 4: Higher digital conversion rates and lower paper form submission.
- KR1: Tableau data shows a decrease statistically significant over current growth patterns of BDD paper claims.

**Overall Metrics, Ideas**
- Veterans are more satisfied with their claims process -> this really is an Objective should remove this.
- Lower processing costs (can we prove this)
- Less time to complete forms (baseline needed)
- Less time to get adjudication/completion from VA for original claims (since BDD is part of original claims flow)
- Less HLR, NOD, Supplemental Claims (not an easy metric to capture but could look at slowed growth)
