# Benefits Delivery at Discharge

## Summary

Service members who are separating and plan to file for disability can file their claim
before separation. This is done through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits Delivery at
Discharge (BDD) program. This program allows Service members to apply for VA
disability compensation benefits prior to separation. Claims must be filed between
180 to 90 days prior to separation.

## Program Requirements
To be eligible for BDD, Service members must:
- Know their separation date
- File their claim between 180 and 90 days prior to separation
- Provide a copy of their service treatment record
- Be available for 45 days from the date the claim is submitted to attend VA exams
The following issues and conditions are excluded from BDD:
- Service members who do not meet the requirements above,
- Claims requiring case management, such as Service members who:
-- Are seriously ill or injured
-- Lost a body part
-- Are terminally ill
- Claims requiring a VA exam in a foreign country, except those that can be
processed through Landstuhl, Germany or Camp Humphreys, Korea,
- Claims for Service members awaiting discharge while hospitalized in a VA or
military treatment facility,
