Intro - (5 minutes)
-------------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we're going to talk about the online form 526, specifically the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) version. BDD allows members in active duty to apply for disability benefits from the VA, prior to separation (this ensures a  veteran receives payments sooner after separating from the service).

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability, we're testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome.

-   During our session today, you'll be interacting with a prototype of a website. The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, don't worry, I will guide you along. Of course, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)
-----------------------------

-   Before we look at the prototype of the website, let's start with a few general questions.

-   Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of prompts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)

Short Interview claim / BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-5 minutes)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs? (or a normal disability claim (after end of active duty)?

-   How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)?

-   Tell me about how it was to go through this process.

-   What was most confusing within this process?

-   Was there anything, in particular, that was helpful in this process?

Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2-5 minutes)
-----------------------------------------------------------

-   Let's spend a few minutes now, where I send you the prototype of the website we will look at today.

-   First, please minimize or close any windows that you don't want to share with us.

-   Now I'm going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app?

-   Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there.

-   Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the "Share" button in Zoom?

Task 1 (20-25 minutes)
----------------------

-   Imagine you are still in active duty, and there is 100 days before your duty ends. You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA, prior to separation. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.

-   Please look at the prototype of the VA website and show me how would apply for for disability benefits through this program. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

-   You want to file a claim for a neck sprain and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear).

-   Please talk out loud as you move through the form, so I can understand what you are trying to do and what you are thinking and experiencing. 

[Allow participants to go through the Form by themselves.]

What to look for and be mindful of:

-   Participants' first impressions and thoughts about the questions and pages.

-   Do they feel that they have all the info they need to file a claim?

-   What is missing?

-   Do they experience any question or page as confusing or unclear?

-   What usability issues and pain points exist?

-   What was most helpful for the participant? 

-   What keywords and phrases do the participant look for?

-   Ambivalence in the language

-   What works well / does not work well?

Note: hesitations, questions, slowdowns, success rate, etc.

Task 2 (10-20 minutes)
----------------------

-   Would it be ok for you if we go back and look at a few pages in more detail, as I have a couple of follow-up questions?

[Have the participant go to the pages we want to probe more into]. 

#### Probes:

-   What do you think is the main purpose of this page?

-   Do you think this page accomplishes its purpose?

-   What is confusing or unclear on this page?

-   What usability issues and pain points exist?

-   What works well / does not work well on the page?

-   What was most helpful for the participant? 

-   What should be changed or added to this page to make it more useful?

-   Any ambivalence in the language?

Post-Task Interview
-------------------

-   Overall what do you think about going through this process?

-   [if they've gone through the BDD process on paper] What do you think of this process versus the paper process you've gone through?

-   If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

-   What was the best part about this process?

-   Any other comments?

Thank You and Closing
---------------------

-   We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is helpful to us as we continue to work on improving these websites.

-   Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
