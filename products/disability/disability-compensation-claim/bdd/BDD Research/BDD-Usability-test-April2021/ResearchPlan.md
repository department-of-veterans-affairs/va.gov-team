Research Plan for a Usability test of Form 526 
===============================================

VSA Claims & Appeals Team, Form 526, Christian Valla, April 2021.

Background
----------

This is a usability test of Form 526 (the Benefits Delivery at Discharge version). 

Several changes have been made to Form 526 in the last several months. A comprehensive usability test with veterans is therefore needed. 

Veterans with a disability and who are planning to apply for a benefit for their condition(s), can use the online version of Form 526 to apply: <https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction>. 

Service members in active duty, that have a discharge date between 90-180 days from today, can apply for benefits through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge program, to receive their benefits sooner after they discharge. 

We have built a prototype of the online 526 Form in Invision that we will show participants. <https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/console/share/K310RJ11GMWE/600538602>

Goals
-----

-   Understand the current user experience, what pain points and usability issues exist, including confusing or unclear content/copy. 

-   Is any necessary information missing throughout the form?

-   Can participants go through the flow by themselves, without any problems or blockers? 

Research questions
------------------

-   What usability issues and pain points exist in the 526 form?

-   Can users go through the form with ease and no blockers?

-   Is there any confusion with regards to language and terms used? 

-   Do participants feel they have all the information they need to complete the form?

Method  
--------

-   We will be conducting a remote, moderated usability study with approximately 8 Veterans (separated from active duty).

-   Allowing users to interact with and walk through the 526 Form online, on their own, in their own environment, can help us detect usability issues they encounter, in a test situation that is as close as possible to the "real" situation.  

-   We will create and test an Invision prototype (post link here). 

-   We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.

-   The sessions will include a short interview (3-5 min.) about their experience with VA.gov and any disability claims they have applied for (or planned to apply for). 

-   We will ask Veterans to navigate to the Invision prototype (a link provided in the Zoom chat) and have participants share their screen with us via Zoom.

-   We will ask the participants to go through the 526 Form, and perform a task: they will submit a claim for a condition (Tinnitus), as well as a few sub-tasks. 

-   We will ask participants to speak out loud as they move through the form, and probe for usability issues and relevant feedback. 

-   Pre-test interview questions will probe past experiences with VA.gov and submitting a claim (paper or online). 

Participants and Recruitment
----------------------------

We would like to interview 8 participants.

-   In order to get 8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 15 participants in total, with the expectation that there will be a max of 7 no-shows.

-   Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and be able to share their screen on Zoom.

-   Participants must be able to open and interact with an Invision prototype of the 526 Form, as well as describe what they are experiencing and trying to accomplish. 

-   Participants must confirm their session the day before by responding to Perigean's email or phone message, or at the latest the day of the interview.   

-   1 person or more with a 70% disability rating or higher.
