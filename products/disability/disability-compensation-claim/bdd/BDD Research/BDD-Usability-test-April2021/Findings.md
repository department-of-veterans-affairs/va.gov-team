Background
----------

This is a usability test of the Form 526 (the Benefits Delivery at Discharge version). 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several changes have been made to Form 526 in the last several months. A comprehensive usability test with veterans is therefore needed. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Veterans with a disability and who are planning to apply for a benefit for their condition(s), can use the online version of Form 526 to apply: <https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction>. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Service members in active duty, that have a discharge date between 90-180 days from today, can apply for benefits through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge program, to receive their benefits sooner after they discharge. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have built a prototype of the online 526 Form in Invision that we will show participants. <https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/console/share/K310RJ11GMWE/600538602>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals
-----

-   Understand the current user experience, what pain points and usability issues exist, including confusing or unclear content/copy. 

-   Is any necessary information missing throughout the form?

-   Can participants go through the flow by themselves, without any problems or blockers? 

Research methodology
--------------------

-   We did a remote, moderated, task-oriented usability study with 7 Veterans, using Zoom.

-   We used the following[ Invision prototype.](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/console/share/K310RJ11GMWE/600538602) 

-   The sessions included a short interview (3-5 min.) about their experience with VA.gov and any disability claims they have applied for (or planned to apply for). 

-   We asked the participants to go through the 526 Form, and perform a task: to submit a claim for two conditions (Neck sprain and Tinnitus).

-   We finally asked the participants a set of questions about their experience.

Who we spoke with
-----------------

-   Seven total participants (3 female and 4 male, four between age 25 and 44, three between age 55 and 64).

-   Five were from major metro areas while one was from a rural area. (one was an "unknown").

-   Highly educated sample: Five had a Bachelor degree or a Master degree, one had an Associate's Degree, and one had some college). 

Research questions
------------------

-   What usability issues and pain points exist in the 526 form?

-   Can users go through the form with ease and no blockers?

-   Is there any confusion with regards to language and terms used? 

-   Do participants feel they have all the information they need to complete the form?

Findings 
---------

1.  Five participants had either heard about the BDD program or submitted a BDD claim. All had used a VSO and believed the help from a VSO was critical. 

-   One participant suggested adding information about the possibility of getting help from a VSO/VSA to the page/form.

3.  Overall participants found the Form to be easy to fill out and mostly self-explanatory. Participants value the drop-downs with added information and the phone numbers that they can call if they need to. 

4.  A few participants were concerned that not everyone would be able to remember the start date of their Service Reserve period.

-   If users had a nested active service period, they would click button "Add another service period"

-   If users were called upon by the Federal, they would also click "Add another service period".

-   Participants are not sure what VA wants with regards to "Unit name" under Reserve period. If they have been in several units, should they provide the first or last unit, or the unit they spend the longest time in? 

-   Participants think the use of the terms Service start/end date (for Active duty) and Obligation start/end date (for Reserve) makes sense.

6.  When a participant is asked to list "New conditions", there is inconsistent use of the term Conditions and Disabilities. 

-   One participant argues that "Conditions" be used for new issues, and "Disabilities" be used for already existing issues/disabilities.

VA will decide if a veterans condition or an issue is in fact a disability (and if this should be granted benefits).

-   A couple of participants were confused why we asked for "New" conditions if this is the first time they apply for a BDD.  

1.  A few veterans were confused about uploading Service Treatment Records (STR). They feel it does not make sense that a Service member needs to obtain and scan the STR  (that could be several hundreds documents), and upload them. They expect the VA to be able to pull these from the military. "

If the Member needs to have digital copies of their STR in order to complete the form, the Member should be made aware of this early in the form.

-   A few veterans were confused about how we ask for STR and Private Medical Records and Other Evidence separately. A few participants missed the "Other Evidence" checkmark.

If I could check both boxes (Private medical records & other evidence) there should be a note that tells you -- I would not have known I could check both (boxes).

-   Two participants (after uploading STR)  clicked on "Upload another file" in order to upload Private Medical records. 

-   One participant suggested that there be a definition or example of what Private Medical records as well as Other Evidence could be. 

1.  A few participants think that the Service member might change their bank account when they discharge from duty. They suggest allowing for several bank accounts or at the least show the Service member how/where they can update their bank account info.

2.  Several participants are confused, or hesitate when asked if they have uploaded all the documentation they need in order to support their claim. Several participants believe this is a question they need help from a VSO/VSA to answer. They are concerned that they will not be able to add evidence later. They are not sure what VA needs. They are not 100% sure about the consequence of their choice on this page.

This seems pretty final, so I would click No just in case there is another thing worth adding -- I've dealt with the VA enough to know that there is always another piece of paper.

-   One veteran suggested adding a FAQ section here.

-   Not everyone noticed the drop down. They felt that this info was very important, and that it is somewhat hidden under the drop down.  

1.  On the Submitted page, most participants would like the option to print that page, or print the entire form filled out, as well as save as a PDF. Two participants want to email it.

-   Two participants wanted to see a time estimate (even if it was a rough estimate). One participant would expect to see some sort of claim number on the page.

Recommendations
---------------

1.  Consider if additional information about getting support from a VSA/VSO is needed on the form. 

2.  Add information about how/where Service members can find the start date of their Active Duty or Reserve period.

3.  Add info about what Unit the Service Member should choose (The last unit they were in? The unit they were in the longest?) for the Reserve Periods. 

4.  Use the terms Conditions, Issues and Disabilities consistently. A participant suggested that Disabilities were already existing issues/disabilities (and therefore termed a Disability by the VA), while conditions are a new issue, not yet determined by VA whether it is a disability (eligible for benefits) or just an issue (not eligible). This seems to be a good way to differentiate these terms. 

5.  Consider a new organization of the question about uploading evidence. Make it more that there are 3 types of evidence for VA: STR, Private medical records and Other evidence. Give examples of each. Rethink using check marks for Private medical records and Other evidence. (Several participants did not see the Other evidence checkbox.)   

6.  Consider adding info about how Service members can change bank accounts later.

7.  When asked if they have uploaded everything, remove the dropdown link and make this information available on the page. State clearly that additional evidence can be submitted later, without making their claim weaker. Consider adding a FAQ section.
