<h2 id="toc_5">Intro - (2-5 minutes)</h2>

<p>Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Today we&#39;re going to talk about the appeals process on VA.gov, specifically an appeals process that we call a Higher Level Review. </p>

<p>Before we start, a few things I want to mention:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>This entire session should take about 60 minutes.</strong> I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.</strong> We are not testing your ability. In reality, we&#39;re testing our online services, in order to improve these tools to better meet Veteran&#39;s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Both positive and negative feedback is very welcome. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>During part of our session today, you&#39;ll be interacting with a prototype of a website.</strong> The prototype may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. But, dont worry, I will guide you along. 
Of course none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.</strong> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?</strong> We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. </p>

<ul>
<li>If yes: <strong>Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.</strong> </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Start recording.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>I have started recording. I&#39;d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_3">Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Before we look at the prototype of the website, let’s start with a few general questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell me a little about yourself. (Examples of promts: Where do you live? Which branch of service? Have you done an interview or usability test like this before? How was that experience?)</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_5">Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?</li>
<li>How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?</li>
<li>Tell me about how it was to go through this process.<br></li>
<li>What were the hardest parts?</li>
<li>What was most confusing within this process? </li>
<li>Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?</li>
<li>If you would do it again, would you do anything different?</li>
<li>Do you have any other comments about this process? </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_4">Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Lets spend a few minutes now, were I send you the prototype of the website we will look at today. </li>
<li>First, please minimize or close any windows that you don&#39;t want to share with us.</li>
<li>Now I&#39;m going to share a link to the prototype in the zoom chat. Can you find the chat button in the Zoom app? </li>
<li>Great, can you click on it? There should be a link you can click on there. </li>
<li>Can you navigate back to the Zoom window and click the &quot;Share&quot; button in Zoom? </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_6">Task 1 (4-5 minutes)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>You have heard of a program that allows active Service Members to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.</p></li>
<li><p>Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it.
[they do the task]</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_7">Task 2</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have. </p></li>
<li><p>How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. 
(Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)</p></li>
<li><p>What are you thinking as you look through this initial page? </p></li>
<li><p>Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program? </p></li>
<li><p>If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page? </p></li>
<li><p>Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking). </p></li>
