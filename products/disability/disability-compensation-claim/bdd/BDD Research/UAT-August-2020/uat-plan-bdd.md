# Research Plan for UAT for Benefits Delivery at Discharge (form 526)

## Goals
1. **What product & team are you doing this research for?**

This UAT will be conducted with one group of service members requesting their first disability claim before they are discharged from the miltary using the BDD tool built into the 526 flow, and a second group of service members that submit a normal claim within 1-89 days of separation.

Note that the Service Members will submit a real claim (either a normal claim or a BDD claim), and need to agree to do this in the session. We have Paul Shute and Barry Cooper in the session, that can correct anything after the submissions, if needed. 

2. **Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?**

Service members who are separating and plan to file for disability can file their claim before separation. This is done through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. This program allows Service members to apply for VA disability compensation benefits prior to separation. Claims must be filed between 180 to 90 days prior to separation.  In addition to testing 90-180 days before separation, although 1-89 days before separation is not a BDD eligible claims submission, it will still be accepted by VSA and EVSS will treat it with a different EP code that is similar to "quickstart".

3. **Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?** 

- Can service members within 90-180 days of separation submit a claim on VA.gov? (BDD claim)
- Can service members within 1-89 days of separation submit a claim on VA.gov? (non-BDD claim)

4. **Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?** 

- Both categories of service members will be able to submit claims and EVSS will accept them.

## Method
1.	**What method of research are you planning?**
  
  - Moderated UAT.
  - These sessions will not be recorded. 
  
2.	**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** 

- We have already done integration testing with EVSS and have completed rounds of usabilty with new designs.  This testing is to determine a go/no go decision with rolling out BDD to 25%.

-Specifically we want 5 active service members, that are eligible for BDD, submit a real BDD claim in the UAT test. The 5 service members must understand that they are submitting a real BDD claim, be eligible and have all the necessary documents ready for the UAT sessions. They need also to be ready for a VA claim exam 45 days after they submit the claim 

-We also want 5 VA veterans, (separated 1-89 days ago) that will submit a normal claim. The 5 service members must understand that they are submitting a real claim, be a VA member and be eligible to submit a normal claim, and have all the necessary documents ready for the UAT sessions. They need also to be ready for a VA claim exam 45 days after they submit the claim 

3.	**Where are you planning to do your research?**

- Through Zoom


4.	**What will you be testing?**

- Submit a claim 1-89 days before separation.
- Submit a claim 90-180 days before separation (BDD). Test BDD functionality and the wizard that directs them to the BDD version of 526.

## Participants and Recruitment

1.	**Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

We would like **5** participants who MUST meet the following criteria:
Required for participating in this study:
