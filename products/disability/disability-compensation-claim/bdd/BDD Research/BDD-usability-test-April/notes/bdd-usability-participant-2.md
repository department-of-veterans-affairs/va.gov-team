DATE/TIME OF INTERVIEW: [5/20/20] at [12] PM EST

# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 2 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)


*goes through intro*



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: Yes I have.


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?

P: I used a VSO.


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.

P: Uhm, it was somewhat rigid. Most of the info I recieved it was through the TAP class and Reddit and feedback from vets who went through the process. Then I went through the TAP course.


C: What was most confusing within this process?

P: I think the stages of the process of filing a BDD...I know there were some booklets through the TAP course that outlines how it works and what you need to do - not always that simple since not every branch works the same way - some things from medical providers can be a daunting task as there is paperwork you have to have in place.


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?

P: I just think patience (laughs)...just patience. I understand a lot of things are out of my control. You're relying on them to relay information you've given to him or her. And you're relying on VA to get you some of the outcomes you're hoping for.


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?

P: I probably wouldn't have spent so much time doing the BDD - I don't believe there is much difference in doing the BDD claim - as opposed to someone who's doing it 90 days or less. It gets processed the same way on the back end.


C: Do you have any other comments about this process?



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

C: Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. 

P: First, I don't really look for information on the va website - usually I find info on third party websites. The information I find on third party sources gives me the information I need.

C: If you had to use the VA website, how would you find the info you're looking for?

P: I've used some of this stuff before, like service member benefits...I would probably use the search function to find what I'm looking for.

C: You can try that.

P: So yeah, there's nothing on BDD that I can find, but...yeah, I dunno. Not sure.

C: So you mentioned using search?

P: Yeah let me see if I can find it...Oh yeah, it's up here.

C: Was that difficult to find?

P: Yeah, if it's hidden, I'm not gonna use it. My eyes don't really go there.

C: So what would you put in here?

P: So yeah, BDD.

C: Click on first search result. Tell me what you think about this page.

P: So...this seems like a FAQ area. I already know some of this....what if I have less than 90 days - already know that. It already tells me what I know from the TAP program. It's repetitive, kind of like a circular motion.

C: So what do you think about that? 

P: I think it's a waste of time and money! Not trying to be rude or anything, but...it's a waste of time. Facts sheet.

C: Any other comments?

P: So how do I file a claim? That's more info that I already know. All this is pretty well known throughout the service community. Maybe those who are coming from overseas. That might be helpful. Educational benefits, housing assistance...that doesn't have anything to do with BDD - why is this here?


C: OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw?

P: Ok, so let's see - so file for overseas - I already like this - I think it would be beneficial. Also I think a 'file while stateside' would be great too. So people know I can do this myself. I can take my discharge into my own hands instead of relying on someone else to do it for me. I like the video feature - I think anything over 3-5 minutes long is too long. But this says under 3 minutes so I think that's good - and the video would let them know if it's worth looking further down. The FAQ portion does seem relevant. If none of this applies to you, then you can file this - it lets them know they can do that. that's great. I would click this function. The other information underneath - I don't mind this, but - most might know it. 

C: What do you prefer on this page vs the other page and why?

P: It's streamlined, and it's not so much an FAQ - it just kinda tells you what you're eligible for. It gets to the point, there's not a lot of fluff - too much information takes up the users time.


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

What are you thinking as you look through this initial page?

Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program?

If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page?

Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).


INFO PAGE

P: So this is good - tells you what you need to supply for supporting documents. So is there more suppoirting docs? Or is this it?

C: Yeah so what would you think?

P: Well...maybe such as but not limited to other things that you can supply. So this is telling me I need to go to another page or another window that would ask for additional evidence outside of these 3. Okay, umm...I like the 'let's get started' feature. 

C: So we can imagine that you have not separated yet.

P: Ok, that makes sense. 

C: So before we continue filing a BDD claim, what do you think about this page?

P: I think it's a step in the right direction...I think that it cleared up if I'm eligible on the previous page I was on. If the separation date was not in July but April and they separated the next month and there would be a fault on the backend saying that you would not be able to do so. Are you ready to file your claim online? then they take you through the process from there.

C: Any other comments on this page before we continue?

P: No. So I would file.


INTRO PAGE

P: Save time - work in progress. I like that. You're not gonna have everything you need in one sitting so I like that. Ok, good. So sign in to file BDD. So are you already signed in at this poiint?

C: No, you are not signed in at this point.

P: So you're coming from the home page...got it.

C: So you're signed in now.


SERVICE MEMBER INFO

P: That's all there. straightforward.


MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY

P: I was looking at what step I was on. Progression bar.

P: I would be interested to see what would change if you said 'federal reserves or national guard'. There are some rules and payments made based off certain conditions. But obviously if you haven't filed at that point, it might not apply. 


DISABILITIES

P: New claims? Yes. So at this point I would stop - because I would need to get all my info from my medical provider. There's this function in the Air Force called 'medical form'. If I start typing, what would happen?

C: It would autocomplete whatever you start typing in.

P: so I can type something in there and it will still take it, even if it's not displayed in the options?

C: Yes correct.


NECK SPRAIN

P: I like that it's a required field bceause a military member can actually put what happened. it would be good to hear from a veteran perspective as to how their injury happened.


TINNITUS



ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS




SUPPORTING EVIDENCE



BANK ACCOUNT

P: This is interesting - well, it's your bank account information. I had to do it during the process as well....I think maybe explaining why, I mean it says why but...I gave mine back in October and I haven't heard anything. Let's say a claim is filed and an award is given...I think that should be another step.

C: Yeah so this might be too early to ask for bank info?

P: In my personal opinion, yeah. You might be giving this information for no reason.




REVIEW

P: I like this whole summary page.

C: Can you say what you like about this summary page?

P: I like that it kinda gives you an oveview of what you just did - so if something needs to be changed, you have that last minute opportunity - maybe you added it weeks before and came back. 

C: Do you think you can edit it directly on this page?

P: I was thinking you could go back - but ideally, maybe you could do it here. That might be a challenge on the backend, those who are writing the code. But yeah, I like all this stuff.

C: So nothing here is unclear?

P: Private medical records...so I'm guessing this is someone who has already separated from the military? So because most military members cannot have private medical records...at least I wasn't allowed.

C: Ah, ok, so you think this is unnecessary?

P: So I think so.

C: Ok, so we can just continue.



SUBMIT

C: Last page. Is anything here confusing?

P: I would go here to see how you would track it?

C: What would you hope to find if you clicked the track status?

P: maybe something more intuitive than what you find on the current homepage. There are some things going on behind the scenes that you don't see as the Veteran, maybe a process showing CMP exams are complete, VA review. So it shows a natural progression. So they can read a script on their end. 

C: It would be a more intuitive process?

P: Yeah, exactly. less calls coming in.

C: Any other comments about this page?

P: I don't like the 'process applications in order we receive them.' That's not true...I think they process claims in the complexity that they are. There are people who have filed after me and have gotten their benefits before me.

What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: I like that it adds the functionality to the website so the Vet can take charge of his/her claim. I like the save feature.

C: What do you think of the length of the flow?

P: I don't think it's a problem so long as you are making progess and can see you're making progress. A vet who is applying for BDD - they can submit the documents they need to file their claim - I think it's the right amount of time.



C: [if they've gone through the BDD process on paper] What do you think of this process versus the paper process you've gone through?




C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: Uhm...hmm. We're specifically talking about BDD. I think I would add some features for those who are overseas, or those in the guard. I would add a few steps. I would add the R&D to determine what they need to do on their end to process a VA disability claim. I think maybe adding a question in there. Based on that info, this needs to be done. Not sure what that looks like, but I think in the future it would help.

C: What was the best part about this process?

P: Uhm..I like entering the claims. 

C: Why was that good?

P: It seems easy. I think there's some satisfaction that you can actually type in your own medical records in here. As opposed to relying on someone else. There was a portion in there that said you can type and it would find it but you can still add it even if it wasn't found, was good. I think maybe adding or attaching documents to that would be good as well, obviously with HIPAA on there as well.
