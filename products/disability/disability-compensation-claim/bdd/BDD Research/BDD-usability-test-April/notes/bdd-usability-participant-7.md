# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 2 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*goes through intro*



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: I did apply for benefits prior to my actual discharge of actual duty.


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?

P: Initially I did it with assistance, there was a seminar conducted at the unit I was attached to at the time.


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.

P: I remember it being a multi-step process, filling out the form, took a while. Not the easiest thing to figure out.

C: What was most confusing within this process?

P: I just remember it being a very long form. Trying to figure out what to apply for as well. There are so many things that could potentially result in a rating. What would count, what wouldn't count, etc. 


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?

P: The VSO was pretty helpful. They did point out a lot of different things and clarify some of the lesser known items we should put on there. In that sense they were quite helpful. That's kinda where their assistance ended though. After that I had no interaction with them.


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?

P: I've actually applied for increases a couple times. I've done that entirely online. And it's ummm...the website was a little confusing and it was a little hard to figure out what had to be done and where everything was in the process. I guess even just logging in. I had to use my ID card to login just to set up the password and log in. I think things have improved since the first time I did my app. What is something that could be considered rateable, what does the actual process look like, etc. 

C: Do you have any other comments about this process?

C: What would you like to see improved in this process? Number one thing?

P: Are you familiar with the Domino's Pizza tracker? Something on that level, sommething to tell you what stage you're in...something to tell you which step you're on. If there's an issue with the application, I can click on that, and they need more info from my doctor, say - and I can help speed that along.

C: So you want something like a dashboard?

P: Right, and I know there is something like that, but it doesn't tell you where you're at in the process, what I need to do to move it along the process, and how long it's going to take to complete that process. Here's the steps you're going to take, and after you apply, here's what's going to happen...I know there is some fraud in the system and concerns like that, but at the same time, knowing the person that is evaluating my claim knows what it's about. Or perhaps the evaluator could come to my appointment with me. If you can use certain tests to back up the claim, like an MRI, maybe that's part of the process. Maybe an automatic step is like, 'go to get this test done.'



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]

P: Uhh, so for filing a disability initially, my eye would go straight to the disability box, then I would go to the link that says file a claim for compensation. 

C: So you can click on that and tell me if you think that's the right page or not.

P: Looking through it it seems like it's the right spot to get the info I need and to start. 

C: So this is the right page but where would you start the claim? If you were to file online.

P: So I'd go to that green button.

C: So that's correct. What do you think about this page overall? What is your first impression?

P: First impression is, it's gonna tell me how to file a claim, what do I need, find out if I'm eligible, so I've got a link here...

C: Go ahead and click on it if you like...

P: Gather any evidence....ask myself what evidence do I need but it shows me here...noticing a lot internal VA terminology. 

C: Do you have examples?

P: yes, like here - 'fully developed claims'...do I need to know this at this point in the process?

C: So when you see these internal VA terms, does it confuse you?

P: I look at it and I don't know what it is...can I submit one? Ok, if so, what do I need? So it looks like to do a fully developed claim I have to start a claim so I have to go back here.

C: If you wanted to learn more about eligibility where would you go?

P: So it's telling me whether or not I'm eligible for compensation...so from now on you could call them conditions - they affect the body and mind. 

C: What do you like and dislike about this page?

P: So I look at this and I go 'I can get a rating from the VA for a disability, but not get compensation...' which I know is true. 

C: So what is confusing?

P: VA disability benefits, that means the monthly payment. However that's not the only thing a VA disability benefit can be. I can get a rating, but not get a monthly payment, but still get other payments. One benefit is healthcare, another is the approval of VA homeloans. I only know that because I have done that a few times, but someone who hasn't might not know.

C: Any other comments about this page?

P: Wondering whether this is referring to active duty (about exposure to chemicals or agents). 

TASK ABOUT BDD INFO

P: If I was looking for BDD I would look for the acronym or the term itself. Maybe I would click disability. If I'm specifically looking for BDD, is there something specific to that process or do I file a claim? So the next thing I'm gonna do is to do a search.

P: Oh! Ok you call it a pre-discharge claim!

C: Yes! So what did you think about how it was to find this, and the fact that we call it pre discharge claim?

P: Well one, I think it's confusing, and if it's its own thing then maybe it should have its own header, or at least info specific to it. And knowing that we keep calling it the BDD program but it's called pre discharge...just pick one (call it one thing).

C: So take a quick glance and tell me what you like/dislike about this page.

P: Tells me I should've planned ahead. there's some stuff about 3 months before. So basically this page is about BDD but this is more than just about BDD. Maybe it should be like, less than 90 days link to the other page. Not have all this stuff not applicable to BDD. I see the TAP, benefits you're entitled to...I think this should be bigger and elsewhere, or everywhere? There should be a link to TAP.


C: OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw? How would you figure out what kind of claim to use? How would this compare with the other version you looked at?

P: Again,pick one. I'm gonna file before I separate, so are we talking about BDD or pre discharge claim. Looks like they're suppose to be the same thing, but they're not.

C: What did you think about this?

P: I think the video is useful - if someone is going to explain the process in a way a non-rate can understand, I think that's great. Otherwise I might ask 'why did you waste 3 minutes of my time?'

C: What other thoughts?

P: Reasons why you may be ineligible...so that kinda explains where that's coming from. So that's a decent thing. I like that. TAP would tell me all about this stuff, right?

C: So TAP encompasses all that then?

P: Yeah, so it's nice because it separates it out to see yeah this isn't part of BDD, but maybe this is part of the block and then all of this down here is not BDD. Like, this is not BDD anymore.

C: Any other comments?

P: No, that's it.


##Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

What are you thinking as you look through this initial page?

Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program?

If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page?

Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).


INFO PAGE

P: If I know I'm filing for a BDD claim, I would look for BDD. I want to push the big green button but I dunno if like, that's the same thing as BDD. If they're the same thing, why do they have different names?

C: Right, so you can just click get started.




INTRO PAGE

P: So it wants me to sign in, but what's this down here? So this is the steps...

C: Do you think the steps are available or useful?

P: I think the steps are...so let's see...so really the filing is really just all step 1 and 2. So when you file, this is filing. After you file, VA will do the review - what does that involve? Ok, well, I submitted evidence, what else would you want? If I sign in does it have to come by mail?

C: What would you like to see?

P: Mail is great, but even if we got an email like, log in to see the status would be great.


SERVICE MEMBER INFO

P: Contact info - did I out this in when I first signed in?

C: Yes.

P: Ok, so I'm wondering why you're showing this to me again?

C: Ah, so you think it's redundant. got it.


MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY



DISABILITIES

P: Do you have any new conditions to add to your claim? Well, this is my first claim, so....

C: So since this is your first claim, this is confusing to you?

P: Yes, exactly.

(when adding claims, he tried to hit add another disability instead of save)

P: My thought is, add another disability shouldn't show up until I have saved this one. 

C: Do you think it autosaves? Or that you'd have to save it?

P: My thought would be if the save button is there and I didn't click it, then it didn't save.


NECK SPRAIN



TINNITUS



ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS


SUMMARY OF BENEFITS

C: Do you think this will work like the previous screens (add another disability)?

P: (add another disability) I feel like they should do the same thing, but why do I have both of them then?


SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

C: Is this useful info for you?

P: Yes, This tells me next steps.

C: Is it useful for you to know what vendors we partner with?

P: Yes.

C: Ok great.

P: Now reading this....you guys don't leave voicemails? No calling back?

C: What do you think about it?

P: Well I mean...if I miss this call, you guys are just gonna do it anyway? Now I have to wait for a letter for an appointment...in this day and age we should be able to call somebody.



REVIEW



SUBMIT

C: Tell me if anything is confusing or unclear.

P: Is there a record number, case number, my SSN or service number associated...?

C: So you would expect a claim number here?

P: Yeah, just some way I can...what are they going to use as the identifier of your claim?

C: So basically it's your SSN. Should that be told here?

P: Yeah, at least let me know about it...people don't like using their social, but...military people are used to it. You're telling me I should receive benefits at discharge via BDD but here basically you're saying that it'll get done when it gets done. 

C: So what would help if you had a time estimate?

P: Yeah, if there was something you could call.

## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: It could be a great program - you apply before and then you get them before discharge. it was hard to find it to start with, how was this process different from the regular process, etc. It has a different name but maybe the VA will do it, maybe they won't.
