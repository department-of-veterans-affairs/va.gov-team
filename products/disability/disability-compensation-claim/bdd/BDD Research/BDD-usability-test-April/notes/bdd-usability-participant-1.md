# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 2 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Christian Valla] and I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*goes through intro*



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)




## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]

Home page --> How to file a claim

P: I would probably go to VA benefits and healthcare and disability, and where it says 'how to file a claim' (clicks on it in dropdown navigation)

C: Great, you can scroll down and look at this page, so tell me what you can do on this page. Take your time and scroll down.

P: Umm...I think it has the tab 'what to file, when to file the claim, the forms that you would need'...the way you can file. And then the process for after you file your claim. Uhhh yep.

C: What do you like/dislike about this page?

P: This screen looks helpful - has helpful information, down the screen. First it says how to start, how to prepare, how do I do it? It's right there, you don't have to search for them. So I think that's good.

C: Is there anything you find confusing or unclear?

P: Right now I don't see anything that's confusing.

C: Can you click on the back button for your browser? Perfect. Imagine that you wanted to read specifically about the program - to get benefits before discharge. Would you still go to where you went before or would you go to other places to find that info?

P: Maybe if there was a FAQ section - page or tab? Or maybe I would search.

C: Ok so go ahead and click on search. And you can just type in BDD. Then click search. And open up the first result that you see there.

C: So take a moment to look at this page and maybe tell me what you can do here, what you like and dislike, etc...

P: I like the fact that the font is bigger! And how it distinguishes the answers in another font style. And it's broken down by how you can use the BDD program, if you have less than 90 days - some things the service members are probably thinking. Can I even use the program? You know, that criteria. Yeah...and the other things that are available [other services]. I don't see anything that's unclear or confusing. I like that it shows what your family is entitled to as well.

C: Ok, good. 

### task 1.5

C: OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw?


P: I think that this screen having a video that you can watch, and it doesn't look like it has much information. The screen doesn't stand out as much as the other screen does. 

C: So if this was a real website, you would be able to click on it and read more.

P: I think having the information already below each tabs, is better - so you don't have to click on it. So your eyes can actually catch onto a word you're looking for. 

C: Would you use the video?

P: I would.

C: would you start with the video or watch after reading?

P: I would probably start with the video.


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

What are you thinking as you look through this initial page?

Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program?

INFO PAGE

C: If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page?

P: I would scroll through it to see what's there...then I would look to see where I file, where to start. What's the first thing I can do? There's a tab to tell me how I file this. I see that it says 'what evidence I'll need for my claim' - I'll read that section. Then it tells me different ways I can file my claim. Also I can get help...and what happens after you file. You can track your claim which I think is awesome.

C: What would you do to file for this program?

P: I would get my records and supporting documents.

C: Imagine you have everthing you need and you are ready to go. What would you do next?

P: I would click on this 'let's get started' tab.

C: Go ahead and do that. And in this case, you are still in active duty.

P: So once I put that date it lets me know that I am eligible. I think that's a good thing, because it tells you here instead of going through all of it and telling you you're not eligible. So telling you right up front, that's a good thing.

C: Exactly. So what would you do next?

P: I would click on 'file benefits.' (clicks on it)

Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).



INTRO PAGE

P: I'm just reading through it, saving time, save your work...

C: Any comments on this page?

P: No, it kinda just gives you a step by step process of how things are going to work.

C: so if that's ok, we can just sign in. And you can just continue.


SERVICE MEMBER INFO

P: It can prefill your info here so you're not doing duplicate work.

C: right, so you can click continue.


CONTACT INFO

C: so what would you do on this page if you could imagine all the info here was correct?

P: I would just click continue.

MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY

C: here we can do 'army' and 'active duty'.

P: Pretty easy to go through.

C: Anything confusing so far?

P: No, not hard to decipher what you're asking.


DISABILITIES

C: And we do have a new claim we want to submit. Mhhmm.

C: Type in the condition and we will say you have a neck sprain.

P: Okay.

C: And then we have a second condition we want to put in. So what would you click here to put another condition in.

P: I would click to add a disability.

C: Would you click save first?

P: Yes, just to be safe.

C: And you can click add new disability. We can add tinnitus here. What would you do here? Click save?

P: Click save.



NECK SPRAIN

C: Here you can just choose the first option.

P: Ok.

C: And you can write down here what exactly happened to you.



TINNITUS

C: And the same thing here.

ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS

C: Here you can say no, that you do not need additional benefits.

SUMMARY OF DISABILITIES

P: It's good that even though you went through those screens, it gives you the option to still add a disability.


SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

C: What's going on here?

P: I think it's just asking for more evidence. And it tells you that if you see a number you don't recognize, it may be regarding your VA claim.

C: Do you think you'd read more about this or not?

P: I would. I think people will miss phone calls they don't recognize.

C: Great, so what would you do next to read more about it?

P: I'd click the plus button.

C: Do you have any comments about this?

P: No, I just think that's good information to have on there. Like I said, if you miss a phone call, it's all right there for you.

C: Ok, so we can continue.


ADD'L INFO

C: What would you do here?

P: Uhh now it's asking you for your account information.

C: So we can imagine that you choose account type and put in this information, You can click anywhere.



REVIEW

C: So this is a review application screen. So just scroll through this page and you can imagine that the info you see here is correct.

P: It seems like it would be better if the information was all laid out for you.

C: So you would like to see all this information already out?

P: I was just saying it's nice that you click on that first tab and they all are opened up for you.

C: Ah, ok got it.

P: I would click the thing here (privacy policy).



SUBMIT

C: Anything unclear here, or anything you like or dislike?

P: Uhhh....it's nice there's a number you can call. Does it have track status on there? Contact, hours, print for your records....that's good.

C: Is that something you would use?

P: Yes.

C: Any other comments?

P: No.



## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: I think this is a good program. I like how the screens are maneuverable. If you don't know how to spell your issue, that it drops down and tells you how to spell it. If I type in the first two letters of a condition, it tells you how to spell it. These claims are very important so you don't want to mess anything up.
