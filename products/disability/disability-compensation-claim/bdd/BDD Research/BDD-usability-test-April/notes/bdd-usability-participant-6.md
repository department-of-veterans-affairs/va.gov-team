# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 2 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)


Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*goes through intro*



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: No I have not, I'm in the process right now, I submitted the paperwork to the VA. I have an admin, liaison, POA to send the information. I'm in the middle of getting ready to retire, so I've given them permission to go through my medical records.


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.

P: The original process of selecting a rep for you, the instructions weren't that clear. They gave a Powerpoint presentation, choosing someone to be your advocate, there was some mix ups in the selections, and someone finally got back to me. There was a week and a half or two weeks during teleworking recently. I understand that, but I would hope that it would be a bit simpler.


C: What were the hardest parts?

P: I've submitted the access to med records, they have it, so now I'm just sitting back and waiting for examination processes, so that's where I'm at right now. 

C: Do you have any other comments about this process?

P: Definitely if there was a sequence or timeline for a starting point or finishing point, like a starting point and finishing point, now that you're in stage 3 for example, ensuring that claims will be submitted to your specialist, etc etc. Maybe your set retirement payment, know when their first disability check will show up. Just those types of things to give you the mile markers with an explanation as to where you're at.

C: Would you like this to be on the website, or via email?

P: Definitely on the website, I think that would be great, maybe not so much email as people might be getting spammed, might disregard, etc.

(participant made comment about how some claims or issues can happen within the 180 - 90 day period, and was wondering how it would work if you needed to add an issue to your claim while it's in process)



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]

P: Umm, looking around here, I would probably click on benefits and healthcare then disability...and then without knowing the process, then click on eligibility. Once there, hopefully get me a link to different benefits and how to apply to them. So hopefully get info on BDD and how to apply. 

C: So let's say that you know you're eligible. Where would you go to file this claim?

P: This section here, makes it seem like you've already got a claim filed. Unless you probably search for BDD. (searches for BDD) and so yeah, pre discharge claim right here. And I would click on that.

C: You can click on it. What do you think is the main purpose of this page?

P: Looking through this, where BDD can't be used, it says there may be special handling, and Im thinking this here is about that special handling. So this goes back to the original link that I clicked on...so it's like the circle of death people sometimes talk about...(laughs)...I have not seen a link that says 'click here to start the process'. You sign in, you create the process, then you get to that starting point on the dashboard.

C: that's valuable feedback. Any other feedback?

P: Maybe the 90 days - back to file a claim...but same for the 90 day page - I clicked it and so it says 180-90 days page when I just said I'm less than 90 days. So why is that info on there? But I guess if you scroll down here you can see less than 90 days which I guess takes you to how to file a claim. Maybe something where it already knows when your date of separation is, so the process is simpler. 

P: We need something to say, yes, you are eligible based on the dates that are in our current system.

**Tasks for BDD usability test 1.5:**

C: OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw? How would you figure out what kind of claim to use? How would this compare with the other version you looked at?

P: And so off the bat - just because I know how webpages work...it says that I've clicked on 4 links to get here...(breadcrumbs)...

C: So you think it's buried too deep?

P: Yeah because how much information is on each page or how much you had to go through to get to here. There's sometimes most frequently used links.

P: so there's a video here...that hopefully talks about eligibility, dates, that kinda thing...this is good because I have less than 90 days, boom, will take you where to go. Or over 180 days as well. Depending on the information that's in this section (accordion) the information is crucial.

C: What do you think about how the information is presented here?

P: It's a lot more clearer. I think within the plus boxes where the next steps are - that's the crucial part.

P: So is this link to start the process?

C: Yeah so what would you expect if you clicked on that?

P: Yes, and I think maybe call this out more..,maybe something like 'you can start your BDD here'. 






## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

What are you thinking as you look through this initial page?

Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program?

If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page?

Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).


INFO PAGE




INTRO PAGE

P: Start a new application...so intent to file...so what happens if I click continue? Does it remove my old claim? Overwriting the previous claim? 

C: Ah , ok gotcha. So you were wanting to know what it actually does?

P: Right.


SERVICE MEMBER INFO

P: So, once again, it's telling me in order to update profile information, I need to call VA, but I can update my profile info right here (contact info screen), so that's kinda confusing...

C: Is there any information on this page that can alleviate that confusion?

P: Well, I would say that this would update the profile information. I would think making it to where this updates your profile would be the friendliest as opposed to going somewhere else to add that information. 

(participant expressed the desire to update profile on the actual application)


MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY

 
NEW CONDITIONS

P: With this, where would I be in the claim process? Do I have any new conditions to add?

C: What would a better description be?

P: I would ask 'why this question in here'? I've updated my address, time in service, etc. New conditions, sometimes people have been in the service for 20 years, etc. so having this question so early I don't know what I would put.

C: So if this is a new user, first time they are adding a claim to the VA, does that make it more logical to ask that question in this way?

P: Definitely wrong way - because if this is me starting this process, and started from square one, just clicking to see that I do meet the requirements for BDD, and then the next questions ask me about new conditions, so I dunno what I need to add based on what they have already.



DISABILITIES

P: So once again, when I gave the liaison the POA, they were able to pull my medical records, they were able to say 'ok, here are the things in your record that you can claim'. This would be the perfect thing to add to the list when you have those items. If a service member was in for, you know, 25 years, then that would be a process to add all the conditions.


NECK SPRAIN



TINNITUS

LIST OF CONDITIONS

P: If I list 10 things here and then I hit submit, and then a week from today I go 'man! I forgot about X,Y and Z!' so what do I do then? Can I get back here or do I have to file a whole new claim?

C: So what would you like to see here?

P: So if you could just add to the claim instead of filing a brand new one.



ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS




SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

P: The next page says it's gonna pull your records, then I've just wasted time to type in that I have foot pain.

BANK ACCOUNT INFO

P:

REVIEW



SUBMIT




## Potential Followup questions

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: So this submission process was very easy to go through - the pros are that it's very user friendly, so that you know what to put into the boxes and is a clean UI. The cons would be how this seemed very final. Ok, I'm done. I've given new address and bank account info...so what if I have something new? So I've typed in my 10 different things, bank account, and then finalized. Feels very finalized. Placement of the new conditions question and then where you put that you're pulling your medical conditions.
