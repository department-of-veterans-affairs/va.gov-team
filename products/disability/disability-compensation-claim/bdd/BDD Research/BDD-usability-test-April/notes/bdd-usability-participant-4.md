# Conversation Guide for Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 2 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)


*goes through intro*



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.


C: What were the hardest parts?


C: What was most confusing within this process?


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?


C: Do you have any other comments about this process?



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]

P: So I would first expect to see 'here's one thing to go do, another thing to do, etc' so I would just start scrolling...and I would look around here for filing my claim.

(user goes to the dropdown navigation --> disability --> how to file a claim)

P: I would expect the purpose of the page is to walk me through how to file a claim. I would want to know what forms I would need for this claim...then down here, it's a 'let's get started' section.

C: What would you expect if you clicked on that?

P: I would expect it to have information like SSN, name, stuff like that. Then I would expect it would have something on there like if I had a heart condition or heart issue, for example.

P: I like that it's giving me different options to do, I like that it tells me what is going to happen afterwards, etc...I guess I don't even know what ITF is...but maybe those who are filing already know...so I think I like all that.

**BDD wayfinding task:**

P: I would think that BDD might be under disability...so when I come here, I don't find anything related to BDD. Maybe I would go to service member...so I think I would just go to search and would search for 'BDD'.

C: So you can do that...and then go to the first search result. Tell me what you think the purpose of this page is.

P: So I guess everyone knows what BDD is. I guess I would expect to see BDD up at the top. And then...yeah, it looks like you're defining that. I am getting that, but...

C: So you would expect it would say BDD or 'benefits delivery at discharge' instead of pre discharge claim?

P: So yeah, I would hope it would say 'benefits delivery at discharge.'

P: It looks like this is just reading about it, down the page...my first impression is that it's user friendly, not everything is bolder, in smaller fonts. I think it sections off the areas well, to me. I would expect blue means I can click on it and black (text) is just text...it might make it a bit easier if I could just expand this stuff out. I think it might make this more user friendly for me. The more I can minimize, the better it is for me.


C: OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw? How would you figure out what kind of claim to use? How would this compare with the other version you looked at?

P: Looking at the site, I do like that this is big - and that's what it's gonna talk about. As I come down...yeah, so...I like these expansions. I feel like things are smaller, I feel like this is more concise. Less scrolling than before. And then this seems more compact. 

C: Which version would you prefer?

P: Previous page....looking at both of these, but the style of the other one was bigger. 


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

C: Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).

P: I think having a cell phone is great but not everyone has a cell phone or older individuals perhaps might not find that so simple.


INFO PAGE


INTRO PAGE


SERVICE MEMBER INFO




MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY

P: There's a long list here! Was surprised to see that.

(participant states they would like to see sub-steps in the progress bar)



DISABILITIES



NECK SPRAIN



TINNITUS



ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS




SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

P: I would like an option, like if I had a scan of my leg or something, I could upload it.

P: I'm not sure what some of these are (QTC medical services), so I'm not sure it needs to be there without an expansion (accordion) beause I don't think everyone needs to know that, but...yeah. I like that I can start the form and stop it and pick it up later.

BANK ACCOUNT




REVIEW

P: I really like that at the end I can review everything and make sure it's right.

C: So you're fine with it being collapsed?

P: Yeah I guess I prefer that, as it makes a more concise page. 

SUBMIT

P: My first impression that it's laid out well..I wish I had some claim number to reference. Great, I can go back and print it...I would like to see 'what happens next..' am I gonna get a call, or get something in the mail? Will it allow me to do that exact same thing? So I can track status, so I like that. To me, track status might be up higher. All this stuff is important, but to have everything on one page with an expansion (accordion) would be nice.


## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: Overall I think it's good. When you were saying something about BDD, I wasn't expecting that we'd have a BDD button on there. I think it's good - how you've set up fonts, to catch my eye on everything. On the submission page I feel like there's a ton of wasted space on the right here. 


C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: I do feel like it's good but...maybe I'm wondering if, hovering over stuff brings something up. 

C: So a better explanation of what something is?

P: Yeah, but maybe the expansion you have is better than that.



*Christian goes through thank you and closing*
