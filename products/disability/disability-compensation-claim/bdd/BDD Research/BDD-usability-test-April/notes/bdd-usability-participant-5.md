DATE/TIME OF INTERVIEW: [5/21/20] at [11] AM EST

# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 2 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*goes through intro*



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: No.


## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]

P: Ok, I would first go down to this disability section...don't have a claim, don't have payment history...I would assume it would be file a claim for compensation. Or I might try the search function or try the link down here. 

C: So if you had to use the search function, what would you type into the search?

P: I would search for 'benefits at separation'.

C: Mhmm. So you can type BDD into the search. And you can click on the first link you see.

C: So tell me about this page you see. What you think it's about, and what you like and dislike about it.

P: Gonna take a second to read it. So maybe not necessarily this page, but I'd be interested to know why you can only file between 180-90 days before separating from the military. I don't understand why that would be.

C: So where do you expect to find that info?

P: Maybe a link to explain why it is that way. I see it explains that you have to have 90 days left on active duty. So my assumption is that - and I don't know much about the disability program - but my assumption is that I can file for the regular process within 90 days of separation.

C: Yes, that would be correct.

P: I would be...a little confused where it says 'I can't use this program if I have the following' - I would definitely need more info on that. 

C: So you would want to have more info on the reasons behind that. 

P: Right, or if I were pregnant. Essentially any of these cases.

P: Can I click on here?

C: Sure! You can click on anything you want.

P: Right, so overseas. This is good. As well as if I was stateside. And an assistance number if I needed to speak with someone on how to do this. Ok, so this answers my questions for less than 90 days. 

C: So this is the end of the page. What do you think about this page?

P: I think the purpose of the page is to point me in the right direction initially. I definitely think it's a useful tool. I think it could get me pointed in the right direction, yeah.

C: Is there anything that's unclear?

P: I might be confused as to why this TAP program is not part of the other benefits you can apply for. I just don't know. 

C: Any other questions before we move on?

P: No sir.


C: OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw? How would you figure out what kind of claim to use? How would this compare with the other version you looked at?

P: First off I would say not having watched this video here, but having a video here may be a good tool to explain the process and may clarify some questions I had on the previous page. I see that's essentially showing the same information. I would say that it's cleaner - it actually seems to sort out the questions I had. I had a special circumstance so I would click here. So I think all those questions I had went away on this new page.

C: And you still think that TAP should be under other benefits?

P: Yes, I'd say so.

P: Maybe having it under one section would be more useful. 

C: So it sounds like you like this page better than the previous one?

P: Yes sir.

C: Any other comments?

P: It seems to be less wordy than the other one, which is more helpful in pointing people in the right direction. I'd say it's significantly better and more straightforward.

C: Got it.

Depending on where the user ends up - guide them to the other page: pre-discharge claim: Take a look at this page. What are your first impressions and thoughts about this page? What would you do on this page? Is anything confusing on this page? how to file a disability claim: Take a look at this page. What are your first impressions and thoughts about this page? What would you do on this page? Do you have all the info you need to file a pre-discharge claim on this page? If no, what is missing? What would make you confident that you could file such a claim on this page? Is anything confusing on this page? Imagine you want to figure out what claims you are allowed to apply for and not. Where would you go from here?

P: This file a claim online option would have a separate path to file a different claim.

C: So when you see the green button to 'file a claim' what would you expect to see if you clicked on it?

P: I would expect to start to put my information in.

C: It seems like you were unsure about this is where you would start. Can you talk more about it?

P: I was thinking maybe it would just be that one method of filing. Maybe if there was a second button that says you're filing for X, and why...

C: Ah, ok, got it got it.


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

What are you thinking as you look through this initial page?

Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program?

If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page?

C: Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).

P: I would probably click on the 'what is intent to file?' if I was unsure. I personally don't understand what an intent to file is. But I would click continue.

SERVICE MEMBER INFO

P: So assuming my information popped up here, I would just confirm it was alright, and hit continue.

P: I'm confirming my contact info here, and if it was inaccurate, I would hit the edit button.

C: If you updated the info here, would you expect it would update in your profile information?

P: I would not. I would expect this filing would be two separate things.


MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY



DISABILITIES

C: What if you could not describe your condition properly?

P: I would be a bit confused at first, I'm sure there would be a condition name for missing an ear, but...I would click on this (what if I don't know name of my condition).

NECK SPRAIN



TINNITUS



ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS

P: So assuming I would need additional assistance, I would select 'yes' here.


SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

P: I do see this option to finish application later, so I might take that option.

C: Ok, so you like that option?

P: Yes.

P: Ok, so this is where I might put in supporting documents, which I may not have available. I might have a private medical record as well...

P: Ok, so right now I'm authorizing release from this particular medical clinic, it appears?

C: Yes. So what's going on here?

P: Essentially it's advising me that the VA is going to look into this particular issue and to be on the lookout for a call. A list of potential vendors they work with.

C: Is that helpful for you?

P: Yes! And my wife is like this in particular, but...she doesn't answer numbers she doesnt' recognize. So this is good. And what happens if I miss a call.

P: I would be curious why there's not an email option. you know, this whole appointment (the one we're currently doing) was set up via email so I don't know why we couldn't do this similarly. Though maybe there's a HIPAA concern there.

P: Ok, just amplifying what would happen in that particular situation. More information.

C: Okay.

BANK ACCOUNT

P: So I'm a bit more curious about this bank information...I would say that my one ear would perk up (laughs).

C: What would make you feel more comfortable?

P: Maybe just something about the security, how the data will not be misused...veterans tend to be more wary.

C: But you'd like a note about security level and what it would be used for?

P: Exactly.

*On the bank details save button*

C: Would you hit save or continue here?

P: I would hit save just to make sure. 

C: Would you expect that if you hit 'continue', that it would still work?

P: Umm..I think there would have to be some back tracking and the info may not be properly added.



REVIEW

P: I would review my info, make sure it was all correct.

C: What do you think of the accordions being clickable to show all info?

P: I wouldn't be certain that most people know how to use those...That would be my only concern here.

C: Got it. Any other comments?

P: There could be something that says 'click the plus symbol to expand'. Or maybe just an expand link. Then I would just logically click the checkbox. I assume if I didn't, an alert would pop up that says you need to check the box to approve. 


SUBMIT

P: It looks pretty clear...I'd look at the form number, confirm my info was right, then print it out. I might also be interested in an option to save for my records. Like save for PDF. 

P: so it says here 'how long does it take the VA to make a decision on my claim?' that's a very vague thing, and I think that's intentional...but it would be helpful if it gave you a general idea....30 days, 90 days....I have heard stories about people complaining about how long it takes. I'm not sure if there could be a time estimate here.

C: So you'd like a ballpark estimate as to how long it might take?

P: Yes.

C: Any other comments?

P: Do you receive an email that it's been submitted?

C: would you expect that to happen?

P: It seems to happen with everything else. So maybe an email with a reference number? I see that there's a place where I can track my claim...I would go there, click it, and take me to a page where I enter my claim number or a page in my profile where it shows claims in progress.

C: so there is no claim number here...it would be followed via a SSN. What are your thoughts on that?

P: Well I think anyone is wary entering their SSN or putting it online. With regards to this page I would be a bit confused. I would expect that 'track your claim' would do that. Maybe there could be an update where track status of your claim could give you an alert, maybe an email alert, that your claim has been moved or processing.

## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: I think it's pretty straightforward. And it would help probably if I had watched that video from earlier.

C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: I think it would be the email notifications. If that's an option.
