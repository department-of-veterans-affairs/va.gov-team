# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 2 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*goes through intro*

C: Branch of Service?

P: Active duty Army.

## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: Yes, I filed a claim last year, started July 2019 ultimately withdrawed as I decided to stay active duty. So therefore I was not awarded a rating.

C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?

P: VSO helped me with the claim. So from that perspective it was easy and straghtforward. But where it got complicated whas submission of medical files from my records, but the VA made me substantiate my claim via exams. The VA does not have direct access to my medical records. I thought the VA had carte blanche to get my medical records but they don't!

C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?

P: So I did my own self study and research and reviewing the BDD process, and also, having submitted a claim, got weekly or monthly emails from the VA pointing me to particular resources.




## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

C: Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]

P: So I would go to VA benefits and click on the dropdown and I know I'm doing a disability claim. ALternatively if I had no idea I would go to the search box and type in BDD. But yeah, I think it's pretty easy so I would go to how to file a claim and it would take me to one of the pages we're going to look at.

C: So if you go to search, type in BDD and click on the first link. Take a look at this page and tell me what you can do on this page.

P: I'm gonna review it, one second....so there's a lot of good info on here, starts up here with "what is the BDD program?" as not everyone knows what this is initially...when you are going through this, it's a TAP program, where it helps you do job hunting, claims stuff...part of that program, the VA portion, they do talk about the BDD program. I might glance over it at first, but I might check it out anyway. I think it's pretty cut and clear and dry. I do like that it tells you when you cannot use the BDD program...in terms of organization, perhaps maybe moving this section up first (participant hovers over eligibility item(s)). Just from a flow perspective.

C: Makes sense.

P: Going down, ok...how do I file...ok. This is good here. And in addition to BDD, the other stuff - education and housing and VRE programs.

(participant denotes that they do like the accordions to consolidate information)

**Task 1.5:**

C: OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw? How would you figure out what kind of claim to use? How would this compare with the other version you looked at?

P: These (videos) are always very helpful. It's published, it's written, but this is good for visual learners. This might make people more successful. I hope the video helps the Vet know that they are integral in getting the stuff to the VA. So this is good, uhhh, this info wasn't on the other page...(accordions)...delays of necessary information is not really intuitive to me. Perhaps renaming it might help.

P: I think side by side, including the instructional video is good and I like the special situations...

C: Do you have a preference?

P: If I had to choose, I would choose the first one, but I would improve it maybe.

C: Can you talk about why you'd choose the first one?

P: I don't feel like this page is adding anything that the first page already has and is displaying. Beyond these two key differences - the video and special circumstances - I think the previous page is fine. The two pages are very similar otherwise.


FILE A DISABILITY CLAIM - VA GOV

P: I do like this page...I think it gives a lot of information. You could probably merge the 'can I file my claim online?" and maybe move it up instead of having it in its own section here. And yeah, what happens...I like this, this was helpfiul to me...there's also a phone number attached to this. 

C: Was there anything missing in the tracking of status?

P: When I would log in, it would give you a broad narrative of what's going on, something like 'packet received' and it takes about 80+ days for this to be processed. It might be helpful if I got an email notification when anything changes, otherwise it was incumbent upon me to check. But yeah...intent to file stuff...yeah. Here again, intent to file, maybe that's a service-specific thing, VA benefit counselors talk to SMs about, but what about intent to file, what does it mean? Or why that's important, really. Basically it's just a placeholder. I will file a claim but haven't gotten around to it yet. I think this takes you to a list of VSOs in your area. 



## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

What are you thinking as you look through this initial page?

Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program?

If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page?

Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).


INFO PAGE




INTRO PAGE


SERVICE MEMBER INFO


MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY



DISABILITIES

P: I like that the issues show up here (in the dropdown).

WHAT CAUSED SERVICE CONNECTED DISABILITY

P: I think this is good. It gives the SM the ability to give more information. And the ability to explain is helpful because one way that it's suggested to potentially get a higher rating is to send in a personal letter or note. This allows the vet or SM to communicate that and gives the reviewer the opportunity to udnerstand how it affects the Vets' everyday lives.

NECK SPRAIN



TINNITUS



ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS




SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

*(we'll get your medical records from: -screen)*

P: this is helpful to me because I didn't think the VA needed me to help them get these records, because I thought they already had access to it. 

P: What if I miss the call? This is good information - the VA scheduled my appointments and I had the opp to call back and reschedule if that didn't work for me. If the VA can schedule the appt, that can make it easier on the vet. One thing I remember is that the VA offered - in the case of reserves or National Guard - they can reimburse for mileage. So maybe a tab that says something like 'what about if I'm scheduled with an examiner 50+ miles away?' or something like that.

REVIEW



SUBMIT

P: I think this is good. You could add something like 'average turnaround time is so many days' just so people know that. How do I check the status of my claim, is helpful...maybe to move this up the page (now what?) so that I know what to expect next. Just from a flow perspective. And maybe you can merge these two. 


## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: For me, it's intuitive, could be because I've done this process before. But I can't imagine someone who is new would have a difficult time here, especially in regards to a BDD claim. The search box makes it pretty darn easy for me to get where I need to go. The VA does a good job of providing 800 numbers as well. I think from a content perspective, it may make things easier to bold some things up as I had mentioned before. Less content but maybe more hyperlinks to where I need to go. 


C: If you had a magic wand and could change one thing about this process, what would it be?

P: During that claims submission, an opportunity to authorize the VA to get medical records from VA medical facilities, but also authorize the VA to get medical files from my service, from any private medical provider I've seen. A whole section where I can authorize the VA to get medical files on my behalf so I don't have to gather, collect and scan files to provide to the VA myself.
