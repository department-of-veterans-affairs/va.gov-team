Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*goes through intro*



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)

C: Have you ever filed a BDD disability claim with the Department of Veteran Affairs?

P: There was a part of a program where you could establish a claim before separating.

C: Did you just hear about it?

P: I had heard about it as a company commander, yeah.


C: How did you file it (alone or with a VSO)? Mail or in an office?


C: Tell me about how it was to go through this process.


C: What were the hardest parts?


C: What was most confusing within this process?


C: Was there anything in particular that was helpful in this process?


C: If you would do it again, would you do anything different?


C: Do you have any other comments about this process?



##Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


##Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]

P: I would go right to the search box, instead of trying to find it anywhere else. Here it doesn't tell me in the disability block at least I can click on what was available to me. Can you repeat what you're having me look for though?

C: Yeah I'm not going to give the exact name of the program but basically it's a way to apply for benefits before separation.

P: I might looks at FAQs...(goes to service member benefits).

C: (after a time of participant searching) So let's say you heard about it - benefits delivery at discharge - where would you go to find that?

P: First time I'm hearing of that. Can you repeat exactly what that is?

C: Ok, so this is the page I was referring to. It tells you specifically aout the BDD program. What was the experience?

P: To be compeltely candid, I would never want to do that again for the rest of my life (searching for this page). This is a program that the VA is trying to get out, so I would like to see an icon on the homepage 'pre discharge eligibility and benefits' and smack you right in the right face. 

C: So take a look at this page and let me know what your first impression is about this page?

P: So if you want to go through the details here, it looks like a one stop shop to let you know if you're eligible...this is importantt to say, like, 'hey you cannot use BDD if 90 days of service left or less' but it would be nice to know exactly what that means. Is it the DD214?

P: Stuff like what benefits can I get? I should be able to get that and know a little more. I do like this - gives me a sequence of events. I like that it tells you about other programs. I do like this other benefits on here, I have to scroll down for the 'so what'? So what I'm getting on this page is that there's not a lot of required reading but at the same time it can be info overload on this page. I'm not sure how to better do it but you see here at the top of the page to let you know how we got here, but there shouldn't be anything here stopping you from going to find this information. That's how I like to see stuff.

C: Let me ask you about this accordion. The three boxes you can open - you said you liked them. can you say a bit more about that?

P: I like this because it gives you an exact plan. 180 days on, I can come back here and hyperlink it, it gives me a sequence of events I can theoretically achieve prior to discharge.



**Tasks for BDD usability test 1.5:**

What are your thoughts on this page you’ve landed on? (first impressions / quick thoughts)

OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw? How would you figure out what kind of claim to use? How would this compare with the other version you looked at?

P: We have the bottom line up front, here's a video that breaks everything down for you, I gotta be honest with you - I would prefer to be 'am I eligible' and then 'how do I do it'. first thing I'm going to ask myself is whether or not I qualify. I'd like the eligibility factors (down the page). No matter what, we want to see what has to happen first, 180 days should happen before 90 days. Chronological order of what I have to achieve. If you have sub-bullets, maybe put them here.

(user continues explaining how he would like to see eligibility higher, and tabbed information may be easier to understand)


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

What are you thinking as you look through this initial page?

Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program?

If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page?

Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).


INFO PAGE

P: I would go straight to start your application. 

C: Ok great. you can click on that and log in.

INTRO PAGE


SERVICE MEMBER INFO

BASIC INFO

P: So this is me is what you're saying?

C: Yes, assume this is the right info.



CONTACT INFO


MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY



DISABILITIES



NECK SPRAIN



TINNITUS



ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS

P: This page should not have this statement here whatsoever (explaining additional benefits and what they are). It would say at the end 'based on what you filled on this form, you can get this'. Tell me I can do the form, and I can take the form.

C: So you would want it to pre choose the right answer?

P: Well yeah but also to fill in stuff that I've already filled in. pre-populated.

C: Ah, yes. gotcha.




SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

P: Ok so, great example. Eye injury...I have military medical records...I would click 'supporting documents'.

C: Got it. so in this case, I want to click on VA medical records.

P: I'd like to see if the third party is one group, and if they had a certain area code, it would be nice if it listed the area codes where it would come from. What are their area codes?

P: Why don't you leave me a number an extension to call back? I don't want to get a letter - I don't have time for you to tell me when to show up. 

C: Would you like to have voice call leave a number? Or have it listed here?

P: I would like to have both, honestly! These two dropdowns are telling me there's gonna be a lot of friction. Two things: 'am I gonna be available', and 'will there be a voicemail'?


BANK ACCOUNT



REVIEW

P: Army Transportation command - they have a great process. Everything I put in it literally on the form. If that was in there, I would say cool, I agree. And then I would click submit?



SUBMIT


P: How many days, I would love to know that. Is it required to bring my records to my exam. And honestly I think this is implied. But even afterwards, the word records, let me know if I need to bring it to my exam. And this, go figure, the VA is going to tell me this - which is basically 'it depends'. We HATE this in the military. I didn't see anything in there that says 'if you don't hear in a certain amount of time, then call this number'. 

P: Oh look it's all the way here at the bottom, how to check the claim of the status.

C: So what would you expect to see if you clicked on the status?

P: It's been reviewed, it's been approved, I just want to see the status - like a Domino's delivery or Papa John's delivery tracker.

## Potential Followup questions

If there is time and moderator feels like he needs more information about the pages the user went through, he may ask them to go back and answer one or more of the probing questions below.

Before clicking on anything, explore this page and let me know what you think the main purpose of this page is.
Do you think this page accomplishes this purpose?
What is most confusing or unclear on this page?
What is most helpful on this page?
What could be added to this page to make it more useful or clear?


## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?


P: overall I did not like how hard it was to get to this process. I guess my first frustration would be how I didn't know about that. Even as a Company Commander I did not know that. On the VA's main page, I'm actually going to go back to this - healthcare, great icon, disability, great icon....I'd like to see a complete list of types of benefits. Of course BDD should be included in that conglomerate. That is all the benefits that are available to us as Service Members who are about to file. Hey, I could file for disability, but what kind of file are we talking about?
