# Conversation Guide for Benefit Delivery at Discharge (BDD): Usability test 2 of 2

## Intro - (5 minutes)

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*goes through intro*



## Short Interview BDD experience (if applicable) - (0-10 minutes)



## Computer Setup: Share your screen with Zoom - (2 - 5 minutes)


## Task 1 (4-5 minutes)
**You have heard of a program that allows members in active duty to apply to get benefits from the VA for a specific disability, prior to separation. The advantage of doing this is that you would receive payments sooner after separating from service. Someone told you that you could apply to this program on VA.gov.**

Please go to VA.gov, and show me what you would do to find this program and apply for it. [they do the task]

P: Just so I understand correctly, I'm active duty, still serving, and I'm trying to see how I can apply. Ok, so I can see this here where it says 'health care' and maybe click on that.

C: You can go ahead and click on it.

P: Actually you know what? I'd click on service member benefits here.

C: So try to find specific info about the program that I mentioned. 

P: Ok...VA benefits you can use during or after service...can you tell me again what the program is in your own words?

C: (explains BDD without saying BDD)

P: Ok well this says you can do it...pre-discharge disability claim...they all sound like benefits to me. It's all a claim.

C: So which would you click on for disability?

P: pre-discharge disability claim.

C: Yes, so go ahead and click on that. So tell me what the purpose of this page is, and what is clear or unclear?

P: The purpose of the page is informing folks how they can apply for disability benefits for things occurring during service. Has some FAQs here...what if I have less than 90 days...tells you why you wouldn't be able to...but it looks like it gives you information for this service.

C: What do you like about this?

P: I like that it has different tiers - different font styles. Allows me to grasp all the important points without having to read a whole lot. Dropdown menus, that's nice. I like how it says, kinda unrelated, but other things you can take advantage of. I don't really know what I would say about 'don't like.'


**Tasks for BDD usability test 1.5**
What are your thoughts on this page you’ve landed on? (first impressions / quick thoughts)

OK, now I’m going to show you another version of this page, what do you think of this and how it compares to the page you just saw? How would you figure out what kind of claim to use? How would this compare with the other version you looked at?

P: So I like videos, but without being able to see it...(not sure what info it contains). I like the space here...the blue box seemed cramped as opposed to this section here. The font changes are nice and the blue fonts here...I think I like the gray box on the first page when it comes to saying 'here's a snippet of unrelated stuff'. And I feel like the gray box was an attention grabber. 


## Task 2

OK, let’s move on. I’m going to send you a link to a prototype [send link]

Imagine that you’ve found the program on VA.gov and the correct form now, and you want to file a claim for a neck sprain issue and Tinnitus (ringing in the ear) that you have.

How would you go about doing this? Please show me what you would do in order to get through this process. (Not all options are clickable in this prototype, but I will guide you through when necessary.)

What are you thinking as you look through this initial page?

Can you tell if you’re eligible for this program?

If you were eligible, what would you do first on this page?

Please go ahead and answer the following questions, and take your time on each page. Please comment on anything you see, and feel free to ask questions at any time. (Remember to talk out loud, so I can understand what you are thinking).


INFO PAGE

P: So I would be at the right page, gonna read over this stuff, okay this applies to me...ok, signing in. I would look over what the steps are. 

C: Are these steps useful, or not?

P: yeah I like steps, I like details, so having that much detail in a step by step process is good to me. Alright cool, so we're at the apply stage, so I'm gonna click 'sign in to start my application'.


INTRO PAGE

BASIC INFO

CONTACT INFO

P: Looks like this info is right...this stuff makes sense to me so far, a lot of heealthcare asks you to update your info.


SERVICE MEMBER INFO




MILITARY SERVICE HISTORY

(participant seems confused about 'military service history we have on file for you')

C: * Christian asks about the sentence *

P: that definitely kinda threw me off in the beginning, made me question what I was doing right then. BEcause it says this is what we already have.

DISABILITIES

P: That's helpful.

C: What is helpful here?

P: Like, if you're not sure exactly what it is, you can start writing it down and it gives you suggestions about what it is. That's cool.

C: Click on that dropdown link (what if I don't know name of condition). Does that make sense to you?

P: No, that's really cool. I am a bit confused though but maybe if you were putting in multiple symptoms.

(chooses back sprain)

C: Let's imagine you had two conditions you had to add.

P: I'd click 'save' on this one and then click 'add a new disability'. 

C: Alright.



NECK SPRAIN

P: What caused this service connected disability? I like that it's a link that defines 'service connected.'

P: (in 'what caused this service-connected disability?' screen) I also like the four separate, and clearly different, examples of what happened. 



TINNITUS



ADD'L DISABILITY BENEFITS

P: I think the examples here are really good, but I think it would be great to have a link that says ' if you want to see the entirety of the list, click here' or something.

C: Ok, go ahead and click yes. Let's see if this is what you expected.

P: uhm...I would say that this is telling you one of the additional disability benefits. And then you could see others if you continued.

C: Ok, you can say no to this.

P: ok...so the intricacies involved in this - just the idea of every day activities, that's up for interpretation. Are you confined to your home is pretty straightforward, but something like need help with everyday activities might be missing out on some help.

INDIVID. UNEMP.

P: "does your disability prevent you from.." not sure I understand this sentence. For example, 'if you didn't have your back injury, you could do your job' you know what I mean?

LIST OF DISABILITIES

P: I like the link to go back instead of clicking all the way back.




SUPPORTING EVIDENCE

P: I like how this is bold (only need to submit evidence that VA doesn't already have).

P: So...I'm not sure if this is to point back to older evidence or if I'm just doing new evidence. I like this! (dropdown for which evidence type should I choose). I get the difference between these but some don't know.

CLAIM EXAM

P: If you miss the phone call, are you able to automatically reschedule it?

C: So what would you like to be possible in this scenario?

P: If you're able to call and reschedule, this would sound kinda more polite maybe. You could call and reschuedle your exam time. it does sound kinda blunt, almost to a fault...it would make sense that someone would schedule it to hold your place or something, but reading it that way does sound like a punishment.

C: So how would you rephrase it?

P: that's tough..either way it's gonna be stabby. Maybe something like 'to hold your place in line'...like something that says 'we're really trying to look out for you here'. Additionally, are they able to have that appointment rescheduled?

C: What would you like to see?

P: Yeah I think having that option would be appreciated by everyone.

C: How would you liuke that to happen? Voicemail? Email?

P: umm...I know very few people who would want to communicate via email for that. Most people would prefer to call a number and talk to an individual. 

C: Do you expect to see a number to call on the page? 

P: Uhm....yeah. I would say putting the number in one of these boxes here. 

BANK ACCOUNT





REVIEW



SUBMIT

P: Great that it lets you tell its submitted, everything is good...status of your claim. No, this looks kinda as I would expect.

## Post-Task Interview

C: Overall what do you think about going through this process?

P: This was way easier than I ever imagined. I don't think I've ever heard of anyone reference doing this online. Yeah this was pretty quick, really. I thought it was going to be a crazy long process. 

C: Any other comments about this process?

P: no, I mean all the details and examples are appreciated.
