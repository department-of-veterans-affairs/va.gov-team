# DIC Placement Within IA

**Aug 21 Recap - Meeting with Angie Smith**

Background: DIC was initially launched within the Burials and Memorials hub on vets.gov, and was migrated to va.gov with the same placement.  A stakeholder within VBA has requested a review of our current placement for the DIC page since it is not an NCA/burial benefit.  The team would like to evaluate where this content best fits - Disability, Pension or Family hub.
Discovery issue - [GH Issue 556#](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/556)

## Current state
Current page location: https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/dependency-indemnity-compensation/
Prominent links/crosslinks:
- **Disability:** Top nav, hub page, left nav
- **Pension:** none
- **Burials:** Top nav, hub page, left nav

## Information from stakeholders
- Survivor's Pension and DIC utilize the same application - applicants don’t need to separately apply for survivors pension and DIC; VA makes the determination which one they get based on which one would give the family member the most $.
- Survivors cannot get both pension and DIC –they are mutually exclusive.
- VA essentially treats a death in the line of duty the same as a veteran service connected disability – therefore making the survivor eligible for DIC.
- DIC really is strongly associated with disability benefits, Survivors' Pension is associated with income.

## Decisions and Recommedations

- Based on analytics and discussions with SMEs, it was determined that DIC strongly associated with disability benefits. We will move DIC in the IA from burials to disability. 
- DIC is already cross-linked in several places inside Disability hub, but we will add it to the left nav as well. 
- We will crosslink DIC and Survivors Pension within those pages.
- Links to DIC from within Burials area will remain.
