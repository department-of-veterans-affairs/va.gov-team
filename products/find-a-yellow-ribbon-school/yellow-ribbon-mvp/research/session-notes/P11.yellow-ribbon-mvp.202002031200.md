# Yellow Ribbon School Finder Conversation Guide for Moderated Research

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about Yellow Ribbon education benefits, and how you, as someone eligible to receive them, understand your benefits and go about using them.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 40 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. The more you can think out loud and share what you're thinking as you go through the session, the better.

- You'll be interacting with an interactive prototype. This is means it may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

- - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

For participants who are in the process of researching their education benefits:

- I understand you're considering going to school, and using your VA education benefits. That's great! Where are you in that process?

I am interested in going back to school full time to get my masters. I still have my GI Bill and have not used Yellow Ribbon – I just heard about it from other veterans.

- Do you know what you want to study?

I want to get my master’s in education. I have a bachelors in math.

- I'd love to hear about your research and decision process so far.

I’ve gone online and looked at the GI Bill comparison tool because there is a specific school that I want to go to. I wanted to use the tool for housing stipends to know what I can afford.

What stage of your military service were you in when you decided to go to school?



How many schools are you planning on applying to?



What factors make you want to apply to a specific school?

I wanted to attend a Christian university but did not want to do it online. That slimmed down my choices drastically. 

How have you done your research on schools so far?

A lot of Google searches. Also word of mouth.

How about research on education benefits available to you?

Have you encountered anything that made it harder, or easier, to do this research?

The comparison tool is very easy to use, and they did a good job revamping it.

Are you familiar with the Yellow Ribbon benefit? Tell me how it works.

I did a search the other day that made Yellow Ribbon look like a kicker to fill the gaps that the GI Bill doesn’t cover. It seems like people who get 100% of the GI Bill may not need it.

How does it fit into your decision-making process?

I have my heart set on the one school – but realistically the biggest factor is the housing stipend. If I couldn’t afford proper housing, then I’d be prompted to go somewhere else.



Can you describe the environment you’d typically be in for this kind of research?

I’d be at home, in my room – on my MacBook

For all participants:

- How did you first learn what VA education benefits were available to you, and how Yellow Ribbon fit into those benefits?

It was a selling point when I enlisted.

- Were there any parts of the process that were particularly confusing? If so, how did you get clarification?



- Imagine I don't know anything about VA benefits. Can you tell me how the Yellow Ribbon program works?



We're almost ready to move to the prototype now, and I'll ask you to do a few tasks related to finding schools and understanding Yellow Ribbon benefits. Before we jump in, can you tell me where you would typically conduct this type of research?

## First Task: Find relevant schools in legacy Yellow Ribbon tables - 5 minutes

*Finding Yellow Ribbon information from va.gov*

I’d look around and I see an education section. I don’t see anything that specifically says Yellow Ribbon. I’ll try the dropdown for benefits and healthcare, but I see “about GI Bill benefits” so I’d click on that. I’m looking for Yellow Ribbon to pop-out. *found it pretty easily – maybe 10 seconds*

- Start on Yellow Ribbon benefit hub page.

- Find a school they're interested in, and tell me the Yellow Ribbon benefit information for that school

- - If participant is interested in a state with a very small number of rows, once they have completed the task, ask them to react to a state like California with numerous rows.

Things to watch for:

- How does the participant understand and navigate the accordion pattern?



- How does the participant navigate the table on the state page? (Ctrl+f, manual scroll, etc)



- What emotions/thoughts does the participant verbalize while looking at a table presentation of this data?



## Second Task: Conduct a search in prototype - 5 minutes

- Go to the other tab we opened earlier, with the prototype.
- Take a look at the content on this page. Tell me what you think this page is for, what you can do here. You can scroll up and down, but don't click on anything just yet. Think aloud as you look.

This seems easy enough. I’m guessing I would type the school name in the first box. I’d expect the next two to auto-populate if the school registers. If not, I would fill those out. I’d think the last box would have to list all of those characteristics on the same description, otherwise it would be weird to have all of them grouped together under one category. 

- What are your thoughts on the search criteria?

Being able to search by school’s funding amount available would be helpful.

- Let's imagine you live in California, and you're interested in finding an in-state school for a Bachelor's degree. Go ahead and see if you can find that.

To look for York University, I would jump to page 4 because it is in alphabetical order. *referenced using the search bar later*

- After results are presented:

Again, take a look at the content on this page. Don't click on anything just yet. Tell me what you're looking at, what you can do here. Think aloud as you look.

It gives a snapshot for each university, but for myself I’d scroll through and see if I can find any names that I recognize. I’d also look by location. It’s important to know the numbers behind the max students and funding.

Imagine you wanted to see this list in a different order, such has highest benefit amount first. How would you do that?



Does the information about each school feel complete to you?

It would be good to know how many slots are left for funding because they can sway me to another school.

Is the meaning of each piece of information in the card clear to you?

I’d assume degree type “all” to mean both undergrad and grad. The max funding and students makes sense to me.

If you wanted to see the next set of schools, how would you do that?



## Third Task: Compare schools and change criteria - 8 minutes

- Let's say you're interested in [School A, School B, and School C] , and you want to see which one offers Yellow Ribbon to the most students. How would you do that?

- - If student does not use add to compare button and make their way to the comparison table, guide them there

- Tell me about this screen - what do you see here, what do you think you can do?

Next, I would want to compare my top choices. I’d hope the add to compare button would give me a more detailed breakdown to compare between schools. To add schools I’d just click the button and then click compare. It gives the same information on the last page but in a better display for comparing so I don’t have to scroll. I’d like it give me more information – such as the tuition.

- What are your thoughts on the way this information is presented?



- If you wanted to update this list somehow, how would you do that?



- Now that you have this information about these schools, what would your next step be?

I’d figure out my GI Bill portion and combine them. I’d then look into applying for Yellow Ribbon if my GI Bill didn’t cover everything.

- Imagine you want to go back and search for something different, maybe a specific school, or a different kind of degree. How would you do that?

The green back to search results button and the search button at the top.

If I clicked the added button, I would expect it to deselect.

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Do you have any other thoughts or feedback you haven't had a chance to share yet?

Positive:

Easy to read, straightforward, to the point. The criteria in each school’s box is exactly what I would need to know. 

- Any questions for me?



## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
