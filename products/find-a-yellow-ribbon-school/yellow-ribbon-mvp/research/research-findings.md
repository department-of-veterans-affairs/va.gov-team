## Research Goals 

Stated in the research plan:

- The primary goal of this research is to understand how Veterans research Yellow Ribbon Education benefits
- The secondary goal of this research is to understand what next steps a Veteran would want to take once they have completed research

The intention of this usability study was to better understand the factors that help Veterans make decisions on higher education, how they gather information to make those decisions, and how well they understand their education benefits.

Additionally, we sought to understand how Veterans are able to find school-specific Yellow Ribbon information, and how we might provide a more modernized experience than what is currently available on va.gov legacy pages.

## Research Methodology 

Sessions were a combined interview and task-based usability testing, via remote-moderation using Zoom, between January 30 - February 3, 2020.  Each session was approximately 40 minutes in length.

The moderator began with interview questions for the first 12-15 minutes of each session, and then prompted users to complete tasks with guiding questions (from the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/yellow-ribbon-mvp/research/jan-2020-conversation-guide.md)) for the remainder of the time.  Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance.

- To establish a baseline, 3 participants went through the tasks on the [existing Yellow Ribbon pages](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/)
- The remaining 8 participants went through the tasks with a clickable prototype https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/X5VOMBG2YP4

The tasks specifically served to help us understand:

- how easily Veterans could find Yellow Ribbon information about schools they're interested in, and what might make it even easier for them to do so
- how easily Veterans could understand the benefit information for each school
- if comparison functionality would be useful to Veterans in this process
- how we can help Veterans achieve the next step in their research process

### Who we talked to

We spoke to 10 Veterans (referred to as “users”) who were geographically spread throughout the U.S. and demographically diverse. A full profile of users can be found in the appendix.

### Research Questions

- How might we provide an efficient, meaningful way for Veterans to evaluate their education options?
  - What role does YR participation play in their decision making process?
  - How well do Veterans understand YR benefits and how the program works?
  - How do Veterans currently look for Yellow Ribbon schools?
  - How do Veterans react to the existing Yellow Ribbon content presentation?
  - What information about Yellow Ribbon is most meaningful to Veterans?
  - What questions do they have as they go through this process?
  - What criteria do Veterans have set in their minds when they begin the research process?
  - How would filtering or sorting improve the experience for Veterans?
  - Is side-by-side comparison functionality useful at this stage in their research?
  - Should the data be presented differently at the research vs comparison phases?
- How might we empower Veterans to take the next step in their education process once they found the information needed to make a choice?
  - Once a Veteran has the Yellow Ribbon information they're looking for, what would they do next?

## Key Findings

1. Only 3 of the 10 users understood Yellow Ribbon benefits; half could not explain how the program works.

2. Yellow Ribbon benefits play a supporting role in the decision-making process for school selection. 

3. 8 of the 10 users we spoke to stated they already had a few schools selected when they began researching their education benefits.  The majority don't approach this task with a browsing mindset. 

4. Users were easily able to complete research on both the current presentation of Yellow Ribbon information, and the prototype.  

5. Some language was confusing and/or ambiguous to users at first.  After looking through the search results, and comparing values against one another, they had a better guess as to what certain pieces of information meant, but weren't fully confident.

6. Once users had identified Yellow Ribbon participating schools that offer the degree and program they're interested in, benefit amount and the likelihood of receiving that benefit were the next most important pieces of information.

7. In order to complete research more efficiently, users would benefit from being able to input more specific criteria to view schools that participate in Yellow Ribbon. 

8. 9 out of 10 users found the side-by-side comparison functionality helpful, though the majority expected to find additional information beyond what was presented in the search results when viewing the comparison table.

9. Users stated after completing a comparison and narrowing down school choices, their next step would be to get more information from the school.

     

## Details of Findings

1. Only 3 of the 10 users understood Yellow Ribbon benefits; **half could not explain how the program works**.  The few that fully understood the benefit had done their own research to come to that understanding.  One Veteran received the benefit without even knowing what it was - it just appeared on their tuition statement!  A participant with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) shared they have been struggling to understand the program and have been unable to find information in a way they can mentally digest. 

   - *"Having a brain injury and PTSD, it's extremely important to me that it is set up in a format that's easy to understand without having to follow rabbit trails and click links, and call people, and do research. It gets too distracting."* 

2. Yellow Ribbon benefits play a supporting role in the decision-making process for school selection.   Primary factors when making are decision about higher education are area of study, degree level, and location. Many users were also interested specifically in online programs. Once the user has made some selections based on the primary criteria, benefits that reduce out-of-pocket expenses play a larger role in narrowing down choices.  When asked what factors played into their school selection process, users named:

   - Proximity of the school to their home or family. From a user who transferred after the first year, and received Yellow Ribbon without asking for it: *"I picked my schools based on convenient location. Not a lot of choices in Alaska [where owned home], and then Methodist [second college] was in the same town as my fiancee and she said they had a good CS program, so that's why I chose them."*

   - Offering the program and degree level they're interested in (e.g. Masters in Business Administration)

   - School ranking / quality of education

   - Learning format - multiple users were interested only in online classes, and one was interested strictly in in-person learning environments

   - *"It'll be a combination of cost, and who has the best program for what I'm looking for in our area"*

     

3. 8 of the 10 users we spoke to stated they **already had a few schools selected** when they began researching their education benefits.  The majority don't approach this task with a browsing mindset.  To learn more about benefits they initially heard about as they transitioned out of the military, users primarily use Google, and then follow-up with the school to confirm what they learned. *"I would not go to a school that didn't have the experience running one of these [benefit] programs"*

   - Most users don't currently rely on the VA for education or benefit information.  *"I'd start on the VA website, and get confused and lost in the infinite pages that lead back to each other, and then just google and go to the military websites that essentially decrypt the VA website"*

   - Many users were focused on the Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit more than others because of it's comprehensive coverage of education costs *and* housing.

   When asked to use va.gov to research Yellow Ribbon information, only one user was successfully able to find the Yellow Ribbon page without site search.  The information on the Yellow Ribbon page was easily understood by the majority of the users (see additional insights below for questions raised during the sessions)

4. Users were easily able to complete research on both the current presentation of Yellow Ribbon information, and the prototype. 

   - Since users had schools in mind when seeking out Yellow Ribbon information, navigating by state was easy for them, and they quickly understood schools were listed alphabetically in the table.   Three opportunities to improve the UX were identified:
     - 2 of the 3 users commented that some kind of filter would be helpful, but they were still able to find what they were looking for. 
     - One user expressed frustration having to continuously scroll up and down to verify what the column he was looking at meant
     - Starting with a geographic location made it unintuitive to find online programs. *"Trying to identify an online school by the state that it's based out of might make it difficult"*
   - Multiple users reacted positively to the simplicity and straightforward presentation of the content in the prototype.  Points of confusion for users were a result of the language and content rather than the user interface itself.
     - A user with TBI/PTSD commented on the landing page: *"A lot of white space keeps it from getting cluttered in my mind."*
     - *"This to me is a lot easier than having to scroll through a bunch of stuff. I prefer things where I can just type it in, search, and be done."*
     - A user comment on the results page: *"I think that breaks it down without giving an overwhelming amount of information"*

5. Some language was confusing and/or ambiguous to users at first.  After looking through the search results, and comparing values against one another, they had a better guess as to what certain pieces of information meant, but weren't fully confident.  Many users stated they would contact a person the school (admissions or VA Resource office) to confirm benefit information.

   - The **Maximum Benefit Amount** label left users unsure whether that applied to a specific period of time, and if so, what that timeframe might be.  
   - The term "**unlimited**" (benefit amount and number of students) was confusing to users who didn't have a strong understanding of how the Yellow Ribbon program worked (7 of 10)  *"What does unlimited mean? Everything has a limit."*
   - The word **"division"** on the current Yellow Ribbon pages was confusing to one user. *"I think there's four divisions in a school...and I'm assuming it doesn't matter what the school is in?"*
   - Users did not know what to expect from the search field labeled **School location, state, or campus**. *"All three of those are different, unless it'll list it as one option?"*
   - **Degree Type** was also problematic. 
     - In the search field, users interpreted that to be more specific than the degree level. They expected to see specific programs such as "Masters in Business Administration".  
     - On the results page, the word **All** was ambiguous to several users. "When it says degree type all, I don't know what that means...my assumption that is just a generic response. But there's no way these schools offer every kind of undergraduate degree"

6. Once users had identified Yellow Ribbon participating schools that offer the degree and program they're interested in, **benefit amount and the likelihood of receiving that benefit** were the next most important pieces of information. Upon reading the "funding available for" value, many users asked some variation of "what are my chances of actually getting this money?" and stated that would be an important factor in determining whether or not they'd want to move forward with that school. *"If I'm applying to the school, I'm definitely going to ask how many students did you already give the funding to"*

7. In order to complete research more efficiently, **users would benefit from being able to input more specific criteria** to view schools that participate in Yellow Ribbon.  The prototype included 3 search fields (`school name`, `degree type`, and `location, state, or school campus`) that could update  results, and users were prompted to show the moderator how they might reduce the number of results.  *"The more metrics you could put to allow someone to further specify search, would make it more usable and more likely to be used."* Multiple users felt the applying following criteria would give them a set of results more relevant to their interests:

   - Specific area of study
   - More specific with the location (e.g. a specific city or zip code radius)
   - Maximum benefit amount
   - Benefit available for most students
   - Online or in-person only

8. **9 out of 10 users found the side-by-side comparison functionality helpful, though the majority expected to find additional information** beyond what was presented in the search results when viewing the comparison table.  On the search results page:

   - Users immediately noticed the `add to compare` button for each school
   - They also immediately noticed the `compare search results >` link that appeared when a school was added. One user commented that the green color made them think it wasn't part of the tool because all everything else was blue, and that they wouldn't normally pay attention to anything down there. *"You don't normally look down at the bottom because that's where all of your junk stuff pops up"*
   - 9 out of 10 users understood that clicking a checked `Added` button would remove the school from their list

   On the comparison table page, when asked how they might update the list they created, 9 out of 10 users clearly understood the functionality to remove a school, and stated they'd go back to the search results if they wanted to add more. 

   - One user thought clicking the red `X` button might reveal additional information and could not be certain what would happen if he clicked it (it was not interactive in the prototype).
   - Additional information users expected to see on the comparison page included total out-of-pocket costs, school ranking information, contact information for the school, and a link to the school website.

9. Users stated after completing a comparison and narrowing down school choices, their **next step would be to get more information from the school**. The majority stated they expected to go to the school website; 2 users said they expected contact information or a way to get in touch with a VA resource at the school.  The school name was the most common area a user expected to click to get this additional info. *"Now, how do I contact the schools?"*

## Additional Insights

- Half of users stated it was difficult to find information about their Yellow Ribbon benefit that they trusted and could understand.   *"Honestly, the only thing I know about Yellow Ribbon is conflicting information"*.  

- Multiple users were unclear how Yellow Ribbon worked with other non-VA scholarships or assistance, such as FAFSA and expressed needing more clarity in that area.  One user was also unsure how their benefits worked across state lines.

- Users had a difficult time finding Yellow Ribbon information through the information architecture on va.gov. However, most stated they'd start their research on Google, and the Yellow Ribbon page ranks first in search results for that term.

  - Those who were somewhat familiar with the Yellow Ribbon program clicked on one of the links on the education card on the home page (see below)
  - The study further validated a known va.gov issue; most participants didn't scroll past the "faux footer" (image of a row of people) at the bottom of the first section of the page.
  - Many resorted to site search when they were unsuccessful after 2-3 clicks on hub pages.
  - Most users first clicked on the Education heading when looking for this information.

- Once they landed on the page, the majority of users found the Yellow Ribbon hub page to be easy to understand and helpful.  Some commented that while it was a lot of information to digest, they were glad it was all in one place.

  - 2 users expressed confusion around "decision" language on the Yellow Ribbon hub page (subway map). They were unsure as to what the decision process was, or how they would be informed of the decision (phone, email, or mail) *"This tells me someone is making a decision about this - what are the deciding factors, if I know I'm eligible?"*
  - One user commented that they felt the eligibility information would be overwhelming for someone with TBI (this user is a full-time caregiver for her partner, who suffers from TBI)

## Hypothesis & Results

- Veterans find the current presentation of YR information tedious to parse through
  - False. They did not have trouble with the current presentation
- Veterans know the degree level, and either city, state, or name of the school they're interested in when they begin their research
  - True. See findings 2 and 3.
- Sorting, filtering, and side-by-side comparison functionality will be helpful for Veterans
  - True. See findings 8 and 9
- Benefit amount will be the most important variable in the search results
  - Partially true.  Assuming that the program and degree type were already relevant in the search results, then benefit amount becomes important
- Veterans will be confused about the difference between this and the GIBCT, and not understand the need for two separate tools
  - False.  8 out of 10 participants were not aware of the GIBCT, and those that were aware understood the distinction.

## Recommendations

#### Yellow Ribbon MVP

- The overall user flow, and interface of the prototype worked well for the users interviewed; no changes recommended to those aspects.
- Provide a way for users to get more information about a specific school
- Explore options for users to enter more specific criteria to find relevant schools

  - when conducting the initial search, or 
  - on the results page, filtering by the data points available for each school (program, degree, benefit amount, number of students)
  - Note: because we do not have accurate data around specific programs, on-line or in-person classes, we can’t include these as criteria
- Improve clarity of content across the product
  - Revisit `Location, state, or campus` field so finding a school by location is more intuitive to users
  - The label **Maximum Yellow Ribbon Benefit Amount** should include **(per student, per year)**
  - Remove `School or program` from the MVP; the data is ambiguous and will not provide a positive user experience
  - Learn more about the data we have available. 
    - Degree Type/Level may be removed based on what we learn; the term “All” is ambiguous. 
    - If we decide to keep it, update label to **Degree Level** (or something similar that will not lead users to expect specific programs)
    - Add clarity around the term "unlimited" for benefit amount and number of students term "unlimited" for benefit amount and number of students
- Shelf comparison functionality for launch and keep as a stretch goal.  The study suggests that with more specific search criteria, or filters, users could refine results to the point where comparison would not be burdensome in the search result itself.

#### **Additional Opportunities**

- Improve outreach efforts to increase awareness around the benefits available to Veterans, and how they can maximize them
- Consider surfacing Yellow Ribbon information at a higher level in the information architecture.  
- Consider adding more information to the Yellow Ribbon (and other benefit pages, where applicable) to add clarity around how the benefit works in conjunction with other funding opportunities
- One participant had TBI and PTSD, and the other was a caregiver for a Veteran who was medically discharged for the same diagnosis.  During those sessions, challenges with the complexity of information available about benefits for those with TBI/PTSD came up. It would be worthwhile to conduct a study focusing on this user group to better understand how we can simplify our content to meet their needs.

## Next Steps

**Review findings and update MVP**

After reviewing findings with team on 2/11/2020, it was determined that we will 

- explore adding more specific criteria for search or filtering to give users a smaller results set
- remove the school or program information, due to the quality of data for this field
- add the school website
- launch without comparison functionality, keeping it as a stretch goal for the team

**Better understand the data**

The team realized we need to get clarity from the Yellow Ribbon team to understand the following questions:

- Is the data for Degree Level available as a list for each school, instead of "All"?
- What does “Unlimited” really mean in school contribution amount, and number of students?
- Inquiry sent to Yellow Ribbon team on 2/12/2020
