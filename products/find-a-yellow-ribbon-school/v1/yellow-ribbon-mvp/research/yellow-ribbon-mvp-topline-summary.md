# Yellow Ribbon Topline Summary

Prepared by: Liz Lantz, VSA Design

February 5, 2020


Description of a topline summary: https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/

First, what the Topline is and isn’t. 

- There’s synthesis that happens from observing the usability study (which the Topline captures), 
- and synthesis that happens from working with the data (which we haven’t done yet).

In the Topline we go a step further than the end of day debrief sessions and start to articulate some of the patterns we think are emerging, but these ideas may change once we do a detailed analysis and synthesis of the data we’ve gathered.

The goals of the topline summary + share out with the team:

- The Topline summary is a great opportunity for everyone who observed sessions to align on perceived top findings. 
- The Topline summary is also a good time for clients/the team to let the researchers/designers know if there are any specific directions they want us to pursue as we analyze and synthesize the data we’ve gathered.

## Research Questions & Answers

(Questions from our original [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/yellow-ribbon-mvp/research/jan-2020-usability-test.md))

- What role does Yellow Ribbon participation play in their decision making process?

- - A: The majority of participants weren’t familiar with the program
  - While availability of benefits overall was voiced as a priority, Yellow Ribbon specifically wasn’t a top decision factor in selecting a school. Most participants assumed their Post 9/11 GI-Bill benefit would cover all their education costs.  
  - Location, and the combination of degree/major (e.g. MBA), and quality of education were stated as important factors over Yellow Ribbon specifically. 
  - If they’re between schools, the school offering the highest benefit is likely to be selected by the Veteran.
    
    

- How well do Veterans understand Yellow Ribbon benefits and how the program works?

- - A: Of the 11 participants we talked to, only 2 had a clear idea of how the program worked. 
  - One participant received YR benefits automatically on his tuition statement and didn’t even know what it was
  -  2 others had a vague understanding of benefits
  - The majority of participants said they would use google or reach out to the Veteran resource center for the particular school to better understand how benefits worked, once they had a school selected
  - A few participants spoke to a lack of VA education resources available to them that could help them understand their benefits or answer questions



- How do Veterans currently look for Yellow Ribbon schools?

- - A: None of the participants we spoke to had specifically looked for a Yellow Ribbon school.
  - One participant had used the GIBCT to see if their school of choice offered GIB benefits, and because it was covered 100% by GIBCT, they had no need to look for Yellow Ribbon



- How do Veterans react to the existing Yellow Ribbon content presentation?

- - A: 3 participants were asked to complete the tasks on the current pages (instead of the prototype).  
  - They were easily able to understand and find schools they were interested in.
  - They didn’t seem particularly daunted by the size of tables or static format of the information available. 
  - All participants stated they’d have a school in mind when looking up this information, so the accordion IA was easy for them to navigate
  - 2 of the three participants commented that some kind of filter would be helpful
    
    

- What information about Yellow Ribbon is most meaningful to Veterans?

- - A: Of the available information, participants stated benefit amount would be most important
  - **"The way I see it, I earned this benefit and I want to get the most out of it"**
  - “Funding available for” (x # of students) was also of interest but about half of the participants weren’t clear on what that number meant (see questions below) 
  - Total out of pocket cost
    
    

- What questions do they have as they go through this process?

- - A: Does “benefit available for” mean how many students are left for the school year? The for the year or semester in total?
  - How many students have already received the benefit for that school this year? What are my chances of even getting this?
  - On the hub page, in reference to “wait for decision” - so, someone is deciding this? Based on what? I want to know more about the criteria to get this funding.
  - How does Yellow Ribbon work with other benefits like FAFSA or state scholarships?
  - What is my final out of pocket cost going to be?
  - Voiced uncertainty about what “school or program” meant when it was paired with the word “all”. It became more clear as they saw more specific information (e.g. School of Business)
    
    

- What criteria do Veterans have set in their minds when they begin the research process?

- - A: The majority of participants stated they’d already have a school name in mind when looking up Yellow Ribbon information
  - Location is also a priority - the majority of participants wanted a school in their town, and had selected colleges they attended based on proximity to their home
  - Almost half of the participants stated they’d want to know if a school had online degrees available as well



- How would filtering or sorting improve the experience for Veterans?

- - A: Filters that allow Veterans to look at schools based on a combination of program and degree (e.g. MBA) would be allow them to find what they were looking for more quickly
  - Participants also expressed interest in the ability to see only schools that offered unlimited funding and/or to unlimited students. 



- Is side-by-side comparison functionality useful at this stage in their research?

- - A: Most participants said they’d already have a school in mind when researching yellow ribbon benefits, so the study did not definitively prove whether or not this was useful, as the tasks took participants through scenarios they would not normally go through on their own
  - Generally, reactions were positive to the presentation of information and participants stated that it aligned with their expectations after clicking the “compare selected schools” button
  - Multiple participants expected additional information on the comparison page, and to be able to click on the school name and go to the school website



- Should the data be presented differently at the research vs comparison phases?

- - A: Participants stated that the search results page was in line with their expectations after clicking “search” on the first page, and that the table view was in line with what they expected to see after clicking “compare selected schools”



- Once a Veteran has the Yellow Ribbon information they're looking for, what would they do next?

- - A: The majority of participants stated their next step would be to contact the school (homepage or admissions)
  - Some specifically stated they’d contact the VA officer at the school
  - A few participants stated they’d want to go look up their GI Bill benefits to determine how much of their school cost would be covered by that

## Our Hypotheses & Answers

(Hypotheses from our original [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/yellow-ribbon-mvp/research/jan-2020-usability-test.md))

- Veterans find the current presentation of YR information tedious to parse through

- - None of the 3 participants who completed tasks on the current pages expressed frustration

- Veterans know the degree level, and either city, state, or name of the school they're interested in when they begin their research

- - All true

- Sorting, filtering, and side-by-side comparison functionality will be helpful for Veterans

- - Providing a way for users to get specific information about what they’re looking for will be helpful; filtering and sorting may not be needed if the correct options are presented on the initial search page
  - Multiple participants stated the side-by-side comparison was helpful to narrow down a group of schools
  - Multiple participants also said would be helpful to see schools based on funding amount and/or "number of students" when asked about how they might "reduce the number of options" on the screen. A couple specifically said "sort by..." those values whereas others said "only see schools that have unlimited funding" or "for unlimited students".

- Benefit amount will be the most important variable in the search results

- - Benefit amount is important, but a close second is the benefit amount + number of students funding is available for. Multiple participants stated they’d be more likely to go with a school that had unlimited benefits for unlimited students

- Veterans will be confused about the difference between this and the GIBCT, and not understand the need for two separate tools

- - Only one participant was familiar with the GIBCT, and didn’t voice any confusion about that, vs our solution.



## Prototype Findings

- Most participants understood the 3 fields were optional on the initial search page
- The label “Location, state, or campus” was unclear for many participants. They expected more specific options than what would be there in reality - states, territories, and countries
- The majority of participants clearly understood the comparison functionality
- One participant commented that she’d never pay attention to the bar on the bottom (compare page link) because that’s where “cookie notices and other junk show up)
- One participant commented they’d have no idea that bar on the bottom was related to the page because it was the only thing on the page that is green
- Most participants expected additional information to be on the comparison view than the initial results page, although said the info on the comparison page was still helpful
- Multiple participants said 3-5 schools on the compare list would be sufficient for them
- A participant with TBI and PTSD specifically said the white space on the first prototype screen was exactly what she needed because it was clear, simple, and to the point

## Other Findings

- Persona/demographic info

- - The majority of participants already had at least one degree

  - 3 were interested in pursuing a second or third Master's degree

  - Most participants do not want to move from where they currently live

  - Most participants spoke to the need for flexibility in higher education so they could manage other responsibilities such as work and family

  - A few participants spoke to "chipping away" at a degree while still in the service, and how their education has been interrupted over the years and put on hold due to deployments

  - Multiple participants were considering an area of study specifically for the “hireability” of that field and likelihood of finding a job

  - 2 participants sustained an life-changing injury that motivated them to pursue higher education

    

- How did participants look for Yellow Ribbon information on va.gov?

- - Most went to Education card on home page, but seemed unsure about where to go next when they didn’t see the words “yellow ribbon” on the page.
  - Since the majority of participants said they would just use Google to get information, having them browse va.gov to find YR info seemed like an unlikely behavior in real life. 
  - When Yellow Ribbon info didn’t come up in first 2 clicks, most participants went to site search
  - Most participants did not scroll below the row of people on the home page; it seemed as if they thought the page ended there.
  - Multiple participants tried to click on the card heading (e.g. Education)



- Can you describe the type of environment you’d be in when you do this type of research?

- - All participants said they would do this type of research at home, on a laptop
  - Many said “on the couch”
  - One specifically said “I would never do this type of research on my phone”
