# Find a Yellow Ribbon School Stakeholder Meeting Feb 3, 2021

## Attendees: 
- Luke Tickner (VA)
- Tammy Hurley (VA)
- Joe Preisser (VA)
- John Hashimoto (PO)
- Laurel Lawrence (Designer)
- Marci McGuire (PM)

## Discussion:
- Not a huge program, but a prominent program
- Luke - What we have today is a huge improvement over what they had; they are excited to hear our ideas
- Spike in July/August - Luke confirmed that is when people are interested in everything school-related.
- Luke - how do they promote?  They don't really promote it.  When they go out and talk to people, they mention it.  There are such a small number of schools that participate (they either can't or they already cover 100% tuition for state schools because they don't want to upset the state schools by promoting the for-profit.
- State schools were super upset when the GI Bill Comparison school showed Yellow Ribbon and Veterans were upset they didn't participate and they didn't even understand what that was.
- The list of top schools now makes perfect sense in context of them covering the state schools 100%
- But it could be that they cover in state/out of state - Joe explained that they really shouldn't be on there.
- The data may not reflect the current agreements. Once the schools have an agreement, it stays until the school changes or remove it.
- Luke said he needs to go back to the team that handles and have them do a data scrub.
- Rolling YR into the comparison tool? Luke confirmed that it probably won't happen this year.
- Rationale for standalone vs being part of GI Bill - Tammy didn't want to update 52 static pages every year and this to have less of an error rate and making it easier to do searches instead of scrolling
- Booz team improved the algorithm (Zach needs to talk to them)

## Comparison School Discovery
- Finding a location near me was huge (geolocation) - like finding a pizza restaurant near me
- Most users are not in a place in their life to pick up and move across the country.  They are working, having families, etc.
- They are also interested in seeing schools with Student-Led Veteran Groups on campus - this is in the dataset for the comparison tool
- Classes online or in person

- Step 1 - improve this
- Step 2 - how do we integrate into the comparison tool - having a filter for Yellow Ribbon isn't going to make sense to them. It just means the school is expensive so they're going to cut them a break. Doesn't mean the school is good or not.

## Search importance top priorities
- Geolocation (schools near me) - VERY important - as long as we aren't collecting PII  - captured in ticket  # 20393
- Degree Type - important - I added to the notes in the issue where Laurel did the design for filtering (#18553)
- Out of Pocket Expenses (tuition minus what the VA/School is contributing)  I added to the notes in the issue where Laurel did the design for filtering (#18553)

- Institution Type - less important.  Luke doesn't know if there are any two year Yellow Ribbon schools.
- Funding Amount - not in the way we are approaching challenge is that people are more interested in their out of pocket cost vs. how much they school and VA is contributing - think of it as sorting shoes by price, value
- Side by Side comparison - important - captured in issue  #20398
- Major - moderately important.  Only half of the users are going to a four year school
- A lot of them are just trying to decide WHAT they are going to do based on what is available.   I added to the notes in the issue where Laurel did the design for filtering (#18553)
- Yellow Ribbon is schools since it's a little different from GI Bill Comparison Tool (GI Bill can have apprenticeships for companies)
- Per John, we'll schedule something again mid-year, or when we have something new coming out.
- 2021-11-05 Follow-up note - John reached out to stakeholders in mid 2001 and at that time our priority was still Find a VA Form, so we agreed there was no point committing to improvements when we were not in a place to deliver and it was still up in the air whether this would be rolled into the GI Bill search tool.
