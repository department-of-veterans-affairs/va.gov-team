## **Research Plan for IIR, Yellow Ribbon Search Filters Research: Open Card Sort**

This work falls in the first phase of a multi-phase Yellow ribbon search enhancement initiative. In this phase we want to understand how Veterans (and others) would expect to see degree types we gather from schools categorized and what the names of those categories would be.


### 
**Background and Goal**

We want to reduce the amount of time it takes Veterans (and others) to discover a yellow ribbon program that matches their preferences and benefit options. Currently when Veterans (and others) search for schools participating in the yellow ribbon program they cannot filter results by “degree type”. 

We want to provide this ability while still keeping the number of “degree types” that Veterans (and others) need to navigate through under 10. For this phase of the initiative we are proposing an iteration on the existing Yellow Ribbon Search tool.

#### 
**Veteran Journey**


#### 
This feature fits into the veteran’s journey **as the veteran seeks to reinvent themselves and acquire appropriate education and new skills**. We want to reduce the amount of time it takes veterans as they **seek educational benefits. \
 \
OCTO Objectives**

The following are the [2024 OCTO Objectives](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/ap/b-59584e83/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdvagov.sharepoint.com%2F%3Ab%3A%2Fs%2Foitdigitaltransformation%2FERxPpNTQ6RxFlLpEjXbkg4ABaiBTOdXohIZ1OkksPwlnvw%3Fe%3DayadXo&data=05%7C02%7C%7Cae5f6afeb74b455339dc08dc265b522f%7Ce95f1b23abaf45ee821db7ab251ab3bf%7C0%7C0%7C638427420916736422%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=1aYuaOt60EmaL3HZfegisRQABCw3Kmh%2BOn%2B3MmMjhJk%3D&reserved=0) this research supports.



1. Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### 
**Research Goals**


Determine how Veterans (and others) would expect “degree type” types to be categorized and what the names of those categories would be.


#### 
**Outcome**

This research will provide confidence in the way we categorize the many degree data types into smaller categories. We will take this learning to create filters to help veterans find the right yellow ribbon participating school for them.


#### 
**Research questions**

How do Veterans (and others) expect to see degree types categorized?



1. How do Veterans (and others) expect the provided data points to map into categories?
2. How would Veterans (and others) name the categories to fit the data in?

#### 
**Hypothesis**

1. Veterans (and others) will have overlap in category types they create.
2. Veterans (and others) will have overlap in the categorization of the cards into groups that they create.

### 
**Methodology**


For this study we plan to run an open card sort.


Before the card sort we will run a pilot test with members of the IIR team

In an open card sort, participants are asked to sort topics into categories which they create. A open card sort works best when you want to define a set of categories, and you want to learn how users sort content items into each category. [Usability.gov - Card Sorting](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html)

[Card Sorting - Methods 18F](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/card-sorting/)


##### **Method**

Using Optimal Workshop, we would like to conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to a card sort activity that contains a list of 28 current degree types from the schools participating in the Yellow Ribbon benefits. Each participant sorts the content cards into categoriesthat the participant defines.

We would like to get complete sorting responses from:



* A pilot test group of 2, we will provide the contact information of these individuals to parigian
* At least 15 Veterans, Veterans spouses, and Veterans dependents in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). Each cohort will access the study using a unique URL.

### 
**Recruitment**


#### 
**Recruitment approach**


Our intended audience for this research is: 


* Veterans 
* Veterans’ spouses seeking educational benefits 
* Veterans’ dependents seeking educational benefits
* Veterans’ caregivers who are seeking educational benefits for the veteran benefits.

We want this recruitment to be supported by Perigean. \


**Recruitment criteria**

Ask Perigean to recruit **35 participants** to get at least **28 completes**. \
Ideally we would like to get about



* Approximately ½ Veterans and ½ spouses or dependents using veteran’s transferred benefits. 
* Approximately ½ with experience using VA educational benefits/service and ½ without such experience but interest in using them.


#### Primary Criteria:



* Must be willing to use Desktop or laptop, study does not support tablet or mobile devices.
* ALL are willing to do an activity that requires dragging and dropping items on their computer screen (NO screen reader users)
* At least 10 women
* Diversity across age groups
* Diversity across racial identities
* Diversity across education levels
* Diversity across rural and major metropolitan areas


#### For Pilot (2 Participants selected from team)
* We will provide pilot participant contact information to parigian in slack channel at research start
* [Pilot study link](https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/pilot)

#### For Cohort A (7 Veterans)



* Must have experience using VA educational benefits/service
* [Cohort A study link](https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/a)


#### For Cohort B (7 Veterans)



* Must **NOT** have experience using VA educational benefits/service but have interest in them
* [Cohort B study link](https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/B)


#### For Cohort C (7 Non-Veterans: 4 spouses, 4 dependants of Veterans)



* Must have experience using VA educational benefits/service
* [Cohort C study link](https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/C)


#### For Cohort D (7 Non-Veterans: 3 spouses, 4 dependants of Veterans)



* Must **NOT** have experience using VA educational benefits/service but have interest in them
* [Cohort D study link](https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/D)


#### **Coordination with Perigean**

To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question "Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?".

We will provide an [email template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-yellow-ribbon-school/2024-02-Degree-Type-Filters/mail.md) and a unique card sort activity link for Perigean to use when reaching out to each cohort of potential participants.

We will include a required field at the beginning of the card sort to collect a code from each participant. We expect Perigean to generate and provide a unique code to each participant for tracking completion and compensation. In order to minimize abandonment, please make very clear to participants that they need to use this code when they start the card sort.

We estimate it will take participants 15 minutes or less to complete the card sort.


### 
**Timeline**

We would like to run this card sort from February 15 - February 29, 2024


#### 
**Prepare**

Because this is a smaller part of a larger initiative we will be performing this test before the midpoint review. \
 \
We will be running a pilot session by sending out the card sort to members of our team.
