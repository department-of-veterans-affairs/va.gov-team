### Executive Summary

To provide Yellow Ribbon. (YR) participating school information as more user-friendly content than the current experience of 50+ manual table pages. The current experience exists as it does today because there is no single source of Yellow Ribbon data.


### Problem Statement(s)

Yellow Ribbon is currently owned by an over capacity team.

Yellow Ribbon relies on data that is periodically updated.

Yellow Ribbon has been updated over time and has developed a discontinuous UX

From a technical perspective, Yellow Ribbon has been through multiple iterations and could benefit from a technical overhaul to modernize along with preparing the codebase for long term ownership and ease of updates.
