## Prod URL:<a id="prod-url"></a>

<https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/>


## Executive Summary<a id="executive-summary"></a>

To provide Yellow Ribbon (YR) participating school information as more user-friendly content than the current experience of 50+ manual table pages. The current experience exists as it does today because there is no single source of Yellow Ribbon data.


## The Product<a id="the-product"></a>

The Yellow Ribbon Program can help Veterans pay for higher tuition and fees at out-of-state, private, foreign, or graduate schools that the Post-9/11 GI Bill doesn’t cover. 


## Problem Statement(s)<a id="problem-statements"></a>

Yellow Ribbon is currently owned by Sitewide Facilities and will transition to IIR until a longer term team is in place.\
Update: It will be transitioned to Darla van Nieukerk’s team on or about April 13, 2024. The date is not solid as of 3/4/2024.

Yellow Ribbon relies on data that is periodically updated. Current data sources are the Institution table and Yellow Ribbon Program.  Fields used are included in the screenshot below. (Degree Level ID field name is proposed and approved on 3/4/2024 pending access to the database from Brian Grubb’s team).![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/q3f5PAOM53dPocrkltOY3B8UCAnGkXN2dF2JiowVJVUkIfCt0uv4I6yAbFtbK8PXyKO-wTxlnQ1wh9yQlcCGCZBNYsTpJD_gOL0FrDkm_fu0w2fyurLP8tXc_qURv-9gbLbkMhlbC6yW1krewJu5gzw)

Yellow Ribbon has been updated over time and has developed a discontinuous UX

From a technical perspective, Yellow Ribbon has gone through multiple iterations. It could benefit from a technical overhaul to modernize and prepare the codebase for long-term ownership and ease of updates.

## Images - Future State (as of 03/04/2024)<a id="images---future-state-as-of-03042024"></a>

_\* The following proposed enhancements were approved at a meeting with Darla van Nieukerk, Brian Grubb, and Jeff Barnes on 3/4/2024._


### Website link to use natural language<a id="website-link-to-use-natural-language"></a>

This change modifies the current card to display the institution's name as a hot link rather than the URL.

### Add filter for Degree type<a id="add-filter-for-degree-type"></a>

This enhancement allows Veteran users to refine their search to a specified degree type. It is a single-select filter.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ufRz-D4-EGGZGHUmGjdCMhYz-houBXAyBJRt8TOEoEGGJPtUeO4dWDcPEB9T-lwKB_KEQ9BDGcNIYgAFzb_bXMRbV-Xb5qyo4-qiNIUQZOKAzYEhSFRLGXPnilSOdC5Oru12F4mlBNyApedCYrqQ_gk)


### Simplify filter language for results summary<a id="simplify-filter-language-for-results-summary"></a>

This enhancement defines the results by reiterating the filters applied by the Veteran user. Doing so enhances the user's experience while using a screen reader and confirms the returned results.
