### Matt

## **- Agree about changes

- Search bar - start with search button

- They have a backlog item for filtering (look for other examples)

- Consider a “details” page

- How is the initial list going to be compiled?

- Is there a ranking, or another filter to enhance their search?

  - Alphabetically from data source**

### Alison

## **- Consider look/behavior for mobile devices**

### Erin - IA

## **- Love search interface

- GI comparison tool as an example 

- Agree with search options 

- Add a sort option button**

### Brian - Accessibility

## - Right track

- User input needs a label associated with it

- When an action takes place, need to have description button

- Key word focus for screen reader would probably skip all of the filtering options (but has no specific recommendation how to solve)

- Provide on screen text telling user what they’ve done (text to identify what filters are in place)

- The code in the current application/results is “weird” arrange content for the search results
