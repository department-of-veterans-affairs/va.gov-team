Subject: Participate in research with VA


Hello,


  The Iterate, Innovate, and Run team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting research to learn how you would expect degree types to be categorized. 


We are looking for Veterans interested in educational benefits and who are interested in participating in an online activity to help us understand your categorization preferences.


What will I be doing in this activity?


You will be sent a link to an online activity in which you'll see a list of degree types, and you'll drag-and-drop each, one at a time, into one category based on how you would organize it. You'll also be able to create your own categories. There are no wrong answers. We would like to know what category you think each degree type fits within.


How long is the activity?


The activity is self guided and should take you 15-20 minutes to complete on a computer (please don't use a phone or tablet because the screen will be too small). You can do this at any time that's convenient for you.


Interested in participating?


Please reply to this email to receive the activity link and a participation code. After completing the activity, we'll send you instructions on how to access your thank you gift card.
