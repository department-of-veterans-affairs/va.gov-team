**Session Report**

Project : [Campaign Landing Page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/campaign-landing-page-templates)

# Key Findings

Following are key findings from four beta tests conducted with four VA editors between March 10-31, 2021:

1. **Images** - Aspect ratio easy to skip. Also would be nice to know requirements for dimensions prior to selecting or uploading images into the form. 
2. **Audiences** - Some uncertainty about what "audience" meant. Shouldn't be able to just add anything/freeform text. 
3. **"What you can do" Promo** - Some confusion about use of the word promo to describe elements within this segment. Also help text seemed to add to confusion more than help it. 
4. **Preview** - Some participants expressed desire to have previews along the way (i.e. after building each segment), or they wanted a side-by-side preview like they've seen in other CMS, such as Dreamweaver. Also expressed a desire to have clearer help text to remind them to save, and that they can preview upon saving.
5. **Internal navigation** - The form is very long, so would be nice to have a way to go from segment to segment without having to scroll/also to help with wayfinding within the form. Also the nesting of forms within forms was confusing (ex. Downloadable Resources segment). 
6. **FAQs** - Why 3 to 10? Some wanted more, some wanted less. 
7. **Order of segments** - would be good if segments could be reordered. For example, if you wanted to lead with a video segment instead of a static hero image. 

# Findings by Severity Level

Following are the key findings ranked in order of severity, where 1 is considered most severe to 4 which is least severe, based on Dumas and Redish's Practical Guide to Usability Testing: 

* **Level 1:** Prevents Task Completion
* **Level 2:** Creates significant delay and frustration
* **Level 3:** Problems have a minor effect on usability
* **Level 4:** Subtle and possible enhancements/suggestions

## Level 1

* N/A
 
## Level 2

* Images ([See #4391](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/4391))
* What you can do Promo ([See #4990](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/4990))
* Preview (No CMS issue for this yet. Not reasonable to make this CLP specific. Certain approaches to the Accelerated Publishing may render this more feasible.)
* Internal navigation ([See #4992](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/4992))

## Level 3

* Audiences ([See #4989](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/4989))
* Order of segments ([See #4991](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/4991))

## Level 4

* FAQs (no issue for this yet, dependent on a product decision.)

# Key Quotes:

> "With these callouts and guided content, it makes it pretty easy for people who aren't in comms to use it."
> 
> "This is really, really solid. I don't think you guys have much more (work) to go on this."
> 
> "I know this is MVP and it'll get more fantastic as it goes."
> 
> "I like how the boxes showed you where the info would go and how it would look, so you're not working in the dark completely."
> 
> “Overall pretty good...for someone who's never created a campaign landing page it was pretty simple...It's (like) copy/paste for someone that doesn't know HTML or (know) the back end of Drupal.”
> 
> "I think this will be very cool. Just a bunch of hurdles until we can get to a cool place."
> 
> "This is not beating up on y'all at all...(I) can tell you put a lot of work into it. For someone that doesn't really know computers, (it) might be confusing."
> 
> "This is cool-this is super cool."
> 
> "I think y'all have done a great job."


## Discussion

* There were no findings that were so severe that it would require stopping the MVP from being released as is.
* The level two findings are not so severe that editors would be rendered unable to complete the task/build a CLP page.
* Some of the findings are dependent upon product owner and/or business decisions, or supporting business processes.
* Next recommended steps would be to compare CMS team findings and severity levels with those of the product owner, and to determine technical feasibility and level of effort for those findings that are chosen as candidates beyond MVP.
