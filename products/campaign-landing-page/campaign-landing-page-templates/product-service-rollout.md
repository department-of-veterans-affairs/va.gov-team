## MVP Production Release Phase (April-June 2021)

**What Will Happen**

**Goals:** 
To learn and iterate both the product AND the governance approach (e.g. who gets the keys, how is URL determined, what are "must have" feature enhancements needed in the tooling and template)

**Governance Model:**
Availability of the CLP page builder will be limited to four (or five?) VACO digital communication teams: VBA, VHA, VEO/OPIA and NCA.  These leads will be responsible for, and have the ability to:

- Being trained and proficient as a user/editor of the CLP authoring tool ([CMS CLP Training Guide](
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YfNpegO3TS13O7Sd0lnmy-mWf7ywmHPTxxtItchu9AE/edit#slide=id.gc3bbf21d57_0_90))
- Deciding which engagement initiatives are ideal fits for the CLP template
- Requesting the CLP via VA.gov's online submission form and providing all required information
- Working with the VA team/office to produce and quality control the CLP
- Publishing the CLP
- Working with the VA.gov team to "retire/sunset" the CLP

**MVP VACO Teams & Leads**
- VHA Digital Media (Health): Jenny Heiland-Luedtke, Jeffrey Grandon, Adrian Osman (VHADigitalMedia@va.gov)
- VBA Digital Strategy Team (Benefits): John P. DiMartino (Chief), Tanekwa Bournes (Program Analyst), Adrianne Hooten
- VEO: Tim Hudek
- OPIA: Kayla Williams, John Santos
- NCA Web Services: James LaPaglia (NCAWebServices@va.gov)

**MVP Request and Publishing Model (April-June 2021):** 

For the MVP phase, the goal was to publish three CLPs to test -- with production release -- the functionality of the tool and associated processes (e.g. establishment and set up of URL, Analytics, and UTMs).

The following three CLPs were launched as part of this phase:

- Trust: https://www.va.gov/initiatives/veteran-trust-in-va/. (VEO-Tim Hudak)
- Pride Month: https://www.va.gov/initiatives/recognizing-lgbtq-veterans-during-pride-month/ (OPIA-John Santos)
- COVID-19 Vaccine Questions: http://va.gov/covid-vaccine-questions (COVID JTF and VHS-Danielle Thierry)

The following IA and governance guidelines were established as part of this phase:

- The CLP will sit within a new "initiatives" sub-directory of VA.gov -- https://va.gov/initiatives/h1-of-clp -- but will not appear in the VA.gov IA.
- The URL is set dynamically via the H1 (with hyphens)
- There will be NO links to CLPs from global menus, footers, or tier 1 benefit pages
- CLPs will be temporary -- they will have a start and end date, and they will be removed from the VA.gov site with a redirect specified by the VA business stakeholder  to support the "expiration" of the page.


## Post-MVP Production Release Phase (June-Forward 2021)


**Goals:** 
To release the CLP to VACO Digital Comms teams -- enabling the tool to be used at wider scale, with VA business self-governance.

**Governance Model (Draft-WIP):**
- Edit and Publish access will go wider --  with the following guardrails in place:
  - The VACO Web Communications (Web Comms) teams/leads **OR the Web Governance Board led by OPIA (Gary Hicks)** will be the business owners of the CLP (with Public Websites remaining the Product Owner). That means, the leads on those teams:
    - Decide what is a CLP – including assessing requests from Offices, Leadership, etc.  Criteria include:
      - Is this a campaign or a blog post? 
      - Is the content duplicative? 
      - Is this time-bound?  A campaign must have an end date.
      - CLPs need to drive traffic TO benefits or tools or products, not the other direction.
      - CLPs can be seasonal or recurring(like Flu Season 2020, Pride Month 2020) but not duplicative of evergreen content
    - Ultimately responsible for ensuring the quality of the CLP -- e.g. look/feel, plain English content, accessibility)
    - Must kick-off the CLP process by creating/submitting the CLP request form. The request form will be used for two purposes:
      - To ensure the CLP meets the criteria for a Campaign and to ensure key information (e.g. name, goals, start-end date, URL requirements, etc.) are identified up-front
      - To make the Public Websites and CMS Product Support teams aware a new CLP is planned in case limited support is needed (user access, site cloning, vanity URL set-up) **Note:** There will be no VA.gov Platform or Product review before publication of the CLP
    - Build or oversee the build of the CLP
    - Manage any page updates
    - Create and implement share links (UTMs)
    - Monitor CLP performance (via Google Analytics)
    - Request “take down” of page when campaign ends, specifying the redirect strategy and/or URL

- VACO Web Comms Teams - CLP Training requirements: 
  - How to use CMS
  - How to use the Campaign Page builder, with special focus on how to add/edit photos, add videos, add PDFs.
  - Content - VA.gov style/tone and plain English 
  - Accessibility 
  - Design/UX - Adherence to VA.gov design principles
  - Information Architecture, with focus on URL (including H1 and Vanity) setting
  - Will be provided with two "artifacts"
    - Campaign Landing Page Info Form - This is the info CLP stakeholders will use to (a) compile upfront about the campaign/page and; (b) is helpful in determing if the initiative is a good fit for CLP.
    - Campaign Landing Page Content Build Template - This Word doc can be used to pre-create a CLP before you use the CMS to build the page.
