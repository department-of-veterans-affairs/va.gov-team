## Campaign Landing Page Approved Governance Model

**IA Governance**

- The CLP will sit within a new "initiatives" sub-directory of VA.gov -- https://va.gov/initiatives/h1-of-clp -- but **will not appear in the VA.gov global site navigation (header, footer, side) nor will links be allowed from the Benefit Hubs.**
- The root URL is set dynamically via the H1 (with hyphens) and will be reviewed by the VA product/IA team; vanity URLs will only be allowed/supported after VA.gov IA review.
- Unless a seasonal campaign, CLPs will be temporary -- they will have a start and end date, and they will be removed/deleted from the VA.gov site with a redirect specified by the VA business stakeholder to support the "expiration" of the page.
  - **Seasonal/recurring CLPs (examples include Flu Vaccination, Pride Month)** will remain live on site, with the root and vanity URL preserved and working, so they can be reused (with new content) the following year.  This will ensure the SEO value of the page/content is maintained.   If the seasonal/recurring CLP contains date sensitive content (e.g. you must get your Flu vaccine between Dec 10-24), the content editors should ensure references are updated for clarity.  

**Governance Model (Draft-WIP):**

- **Goal:** To allow VACO Digital Comms teams to self-publish with little "overhead" required by VA.gov digital teams (Public Website and CMS Product)

- **How It Works:**
  - The VACO Web Communications (Web Comms) teams/leads will be the business owners of the CLP (with Public Websites and CMS Product Support remaining the Product Owner). That means, the leads on those teams:
    - Decide what is a CLP – including assessing requests from Offices, Leadership, etc.  Criteria include:
      - Is this a campaign or a blog post? 
      - Is the content duplicative? 
      - Is this time-bound?  A campaign must have an end date.
      - CLPs need to drive traffic TO benefits or tools or products, not the other direction.
      - CLPs can be seasonal or recurring(like Flu Season 2020, Pride Month 2020) but not duplicative of evergreen content
    - Are responsible for ensuring the quality of the CLP -- e.g. look/feel, plain English content, accessibility)
    - Must kick-off the CLP process by communicating their plan -- via dedicated Teams channel -- to the Web Governance Board chaired by Josh Tushcher of OPIA.  This is to ensure cross-organizational alignment (e.g. this does not conflict with strategic communications initiatives by another VACO team)
    - Must kick-off the CLP process by creating/submitting the CLP request form. The request form will be used for two purposes:
      - To ensure the CLP meets the criteria for a Campaign and to ensure key information (e.g. name, goals, start-end date, URL requirements, etc.) are identified up-front
      - To make the Public Websites and CMS Product Support teams aware a new CLP is planned in case limited support is needed (user access, site cloning, vanity URL set-up) **Note:** There will be no VA.gov Platform or Product review before publication of the CLP
    - Build or oversee the build of the CLP
    - Manage any page updates
    - Create and implement share links (via UTM Worksheet on Sharepoint)
    - Monitor CLP performance (via Google Analytics)
    - Request “sunset” or "archiving" of page when campaign ends, specifying the redirect strategy and URL.

    - Campaign Landing Page Info Form - This is the info CLP stakeholders will use to (a) compile upfront about the campaign/page and; (b) is helpful in determing if the initiative is a good fit for CLP.
    - Campaign Landing Page Content Build Template - This Word doc can be used to pre-create a CLP before you use the CMS to build the page.
