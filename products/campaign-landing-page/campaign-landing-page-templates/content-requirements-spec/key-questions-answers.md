## CLP Key Questions

**Who will use CLP?**
- VA business stakeholders, with their Web leads very likely doing the hands-on authoring.

**When will CLP be used?** 
- CLP will be used by primarily by VA marketing stakeholders to communicate new initiatives, new or annual programs.  Examples include:

  - https://missionact.va.gov/
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/transition/solid-start.asp
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/blue-water-navy.asp
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/financial-literacy.asp
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/banking.asp
  - https://www.va.gov/QUALITYOFCARE/education/Mental_Health_Awareness_Month2020.asp
  - https://www.wearewithinreach.net/

**What problem does CLP try to solve?**  
- We are addressing demand from business stakeholders who want this capability to create more effective communications AND capacity issues – e.g. Public Websites does not have the resources to solve this need.   

**How will we be able to track the success of CLPs?**  
- CLPs will be instrumented for Google Analytics tracking, with particular focus on the performance of the page CTAs to drive traffic to benefits contents and tools.  While the traffic performance of CLP is not a KPI -- we do think enforcing the use of a CTA and identifying the audience the CLP is targeting (e.g., Who is this for?) will help ensure business these marketing efforts are more focused, targeted and measured. 

**How many CLPs will likely be launched a year?** 
- 5-10 a year, if we roll it out in phased approach. If made available to all businesses at VA, it could be significantly more than 10 a year.

**Is there an expiration date associated with CLPs?**  
- CLPs, in theory, should be time-bound, like any campaign.  But a hard and fast rule may be impractical to impose given the nature of some VA programs and initiatives.  That said, we do want to avoid abuse of the template.  Here are some thoughts about how we “govern” their use:

  - Drupal sends the content author and PW team a notification to review the CLP to determine if it should remain live. We would want to remove pages from the server for example, the page is not attracting meaningful traffic. We would only set a re-direct if there is meaningful traffic/SEO value.
  - Another approach: One year after the CLP goes live, a notification is sent to VA stakeholders and PW to review the goals and performance (e.g. will it continue to be marketed; is it continuing to generate traffic) to determine if the CLP should remain live on VA.gov.

**Who are the users who will get access and edit rights for the CLP?**  
- We will govern via Drupal access – e.g. we don't want a sub-sub-sub VA office using these, nor an unlimited number of users. We will want to restrict authoring rights to the Web-master types who currently do the hands-on work for the VA business units.

**How will VA businesses become aware of the new CLP capability/product?**
- for MVP we will work with a select group of stakeholders -- likely one BU.  Once we validate the product's value (and fine-tune the product as needed), we will introduce CLP to other key stakeholder/user groups.
- we will create a product guide/webpage to on-board users

**How will the use of the CLP be governed?**  
- We envision three phases of roll-out where a sliding scale of governance is applied.
  - Phase One (MVP phase) - Public Websites will tightly govern use with 1 or 2 select VA business user groups who will serve as our beta builders/testers.
  - Phase Two (Incremental roll-out) - Assuming MVP phase meets key criteria (to be better defined), will widen the pool of users to 3 stakeholder groups.  Think of this as phase “by invitation only.”
  - Phase Three (Full launch) - the self-service phase with a Product on-boarding guide to help users get up and running. While the CLP is in theory available to all VA stakeholder groups, we may require users to submit a "request for access form" to ensure the CLP is used for its intended purpose/use case.  More consideration and definition to come.

**How will VA businesses become aware of the new CLP capability/product?**
- for MVP we will work with a select group of stakeholders -- likely one BU.  Once we validate the product's value (and fine-tune the product as needed), we will introduce CLP to other key stakeholder/user groups. We would create a product guide/webpage to on-board and train users

## Questions which need follow-up to finalize (John):

**What's the difference between content for CLP, Learning Center and a Benefit Hub?**  
- I will work to put a finer point around the distinctions (e.g. comparison table)

**Will CLPs need VSP Collaboration Cycle review before they are published?**   
- While the CLP product will undergo all necessary Collab Cycle reviews, we see no reason for each CLP to be created by users to require review.   Will confirm with VSP.

**Where will CLPs sit in the site IA and directory structure?**  

- Requires more follow-up thinking with Mikki, Meg and KevinW. Original thinking -- CLPs would be root-level pages, not part of the IA with the URL baked in to the CLP template creation, perhaps driven by the H1.  However, Mikki's concern: H1s can be changed which would affect the URL.
- CLP will be for a limited time; some will be for bigger campaigns and last longer;
- It would sit at the root level and linked to from related content
- Would we put them in a campaign directory?  Probably not.   They will likely want a vanity URL -- but not a sub-domain.
- The IA should be modeled on the way people think.  It's a topic, a thing (e.g. Legislation for community care).
- We don't want to let the stakeholders determine the URL/placement (Should we require a submission request and the stakeholder can request a URL but we will make decision)
  - Mikki: In Drupal, there is an ability to govern creation of the URL (check w/KevWalsh)
- NOT in the NAV
