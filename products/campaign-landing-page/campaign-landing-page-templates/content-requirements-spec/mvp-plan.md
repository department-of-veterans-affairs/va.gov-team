By end of December ...

<b>Minimum:</b>

- CMS: Complete required Panels
- Product: Address all [Content Model questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/campaign-landing-page-templates/content-requirements-spec/cms-content-model-and-rigidity.md) 
- Product/Editorial: Populate with demo content from archived campaign
- Product: Demo backend/frontend experience for two VA stakeholders (Paul Shute, VBAVACO-Disability + Sandy Tadeo, VBAVACO-Digital Strategy + Jenny Heiland-Luedtke VHACO)

<b>Stretch:</b>
- All of the above, plus
- Product: Have at least one VA stakeholder build out a demo Campaign Landing page with available panels to provide UX/AX feedback


<b> Questions: </b>
- What FE effort will be needed to accomplish our MVP goals?  Will those resources be available (given Transformers and R&S)
