## CLP Campaign Cloning Process: 
_As far as spinning up a new CLP, itâ€™s fairly straightforward Process._

### Step 1
Go to https://prod.cms.va.gov/node/16512 and click the Clone tab (or go straight to https://prod.cms.va.gov/entity_clone/node/16512).  If you lose this link, you can find it again by filtering all content for Campaign Landing Page.
Change the Owner field to a section that the editor can access, in this case it would be Veterans Experience Office, which is in VA > OPIA

### Step 2
Change whatever required values that may already be known, such as name of campaign, audience, etc.

### Step 3 
Set the URL alias, eg  /trust

### Step 4 
Validate and disseminate when ready!
