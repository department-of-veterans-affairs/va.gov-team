# Campaign Landing Page v2 Meeting Minutes 10/8/2024


**TLDR**: We want to see CLPs used more often to direct veterans to core content, as well as reduce duplicate content when editors opt to publish outside of CLPs because they found them too restrictive or hard to use.

## Notes

**Dave**: it would be helpful to know if content published elsewhere for clp that didn't get published, and if so, what that content was (so that he could see what the delta of information was for what could have been a CLP vs what they opted to publish instead.)
	- expanding character count can be done: is that something we should do and what expansion?
  - One was denied because the editor only had ability to add one CTA in hero banner - could a second one be added in that section?
**Dave**: relaxing the requirement for any takes more effort/possibly engineering input; it's better to remove the requirement e.g. 0 primary CTA - easy to do.
**Michelle** **(?)**: maybe the number of secondary ctas need to be increased?

### Why this matters section:
	- needs expanded character count
	- they dislike having a fixed title. They think it can be insulting or resumptive. Can this be editable? Select a title?
	- They think 'Why this matters' and 'What you can do' is duplicative; choose one or the other? Work with CAIA. Possibly give them help text to describe what to use these two sections for.
	- **Dave**: Expanding cardinality for audience is easy; need to ensure FE can handle though. (Amanda: can expand to five? FE should be able to handle that but they can check)

### What you can do:
	- Promo is on backend? Help text change?
	- Needing more than 3 promo boxes, or add more than one? Use case: needs the ability to add more links to point to other resources. Multiple kinds of resources. For instance, if they want to point to multiple places e.g. learn/apply/manage. Links to specific audiences e.g caregivers, etc. - wants to cover these. Six should be enough. Are they using all the sections that could accommodate this?
	- reordering not restricted to what you can do ** (Fran) Not sure what this was about?

### Connect with us panel

- N**ote from Fran:** Conversation became fairly dynamic at this point, with input from Fran, and notetaking suffered. :)
	
### Action Items:
- [X] **Fran**: Create a ticket for Dave to do the audit
- [ ] **Dave** will do the audit, and make a list of what he can accomplish as quick-wins sans engineering resources
- [ ] **Amanda** will do an FE mockup where needed
- [ ] **Amanda**/**Dave**: Consider mapping our instructions for each field to help editors.
- [ ] **Michelle**: Will connect with Heather Santos (to get info on what she's been updating?)


### Questions: 
- **Dave**: Where does CAIA fit into the governance? Michelle has talked to Danielle. How much to they play into the CLP?
- **Dave**: Where did feedback come from? [Michelle[] VHA/OPIA/Danielle have provided feedback. and Heather Santos who has been updating existing CLPs. 
- **Dave**: Does content die? [Michelle] doesn't think so; it's created elsewhere.
