This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings


### 1. Service Design & Digital Design
A full user experience journey for VA debt resolution must account for service design in addition to the digital design component.
Participants noted they had issues outside of the debt portal.  How can we narrow the gap between these 2 streams?

>“The VA was telling me I had to speak with the Education Center, Education Center would tell me I had to speak with Debt Management. It was like ping pong. And I'm still in the situation currently. Yeah, it's not resolved at all. I remember like I would call them, and I would get hung up on. Or I would have one of the Va employees start arguing with me, it would not help the situation at all.. … But yeah, in that situation it's caused like a domino effect in my life as well or like. I'm still suffering from the consequences of not just getting laid off from work but the VA, so yeah, I don't have the greatest relationship currently in terms of like debt management with the VA which is a whole different personal thing.” -P4


### 2. Overall Comprehension & Language
**Overall Comprehension**
Overall, comprehension was excellent and participants could easily understand the UI and content/copy on each page. The terms participants were specifically asked about, “current balance” and “resolve this debt” were easily understood.


**Language Sensitivity**
Participants in this study had very clear mental models around “overpayments” and “debt”. Several participants stated that the term “overpayment” was more specific than that term “debt”.

>“I think consistency would be important rather than going back and forth. Debt just automatically has a negative connotation to it that could rub people the wrong way. They’re probably likely to associate it with credit card debt or something like that where you know, again, that's a conscientious act. If you are spending money versus an overpayment where typically you’re the downstream recipient of. –P3

One participant said it depended on the circumstances of how the debt was acquired:
>“It should probably be one or the other…the debt probably wouldn't be an overpayment if it's something like the person got sick in class and failed out of class now they have to repay that. I wouldn't consider that an overpayment,  I’d consider that as a debt for failing the class. While to me an overpayment would be like ‘we still paid you and you stopped going to school like 3 months ago.’” –P8

Several participants had very strong reactions to other language used on the debt portal.
>“I mean, the only thing that jumps out to me is the collection action. That's a little strong, which again, debt collection is a real thing, but probably softening that up a little bit would be beneficial. Especially in my case where I'm like, I didn't do it, something happened, and there was an error, you know, with my overpayment, it wasn’t anything that I did. That’s a little strong.” -P3



### 3. One thing per page: 
The way the experience is structured makes sense to Veterans, is easy to understand, learnable, and easy to navigate. Findability is also good. 
The majority of participants (6 of 9 participants) had no issues with one-thing-per-page, where they could see the break up of debt details, ways to resolve, and debt letters on different pages. Additionally, participants that were asked to complete a task at the end of the interview, navigated through the pages easily. It is also noteworthy that a full-time advanced screen reader user had no issue with one thing per page either. 
One participant felt that debt letters should be with the debt details page. At least one participant did not get to the debt letters section. 


### *Page by Page*

### 4. Overview Page
The overview page tested very well, and there were a few important mentions of possible improvements: 
- Participants thought active debts and completed debts should be separated with completed (paid) debt at the bottom of the page.
- Most participants would like it there for reference and proof/supporting evidence of having made the payment. Only 1-2 participants felt that it should not be there at all.
- Participants noticed the text near the symbols on the cards when prompted but it did not always stand out. Most did notice that the benefits offset and Treasury paths did not have the Resolve this debt link, and could hence piece together that those debts may not be actionable in the same way as the first.

### 5. Debt Details Page
For the most part, this page along with the payment history section were clear: 
- The payment history section was clearly understood by all participants.
- Current balance was easily understood.
- Not all participants understood the purpose of the information that is needed to make a payment (file number, payee number, person entitled, deduction code) until they reached the Resolve page.
- Because this use case/scenario was several months late on paying the full amount, the due date in the yellow alert box was in the past, and thus participants had a hard time pointing out the due date. 
- Several participants had strong reactions to late fees. More discovery research with SMEs can be done to fully understand how and when late fees and interest are applied to each type of overpayment debt.

>“The late fees are a little bit too high. How many people that are disabled at 100% can afford $15?” -P9


### 6. Resolve page
The resolve page was easily understood by all participants. The term “resolve” was easily understood to mean there were multiple ways to resolve their debt other than paying it. Several participants, unprompted, stated they wanted a way to dispute their debt online. 

### 7. Debt Letter Page
Many participants had not received a debt letter, or demand letter, a letter sent to a Veterans after they have not paid. Many participants understood “debt letters” as all communication VA had sent them regarding the debt including their initial notice. 
- All participants who were asked wanted debt letters available for download online. 
- Several participants felt the download links should be shown within the table on the page.
- Some reasons given for having debt letters online: in case they misplace the letter sent in the mail or it is lost in the mail, to have a record of it on their computer
- Some reasons given for how a debt letter would be used: to gain state benefits, to use in case of bankruptcy, for court cases, or wage garnishment
