This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

**Finding 1: Navigation & Findability**

- Navigation and findability were excellent: Veterans in this study could easily find information they were looking for and knew which links to click on to read more details on their bill and to resolve the bill.
  
> “I think that they were what I like to say: simple. I think if you keep things pretty simple, well thought out, not trying to overcomplicate it and be an engineer to people who are not then you'll make great pages and websites and things of that nature. Because most people run away from the Internet because of how complicated people are making it. Thinking that it's a really nice design, it might be a nice design to you, but not user friendly. So that's the biggest thing that I like to do is keep things user-friendly. So this is definitely very user-friendly. I would say.” - P16 (screen reader user)

**Finding 2: Overall Comprehension**

Comprehension was excellent overall. The copay detail page was overall well understood but could be improved. Veterans we interviewed correctly interpreted the status differences between each facility's copay bill (payable in the portal, not payable since escalated to treasury, and already paid). 

> “I like the way it's laid out. It's simple and everything you need is directly in front of you, almost the very middle of the page. Everything is blocked, so there's no bleed from one to another. ‘Your other VA debt’ that's good. ‘Need help?’, I love help desk. It looks like the majority of the stuff I would need is right here.” -P3


**Finding 3: Pending Transactions Comprehension & Desirability**
- Overall, seeing pending transactions unrelated to the bill that is owed was described as unhelpful at best and confusing at worst. 
The majority of Veterans we interviewed said it is not helpful to see this information.
2 Veterans said it would be helpful to see for budgeting purposes for the next month's statement, and the addition of a $ amount would be most helpful.
  
>  “Well, if it's not pending, and you're sending me a statement that means it's not due yet. So when you're sending me a statement you're telling me it's due, and it doesn't say on here, Hey, do you want to pay what's due, or do you wanna include what's pending as well? That's not an option for the billing, so why confuse them with it on?” -P5

**Finding 4: Comprehension of Crucial Information**
- The information in the yellow alert component was understandable by most participants and the due date was findable by almost everyone. The copay details section after the yellow alert caused confusion because it referenced activity outside of the current month.
  
> “That little triangle gets your attention right off. Now, there's nothing like that on the bills that I receive. So I like realizing that, ‘Oh, wait a minute, I got to deal with this by the 30th or whatever.’” -P3

**Finding 5: Service design**
- Participants were able to easily find and understand the resolve page and all of the options available to them. Participants who had not used the debt portal before were not aware of all of the ways they could resolve their bill, including requesting financial help. There is room for improvement on raising awareness to Veterans who receive copays and do not access the debt portal that financial help is available to them.

>”I saw it on the bill, the actual bill, and I didn't understand why, you know, I did not have to pay previously for the doctor. And now I did, and honestly, what it's caused me to do is not want to go to the VA for my health care, and I've actually not gone because I didn't want to incur any more expenses. And I started, my husband is disabled, so I found out this year that I actually could utilize the Medicaid, so I switched a few of my medicines to picking them up from Medicaid. But now I don't know what my situation will be and you know, not getting the medicine that I need, because I didn't want to incur any more bills. Because I honestly didn’t understand how it worked.” -P10

> “You know what I did. I just made it my own. I just send what I could send. I didn't bother, you know, I didn't know I could make a compromise offer or repayment plan. I just sent what I had available, and wait until the next time…
I did not know they were available. I didn't know you could dispute them. I never, never, actually, because I normally kind of know my bills and stuff, have an idea what to expect.  I've never had a cause for a waiver or a compromise, but a repayment plan back in the past would have been really nice. I'm glad that's there. ‘Request help for future health care’, ‘Hardship determination’. That's interesting. And I think we've got Vets that could use that, I would put money on it actually.” -P3
