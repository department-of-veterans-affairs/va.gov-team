# Conversation Guide for Debt Resolution Team, VHA Debt Portal Payment History, September 2024

## Getting to know you (10 minutes)

5-7 minutes


Welcome!

  

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

  

How are you today?

  

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

  

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

  

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand and resolve your copay bills.

  

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

  

Next, I want to explain my role better.

  

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

  

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

  

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us.

  

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

  

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? *Yes.

  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  

**Optional:**

  

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? *I don’t want to be shared on that.

  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image.

  

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

  

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? *I don’t want to be shared on that.

  

Do you have any questions for me?

  

Just want to ensure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today?

  

**START INTERVIEW**

  

3-5 minutes

  

**[Rapport building]**

  

We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

  

What's your favorite thing about Fall? * I like the leaves changing. 

  

Thank you for sharing! (personalize response)

## [VA copay bill workflow] (5 minutes)

  

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

  

Today I will be sharing a portal to help with VA copay bills.

  

Before I share the prototype, I’d like to hear about your experience paying for VA copay bills. Can you please walk me through what this has looked like for you in the past, from the moment you receive a VA healthcare service or a prescription through VA, to the moment you pay for that service copay or prescription copay bill. [establish baseline and common experiences to inform mental models] *I just got the notice in the mail that I owed and there was a link where I can pay and that is were I went and was able to pay. 
*I saw a portal before hand. 
*It was straightforward for me. 

  

-   Some things to consider asking:
-  How does the VA clinic or Medical Center inform you of your copay?
    
-   What options does it give you to pay?
    
-   Have they ever mentioned a portal to pay your copay?
    
-   How often do you use it?
    
-   When was the last time you viewed it?
    

## [Prototype] (5 minutes)

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

  

-   You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect.
    
-   Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
    
-   This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
    
-   In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback.
    
-   Please comment on what is clear and unclear.
    

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

## Copay Bills Overview (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

-   How understandable are the copay summary page, detail page, and resolve page?
-   Can participants find what they are looking for?
-   Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are? (pay, request help, dispute the debt)
-   What elements on the page draw their attention? What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable?
-   Do participants understand the callouts that indicate the copay bill has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    
**Conversation Guide Questions**

-   What are your initial impressions? * It looks like this guy has three bills. 

-   What draws your attention the most on this page?
    
-   What can you tell me about the copay cards you see on this page? *Theres two triangles that indicates he has a balance and he can review the details and resolve the bill. But he needs to call at the Hidden River clinic because he’s in debt. It was sent to the US department of treasury. 

Success criteria:

- Only one of copays is payable in the portal * it looks like you can pay the US Veterans Tampa Florida. 
- One of the copays has been sent to the US Department of the Treasury
- One of the copays has been paid
  
> [Partial Pass] Participant mentions only 2 of the 3

> [Fail] Participant does not notice the difference between these 3 copay bills


-   What copays are payable?


Success criteria:

> [Pass] The James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital - Tampa copay bill

> [Partial Pass] Takes more than 30 seconds to notice

> [Fail] Participant does not notice

    
-   What does "current balance" mean to you? * That it is not overdue. Usually the current balance may increase if you’re late. 

Success criteria:

-   What link would you click on to find out more information about the James A Haley copay bill? *It’s a prescription for Benadryl and then he saw the doctor. This is for all visits. 
* I think it’s a little confusing because it’s a little wordy and a lot going on here. 
*I don’t remember clicking that many times and I only had the one appointment there. On this bill, it’s showing appoints for October, and September. Maybe if they just had one per month.

> [Fail] Incorrect answer

  
Success criteria: [add]

## Copay Bill Detail page (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

Goal 2: To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.
Goal 3: To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models.

  
**FIRST IMPRESSIONS (What do they notice and what stands out?)**


-   What stands out to you on this page?


**COMPREHENSION (Payment activity)**

-   What can you tell me about the due date for this copay bill?  *It says it's due October 30th.
Success criteria:
> [pass] It is due on Oct 30, 2024(notice callout)
> [fail] don’t see the due date


-   Based on what you see here, what does the information on this page tell you about your copay balance and payment activity?
    
Success criteria:
> [pass]  Participant can correctly interpret these numbers/amounts due which would allow them to understand the charges and amounts due
- Original amount was $40
- $5 of late fees 
- Payment of $45 was made
- I’ve since received new charges that add up to $50

> [partial pass] Participant seems to have an understanding, but there are gaps in their understanding

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 
    

  **PREFERENCE** 
  
-   After you’ve paid your bill, when would you expect it to show up here? *After you pay it. It should show that it was paid there. 

    
-   After you’ve visited a VA medical center, when would you expect it to show up here? *At the end of the business day. Because that is when you have to have your charges closed as a provider. I think that is where it gets lost too because I deal with the VA and they have days and days to add this to their notes. 
*It took years and years, I kept getting denied. I think the Pact Act helped me. 
    
  
**COMPREHENSION (Pending transactions)**

-   What is the difference between the two tables (sections) you see on this page? One looks like it’s a previous statement and the other a current statement. 
*If it’s not pending it doesn’t mean it's due but if you are sending me a statement it’s because it's due. 
    
Success criteria:

> [pass] Participant understands that the Current statement table describes the most recent statement and is fixed. They also understand that the Activity since last statement table describes pending transactions (not finalized). 

> [partial pass] Participant has some degree of understanding, but does not fully understand the difference between them

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 

  
-   How do you feel about seeing pending transactions?
    

	- What does “Activity since last statement” mean to you?
    
	- Would it be helpful to see pending transactions? Why or why not?
  
  

**DESIRABILITY & HELPFULNESS (Copay details)**

  I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Prescription Copay details.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the prescription copays? *As a provider I know what it means but in layman's terms, they won't know. 
*It doesn’t change anything; this is a bill. It won't change anything. 

    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why?
    

-   I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Outpatient Care Copay details.
    
	-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the outpatient care copays? *I think that is good. 
*It doesn’t bother me. Some people may get a little offensive with having their diagnosis with that. 
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary? *I think that its good that the links are there and the links to their previous bills. 

	- Why? 

##   Resolve your copay bill page (10 minutes)
*You have a lot of options to pay it. You also have the pay.gov button and have the arrow to pay it, that’s helpful. 

  

-   What are some of the options you see on this page to address and resolve this copay bill? *Looks like they can pay by phone, or mail it. It gives the address or pay in person at the VA in the cashier's office. Also, options if you need help paying the bill. I knew there was financial help available if you needed it. 

Success criteria:
> [pass] Participant sees they can pay online, by phone, by mail, in person, request financial help, request help for future health care, and dispute the debt.

> [partial pass] Participant notices some of the options, but not all

> [fail] Participant is unsure/does not understand


  -   Given the situation you are in now, which option would you choose and why? * I would pay it online to get it done. 

    

  

-   After reviewing the copay details page and the resolve your copay bill page, what are your thoughts on having these types of information on separate pages? * I think it would be better to have it on one page and pay now would be better. 

    


**MENTAL MODELS**

  

-   If you have visited this portal in the past, did you know there are other pages to address other money you might owe to the VA, such as VBA overpayment debt?
    

	-   If not, briefly tell them about it
    
-   How do you feel about having your medical copay bills in the same place as other types of bills or debt that need to be paid to the VA?
    
-   Why do you feel that way? *This one shows that you have two copay bills and two outstanding debts and that is confusing because people won't understand that a bill means you still have time to pay and debt is past due. 
*Maybe, current balance due or past balance due.
*I’m not a fan. Maybe if you did a current balance or overdue balance. A trigger word that is not the same. 
*That would be fine. I think the easier access and less they have to do research it, the more you can collect. The less steps involved the more likely they can comply. 
    
    

## Post Task Questions (5 minutes)

-   What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed today? *Easy to access, easy for me to go through. 
*The links actually went to the page. 

    
-   Was there any information missing?
    
-   What would you change, if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear? *I think we talked about all the changes that I would make. 
    

  

-   We want to know your thoughts on how clear the portal is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would be able to understand the information in the portal, and -make a payment or ask for help.
   
  

	-   On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not clear at all, and 5 being very clear, how clear was the portal? * About a 3. Because of some of the wording. For me I could understand it but for most , they would not. 
*Making it accessible and having that button to make payment. 

    

  

	-   Why did you rate it a (rating)?
    

  

-   We have something called a blue sky thinking question. In this question, we encourage you to think about if sky were the limit and you could design any experience that would help you receive, understand, and resolve your copay bills, what would that look like? *Knowing what I owe and being able to click on and pay it. That would be idea for me. Then later on if I wanted to go back and I look at the PDF. Very simplistic. 
    

  

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

  

-   Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this?
    

  

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? *I don’t think so. 
    

  

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
