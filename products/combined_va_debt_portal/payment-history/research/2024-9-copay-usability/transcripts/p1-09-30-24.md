## Getting to know you (10 minutes)

5-7 minutes


Welcome!

  

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

  

How are you today? *Fine, it’s nine o'clock here. Just getting started. 

  

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

  

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission] * Yes.

  

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand and resolve your copay bills.

  

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

  

Next, I want to explain my role better.

  

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

  

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

  

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us.

  

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

  

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? *Yes.

  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  

**Optional:**

  

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? *Yes.

  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image.

  

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

  

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? *Yes.

  

Do you have any questions for me?

  

Just want to ensure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today?

  

**START INTERVIEW**

  

3-5 minutes

  

**[Rapport building]**

  

We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

  

What's your favorite thing about Fall? *That it is going to start cooling down here in Vegas and it’s really hot. 

  

Thank you for sharing! (personalize response)

## [VA copay bill workflow] (5 minutes)

  

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

  

Today I will be sharing a portal to help with VA copay bills.

  

Before I share the prototype, I’d like to hear about your experience paying for VA copay bills. Can you please walk me through what this has looked like for you in the past, from the moment you receive a VA healthcare service or a prescription through VA, to the moment you pay for that service copay or prescription copay bill. [establish baseline and common experiences to inform mental models] *Usually all my medications come in the mail. I never pick it at the hospital. I get the copay bills by mail which I hate. I don’t like paper. It tells me everything I have ordered or not ordered. I have so many in there that I can't remember if I got those or not. I get the paper in the mail and every time I want to pay my bill and I don’t have my paper, I can't pay it because it asks for my account number, 4 letters of my last name. Now, I log in and I see my bill there, I have to log in. I do it on that site, I don’t trust the receipt. All my medical is on the VA. My husband has an HSA and I want my copays to go through them eventually and get them paid through them. 
*It’s not the typical receipt you’ll see. You have to look at the statement and marry the two and  confirm and look at the confirmation number. It doesn’t say anything else. I wish it was just one file and here are the three medications you pay for. 
*It’s usually the same, it’s just so long and I can’t remember it and can’t pay. I recently learned I can login and pay it that way.
*On the bill in the mail, the statement that comes to me that mentions I have to pay. It’s the only place I can find it. I had to call the center to get it last time. 
* Now, yes. In the past, I would go to the VA site and it was the hardest thing to find it there. 

  

-   Some things to consider asking: 
* I like that it ask me how much and from where. People like me don’t go anywhere but my hospital or primary. My memory is really bad and I don’t know what it will say.  I have no idea what I pay for anymore at this point. Something like this scares me because I don’t know if I had a ton of these and I’d be scared if this said, Department of Treasury. I wouldn’t want to see the one has been paid. There’s nothing wrong with it, but I don’t see to see it. I don’t know what overpayment is, I wouldn’t click on it. I would like to see what other debt is.
*It’s good but I don’t like, if it’s medical, I think I would have to go to the medical area. It’s easy to find the central place for all of your financial stuff, it would be fine. Or if it was on the VA.gov site and easy to find it would be fine instead of clicking everything. A central place would be good. 
* it would be nice to have everything in one page and I just go through it unless it was overwhelmingly long for some reason, it can be broken down. When you land on the VA website, you can just see it, I always have to find it and it’s always so hard. I would click review details. 
-  How does the VA clinic or Medical Center inform you of your copay? 
    
-   What options does it give you to pay?
    
-   Have they ever mentioned a portal to pay your copay?
    
-   How often do you use it?
    
-   When was the last time you viewed it?
    

## [Prototype] (5 minutes)

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know: 

  

-   You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect.
    
-   Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
    
-   This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
    
-   In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback. 
    
-   Please comment on what is clear and unclear.
    

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

## Copay Bill Detail page (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

Goal 2: To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.
Goal 3: To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models.

  
**FIRST IMPRESSIONS (What do they notice and what stands out?)**


-   What stands out to you on this page?


**COMPREHENSION (Payment activity)**

-   What can you tell me about the due date for this copay bill? *The only place is here and that just gets lost. I want to see what my copay is, I don’t care about these here. I want to know, how much, when. I don’t need to see all that is information because I have so many things. I clicked specially for this $50 and its due by this time and I’m here to pay and  I want to see what is tied to the $50. 
*Just that section. I clicked on it to pay $50, I don’t want to see the $45, $5. The copay details is confusing to me. 
*I thought this is what I paid before, now that I see this, I know my due date is October, but it would be nice to see everything from September. Now, I have to read it again. I think it’s useless if it’s not part of the bill. 
*It’s really hard to enter your account number, I wish I could just pay it here (pay.gov). I wish this was at the top ( helpful request).  All I see here is Pay. 

Success criteria:
> [pass] It is due on Oct 30, 2024(notice callout)
> [fail] don’t see the due date


-   Based on what you see here, what does the information on this page tell you about your copay balance and payment activity?
    
Success criteria:
> [pass]  Participant can correctly interpret these numbers/amounts due that would allow them to understand the charges and amounts due
- Original amount was $40
- $5 of late fees 
- Payment of $45 was made
- I’ve since received new charges that add up to $50

> [partial pass] Participant seems to have an understanding, but there are gaps in their understanding

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 
    

  **PREFERENCE** 
  
-   After you’ve paid your bill, when would you expect it to show up here?
    
-   After you’ve visited a VA medical center, when would you expect it to show up here?
    
  
**COMPREHENSION (Pending transactions)**

-   What is the difference between the two tables (sections) you see on this page?
    
Success criteria:

> [pass] Participant understands that the Current statement table describes the most recent statement and is fixed. They also understand that the Activity since last statement table describes pending transactions (not finalized). 

> [partial pass] Participant has some degree of understanding, but does not fully understand the difference between them

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 

  
-   How do you feel about seeing pending transactions?
    

	- What does “Activity since last statement” mean to you?
    
	- Would it be helpful to see pending transactions? Why or why not?
  
  

**DESIRABILITY & HELPFULNESS (Copay details)**

  I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Prescription Copay details.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the prescription copays?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why?
    

-   I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Outpatient Care Copay details.
    
	-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the outpatient care copays?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why? 

##   Resolve your copay bill page (10 minutes)

  

-   What are some of the options you see on this page to address and resolve this copay bill? * There is no statement, all I need is the account number, and I want the payment stub. I can download and print it but I don’t see that here. I would close the screen and do this later. 
    

Success criteria:
> [pass] Participant sees they can pay online, by phone, by mail, in person, request financial help, request help for future health care, and dispute the debt. *Payment plans, compromise, waiver. I guess this is not my copay, and then dispute and if all fails, call them. 

> [partial pass] Participant notices some of the options, but not all

> [fail] Participant is unsure/does not understand


  

-   Given the situation you are in now, which option would you choose and why? * I know I have to go to pay.gov and press this. 
    

  

-   After reviewing the copay details page and the resolve your copay bill page, what are your thoughts on having these types of information on separate pages? *I’d rather have a button that says pay and details. 
    


**MENTAL MODELS**

  

-   If you have visited this portal in the past, did you know there are other pages to address other money you might owe to the VA, such as VBA overpayment debt?
    

	-   If not, briefly tell them about it
    
-   How do you feel about having your medical copay bills in the same place as other types of bills or debt that need to be paid to the VA? *Would be nice to have all those broken up here. Maybe a table that tell you what copay bills. 
*Copay, we all know what that is maybe it should say medical bill. 
    
-   Why do you feel that way?
    
    

## Post Task Questions (5 minutes)

-   What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed today? * Too many pages. I just want to see them in the center. 
More, but easier to see in the box. 
    
-   Was there any information missing? *I don’t know if there is anything missing. 
    
-   What would you change, if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?
    

  

-   We want to know your thoughts on how clear the portal is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would be able to understand the information in the portal, and -make a payment or ask for help.
    

  

	-   On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not clear at all, and 5 being very clear, how clear was the portal?
    *It was clear, like a 4. Do you want to pay, go look at pay and help. If I want to pay, I just want to pay. 

  

	-   Why did you rate it a (rating)?
    

  

-   We have something called a blue sky thinking question. In this question, we encourage you to think about if sky were the limit and you could design any experience that would help you receive, understand, and resolve your copay bills, what would that look like? * I think it was just front page and click on and know what you are late on and even the one where you can call the Department of Treasury or make it red. Or just gets lost in the shuffle. 
    

  

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

  

-   Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? * Yes.
    

  

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? *No. 
    

  

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
