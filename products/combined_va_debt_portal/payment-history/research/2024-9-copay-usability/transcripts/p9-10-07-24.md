# Conversation Guide for Debt Resolution Team, VHA Debt Portal Payment History, September 2024

## Getting to know you (10 minutes)

5-7 minutes


Welcome!

  

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

  

How are you today?

  

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

  

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

  

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand and resolve your copay bills.

  

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

  

Next, I want to explain my role better.

  

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

  

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

  

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us.

  

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

  

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? *Absolutely. 

  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  

**Optional:**

  

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? *Yes.

  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image.

  

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

  

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

  

Do you have any questions for me?* None.

  

Just want to ensure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today?

  

**START INTERVIEW**

  

3-5 minutes

  

**[Rapport building]**

  

We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

  

What's your favorite thing about Fall? *Fall was just a change of the season, especially New England. We call it Indian summer, it’s warm during the day and gets cool at night. Just warm memories. 

  

Thank you for sharing! (personalize response)

## [VA copay bill workflow] (5 minutes)

  

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

  

Today I will be sharing a portal to help with VA copay bills.

  

Before I share the prototype, I’d like to hear about your experience paying for VA copay bills. Can you please walk me through what this has looked like for you in the past, from the moment you receive a VA healthcare service or a prescription through VA, to the moment you pay for that service copay or prescription copay bill. [establish baseline and common experiences to inform mental models] *I want to compliment the VA. My experience with the VA is positive. I’m constantly on VA.gov. I use the VA.gov extensively. It will say if you have any pass due bills, if it’s due, pay online or you can snail mail. I only pay for one prescription. It’s a low dose of my blood pressure medicine.
*It’ s never past due, it’s a minimal amount. But the system is there, lab work. I have been using probably since it’s initiation, years and years ago. 
*I prefer to pay it online.
  

-   Some things to consider asking:
-  How does the VA clinic or Medical Center inform you of your copay?
    
-   What options does it give you to pay?
    
-   Have they ever mentioned a portal to pay your copay?
    
-   How often do you use it?
    
-   When was the last time you viewed it?
    

## [Prototype] (5 minutes)

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

  

-   You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect.
    
-   Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
    
-   This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
    
-   In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback.
    
-   Please comment on what is clear and unclear.
    

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

## Copay Bills Overview (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

-   How understandable are the copay summary page, detail page, and resolve page?
-   Can participants find what they are looking for?
-   Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are? (pay, request help, dispute the debt)
-   What elements on the page draw their attention? What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable?
-   Do participants understand the callouts that indicate the copay bill has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    
**Conversation Guide Questions**

-   What are your initial impressions? *Pretty simple. You can go further, I would want to view that overpayment because the VA has my money. I would want to view how much overpayment I had. I have a current balance of $50 and $200, I would want to see if I have an overpayment, I would want to use that to pay my current balance. I don’t see, if I click ASK VA would I see and AI or person?  If I click ASK VA, can I just type my question. If I can get my questioned answered before giving a call, that would be beneficial. I would review the details fist and resolve it online and my last resort would be to call. 
*If I have an overpayment and I have a balance, just apply it to my balance, if you can. 
*No I have not had an overpayment. 
* I don’t know if they text as a reminder of a bill coming up. I know you use reminders for prescriptions but I don’t know if you do it for billing. Texting is basically reminders and VA does it for appointments, why not billing as well. 

-   What draws your attention the most on this page?
    
-   What can you tell me about the copay cards you see on this page? *Two have a balance and one doesn’t. The zero balance the third one, you don’t see a contact- Department of Treasury. You don’t see resolve that bill only review details. One give more opportunities to reseolve the issue than the other one. You need uniformity, they should have the same uniform options or non options in this case for all three. 
* You cant use three but number one has resolve this bill but no contact information like in box 2. Give Veterans all the available abilities to resolve their payments. I would pick one to resolve this bill. It’s not confusing to me because I can get around it but for older or disabled Veterans, it would be confusing. They are used to seeing that 1-800 number. Make it more uniform. 
Success criteria:

> [Pass] Participant mentions:

- Only one of copays is payable in the portal
- One of the copays has been sent to the US Department of the Treasury
- One of the copays has been paid
  
> [Partial Pass] Participant mentions only 2 of the 3

> [Fail] Participant does not notice the difference between these 3 copay bills


-   What copays are payable?


Success criteria:

> [Pass] The James A. Haley Veterans’ Hospital - Tampa copay bill

> [Partial Pass] Takes more than 30 seconds to notice

> [Fail] Participant does not notice

    
-   What does "current balance" mean to you? * What the VA is saying that I owe for that visit. 
*Another thing is you can go in and see everything you paid because people can use it on their taxes. 

Success criteria:

> [Pass] The amount I have to pay *

> [Fail] Doesn’t define it correctly



-   How do you feel about this wording? Is there a different word or words you would use?
    
-   What do the small icons on the left of the text in the boxes tell you? (exclamation point, checkmark)
    

Success criteria:

> -   Status of the debt (pass)
    
> -   They notice the only with further prompting (partial pass)
    
> -   They don’t notice (fail)
    
 
-   Any information missing that you’d like to see?


-   What link would you click on to find out more information about the James A Haley copay bill? *Review details. 
*There’s a lot of information. I can understand it but the older Vets, there is no telephone number. They need to be able to talk to someone. You have this pay you balance, request help or dispute bill but no telephone number and this math is off on this bill. The charges seem a little confusing. But I look down here in activity, the math here doesn’t seem correct when I’m adding things up seems like an error. 
*I wouldn’t go current up front; I would do it in chronicle order and do reverse. I would have to call the VA and have them explain the charges and have them tell me why I have a late fee and the math doesn’t add up. 
* I believe it would be October 1st but it doesn’t say due date. It’s confusing. There is no amount right here. Now I can go to the current statement and find out due date and date of service. 

Success criteria:

> [Pass] “Review Details”

> [Fail] Incorrect answer

  
Success criteria: [add]
    
-   If you pay off a copay bill completely, would you like to see it here for your reference, or would you like to not see it here at all?
    

## Copay Bill Detail page (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

Goal 2: To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.
Goal 3: To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models.

  
**FIRST IMPRESSIONS (What do they notice and what stands out?)**


-   What stands out to you on this page?


**COMPREHENSION (Payment activity)**

-   What can you tell me about the due date for this copay bill? 

Success criteria:
> [pass] It is due on Oct 30, 2024(notice callout)
> [fail] don’t see the due date


-   Based on what you see here, what does the information on this page tell you about your copay balance and payment activity?
    
Success criteria:
> [pass]  Participant can correctly interpret these numbers/amounts due that would allow them to understand the charges and amounts due
- Original amount was $40

> [partial pass] Participant seems to have an understanding, but there are gaps in their understanding

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 
    

  **PREFERENCE** 
  
-   After you’ve paid your bill, when would you expect it to show up here? *Right away. But 24 hours maybe too. 
    
-   After you’ve visited a VA medical center, when would you expect it to show up here? *I would say immediately if possible or within 24 hours. 
    
  
**COMPREHENSION (Pending transactions)**

-   What is the difference between the two tables (sections) you see on this page?
    
Success criteria:

> [pass] Participant understands that the Current statement table describes the most recent statement and is fixed. They also understand that the Activity since last statement table describes pending transactions (not finalized). 

> [partial pass] Participant has some degree of understanding, but does not fully understand the difference between them

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 

  
-   How do you feel about seeing pending transactions?
    

	- What does “Activity since last statement” mean to you?
    
	- Would it be helpful to see pending transactions? Why or why not?
  
  

**DESIRABILITY & HELPFULNESS (Copay details)**

  I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Prescription Copay details.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the prescription copays? *We don’t know it’s a cop-pay we are assuming because it doesn’t say co-pay or amount due. Just assuming. That’s my answer. 
*Late fee, $5 shouldn’t that have a negative next to the $5? 
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why?
    

-   I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Outpatient Care Copay details.
    
	-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the outpatient care copays? *We don’t have to have the doctors name on here, it’ s a matter of billing. The Hypertension, I think the patient was there for high blood pressure and exam from the doctor. 
*People could assume if it’s owed. I guess it’s okay where it is. 
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why? 

##   Resolve your copay bill page (10 minutes)

  

-   What are some of the options you see on this page to address and resolve this copay bill? *A lot of useful information. Many different ways to pay. 
*Request help to pay current bill, I hope there is a number to call. 
*Where is the 1888, if I wanted to call someone but not pay by phone. I see a number at the end but that’s all the way at the end here. 
    

Success criteria:
> [pass] Participant sees they can pay online, by phone, by mail, in person, request financial help, request help for future health care, and dispute the debt.

> [partial pass] Participant notices some of the options, but not all

> [fail] Participant is unsure/does not understand


  

-   Given the situation you are in now, which option would you choose and why? 
    

  

-   After reviewing the copay details page and the resolve your copay bill page, what are your thoughts on having these types of information on separate pages?
* I know the current statement is the total of all. The current statement could be a history of 30 days or beyond. 
*Why even say that, you’re saying that all these are copays, why not have an amount owed because you have everything else. 
*If it has not been finalized, why is there and it’s confusing. Why say I have a co-pay but no amount. 


**MENTAL MODELS**

  

-   If you have visited this portal in the past, did you know there are other pages to address other money you might owe to the VA, such as VBA overpayment debt? *You’re giving me all the option on how to pay, where it says How to request for help to pay can be on another page. I would add on another page or link because it’s two separate things. 
* I can’t say if I have seen it before. I’m just glad that the service is available. 

    

	-   If not, briefly tell them about it
    
-   How do you feel about having your medical copay bills in the same place as other types of bills or debt that need to be paid to the VA? *$250 for two copay bills, I know I can click on it and how to resolve it, in this case, it’s not a problem. It’s pretty simple, you have two outstanding debts, click on them and find out what they are. 
*Debt and debt overview, what does that mean? All you are saying $25O0 for copay bills, is that debt or is that a copay bill for two bills or current bills, late, or credit. Play on words. Be more specific there. 
*Then $350 for outstanding debts, what does that mean. 
    
-   Why do you feel that way?
    
    

## Post Task Questions (5 minutes)

-   What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed today? *It was good. 
    
-   Was there any information missing? *What about identifiable information. Like if my name was on here. If you go into the VA.gov, your name can be right up here in certain pages. There is another Veteran with the same last name and last 4 digits of my social security number, he’s 90 something years old and if I got his lab results, we are two different people. The fact that just having your name up there. 
    
-   What would you change, if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?
    

  

-   We want to know your thoughts on how clear the portal is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would be able to understand the information in the portal, and -make a payment or ask for help.
    

  

	-   On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not clear at all, and 5 being very clear, how clear was the portal? *A 5. I’m a big fan. 
    

  

	-   Why did you rate it a (rating)?
    

  

-   We have something called a blue sky thinking question. In this question, we encourage you to think about if sky were the limit and you could design any experience that would help you receive, understand, and resolve your copay bills, what would that look like?
    

  

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

  

-   Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? *Yes.
    

  

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? *No.
    

  

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

[End of session]

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
