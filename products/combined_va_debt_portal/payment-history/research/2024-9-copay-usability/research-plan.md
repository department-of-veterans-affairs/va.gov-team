# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, VHA Debt Portal payment history, September - October 2024
  

## Background

Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:

-   What problem is your product trying to solve?
    
-   Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
    
-   What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
    

#### [Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/payment-history/initiative-brief.md)


This usability and comprehension study builds on knowledge and findings from research in the July 2024 VBA payment history study. These two parallel debt portal paths (VBA and VHA) should be consistent in their information architecture for the use case of Veterans who will utilize both. The information contained within them differs in so far as the type of debt/bills and ways of resolving.

  

Veterans that have VBA debt and Veterans that have VA medical debt will have different mental models and needs. Understanding the mental models of Veterans that have isolated or recurring health needs and are required to pay VHA copays will be important.

  

Moreover, we can assume that some Veterans with higher reliance on VA health services may be part of more vulnerable groups (Veterans that have complex medical needs or multiple chronic health conditions, and mental health conditions, which might affect their experiences with usability and comprehension). Although, we are not certain whether these Veterans will be paying copays (this is still an open question we have). We expect that by talking with Veterans in the situation of paying VHA copays, we will be able to have a better understanding of who they are, their situations, and their needs.

  

We expect that usability and comprehension should test well, based on findings from the VBA study.

  

In terms of the background of the VHA payment history initiative, we see pain points that have surfaced in Medallia feedback and usability studies:

  

-   As of May 2024, Veterans do not receive timely confirmation of payments made on the debt portal, resulting in confusion, frustration, and possibly mistrust.
    
-   Veterans may not see their payment confirmation reflected in the debt portal for months.
    
-  They can’t revisit the debt portal to review this payment history
    
-   They have to wait for the next statement a month later to see their payment
    
-   Inconsistent messaging about payments made can be a distressing experience for Veterans seeking to resolve and address their debt.
    
-   Details about VHA medical copays are in the copay statement page which is often difficult to find.

## Why

-   The payment history data messaging discrepancy is due to the payment history being batched on a monthly basis, resulting in untimely information on the debt portal.
    
-   Veterans rely on consistent messaging across the different channels of official communication with VA (email, debt portal, call center) to have confidence that their payments went through. Inconsistencies can reinforce mistrust of VA.
    

## How

Payment history improvements support the following:

-   All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
    
-   Veterans share more positive feedback on Medallia.
    

## OCTO Priorities

 Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

-    Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.
    
-   Key Result 2: Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%.
    
-   Key Result 3: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
    
-   Key Result 4: No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.
    

### Objective 2: Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.

-   Key Result 1: Our platforms hit the “elite” level (as defined by DORA) on Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, and Time to Restore Service.
    
-   Key Result 2: Our platforms measure and improve the satisfaction of their internal users.
    
-   Key Result 3: Our platforms power twice as many interactions compared to last year.
    

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

-   ### Balancing finances
    
-   ### Managing primary care and chronic health issues
    
-   ### Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health
    
-   ### Managing my declining health
    

There are multiple intersecting factors that interact and can influence a Veteran’s financial situation, which can then impact their ability to address any VA debt and avoid more serious consequences. VA benefits overpayments and some types of VA copay debt can come out of the blue and be unrelated to personal decisions or actions. However the ability to repay them is influenced by a Veteran’s personal financial situation, the stage they are on along the Veteran journey, and levels of personal financial decision making, motivation, and agency. Research shows that the transition between getting out and starting up can be an especially vulnerable time, with a survey of Veterans showing that 35% had trouble paying bills in their first few years after ending military service (Pew Research Center).

## Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?

Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### 1.  To understand usability (findability and navigation) and comprehension of the revised information architecture of the copay path of the debt portal.
   
- Copay summary page,

- Copay detail page along with payment history,

- Resolution page

  

### 2.  To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.
  
  - How clear is the transaction information on the Copay Details page?

- Are Veterans interested in seeing pending transactions? Why or why not?

-   How do Veterans perceive pending transactions? Does it fit within their mental models, or does it cause confusion?
    


Do participants understand:

-   When their bill is due?
    
-   How much is currently due?
    
-   Copay statuses and icons
    

  

### 3.  To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models.
    

- What information is necessary on doctor visit summaries, and prescription medication summaries?

- Do Veterans have concerns about the security and privacy of their PHI?

- What are Veterans' mental models about VHA copay billing?


### Outcome

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

-   This research will allow us to validate and/or make improvements to the VHA payment history prototype we have created in Codepen before development begins.
    
-   Confirm the updated AI is easy to navigate and participants are able to find information and resolve their bill.    

-   Confirm that bill details are understandable (ex: due date, amount due)
    
-   Determine whether displaying pending charges is a desirable feature.

-   Determine the type of description data participants would like to see on their copay statements.
    
-   After this study, we will release key updates in iterative cycles.
    

This research will allow us to evaluate the payment history designs and validate them before or while they are being developed. We can also make changes as needed.

-   The payment history additions to the debt portal will result in a significant improvement in the user experience of Veterans in the process of managing or resolving their VA copay bills.

- Veterans can rely on consistent messaging across the different channels of official communication with VA (email, debt portal, VHA call center) to have confidence that their payments went through.
 
    
-   *Veterans can understand where the copay bill(s) originate from and are less likely to call for additional details, saving time for the Veteran and the Call Centers.* 
    
-   *Veterans get accurate and timely financial information (payments made) and are less likely to make duplicate payments.* 

-   Copay transaction details for prescriptions and doctor visits will be easier to scan and understand.

## Research questions

Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:

-   What will I do with what I learn from this question?
    
-   Does this question serve the goals of my study?
    
-   Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)
    
### Goal 1: To understand usability (findability and navigation) and comprehension of the revised information architecture of the copay path of the debt portal.

  

1.  How understandable are the copay summary page, detail page, and resolve page?
    
2.  Can participants find what they are looking for?
    
3.  Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are? (pay, request help, dispute the debt)
    
4.  What elements on the page draw their attention? What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable?
    
5.  Do Veterans understand the callouts that indicate the copay bill has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    
### Goal 2: To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.

6.  Do participants understand:
    

-   When their bill is due?
    
-   How much is currently due?
    
-   Copay statuses and icons
    

7.  How clear is the transaction information on the Copay Details page?
    - Can participants define and/or understand the different transaction fields (new charges, previous balance, payments received, date of last payment, next payment due, total late fees/interests)?
    
9. Are Veterans interested in seeing pending transactions?
    -  How do Veterans perceive pending transactions? Does it fit within their mental models, or does it cause confusion?
    
  

### Goal 3: To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models. Additionally, understand Veterans' mental models about VA copay billing in general. 


9.  What information is necessary on doctor visit summaries, and prescription medication summaries?
	-  Do Veterans have concerns about the security and privacy of their PHI?
	- What are Veterans' mental models about VHA copay billing?


10. What are Veterans perceptions of VA copay billing and VBA overpayment debt being housed under one experience? 
	- Does it trigger negative feelings? (associating receiving medical copay bills as "debt")
	- Do they seem unrelated to Veterans? 
	- What is a better conceptual model for this hub? 


## Hypotheses
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

*Hypothesis 1:* 

#### The revised debt portal IA (with the addition of a copay detail page and surfacing of statement data sooner) will be easy to understand. Veterans will be able to easily navigate between pages, review their statements, and resolve their copay bills. 

*Hypothesis 2:*
  
#### VHA payment history (including activity since the last statement and current statement data) displayed on the copay detail page will be easy to understand.  Medical visit copay and prescription copay details will also be easy to understand and be helpful to see. 

-   Payment history was easy to comprehend in the VBA payment history study. Hence, we expect that payment history (current balance amount, previous balance, new charges, payments received, total feels/interest, payment due date) will be easy to understand for the Veteran in the VHA study as well.
    
-  We further hypothesize that details provided for medical visit copays and prescription copays will be easy to understand and provide the right amount of detail. Some participants may express concern about their PHI.
 
 
*Hypothesis 3:* 

#### The addition of pending copay charges will be beneficial to Veterans. 

-  A year’s worth of Medallia data reveals that Veterans want to see current balances to make informed budgeting decisions. We expect that participants will find it helpful to view pending charges. Participants will understand that these transactions are pending and have not been finalized.
    
-   Participants will differentiate the current statement section from the activity since the last statement (pending) section.

*Hypothesis 4:* 

#### Veterans will be able to differentiate between copay bills that are payable, receiving a benefit offset, and sent to the Department of Treasury. 

-   The VBA payment history study revealed that participants were able to deduce that some VA debts are payable on the debt portal, while others are not (benefits offsets and Department of Treasury). We believe this information will be clear to participants for the VHA copay path as well.

####  We would like to request a kick off call with Perigean the week of 9/23.

#### We would like Perigean to help take notes during the interviews.

## Recruitment approach

Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

-  Recruiting a diverse sample of 8-12 Veterans
    
-   Higher quotas: Veterans that have a cognitive consideration

- Inclusion is prioritized. We seek to over-recruit underrepresented groups that are often underrecruited in research.

- Moreover, since a primary goal of this research is to understand comprehension, we want to talk to Veterans who have cognitive considerations, lower literacy levels, and English as a second language.

## Recruitment criteria

## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

Monday, September 30 - Tuesday, October 9 2024

## Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

-   Pilot participant email:
    
-   Date and time of pilot session:
    

## Research sessions

Monday, September 30 - Tuesday, October 9 2024
   
-   Session length: 60 minutes
    
-   Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
    
-   Maximum Sessions per day: 2
    

## Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
