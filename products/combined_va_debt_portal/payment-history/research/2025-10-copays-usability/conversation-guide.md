# Intro \- 5 minutes

* Thanks for joining us today\! My name is Risha. It‚Äôs nice to meet you. How are you doing today?

* I have a colleague(s) with us in this session who will be taking notes.

* *(if applicable)* \[accessibility specialist\] is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology during this session.

* There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?

* *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).

* *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to \#feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

* Today we're going to talk about receiving and resolving VA copay bills online. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll ask you to do some specific tasks from your account in [VA.gov](http://VA.gov).  
     
* Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

* **This entire session may take 70 (or 120\) minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* **I work for the VA.** My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand and resolve your copay bills. Some veterans use this portal all the time and others haven‚Äôt been on it before. Both perspectives are valuable to us. If something doesn‚Äôt make sense that‚Äôs exactly what we want to know about.

* **You are the expert and I want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers to any of my questions; I am not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know. Please also let me know if you‚Äôd like to take a break\!

* Finally, I would like to confirm you are comfortable with my recording this session. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. **Are you comfortable if I record our session today?**  
  * *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

‚û°Ô∏èSelect Record, then Record to the cloud.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm:  
  * **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No

  * Do you have any questions before we get started?

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to SHOW CAPTIONS \> View Full Transcript \> Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking Close Full Transcript in the Show Captions menu.*

# Screen sharing instructions (if needed)

* In the Zoom application on your computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click More...)*  
  * If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.  
  * (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)  
* Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.  
* Great, now I can see your screen\! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

# Troubleshooting

\[Avoid AI Companion, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons\]

\[If see unpredictable jumping around behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)\]

\[If having difficulty moving windows around or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.\]

\[If can't see an iPhone's magnified screen, ask participant to go into their phone and do `Settings > Accessibility > Show while Mirroring`\]

\[If ‚ÄúUncaught runtime errors‚Äù, close with ‚ÄúX‚Äù (label ‚Äúdismiss‚Äù) in top right corner, leave site if prompted.

Check my browser window to see if codespace shut down.

If so, restart it. Then have them click on the Apple button to resume/start over.\]

# Warm-up Questions \- 8 minutes

* Let‚Äôs start with a few questions. Just to confirm, you mentioned during recruitment that you‚Äôve received a copay bill in the past six months, is that correct?

* Can you tell me more about that experience? What did you do once you received it?  
     
* Looking back on it now, what do you wish had gone differently, if anything?

* Before we look at the screen, tell me \- if you needed to find information about a medical bill you owe to the VA, where would you look first?   
  * \[PROBE\] What would you expect to see?

### **For only assistive tech users \- 5 minutes**

* ### **What assistive technology are you using right now? *(screen reader / magnifier \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)***

  * *(If Dolphin screen reader, won't be able to share screen on Zoom)*  
  * *(if no AT)* Do you sometimes use assistive technology while using VA.gov or filling out a form online?  
    * If so, what do you use and when?  
      * Would you be willing to start using it now in this session?  
      * *(if not, run session w/o AT, or stop and ask Perigean for a replacement participant)*  
* How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen *(reader / magnifier)*\--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?

# User Tasks

## Task 0: Login to [VA.gov](http://Va.gov) account \- 1 minute

* Now I'd like you to login to your [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) account. 

## Task 00: Share screen \- 2 minutes

* Now I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your own screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.

*(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*

*STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **\< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

Make sure that the Zoom application has focus

Navigate to the screen share button

Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane

Activate the screen share

* **(If we can't hear the screen reader)** Since I can't hear your screen reader and don't want to interrupt it, after I ask you to do something, I'll try to not say anything until you say that you're done or need help, OK?

* **(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)
