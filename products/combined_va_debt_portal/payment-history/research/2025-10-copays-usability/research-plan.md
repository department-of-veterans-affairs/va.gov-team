# Research Plan for Financial Management Team, Copay Debt Portal Payment History, October \- November 2025 

# Background

Veterans who visit the debt portal to understand and resolve their debts have been frustrated by the inability to view up-to-date [payment history.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/payment-history/initiative-brief.md) Veterans expect that after making a payment, the system will update their new payment history and balance quickly. This is not the case, owing to the site’s current functionality, which populates copay payment history data from static monthly statements. As a result, payment history updates only monthly, which at best confuses and frustrates Veterans, often increasing call volumes to support centers, and at worst misleads them to make duplicate payments. The latter action decreases trust in the VA and prompts a lengthy VHA investigation to identify and remediate the issue. Additionally, Veterans expect to see details about their medical copay balances in the context of their payment history, which suffers from the same problem.

The team plans to integrate a new Lighthouse API that integrates dynamic Copay (VHA) payment history data to remediate these issues.    

## OCTO-DE Priorities 2025

This research supports the following OCTO priorities:

Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

* Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.  
* Key Result 2: We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.

## Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

* Getting Out  
* Starting Up  
* Taking Care of Myself  
* Reinventing Myself  
* Putting Down Roots  
* Retiring  
* Aging

# Research Goals

* Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience when interacting with  Copay payment history   
* Understand if the current copay balances are accurate to Veterans  
* Understand which copay details are helpful to Veterans  
* Understand how Veterans interpret the differences between dynamic html statements and static paper bills/pdfs.

## Outcome

The results of the study will help us identify if Veterans encounter any major issues or pain points with Co-pay statement data post-Lighthouse API integration. This will allow us to solve these issues if they occur prior to wider public release.

## Research Questions

**Research Goal \#1: Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience when interacting with Copay payment history**  
 

1. What challenges, if any, do Veterans encounter when viewing Copay Balances?  
2. What steps do Veterans take to understand their current copay balances?  
3. Are there points of confusion or difficulty when Veterans attempt to find, understand, and resolve their copay balances?          

**Research Goal \#2: Understand if Veterans believe the current copay balances are accurate and trustworthy**

4. Do veterans think the information displayed under copay balances is accurate and up to date?  
5. What, if any, technical or design barriers prevent Veterans from successfully understanding their barriers?  
6. How do Veterans feel about the overall experience of understanding their copay balances?

**Research Goal \#3: Understand which copay details are helpful to Veterans**

7. Do Veterans understand the different transaction fields?  
8. Which information do Veterans consider as the most important within the copay details?  
9. When do they use this information?   
10. Do Veterans think any vital information is missing from their copay details?

**Research Goal \#4: Understand how Veterans interpret the differences between dynamic HTML statements and static paper bills/PDFs.**

11. How do Veterans interpret the currency of payment data in dynamic HTML copay balances compared to static PDF or paper statements?  
12. What confusion, if any, do Veterans experience when deciding which statement to use and what copay balance amount to pay when they have access to both types of documents?   

# Hypotheses

1. Veterans will be able to easily find, understand, and know how to resolve their Copay balances

2. Veterans will believe their copay balances are accurate and trustworthy

3. Veterans will be able to easily understand their copay details and think it is useful and relevant

4. Veterans will be able to understand that PDF/paper statements contain static data and dynamic HTML statements contain current data

# Methodology

This study will use moderated usability testing to observe Veterans interacting with the Copay payment history from their own accounts in their natural logged-in stage.  Participants will complete tasks while sharing their desktop screens. 

## Location

* Remote via Zoom

## Research materials

Note

**Your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan – prior to submitting a recruitment request.**

# Timeline

Note

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

## Prepare

## Before recruitment starts, we would like to **request a kickoff call with Perigean** to align on recruitment criteria and terminology for screener questions in the survey and emails that will be sent to Veterans. We would also like to discuss the relative priorities of recruitment criteria.

## Risha is available for a kickoff call during any of these times:

* 10/27-29, 9-5pm ET

## **Prior to the kickoff call, we would like a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey** for this study to review beforehand.

* Dates and times of pilot sessions  
  * Thursday, 10/30  
  * Friday, 10/31  
  * Monday, 11/3 

## Research sessions

* `Planned dates of research:` \[11/5-11/18\]

We would like to request that **Perigean calls each participant** to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. And please include the session time in **each participant's own time zone** (from their address).

## Length of sessions

* Session length: 60 minutes; 120 minutes for AT sessions  
* Buffer time between sessions: 60 min  
* Maximum Sessions per day: 2 sessions

## Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time.

Note

We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Tip

Please request enough dates and at *least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants*. (e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.; *12 time slots for 6 participants*). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

Place time slots between `hash marks` when in edit mode.

* `November 5, 12-5pm ET`  
* `November 6, 12-5pm ET`  
* `November 7, 12-5pm ET`  
* `November 10, 12-5pm ET`
