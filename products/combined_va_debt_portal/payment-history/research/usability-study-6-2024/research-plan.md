# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Debt Portal payment history, June - July 2024
## Evaluative usability study (60 minutes)


## Background

Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:

-   What problem is your product trying to solve?
    
-   Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
    
-   What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
    

[Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/payment-history/initiative-brief.md) 

-   As of May 2024, Veterans do not receive timely confirmation of payments made on the debt portal, resulting in confusion, frustration, and possibly mistrust.
    
-   Veterans may not see their payment confirmation reflected in the debt portal for months.
    
-   They receive an immediate confirmation when the payment is made *
    
-   They can’t revisit the debt portal to review this payment history
    
-   They have to wait for the next statement a month later to see their payment
    
-   Inconsistent messaging about payments made can be a distressing experience for Veterans seeking to resolve and address their debt.
    

## Why

-   The payment history data messaging discrepancy is due to the payment history being batched on a monthly basis, resulting in untimely information on the debt portal.
    
-   Veterans rely on consistent messaging across the different channels of official communication with VA (email, debt portal, call center) to have confidence that their payments went through. Inconsistencies can reinforce mistrust of VA.
    

## How

Payment history improvements support the following:

-   All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
    
-   Veterans share more positive feedback on Medallia.
    

### OCTO Priorities

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

-   Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.
    
-   Key Result 2: Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%.
    
-   Key Result 3: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
    
-   Key Result 4: No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.
    

Objective 2: Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.

-   Key Result 1: Our platforms hit the “elite” level (as defined by DORA) on Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, and Time to Restore Service.
    
-   Key Result 2: Our platforms measure and improve the satisfaction of their internal users.
    
-   Key Result 3: Our platforms power twice as many interactions compared to last year.
    

  

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

-   Balancing finances
    
-   Managing primary care and chronic health issues
    
-   Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

  

There are multiple intersecting factors that interact and can influence a Veteran’s financial situation, which can then impact their ability to address any VA debt and avoid more serious consequences. VA benefits overpayments and some types of VA copay debt can come out of the blue and be unrelated to personal decisions or actions. However the ability to repay them is influenced by a Veteran’s personal financial situation, the stage they are on along the Veteran journey, and levels of personal financial decision making, motivation, and agency. Research shows that the transition between getting out and starting up can be an especially vulnerable time, with a survey of Veterans showing that 35% had trouble paying bills in their first few years after ending military service (Pew Research Center).

## Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?

Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

1.  How understandable are the overpayment summary page and detail page? How is the comprehension of the different financial elements on these pages?
    
2.  What is the findability of different elements like on these pages?
    
3.  What is missing in this experience, if anything?
    
4.  Do Veterans understand the callouts that indicate the debt has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    

### Outcome

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

This research will allow us to evaluate the payment history designs and validate them before or while they are being developed. We can also make changes as needed.

-   The payment history additions to the debt portal will result in a significant improvement in the user experience of Veterans in the process of managing or resolving their VA debts.
    
-   Veterans can rely on consistent messaging across the different channels of official communication with VA (email, debt portal, call center) to have confidence that their payments went through.
    

### Research questions

Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. 
    
-   How understandable are the overpayment summary page and detail page? How is the comprehension of the different financial elements on these pages?
    
	-	Do participants notice and understand the icon callouts on the debt overview page (exclamation point, checkmark)?
    
	- What elements on the page draw their attention?
    
	- What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable they might be missing?
    
	- Can participants define and/or understand the different transaction fields (current amount, original amount, total paid, date of last payment, next payment due, total late fees/interests)?
    
	- Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are? (pay, request help, dispute the debt)
    

-   What is the findability of different elements like on these pages?
    

-   Can participants find what they are looking for or what they deem to be important on this page?
    

-   What is missing in this experience, if anything?
    
-   Do Veterans understand the callouts that indicate the debt has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    
	- Without prompting or leading, do Veterans notice that the debt has been sent to collections or treasury?
    

### Hypothesis

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

**Hypothesis 1: Debt Status Noticeability**

-   The yellow call-out box on the debt detail page informing the Veteran of the status of their debt will draw the Veteran’s eye and stand out.
    

**Hypothesis 2: Payment History Comprehension**

-   The financial elements on the detail page (current amount, original amount, total paid, date of last payment, next payment due, total late fees/interests) will be easy to understand and provide the right amount of information for the Veteran to understand what they need to know.
    
**Hypothesis 3: Sent to Treasury Notice**

-   Participants might want to be informed about the debt being sent to the treasury sooner on the portal.
    

## Methodology

Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.

Examples of common research methods include:

-   Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research

## Recruitment

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources.

-   [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research.
    
-   [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.
    

### Recruitment approach

Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

-   Recruiting a diverse sample of 8-10 Veterans
    
-   Higher quotas: Veterans that have a cognitive consideration
    

Inclusion is prioritized. We seek to over-recruit underrepresented groups that are often underrecruited in research.

Moreover, since a primary goal of this research is to understand comprehension, we want to talk to Veterans that have cognitive considerations, lower literacy levels, and English as a second language.

### Recruitment criteria

List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.

Primary criteria (must-haves) What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?

### We most want to speak to:

-   Veterans that have overpayment debt (past 2 years)
    
-   Veterans who have had high amounts of debt (hundreds, thousands)
    

### Primary criteria (must-haves)

-   #### At least 8-10 Veterans interviewed, please recruit 16 - 20 Veterans
    
-   #### All participants must be Veterans

## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

Tuesday, June 25 - Tuesday, July 2nd 2024

### Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

-   Pilot participant email:
    
-   Date and time of pilot session:
    

### Research sessions

-   Planned dates of research: Tuesday, Jun 25, 2024 - Tuesday, Jul 2, 2024
    

### Length of sessions

-   Session length: 60 minutes
    
-   Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
    
-   Maximum Sessions per day: 2
    

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
