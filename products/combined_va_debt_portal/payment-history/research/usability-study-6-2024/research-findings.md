## <a id="research-goals"></a>Research Goals

How this research fits into [the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

-   Balancing finances
    
-   Managing primary care and chronic health issues
    
-   Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health
    
-   Managing my declining health

  

There are multiple intersecting factors that interact and can influence a Veteran’s financial situation, which can then impact their ability to address any VA debt and avoid more serious consequences. VA benefits overpayments and some types of VA copay debt can come out of the blue and be unrelated to personal decisions or actions. However the ability to repay them is influenced by a Veteran’s personal financial situation or financial hardship, the stage they are on along the Veteran journey, and levels of personal financial decision making, motivation, and agency. Research shows that the transition between getting out and starting up can be an especially vulnerable time, with a survey of Veterans showing that 35% had trouble paying bills in their first few years after ending military service (Pew Research Center).


In this study, our primary goals were to evaluate usability and comprehension of additions to the debt portal: VBA payment history transactions, as well as a new breakup of content on different pages (overview page, debt details page, resolve your debt page, and debt letters page).

  

Our goals were to understand:

  

1.  How understandable is the:
    

    - Overpayment summary page
    
    - Overpayment detail page
    
    - Resolution page
    
    -   Debt letter page
    

  

2.  Are participants able to locate how to:
    

    -   Pay their bill (locate the file information that allows them to pay)
    
    -   Request financial help
    
    -   Dispute their debt
    

  

3.  Do participants understand:
    

    -   When their bill is due?
    
    -   How much is currently due?
    

  

## <a id="research-questions"></a>Research Questions


1.  How understandable are the overpayment summary page and detail page? How is the comprehension of the different financial elements on these pages?
    
2.  Do participants notice and understand the icon callouts on the debt overview page (exclamation point, checkmark)?
    
3.  What elements on the page draw their attention?
    
4.  What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable they might be missing?
    
5.  Can participants define and/or understand the different transaction fields 

    -   current amount
    
    -   original amount
    
    -   total paid
    
    -   date of last payment
    
    -   next payment due
    
    -   total late fees/interests?
    

7.  Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are?
    

    -   "Resolve"
    
    -   "Pay your balance, request help or dispute this overpayment"
    

9.  What is the findability of different elements like on these pages?
    
10.  Can participants find what they are looking for or what they deem to be important on this page?
    
11.  What is missing in this experience, if anything?
    


## <a id="methodology"></a>Methodology

-   Usability and comprehension testing - appropriate for evaluative research
    

## <a id="hypotheses-and-conclusions"></a>Hypotheses and Conclusions
  

Hypothesis 1: One-thing-per page

-   Participants may find the lower amount of content on each page makes information easier to comprehend - **Definitely true**
    
-   Participants may find the amount of clicks to pay their debt to be overwhelming - **Maybe true**

    [See Finding 3: One thing per page](#finding-3)

Hypothesis 2: Payment History Comprehension

-   The financial elements on the detail page (current amount, original amount, total paid, date of last payment, next payment due, total late fees/interests) will be easy to understand and provide the right amount of information for the Veteran to understand what they need to know - **Likely true**, *however* payment due date could use refinement
    

  

Hypothesis 3: Ability to understand what is due, when it is due, and how to resolve

-   Participants will be able to understand the amount that is due, when it is due, and how to resolve the debt (pay, request help, dispute) - **Likely true**, *however* payment due date could use refinement

## Details of Findings

  
### <a id="finding-1"></a>1. Service Design & Digital Design

  

Labels: PRDT: Debt-portal

  

A full user experience journey for VA debt resolution must account for service design in addition to the digital design component. Participants noted they had issues outside of the debt portal. How can we narrow the gap between these 2 streams?

  

>“The VA was telling me I had to speak with the Education Center, Education Center would tell me I had to speak with Debt Management. It was like ping pong. And I'm still in the situation currently. Yeah, it's not resolved at all. I remember like I would call them, and I would get hung up on. Or I would have one of the VA employees start arguing with me, it would not help the situation at all.. … But yeah, in that situation it's caused like a domino effect in my life as well or like. I'm still suffering from the consequences of not just getting laid off from work but the VA, so yeah, I don't have the greatest relationship currently in terms of like debt management with the VA which is a whole different personal thing.” -P4

  

>“It’s been a painful experience like any payment with the VA is. Maybe over a year ago now, I got a duplicate payment for my monthly retirement. It came in like a normal payment on the last business day of the month like it normally does. Then, it was the 1st or 2nd when I received a duplicate payment. I tried to get in touch with a human, but it was nearly impossible.<br>I knew eventually that money was going to have to be rightfully returned but working out the process took weeks. Then, it got pulled from my bank account. There wasn’t any notice or anything. So, I just let the money sit in there. There wasn’t any effective communication. [ … ]"
<br>"It’s difficult to find a number and when you do, you get sucked into a phone tree."
<br>"[ .. ]I’m hoping what you all have is a website I can just go to with easy web navigation. Same as you would with anything else. I was able to get it resolved but it took maybe 4 or 5 months. I only noticed it when I looked at my bank account. I did eventually get a letter but that was a couple weeks after. Even in the letter, there wasn’t a number to call. It just said there was a duplicate payment. Nothing about pulling the amount out of my account. No communication of the details. My bank account just looked larger than expected. I wasn’t given any options. It was just randomly withdrawn.” -P3

  

>"They sent me a notice right before my wife died that my forms weren’t correct, and I owed them $77,000. They started taking my social security. A year and a half ago, I finally qualified for service-connected disability after 50 years. Now, they’re taking my disability checks. The first overpayment was a pension overpayment. They are still taking my disability checks. I’ve never had any luck with VSOs I was working with to get my disability up to where it’s supposed to be. It’s at 30% now and I would be over 100%. I worked with blinded vets association and state counties. They never got anything done. It's just very frustrating." -P5

  

**Initial notification and instructions**

Several participants stated that they did not receive any notification that they had an overpayment. Some participants stated that the overpayment amount was taken from them without any warning. One participant stated she received notification that she had the overpayment but only understood she needed to take action once she spoke with other Veterans.

  

>“I got the letter in the mail saying that I had an overpayment debt. It was frustrating because I would have handled the debt when it happened weeks ago. Instead of having it sit there. I was led to believe something that wasn’t true. Alerting me through mail was fine but the letter was unclear on what my part was. It took a lot longer to pay the debt than it should’ve. I was unclear on what my step was as the veteran. The clarity came through other veterans. Somebody had a similar experience and explained it to me. The school isn’t going to pay for it on your behalf.” -P11

  

**Chapter 35 debt**

One participant stated her son’s Chapter 35 debt was taken out of her VA disability payment. She found out about it when she had to present documents for VA housing and she noticed her VA disability payment was a lower amount. She was not sure if she was mailed notification about this debt as she and her son were homeless. Since a dependent's debt can impact a Veteran’s VA disability payment, it is worth considering adding the debt information to the Veteran’s account.

>“Yeah, even when I called at first they couldn't find it. They had to go into my son's account and research through that to find out. That's where it was coming from and I was like, well, if we had to pay, I would understand, but it was coming out of mine. It should at least been posted in my outstanding debt so I can, you know, so I'm aware.” –P8

  
  
  

### <a id="finding-2"></a>2. Overall Comprehension & Language

Labels: RESRCH: Comprehension testing

  

**Overall Comprehension**

Overall, comprehension was excellent and participants could easily understand the UI and content/copy on each page. The terms participants were specifically asked about, “current balance” and “resolve this debt” were easily understood. At the end of the session, 9 participants were asked to rate how clear they thought the Debt Portal was on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the clearest. The average score was 4.22.

>“I would think, getting started was the weakest part. Once I recognized how it was subdivided, it got better and better. And I'm not sure what can be done about that. Yeah, so getting started was the weakest part.” -P5 (Advanced JAWS user)

  
  

**Language Sensitivity**

Participants in this study had very clear mental models around “overpayments” and “debt”. Several participants stated that the term “overpayment” was more specific than that term “debt”.

  

>“I think consistency would be important rather than going back and forth. Debt just automatically has a negative connotation to it that could rub people the wrong way. They’re probably likely to associate it with credit card debt or something like that where you know, again, that's a conscientious act. If you are spending money versus an overpayment where typically you’re the downstream recipient of." –P3

  

One participant said it depended on the circumstances of how the debt was acquired:

  

>“It should probably be one or the other…the debt probably wouldn't be an overpayment if it's something like the person got sick in class and failed out of class now they have to repay that. I wouldn't consider that an overpayment, I’d consider that as a debt for failing the class. While to me an overpayment would be like ‘we still paid you and you stopped going to school like 3 months ago.’” –P8

  

Several participants had very strong reactions to other language used on the debt portal.

  

>“I mean, the only thing that jumps out to me is the collection action. That's a little strong, which again, debt collection is a real thing, but probably softening that up a little bit would be beneficial. Especially in my case where I'm like, I didn't do it, something happened, and there was an error, you know, with my overpayment, it wasn’t anything that I did. That’s a little strong.” -P3

  

### <a id="finding-3"></a>3. One thing per page

Labels: PRDT: IA

The way the experience is structured makes sense to Veterans, is easy to understand, learnable, and easy to navigate. Findability is also good. The majority of participants (6 of 9 participants) had no issues with one-thing-per-page, where they could see the break up of debt details, ways to resolve, and debt letters on different pages. Additionally, participants that were asked to complete a task at the end of the interview, navigated through the pages easily. It is also noteworthy that a full-time advanced screen reader user had no issue with one thing per page either. One participant felt that debt letters should be on the Debt Details page. One participant did not view the Debt Letters page.

  

>“I mean, it probably could be included on same page. I don't see why not, but I mean, I like that, it gives links, I mean, you don't have to go searching for it. It's all in that one card. But it probably could be on, like, one page that would make it a lot make it a lot easier. I would like for that to be the case, so I don’t have to go back and forth.” -P1

  

>“I kind of like things all on one page, but I think in this case, you've got information grouped on each page. It's pretty much a pageful. And you know, and that's good If you don't have to scroll up and down the screen. I've got to scroll up, anyway, but I'd have to scroll back and forth, and maybe something that's off the edge of the screen. Each one of these that I have seen so far are really self-contained. They’re about specific items. They're not about 6 different items. And if you put them all on one screen it would be a mess to go back and forth through.” -P5 (Advanced JAWS user)

  
  
  

***Page by Page***

### <a id="finding-4"></a>4. Overview Page

Labels: DSC: Cards

  

The overview page tested very well, and there were a few important mentions of possible improvements:

**Active/Completed debt**

Participants thought active debts and completed debts should be separated and that completed (paid) debt should be at the bottom of the page. Most participants would like it there for reference and proof/supporting evidence of having made the payment. Only one participant felt that it should not be there at all. One other participant stated that completed (paid) debt should only be shown for 30 days. 

**Debt status**

Participants noticed the text near the symbols on the cards when prompted but it did not always stand out. Most did notice that the benefits offset and Treasury paths did not have the ‘Resolve this debt’ link, and could hence piece together that those debts may not be actionable in the same way as the first. On participant stated the warning icon's color blended into the background. Two participants wanted a direct link to be able to contact the Department of Treasury. (The contact information for the Department of Treasury is available on the Debt Details page but was not available on this prototype.)

  

### <a id="finding-5"></a>5. Debt Details page

Labels: DSC: Alert Boxes, DSC: Tables


For the most part, this page along with the new transaction/payment history section were clear:

  

**Alert Component**

The link and the wording “Pay your balance, request financial help, or dispute this overpayment” was easily understood.

This use case/scenario was several months late on paying the full amount, the due date in the yellow alert box was in the past. Some participants had a hard time pointing out the due date and understanding that this participant was late on paying the full amount.

**Why do I have this debt?**

Some participants mentioned this section was very verbose and would like to see only information that is specific to the type of debt they have.

**Debt details**

Current balance was easily understood. Not all participants understood the purpose of the information that is needed to make a payment (file number, payee number, person entitled, deduction code) until they reached the Resolve page. On the Resolve page, this information was quickly understood as information they needed to provide in order to resolve their debt.

**Transaction/payment history**

Transaction/payment history was easily understood by all participants and participants were pleased to have this information.

Several participants had strong reactions to late fees. Our prototype showed a use case/scenario where late fees were incurred. After the sessions, we later verified with an SME that late fees and interest would not be incurred while the debt was on the Debt Portal but only if the debt had been escalated and sent to the Treasury Department.

>“The late fees are a little bit too high. How many people that are disabled at 100% can afford $15?” -P9

  
  

### <a id="finding-6"></a>6. Resolve page

Labels: RESRCH: Comprehension testing

  

The resolve page was easily understood by all participants. The term “resolve” was easily understood to mean there were multiple ways to resolve their debt other than paying it.

**Debt details**

Participants understood this was information they needed to provide in order to resolve their debt. One person was confused by “person entitled” as they thought it might mean who their debt was owed to. One participant thought the “person entitled” field was helpful as it would clarify that the Chapter 35 debt was for her son.

  

**Pay**

Participants liked how there were multiple options available for them to pay: Online, by mail, or in person.

One participant wanted an easy way to pay online directly on the Resolve page:

>“Yeah, you'd have a payment option right here, Apple Pay, Google Pay, all of those, kinda, you know, easy click buttons. Especially, you know, most people, I feel like if you've gotten this far. There's a lot of good information here. I would just go ahead and be able to submit the payment instead of having to go through yet another menu onto a different page to start the process.” -P3

  

**Request financial help**

Participants were easily able to locate where they could go to request financial help.

**Dispute**

Several participants, unprompted, stated they wanted a way to dispute their debt online. One participant stated she wanted a tracking number given after filing a dispute.

  

### <a id="finding-7"></a>7. Debt Letters page

Labels: RESRCH: Comprehension testing


This page was easy to find from the Debt Details page. Many participants had not received a debt letter, or demand letter, a letter sent to a Veterans after they have not paid. Many participants understood “debt letters” as all communication VA had sent them regarding the debt including an initial notice. Some stated it would be helpful to have documentation of all communication including phone calls on the Debt Portal. One participant stated it would be helpful to have a way to add notes that VA employees could review.

  

-   All participants who were asked wanted debt letters available for download online.
    
-   Several participants felt the download links should be shown within the table on the page.  
    How Debt Letters are used
    
-   Some reasons given for having debt letters online: in case they misplace the letter sent in the mail or it is lost in the mail, to have a record of it on their computer
    
-   Some reasons given for how a debt letter would be used: in case there was a discrepancy with VA data, for taxes, share with a school, to share with a Veteran organization for assistance, to gain state benefits, rental assistance, to use in case of bankruptcy, for court cases, wage garnishment, or establishing an agreement with another creditor
    

  
  

## <a id="additional-insights"></a>Additional Insights



**Accessibility**

-   We had one advanced, full time screen reader user. This participant was able to understand and navigate the prototype as it was formatted into the one-thing-per-page concept.
    

> “I would think, getting started was the weakest part. Once I recognized how it was subdivided, it got better and better. And I'm not sure what can be done about that. Yeah, so getting started was the weakest part.” -P5 (Advanced JAWS user)

[See Finding 3: One thing per page](#finding-3)

**Digital Dispute** 

- 3 participants mentioned that they would like a way to complete the dispute statement for VA overpayment debt online. This was mentioned without prompting from the moderator. 
  

## <a id="recommendations"></a>Recommendations

**Overall:**
    

-   Work with stakeholders to improve notifications
    
-   Debt overview page:

     -   Completed (paid) overpayment debts should be listed below active (unpaid) overpayment debts.


-   Debt details page:
    

    - Due date:
        -   Not all participants understood the purpose of the information that is needed to make a payment (file number, payee number, person entitled, deduction code) until they reached the Resolve page. We will only display this information on the Resolve page for the next iteration. Additional research will focus more on the placement of this information.

        -   Add due date again within Debt Details section    

        -   Can we surface a more actionable due date? OR
    
        -   Can we surface a more clear and accurate message about the next step in the escalation process?
    
        -   Explore ways to add additional language to emphasize to users that the due date is past due while considering those on payment plans. Work with CAIA to refine this section.


    - Payment schedule and late fees:
    

        -   Discovery with SMEs to understand late fees schedules and amounts.
    

        - Answer: "DMC doesn’t charge any late fees, Treasury is the one who assesses interest and fees when a debt gets referred there and of course the timeline for that can vary depending on if the Veteran never takes action or has some starts and stops along the way before the debt finally becomes delinquent. Essentially that schedule is a shifting target."
    

  

        -   Discovery with SMEs to understand the effect of making a small payment on an overpayment debt on the overall progression in severity
    

        -   If a Veteran makes a small payment on a debt, does the debt still get escalated to benefits offset, or the Department of Treasury?
    

    
- Debt letter page:

    -   PDF links within tables 
    
    -   Discovery with SMEs to determine what is shown on the Debt Letters section
      
    
- Accessibility
    

    -   Consider having the grand total due at the top (This was mentioned by one screen reader user, a larger sample size is needed to confirm this)
    

  
  

## <a id="next-steps"></a>Next Steps

Next steps here. Include owners if appropriate.

-   Use what we learned to create mockups for additional VBA use cases:
    
	-   Paid (completed) debt
    
	-   Debt sent to Treasury Department
    
	-   Benefit reduction
    

  

-   Apply learnings from the study to the analogous VHA copay payment history path, while considering differences in data, user needs, and stakeholder needs.
    
-   Work with CAIA team to refine terminology and overall content before Staging Review.
    

-   Refine VBA debt archetypes
    

-   Refine service design and digital design [user journey](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1715724483530/d9dca99e2bd499dfd6483206f17938cd08bb06b9) map for VBA
    
  

## <a id="further-research-needed"></a>Further research needed


In a previous research (Accessibility study on Streamlined Waiver/FSR), several participants who use screen readers stated that they prefer information on one page.

This current study only had one participant who utilizes a screen reader at all times and two who use screen readers in as-needed situations. Further research involving screen reader users is recommended.
