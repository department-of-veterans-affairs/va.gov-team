# Conversation Guide for Debt Resolution Team, VHA Debt Portal Payment History, September 2024

## Getting to know you (10 minutes)

5-7 minutes


Welcome!

  

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

  

How are you today?

  

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

  

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

  

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand and resolve your copay bills.

  

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

  

Next, I want to explain my role better.

  

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

  

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

  

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us.

  

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

  

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  

**Optional:**

  

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? *Yes.

  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image.

  

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

  

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences? *Okay.

  

Do you have any questions for me?

  

Just want to ensure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? *Okay.

  

**START INTERVIEW**

  

3-5 minutes

  

**[Rapport building]**

  

We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

  

What's your favorite thing about Fall? *The grey. 

  

Thank you for sharing! (personalize response)

## [VA copay bill workflow] (5 minutes)

  

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

  

Today I will be sharing a portal to help with VA copay bills.

  

Before I share the prototype, I’d like to hear about your experience paying for VA copay bills. Can you please walk me through what this has looked like for you in the past, from the moment you receive a VA healthcare service or a prescription through VA, to the moment you pay for that service copay or prescription copay bill. [establish baseline and common experiences to inform mental models] * I go in in Seattle every week for a while. Some of the stuff I had a copay on and some I didn't.t The problem I had was recycling the bill. Lots of numbers that I had no idea what they were about. There is no total, what do I owe? I called the VA online and nice lady, great conversation, she explained some things to me and I was able to make my payment. I found the layout, too much there. Line after line. I had no idea what they mean. 
*I felt it was harder than it needed to be. I know the VA is working on portals to be on the same page and I get that, whatever is easier for me. My copays aren’t high, I’m lucky. I wish there was a better system. I wish I could pay my copays before I leave the clinic. I wish there was a way. 
*I just wait patiently for the bill. I don’t think they do a digital bill, I only get them physically. 

  

-   Some things to consider asking:
-  How does the VA clinic or Medical Center inform you of your copay? *I go directly to pay.gov.

    
-   What options does it give you to pay?
    
-   Have they ever mentioned a portal to pay your copay?
    
-   How often do you use it?
    
-   When was the last time you viewed it?
    

## [Prototype] (5 minutes)

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

  

-   You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect.
    
-   Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
    
-   This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
    
-   In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback.
    
-   Please comment on what is clear and unclear.
    

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

## Copay Bills Overview (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

-   How understandable are the copay summary page, detail page, and resolve page?
-   Can participants find what they are looking for?
-   Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are? (pay, request help, dispute the debt)
-   What elements on the page draw their attention? What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable?
-   Do participants understand the callouts that indicate the copay bill has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    
**Conversation Guide Questions**

-   What are your initial impressions? *This looks familiar. The way the VA pages are now, it looks familiar. I like that because it’s standard. It appears, the stuff is there, I have never head of overpayment. I like the way it’s laid out, it’s simple. Everything you need is in front of you in the middle of the page. Everything is blocks. I like the VA held desk. 

-   What draws your attention the most on this page? *
    
-   What can you tell me about the copay cards you see on this page? *That little triangle gets your attention right away, not like in the bill, it has nothing like that. Another triangle that I need to get on it and get on this bill.  I like the green check to make the payment. I’ll click review details, now I’m on the pay your copay. 
*Sometimes I’m looking at numbers, no description and I don’t know what I was paying for. This has everything, I like it, it has everything laid out. Down at the bottom you can download it in PDF, you have your previous statements listed, your address. Patients rights and responsibilities should be at the top because some people want to know right away what their rights are and responsibilities. Several years ago, I did feel, but there have been a lot of changes since then. 
*You have the arrow in green, that’s helpful.

*The request help for current bill is a good one. There are times where I wish I could send a repayment plan. I did not know they were available nor dispute them. I never had a cause, the repayment plan would have been nice to know.

## Copay Bill Detail page (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

Goal 2: To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.
Goal 3: To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models.

  
**FIRST IMPRESSIONS (What do they notice and what stands out?)** *I like the way they are separated out, three separate copays. The idea of contacting the Department of Treasury to pay the debt is scary. I don’t want to deal with the Department of Treasury, I’d rather deal with the VA. I’m not sure how pay.gov works. I’d rather talk to someone at the VA. I believe the VA has my back, now the Department of Treasury is like dealing with the IRS. 
-Would you want to see if the debt was sent to the Department of Treasury? *Yes. 


-   What stands out to you on this page? *Pay now or request assistance. I like that. The middle one, you have to make payments basically. The third one is paid, I like that, you paid your bill, move on. I would want to see it here. Especially if I have some that are not paid. I like knowing that the bill is paid for and I don’t have to deal with it anymore. 


**COMPREHENSION (Payment activity)**

-   What can you tell me about the due date for this copay bill? * October 30th, 2024

Success criteria:
> [pass] It is due on Oct 30, 2024(notice callout)
> [fail] don’t see the due date


-   Based on what you see here, what does the information on this page tell you about your copay balance and payment activity? * It shows the amount received, account number, that’s the one I used to lose track of, billing reference- doesn’t really tell me anything at all. Not helpful. Prescription copay, and the doctor, Theres no amounts under prescription copay. 
*The current lists everything what I’m going for once a month in September, and the amounts and knowing what your copay is for. I like this idea a lot better on the website rather than the mail. 
*I think it’s pretty good, enough details here. I wouldn’t want this in the public. The explanation of the late fee is nice. I like it, there is a lot of detail. Once again, the billing reference doesn’t do anything for me. 
    
Success criteria:
> [pass]  Participant can correctly interpret these numbers/amounts due that would allow them to understand the charges and amounts due
- Original amount was $40
- $5 of late fees 
- Payment of $45 was made
- I’ve since received new charges that add up to $50

> [partial pass] Participant seems to have an understanding, but there are gaps in their understanding

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 
    

  **PREFERENCE** 
  
-   After you’ve paid your bill, when would you expect it to show up here?
    
-   After you’ve visited a VA medical center, when would you expect it to show up here?
    
  
**COMPREHENSION (Pending transactions)**

-   What is the difference between the two tables (sections) you see on this page? * I like having the activity of last statement. Prior to receiving your statement. 
    
Success criteria:

> [pass] Participant understands that the Current statement table describes the most recent statement and is fixed. They also understand that the Activity since last statement table describes pending transactions (not finalized). 

> [partial pass] Participant has some degree of understanding, but does not fully understand the difference between them

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 

  
-   How do you feel about seeing pending transactions?
    

	- What does “Activity since last statement” mean to you?
    
	- Would it be helpful to see pending transactions? Why or why not?
  
  

**DESIRABILITY & HELPFULNESS (Copay details)**

  I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Prescription Copay details.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the prescription copays? * I like that, it’s there. The copay number, the prescription number and what the copay is. 
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why?
    

-   I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Outpatient Care Copay details.
    
	-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the outpatient care copays? *Well, it only says what you are there for and nothing else. Not sure if that is the right thing or why you are there I might want more information but doesn’t have to be in this box. Not sure where I would want it. I would want a link to the details to the outpatient care.  A link to the doctors notes or to what the patient would want to read. 
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful?
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why? 

##   Resolve your copay bill page (10 minutes)

  

-   What are some of the options you see on this page to address and resolve this copay bill? * It's in the medical section to be honest. Or maybe more information in the information button. 
*So if the patient has a question about it, it would be nice to have a link about it or open a brief bubble. 
-How do you feel about having diagnosis? * I don’t know what Hypertension is, but if it’s public information I wouldn’t want it, but I think it’s fine. 
    

Success criteria:
> [pass] Participant sees they can pay online, by phone, by mail, in person, request financial help, request help for future health care, and dispute the debt.

> [partial pass] Participant notices some of the options, but not all

> [fail] Participant is unsure/does not understand


  

-   Given the situation you are in now, which option would you choose and why?
    

  

-   After reviewing the copay details page and the resolve your copay bill page, what are your thoughts on having these types of information on separate pages? *This page can get really busy if you had someone that was going to the doctors a lot. 
* I would like to see it as humanly possible. I wouldn’t mind seeing a receipt that its paid as soon as human possible. Because I’m forgetful. 


    


**MENTAL MODELS**

  

-   If you have visited this portal in the past, did you know there are other pages to address other money you might owe to the VA, such as VBA overpayment debt? 
    

	-   If not, briefly tell them about it
    
-   How do you feel about having your medical copay bills in the same place as other types of bills or debt that need to be paid to the VA? * I would reverse the amount. I would put the money after the copay bills so they can see the copay bill is important not the money. 
*This is everything, education, disability, this is everything in the medical section, it’s nice to look at the bill and its all in one place. I like it, its all right there, I think it’s a good idea. 
    
-   Why do you feel that way?
    
    

## Post Task Questions (5 minutes)

-   What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed today? *Overall positive, I think it’s a good thing moving forward. Overall, I like it. I like to be able to go on my VA website and deal with it. Having a link that takes me to my copay, would be nice, I like it. 
*Yes.
    
-   Was there any information missing? * Yes. One thing, is travel, I know some hospitals you can go there and get your travel paid for.  Because it is tied into your VA health. There is an area in Seattle where you can turn in your VA bills. 
    
-   What would you change, if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?
    

  

-   We want to know your thoughts on how clear the portal is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would be able to understand the information in the portal, and -make a payment or ask for help.
    * I would like to have something where I can see my balance of everything. 

  

	-   On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not clear at all, and 5 being very clear, how clear was the portal? *4.5, because I was able to find everything I was looking for. 
    

  

	-   Why did you rate it a (rating)?
    

  

-   We have something called a blue sky thinking question. In this question, we encourage you to think about if sky were the limit and you could design any experience that would help you receive, understand, and resolve your copay bills, what would that look like?
    

  

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

  

-   Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this?
    

  

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know? * Not so much, it’s a good start. 
    

  

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.
