# Conversation Guide for Debt Resolution Team, VHA Debt Portal Payment History, September 2024

## Getting to know you (10 minutes)

5-7 minutes


Welcome!

  

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at VA.gov - it’s nice to meet you!

  

How are you today?

  

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services. [meaning]

  

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission]

  

My goal today is to learn how easy or difficult it is to use a digital portal we are working on to help you understand and resolve your copay bills.

  

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

  

Next, I want to explain my role better.

  

I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA medical copay billing. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your VA copay bills.

  

The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience nor am I a financial expert, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

  

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us.

  

Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. [comfort and consent]

  

Your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

  

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? *Okay.

  

We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  

Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

  

**Optional:**

  

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? *Okay.

  

One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image.

  

[Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.]

  

At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  

Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?

  

Do you have any questions for me?

  

Just want to ensure the next 60 minutes are still good for you today? *Yes.

  

**START INTERVIEW**

  

3-5 minutes

  

**[Rapport building]**

  

We like to start off with a lighthearted question to get to know you better.

  

What's your favorite thing about Fall? *The Colors. 

  

Thank you for sharing! (personalize response)

## [VA copay bill workflow] (5 minutes)

  

Now we’ll start the more formal interview.

  

Today I will be sharing a portal to help with VA copay bills.

  

Before I share the prototype, I’d like to hear about your experience paying for VA copay bills. Can you please walk me through what this has looked like for you in the past, from the moment you receive a VA healthcare service or a prescription through VA, to the moment you pay for that service copay or prescription copay bill. [establish baseline and common experiences to inform mental models] * logging onto the portal has changed multiple times and I thought I had information saved so I wouldn’t have to enter it every time, but that didn’t happen. When I paid a bill, I didn’t know what it was really for- if it was for the current prescription or previous one. Both portal and paper bill. 
*I have to re-enter basic name, address, and things like that. I signed up for the account to save that information and I ended up still having to enter that information. 

  

-   Some things to consider asking:
-  How does the VA clinic or Medical Center inform you of your copay?
    
-   What options does it give you to pay?
    
-   Have they ever mentioned a portal to pay your copay?
    
-   How often do you use it?
    
-   When was the last time you viewed it?
    

## [Prototype] (5 minutes)

Let’s go to the next part of the interview where we are going to share a digital experience we’re working on and ask for your feedback. A few things I want you to know:

  

-   You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect.
    
-   Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.
    
-   This is very important to know: since it's a demo, we have used fake information, and none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
    
-   In this task, we would like to hear your honest feedback.
    
-   Please comment on what is clear and unclear.
    

  

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page.

## Copay Bills Overview (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

-   How understandable are the copay summary page, detail page, and resolve page?
-   Can participants find what they are looking for?
-   Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are? (pay, request help, dispute the debt)
-   What elements on the page draw their attention? What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable?
-   Do participants understand the callouts that indicate the copay bill has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    
**Conversation Guide Questions**

-   What are your initial impressions? * Looks like I can review details of the bill. I have multiple places where I  can get the bill from. See if I had any overpayments. I can call if I have questions, Monday through Friday. 
*No, because I have either paid the bill and I keep track of what I have paid, and I have things covered. 

-   What draws your attention the most on this page?
    
-   What can you tell me about the copay cards you see on this page? *One, I can pay the first one, the James Haley, looks like I can pay it on that screen. The second one, I can't do anything except call and review details. The last one, I don’t have a balance. 
*The triangle means its some type of a warning or something to look into. The green checkmark, you don’t have to do anything to it. Just informational. 
*I’d like to be able to see a history. Doesn’t have to be shown on this screen, but on another screen with history. Having a history on one summary would be good. Because I can see where I’m spending the money on. 
*Probably just a year. 
*No. The link to Hidden River, I’d have to do it on my  mobile phone.

## Copay Bill Detail page (10 minutes)

*Research Questions addressed in this section:*

Goal 2: To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.
Goal 3: To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models.

  
**FIRST IMPRESSIONS (What do they notice and what stands out?)** 


-   What stands out to you on this page? * I can request financial help. 
* Looks Like I overpaid by $5. I would hope that my new bill would be $45. It’s not showing me what is going on here. It’s showing my current balance is $50 but it’s now showing $45. It’s not clear. It’s not telling me why the $5 is there. 
*Basically you are having me scroll a lot to get a little piece of information.
* I would change the total fees, right up here because that is where the most confusion is and causes me to look further down. 


**COMPREHENSION (Payment activity)**

-   What can you tell me about the due date for this copay bill? 

Success criteria:
> [pass] It is due on Oct 30, 2024(notice callout)
> [fail] don’t see the due date


-   Based on what you see here, what does the information on this page tell you about your copay balance and payment activity?
    
Success criteria:
> [pass]  Participant can correctly interpret these numbers/amounts due that would allow them to understand the charges and amounts due
- Original amount was $40
- $5 of late fees 
- Payment of $45 was made
- I’ve since received new charges that add up to $50

> [partial pass] Participant seems to have an understanding, but there are gaps in their understanding

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 
    

  **PREFERENCE** 
  
-   After you’ve paid your bill, when would you expect it to show up here?
    
-   After you’ve visited a VA medical center, when would you expect it to show up here? *It’s telling me I have a couple of items but not how much they would be.  I don’t see an amount. 
*Other than the amount missing, I think it’s good.
*For budgeting purposes it would be helpful having the amount. 
*I’d rather see the statement first rather than active. 
    
  
**COMPREHENSION (Pending transactions)**

-   What is the difference between the two tables (sections) you see on this page?
    
Success criteria:

> [pass] Participant understands that the Current statement table describes the most recent statement and is fixed. They also understand that the Activity since last statement table describes pending transactions (not finalized). 

> [partial pass] Participant has some degree of understanding, but does not fully understand the difference between them

> [fail] Participant visibly doesn’t understand the information 

  
-   How do you feel about seeing pending transactions?
    

	- What does “Activity since last statement” mean to you?
    
	- Would it be helpful to see pending transactions? Why or why not?
  
  

**DESIRABILITY & HELPFULNESS (Copay details)**

  I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Prescription Copay details.
    
-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the prescription copays? *Is this date that it was shipped or the date that I received it? It’s a toss up between order date, I think that would be good. Because they don’t know when I received it since they don’t ask for proof of receipt. 
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful? *The billing reference for me unless is in reference to a specific bill. It’s hard for me to answer if that’s necessary or not. If its on the bill it could be helpful. Hopefully the date that is on the bill matches the date on here. 
* I like that amount of detail, one thing that might be useful is how many more prescriptions are still left, refills. Because let's say I’m running low, I have not received or misplaced the email that reminds me of a refill. I recently had an issue because the text message I got it said I had one and was ready and I thought I had one left. Then I hopped online and came up with a warning saying, “ you need to contact your provider”. 
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why?
    

-   I’d like to bring your attention to where you see several Outpatient Care Copay details.
    
	-   What are your thoughts on the amount of detail you see on the outpatient care copays? *It seems fine to me. It’s telling me what kind of care I was going for and what kind of doctor.
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are helpful? *I’m not really sure since I have not had to deal with that. 
*1-3 days.
    
	-   Which parts, if any, are unnecessary?
	- Why? 

##   Resolve your copay bill page (10 minutes)

  

-   What are some of the options you see on this page to address and resolve this copay bill?  Looks like I can pay by bank, debit, pay.gov. You can also pay by mail. If I was paying my mail, I think I would like to see it within 5 days because its mail. 
*This is assuming that I’m getting a statement in the mail. Unless it’s something I can print. 
*I think you’re turning me into my own door, meaning your making me print on my own and put it in my own envelope. 
* I like to do it by mail, but I’ll pay it by mail. I do bill pay online for my bank. 
* This pay in person, I have never done that. I don’t know if that is something that is available at the outpatient clinics. 
*This link, request help would be good. 
*Learning more about hardship, that’s good.
*Disputing copay charges, I have 30 days of receiving my bill. My mail gets delayed a lot of times, how do you know what day I received it. Let's say I bring it in the day after I got it but its really more than 30 days. 
*I think I do get some text messages, some emails. I basically toss them off, I don’t look at them. I put them in the delete folder because I get too many emails. 

    

Success criteria:
> [pass] Participant sees they can pay online, by phone, by mail, in person, request financial help, request help for future health care, and dispute the debt.

> [partial pass] Participant notices some of the options, but not all

> [fail] Participant is unsure/does not understand


  

-   Given the situation you are in now, which option would you choose and why? *It would depend upon on how far in debt I am in my whole life. For me, I don’t got into debt, I pay my bills in full all the time. Repayment plan would be good if they were really in trouble. The compromise offer, how many times can it be done. The waiver, if you really can’t pay, I can see someone asking for a waiver.
*If I wanted to pay my copay bill and I needed help, I would want to talk to a person. 

  

-   After reviewing the copay details page and the resolve your copay bill page, what are your thoughts on having these types of information on separate pages? *It would be a lot of scrolling and if you are doing it on your phone it would be harder because it would be a lot of information and the font would be smaller. 
    


**MENTAL MODELS**

  

-   If you have visited this portal in the past, did you know there are other pages to address other money you might owe to the VA, such as VBA overpayment debt? *The first one looks like its to the, guessing I’ve gotten billed for this already. I would be checking to see what are the bills. This one here looks like a prior statement that I have not paid completely. It’s not a balance I should be looking at, it should be a detail of why. 
    

	-   If not, briefly tell them about it
    
-   How do you feel about having your medical copay bills in the same place as other types of bills or debt that need to be paid to the VA? *It does make sense, to me I guess to understand what the outstanding debts would be, I would want to look at a summary of those. 
    
-   Why do you feel that way?
    
    

## Post Task Questions (5 minutes)

-   What was your overall experience with the pages you reviewed today? *It was good to be able to get feedback on it. 
    
-   Was there any information missing? *No, it covered a bit of information. 
    
-   What would you change, if anything? What can be improved? Was anything unclear?
    

  

-   We want to know your thoughts on how clear the portal is. When you answer this question, think about how easily you would be able to understand the information in the portal, and -make a payment or ask for help.
    

  

	-   On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being not clear at all, and 5 being very clear, how clear was the portal? *Probably a 3-4. For the reason I have already pointed out. 
    

  

	-   Why did you rate it a (rating)?
    

  

-   We have something called a blue sky thinking question. In this question, we encourage you to think about if sky were the limit and you could design any experience that would help you receive, understand, and resolve your copay bills, what would that look like?
    

  

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

  

-   Circling back about the optional use of clips with internal VA partners. Now that you know what we’ve discussed, are you still comfortable with this? *Yes.
    

  

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
    

  

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
