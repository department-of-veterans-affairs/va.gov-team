## Research Goals

This usability and comprehension study built on knowledge and findings from research in the July 2024 VBA payment history study. These two parallel debt portal paths (VBA and VHA) should be consistent in their information architecture for the use case of Veterans who will utilize both. The information contained within them differs in so far as the type of debt/bills and ways of resolving.

Veterans that have VBA debt and Veterans that have VA medical debt have different mental models and needs. Understanding the mental models of Veterans that have isolated or recurring health needs and are required to pay VHA copays was a focus of this study.

Moreover, we were able to confirm that some Veterans with higher reliance on VA health services were a part of more vulnerable groups (Veterans that have complex medical needs or multiple chronic health conditions, and mental health conditions, which might affect their experiences with usability and comprehension).

  We see pain points that surfaced in Medallia feedback and usability studies:

-   As of May 2024, Veterans do not receive timely confirmation of payments made on the debt portal, resulting in confusion, frustration, and possibly mistrust.
    
-   Veterans may not see their payment confirmation reflected in the debt portal for months.
    
-  They can’t revisit the debt portal to review this payment history
    
-   They have to wait for the next statement a month later to see their payment
    
-   Inconsistent messaging about payments made can be a distressing experience for Veterans seeking to resolve and address their debt.
    
-   Details about VHA medical copays are in the copay statement page which is often difficult to find.
    

The goals of this study were:

### 1.  To understand usability (findability and navigation) and comprehension of the revised information architecture of the copay path of the debt portal.
   
- Copay summary page,

- Copay detail page along with payment history,

- Resolution page
  

### 2.  To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.
  
  - How clear is the transaction information on the Copay Details page?

- Are Veterans interested in seeing pending transactions? Why or why not?

-   How do Veterans perceive pending transactions? Does it fit within their mental models, or does it cause confusion?
    

Did participants understand:

-   When their bill is due?
    
-   How much is currently due?
    
-   Copay statuses and icons
    

  

### 3.  To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models.
    

- What information is necessary on doctor visit summaries, and prescription medication summaries?

- Do Veterans have concerns about the security and privacy of their PHI?

- What are Veterans' mental models about VHA copay billing?


## Research questions

#### Goal 1: To understand usability (findability and navigation) and comprehension of the revised information architecture of the copay path of the debt portal.

  
1.  How understandable are the overpayment summary page and detail page? How is the comprehension of the different financial elements on these pages?
    
2.  Do participants notice and understand the icon callouts on the debt overview page (exclamation point, checkmark)?
    
3.  What elements on the page draw their attention?
    
4.  What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable they might be missing?
    
5.  Can participants define and/or understand the different transaction fields
    
	
	-   current amount
	    
	-   original amount
	    
	-   total paid
	    
	-   date of last payment
	    
	-   next payment due
	    
	-   total late fees/interests?
    

6.  Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are?
    
	-   "Resolve"
	    
	-   "Pay your balance, request help or dispute this overpayment"
    

7.  What is the findability of different elements like on these pages?
    
8.  Can participants find what they are looking for or what they deem to be important on this page?

10. What is missing in this experience, if anything?

### Goal 1: To understand usability (findability and navigation) and comprehension of the revised information architecture of the copay path of the debt portal.

1.  How understandable are the copay summary page, detail page, and resolve page?
    
2.  Can participants find what they are looking for?
    
3.  Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are? (pay, request help, dispute the debt)
    
4.  What elements on the page draw their attention? What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable?
    
5.  Do Veterans understand the callouts that indicate the copay bill has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    

### Goal 2: To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.

6.  Do participants understand:
    

-   When their bill is due?
    
-   How much is currently due?
    
-   Copay statuses and icons
    

7.  How clear is the transaction information on the Copay Details page?
    
	-   Can participants define and/or understand the different transaction fields (new charges, previous balance, payments received, date of last payment, next payment due, total late fees/interests)?
    
8.  Are Veterans interested in seeing pending transactions?
    
	-   How do Veterans perceive pending transactions? Does it fit within their mental models, or does it cause confusion?
    

### Goal 3: To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models. Additionally, understand Veterans' mental models about VA copay billing in general.

9.  What information is necessary on doctor visit summaries, and prescription medication summaries?
    
	-   Do Veterans have concerns about the security and privacy of their PHI?
    
	-   What are Veterans' mental models about VHA copay billing?
    
10.  What are Veterans perceptions of VA copay billing and VBA overpayment debt being housed under one experience?
    
		- Does it trigger negative feelings? (associating receiving medical copay bills as "debt")
    
		- Do they seem unrelated to Veterans?
    
		-   What is a better conceptual model for this hub?

##  Methodology

-   Usability and comprehension testing - appropriate for evaluative research

## <a id="hypotheses-and-conclusions"></a>Hypotheses and Conclusions

### Hypothesis 1: The revised debt portal IA (with the addition of a copay detail page and surfacing of statement data sooner) will be easy to understand. Veterans will be able to easily navigate between pages, review their statements, and resolve their copay bills. 

**Likely true**

### Hypothesis 2: VHA payment history (including activity since the last statement and current statement data) displayed on the copay detail page will be easy to understand.  Medical visit copay and prescription copay details will also be easy to understand and be helpful to see. 

-   Payment history was easy to comprehend in the VBA payment history study. Hence, we expect that payment history (current balance amount, previous balance, new charges, payments received, total feels/interest, payment due date) will be easy to understand for the Veteran in the VHA study as well. 
- We further hypothesize that details provided for medical visit copays and prescription copays will be easy to understand and provide the right amount of detail. 
    
 **Likely true**
    
Some participants may express concern about their PHI.
 
 **Maybe true**
 
### Hypothesis 3: The addition of pending copay charges will be beneficial to Veterans. 

-  A year’s worth of Medallia data reveals that Veterans want to see current balances to make informed budgeting decisions. We expect that participants will find it helpful to view pending charges. Participants will understand that these transactions are pending and have not been finalized.
    
-   Participants will differentiate the current statement section from the activity since the last statement (pending) section.

**Likely false**


### Hypothesis 4: Veterans will be able to differentiate between copay bills that are payable, receiving a benefit offset, and sent to the Department of Treasury. 

-   The VBA payment history study revealed that participants were able to deduce that some VA debts are payable on the debt portal, while others are not (benefits offsets and Department of Treasury). We believe this information will be clear to participants for the VHA copay path as well. 

**Definitely true**    

## Methodology

 Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.

-   Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
    
## <a id="key-findings"></a>Key Findings

**[1. Navigation & Findability](#finding-1)**

 Navigation and findability were excellent: Veterans in this study could easily find information they were looking for and knew which links to click on to read more details on their bill and to resolve the bill. Additionally, comprehension was excellent, overall.
 
Not all participants were asked about this but of those who were, the majority of those participants were in favor of the way content was divided among these pages.

  

**[2. Copay Overview page](#finding-2)** 

Veterans we interviewed correctly interpreted the status differences between each facility's copay bill (payable in the portal, not payable since escalated to treasury, and already paid).
    

**[3. Copay Detail page](#finding-3)**
    
The copay detail page was overall well understood but could be 	improved.

**Pending Transactions**

Overall, seeing pending transactions unrelated to the bill that is owed was described as unhelpful at best and confusing at worst by 5 of 8 participants (2 of 10 participants did not see this section).


**Prescription copay**
	
The feedback we received on the prescription copay details was very positive. All of the information provided in the example was described as helpful.

**Outpatient care copay**

Keeping this section simple seems preferable based on participant feedback.

  The majority of participants said the information was helpful:

-   Department or clinic name
    
-   Name of diagnosis* (some concerns about PHI, 3 of 8 participants)
    
-   Doctor’s name
    
**Inpatient care copay**

A more in depth study that includes more participants who had inpatient stays would be helpful in determining this information.

 **Alert Component**

The information in the alert component was easy to understand. Participants could easily find the due date and current balance.  

**Copay Detail Section**

The copay details section after the yellow alert component and before the statement caused confusion because it referenced activity outside of the current month.

**Rights and responsibilities** 

The Rights and responsibilities modal link is currently on the combined Copay Detail and Resolve Page. On the prototype it is only placed on the Copay Details page. It is worth exploring the placement in future studies.

**[4. Resolve page](#finding-4)**
    
Participants easily understood each section: Pay online, Pay by phone, pay by mail, pay in person, request financial help, dispute this bill.

**[5. Service Design](#finding-5)**
    
Participants were able to easily find and understand the Resolve page and all of the options available to them. Three participants who had not used the debt portal before were not aware of all of the ways they could resolve their bill, including requesting financial help. There is room for improvement on raising awareness to Veterans who receive copays and do not access the debt portal that financial help is available to them.


## Details of Findings

### <a id="finding-1"></a>Finding 1: Navigation & Findability

Navigation and findability were excellent: Veterans in this study could easily find information they were looking for and knew which links to click on to read more details on their bill and to resolve the bill. Additionally, comprehension was excellent overall.

> “I think that they were what I like to say: simple. I think if you keep things pretty simple, well thought out, not trying to overcomplicate it and be an engineer to people who are not then you'll make great pages and websites and things of that nature. Because most people run away from the Internet because of how complicated people are making it. Thinking that it's a really nice design, it might be a nice design to you, but not user friendly. So that's the biggest thing that I like to do is keep things user-friendly. So this is definitely very user-friendly. I would say.” - P16 (screen reader user)

**One thing per page**

Not all participants were asked about this but of those who were, the majority of those participants were in favor of the way content was divided among these pages. 

Some of those in favor of one thing per page noted that there was a lot of information on the Resolve page and it was good that it was on its own page. One participant wanted further separation stating that ‘Dispute this bill’ and ‘Request financial help’ could be on a separate page from information about paying.

In favor of one thing per page: P3, P9, P10, P12

Not in favor of one thing per page: P1, P4

P5 did not remember having to click so many times to pay her bill. She recently signed up for VA health care and had received one copay bill so far. She received a bill in the mail and went directly to pay.gov to pay the bill. 

>”I don't remember clicking that many times, and I only had the one appointment on there, so it wasn't so wordy and lengthy on there.” -P5

P12 shared an analogy about the amount of information on VA.gov: 
>”Sometimes things can be a bit lengthy when it comes to the VA, so I feel like things might need to be a little bit more concise, because a lot of times when Veterans are trying to take care of bills or things through the VA. They know exactly what they want, but there's just so much it feels like, almost like, you know, you want to take a bath and you got a bathtub full of rubber duckies. Enjoy those rubber duckies, the rubber duckies help you to have a better experience. They are there for your help there to help you get along to where you're headed. However, too much of a good thing can become a bad thing, and sometimes you just want to turn the water on and turn more hot water on so you can enjoy the tub. But you got to swim through all these rubber duckies just to turn on the hot water, and you already know what you want. But there's the sea of rubber duckies, and it's just much easier if you, if you just take some of the rubber ducks out.” -P12


### <a id="finding-2"></a>Finding 2: Copay Overview page
Veterans we interviewed correctly interpreted the status differences between each facility's copay bill (payable in the portal, not payable since escalated to treasury, and already paid). 

> “That little triangle gets your attention right off. Now, there's nothing like that on the bills that I receive. So I like realizing that, ‘Oh, wait a minute, I got to deal with this by the 30th or whatever.’” -P3

Of the participants asked, all participants would prefer to see paid bills on the portal. 
>”I like where it said you had a 0 balance, and it told you when you paid it. I like that because it's like, ‘Oh, see, I told you. Look, look, I told you I paid it! Don't don't play with me.’” -P16

### <a id="finding-3"></a>Finding 3: Copay Detail page

The copay detail page was overall well understood but could be improved. 

**Pending Transactions**

- Overall, seeing pending transactions unrelated to the bill that is owed was described as unhelpful at best and confusing at worst by 5 of 8 participants (2 of 10 participants did not see this section). 
The majority of Veterans we interviewed said it is not helpful to see this information.

>”I don't really need to see that, I pay so many things, sometimes I pay on the phone and I don't know what I'm paying for. I'm going in here to pay. I just want to know what this $50 is for [current statement section]. There's too many things to read.” -P1


>  “Well, if it's not pending, and you're sending me a statement that means it's not due yet. So when you're sending me a statement you're telling me it's due, and it doesn't say on here: hey, do you want to pay what's due, or do you wanna include what's pending as well? That's not an option for the billing, so why confuse them with it on?” -P5

>"Don't say I have a copay and not list an amount" -P9

>"Confusing when there is another charge – "pending" does that mean I add this on top of my other charges?" -P12

Three participants said it would be helpful to see for budgeting purposes for next month's statement, and the addition of a $ amount would be most helpful. 
>I like having the activity since last statement. It lets you know that this is what you're doing and where you're at prior to receiving your statement.  It's there, and I don't have to go to another page. -P3

>I think it's good. Shows me what happened since the last statement. I'm guessing that would be a screen that I could look at any time of the month. It would be helpful for budgeting purposes. The amount would be much more helpful. -P4

>”Oh, I think it's good because that helps me prepare.” 
Moderator: “And how do you feel about seeing the activity since the last statement without the amount?”
“Well, it gives me an opportunity to say, no, I did not go and get this, or you know, okay, this is what I did.” -P10


**Copay Detail Descriptions**


**Description details described as helpful by participants:**
|Prescription Copay | Outpatient Copay | Inpatient Copay |
|--|--|--|
| the name of the prescription, the amount, the count, and the number of days | Department or clinic name, Name of diagnosis* (some PHI concerns), Doctor’s name | Additional research needed



In the interviews we prioritized asking participants about their thoughts on the prescription copay details they had recent experience with. 6 of 9 said they had received VA prescription copays in the past (one declined to answer the type of copay), 2 of these 6 said their prescriptions were recurring. 4 of 9 said they had received VA outpatient or inpatient copays in the past.  

One of the design considerations that emerged in this study is balancing copay description detail usefulness in the debt portal without turning it into a patient medical chart. 

We noted multiple different use cases of copay description data: 
Veterans might refer to the bill for different purposes (understanding the service and charges vs going to an external page seeking medical clarity). 

Of note, a participant that was currently experiencing significant financial hardship due to her prescription copays said she would use the information she can see in the prescription copay description to compare costs against her Medicaid insurance for the same medication. 


**Medication prescription copay**

The feedback we received on the prescription copay details was very positive. All of the information provided in the example was described as helpful, most notably: 

- the name of the prescription, 
- the amount, 
- the count, and 
- the number of days 

Less notable: 

- Prescribing doctor
- Prescription number (described as not helpful from a Veteran perspective)

Quotes: 

>"Oh! You've got a description in there. Not just random numbers. That's awesome." (referencing his experiences he's had seeing just numbers on his paper statement, which confused him) -P3

>”Tells me what it is, the size, the count, the fact it's a 30 day supply, and prescribed by. The information that matters most to me is right there.”  -P3

>”I like seeing this information, because I have a lot of mental health medication. In the middle of the month, I could change my blood pressure to 60 count, or my doctor will say go take this other medication, but I'm only going to prescribe it to the end of the month because it's controlled, so it’s like 7 left for 7 days. It’s still the same copay no matter how many it is, but I know what I’m paying for.” -P1

>”Just the medication, the milligrams, and who prescribed it, a lot of people have different doctors, so that kind of does help. With that info, you can call someone and get what you need with it.” -P5


>”I don't think who prescribed it is necessary…Reference is not necessary. For accounting purposes, I'm sure, for them, not you or me.
Moderator: “And in terms of the description like it says, the name of the medication, 10 milligram tablets, 30 count, 30 day supply?”
“That's good. The Rx number is not necessary because it doesn't mean anything to me. It doesn't mean anything to the Veteran.” -P7

>”Helpful to see this amount of detail!” (comparing costs in VA and outside of VA due to financial hardship) -P10

Suggestions for improvement included: 

- The order date is most helpful 
- Billing reference was mentioned as unhelpful by most

Quotes: 

>”I like that amount of detail. One thing that would be useful would be the number of refills that are left. Let's say I'm running low on it, and I misplaced the text message that says you have a refill coming up. Do I still have one available? I had an issue with that recently, I received a text 2 months before I needed to refill. I hopped online and it came up with a warning saying ‘You need to contact your provider.’ What the heck?” -P4

>”Because, you know. I don't always know when I'm gonna receive it. And I think that's more consistent for me to know when it was prescribed. And you know the date that prescription went in versus when I'm actually going to get it, because it could be anywhere up to 10 days before I receive it.” -P10

>”Prescribing doctor is not necessary, billing reference is not necessary to me.” -P7


**Outpatient care copay**


The majority of participants said the information was helpful:
Department or clinic name
Name of diagnosis* (some PHI concerns)
Doctor’s name

Keeping this section simple seems preferable based on participant feedback. 

>”This is okay because I go to my doctor, for, like my knee, or like my blood pressure, or whatever this is actually good, because then, if I go multiple times, I don't remember what I paid for and what I did.” -P1

>”That one looks fine, too. It's telling me what kind of care I was going for at that particular date and who the doctor was.” -P4 

>”Hypertension and the doctor's name might be important if you have outpatient care, I don't. So that's not important to me. But I would assume if I did, that would be important. So that particular 1st line date is important. -P7 (This participant only received copays for prescriptions)

>”So it's good detail. I mean, you know enough detail for me to know what it is.” -P10

>”Since this is just a billing, we don't really necessarily have to put the doctor's name in there. I mean we don't. This is a matter of billing. So it's really numbers. and you can kind of keep it simple.” -P9


2 participants mentioned it would be helpful if it could link to an external location for more details: 

>”It only says what you're there for, nothing else that I don't know… It's got the doctor, of course, and why you're there. I might want more information, but it wouldn't necessarily have to be in this box… I would might want a link to the details of that on outpatient care.” -P3

>”Unless you're a doctor, you don't really need all of that so maybe just have this part just as prescription copay and the number, and then the amount. And then on a separate page, if it said like something like more details, then you would click it, and then it would show everything.” -P12


Three participants mentioned sensitivities around reading a diagnosis in the outpatient copay description: 

>”It's a little scary, like, not scary, it's like, I don't wanna know. I don't wanna remind myself that I'm going there for that. Okay. Cause I already know I'm going. Maybe for behavioral health, I don't wanna know.” -P1


>”If this was public I wouldn't want it”. -P3


>”Some people do get a little defensive and say they don't want to be diagnosed with that.” -P5 (Participant who works in a healthcare department)

A few participants were confused by the outpatient care copays because the examples did not say “copay” at the end (like in the prescription copay lines). The moderator clarified this during the interview. It will be important to have the word ‘copay’ at the end of every description for clarity in the live experience. 


**Inpatient care copay**

While we did not focus on inpatient care copays as extensively, we did gather some feedback. 

2 participants mentioned these details in common as being helpful: 

- Date of admit

Other ideas that were mentioned were: 
- What was wrong
- Diagnosis and prescriptions
- Date of discharge
- Location
- Name of Doctor

We believe that the dates of the stay may be the most important piece of information for a Veteran to understand the resulting charges. A more in depth study that includes more participants who had inpatient stays would be helpful in determining this information. 

Quotes: 

>”I guess the time that I was actually there. What exactly was wrong with me and, you know, how many days, what exactly what I was prescribed with, or, you know, diagnosed with. What they prescribed for me to take, and the date I was discharged.”  P10

> “The facility, the doctor, the admittance date, and then any fees or associated costs.” P12

**Alert Component**

The information in the alert component was easy to understand. Participants could easily find the due date and current balance. 

**Copay Detail Section**

The copay details section after the yellow alert component and before the statement caused confusion because it referenced activity outside of the current month. 


**Rights and responsibilities**

The Rights and responsibilities modal link is currently on the combined Copay Detail and Resolve Page. On the prototype it is only placed on the Copay Details page. It is worth exploring the placement in future studies. In a past study it was called out as pertinent information. In this study, a participant, unprompted, noted its importance. 

> “‘Notice of rights and responsibility’. You might want to put that at the top of the sheet instead of the bottom… Some people are extremely…they want to know that information almost more than they want to know anything else. Because rights and responsibilities covers a lot of area…” Moderator: “Do you feel that way as well?”
“Not so much, because well several years ago yes, I did, because the information just wasn't there. There's been a lot of changes since then, and it's improved a lot. So now I generally have a clue before I get to this page, but I would like it in a larger box and towards the top maybe…” -P3


### <a id="finding-4"></a> Finding 4: Resolve page
Participants easily understood each section: Pay online, Pay by phone, pay by mail, pay in person, request financial help, dispute this bill. 

As noted on the VBA research study, several participants expressed frustration with needing to go to a separate site, pay.gov, to pay their bill. 

>”Yes, you have to go to pay.gov directly. I mean, I'm just gonna be honest, I hate that I have to go somewhere else. It's like I'm already here, like I'm already logged in… now you go to pay.gov, and then I hate this account number thing. And then if you mess up typing it, it's like you have to delete all of it. It's really hard to enter, and it's like, I don't know, it skips to the next box.” -P1


A few participants noted that this page was lengthy and wanted a way to quickly view each section.
> “Even if these were dropdowns, these could be tabs at the top, you know ways to pay, and then it drops down, and it hyperlinks to a completely separate page.” -P12

### <a id="finding-5"></a> Finding 5: Service design

- Participants were able to easily find and understand the Resolve page and all of the options available to them. Three participants who had not used the debt portal before were not aware of all of the ways they could resolve their bill, including requesting financial help. There is room for improvement on raising awareness to Veterans who receive copays and do not access the debt portal that financial help is available to them.
- We let Veterans who were not aware of these options know that these financial help options are available today.

Participants who were not aware of financial assistance: P3, P10, P12


There is also room for improvement on the details for each copay transaction. Several participants noted that the details in the prototype were more helpful than the information they received on their mailed copay statement. 

>”I know my bill has this stuff, but it's not, you don't really read it, because it’s like old, old way, like a bill…So I know what I’m paying for, it's easier here and it’s great you can read it.” -P1


>”I saw it on the bill, the actual bill, and I didn't understand why, you know, I did not have to pay previously for the doctor. And now I did, and honestly, what it's caused me to do is not want to go to the VA for my health care, and I've actually not gone because I didn't want to incur any more expenses. And I started, my husband is disabled, so I found out this year that I actually could utilize the Medicaid, so I switched a few of my medicines to picking them up from Medicaid. But now I don't know what my situation will be and you know, not getting the medicine that I need, because I didn't want to incur any more bills. Because I honestly didn’t understand how it worked.” -P10

> “You know what I did. I just made it my own. I just send what I could send. I didn't bother, you know. I didn't know I could make a compromise offer or repayment plan. I just sent what I had available, and wait until the next time…
I did not know they were available. I didn't know you could dispute them. I never, never, actually, because I normally kind of. Know my bills and stuff, have an idea what to expect.  I've never had a cause for a waiver or a compromise, but a repayment plan back in the past would have been really nice. I'm glad that's there. ‘Request help for future health care’, ‘Hardship determination’. That's interesting. And I think we've got Vets that could use that, I would put money on it actually.” -P3


- There might be a link between Veterans over 65 who are on a fixed income and/or facing financial hardship and having a need to budget in advance to avoid any/further financial strain. Additionally, Veterans over 65 wanted more assurance to confirm payments they made and to understand the copay fees they’ve incurred. Memory loss was mentioned as making it more difficult to keep track of bills and payments. 

> “I would like to see the payment as close as humanly possible. I don't know how long it takes to process payments, but it would be nice to know. If I paid today, I wouldn't mind seeing a receipt as soon as humanly possible. Why? I'm forgetful. I forget I paid bills.” - P3

## Additional Insights

**Combined Debt Portal Mental Models:**

**Overall Overview page**

If time allowed, some participants saw the Overall Overview page that contained a card with a summary of overpayments and a card with a summary of copays. Not all of the participants understood what VA debt/overpayment was as they had never received an overpayment from the VA before. 

>”If it's VA overall, then I understand it because I don't have any of the other programs. But now I'm reading up here, you know, disability, the pension plans, all that is part of the VA… it consolidates it so you're just having an overview right now. Then it's allowing you to go to the next pages, so you can resolve it further, you know, or look at it, or view it.” -P10

While most participants did not know about VA overpayments, a few participants said combining VA copay bills and other types of money owed to VA makes sense to them. One participant said it would be helpful to have this information filtered. 

**Trauma informed findings:** 
Participants were not asked about concerns with PHI and privacy/security, but a few commented on this without prompting: 

P3 wanted to be ensured that the information contained in the copay description details is not public information:

> ​​"If this was public I wouldn't want it" (copay description details) -P3

 P1 said it was triggering to see mental health diagnosis.

>”It's a little scary, like, not scary, it's like, I don't wanna know. I don't wanna remind myself that I'm going there for that. Okay. Cause I already know I'm going. Maybe for behavioral health, I don't wanna know.” -P1

P7 thought phone numbers listed on VA.gov may be unsafe as they were wary of scammers. 
>"Another thing is the 888 number to pay the debt…They can hack anything. Evidently the VA has been hacked or something because they're switching everything around the 1st of the year. And I'm computer literate and couldn't set up an account in their system." -P7

Screen reader user stated that the term "warning" was triggering.

>”I don't know if it's because of my military background, and what I did because warnings in my regs, for when me, with me being a flyer in the Air Force ‘warnings’ meant potentially death…. as soon as I seen ‘warning’ it made me want to swipe to see what it was. What's the warning? So I just, it just made me pay close attention is what it did.” -P16

One participant talked about the difficulty of signing up for VA healthcare, which she received recently. She mentioned the PACT act helped:
>
>"It was a nightmare. I had to fight for years for it. Initially got denied and had to keep submitting information, the PACT act helps get things approved.” -P5 

A participant reached a point of frustration with the debt portal copay prototype experience. While we reviewed a part of the prototype with him, the rest of the session was used as a listening session where he shared his experiences related to VA healthcare and how the VA has changed. Some Veterans may never use the debt portal so it is important to meet them where they are and make all paths to reviewing and resolving bills as easy as possible (see Finding 5: Service Design).

>”You've seen how much difficulty I have with online things. It's MyHealth or myVAhealth.com, or whatever it's called. Anytime there's even the slightest change on there it throws me completely off balance. Once I learn how to navigate it, how to maybe ask for refills or blah blah. Even the slightest changes caused me a headache. So pay online. I'm not even gonna try. You've already seen how much trouble I have with this.” -P2

**Trauma informed interviews:**

A through line in this study and previous studies on VA debt and copay bills has been the importance of trauma-informed moderating. 
In every interview we are being **trauma informed** by:

Setting expectations before the interview begins:

- The purpose of the study, the moderator’s role, the sensitive nature of what will be discussed and a choice to opt out of questions, take a break, or end the interview at any time. 
- Taking time to build rapport before the formal interview begins.
- Actively listening during the interview
- Team preparedness should difficult moments arise
- Daily debriefs for the team and observers to understand and unpack each interview


## <a id="recommendations"></a>Recommendations

**Copay details page (page with most need for improvement)**

**Debt Details section**
We recommend simplifying this section or further differentiating information from the current statement and information from the past statement (amount paid). 

**Pending transactions**

A majority of participants did not find pending transactions helpful so it is not necessary to include this information, especially if an amount will not be shown. If necessary to add, we can consider moving Activity since last statement (pending transactions) after the information that directly relates to the statement at hand, to minimize confusion and provide this info to Veterans that it can be helpful to (possibly a minority)

**Copay transaction details**

Work with Lighthouse team and VHA stakeholders to further understand and refine the data displayed for each type of copay transaction.

**Resolve page**

Several participants noted that this was a lot of content to scroll through. It would be helpful to add the On this page component with anchor links to Pay, Request help, and Dispute the bill.

## Next Steps

The recommendations for pending transactions and copay description details have been shared with the Lighthouse team to inform their efforts as they structure the API. 

Continue to work with Lighthouse team and VHA stakeholders to further understand and refine the data displayed for each type of copay transaction.

## <a id="further-research-needed"></a>Further research needed
The team needs further research to gather more information on:
- Validating how much variation is acceptable between online HTML statements and mailed/PDF statements
- Validating statement data from Lighthouse (when we have more specific data to test)
- What copay description fields are helpful for the inpatient copay details

The research from this study and the accompanying [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1727450668943/478ab5b6198f786e8aeb03f72fc99096a067e6c6?sender=u144a57b408dc250f8de06881) where we synthesized and analyzed the data can be used as a starting point for Veteran archetypes specific to those receiving VA care and paying copay bills. We expect these archetypes will likely be a combination of Veteran health archetypes and Veteran financial hardship archetypes.
