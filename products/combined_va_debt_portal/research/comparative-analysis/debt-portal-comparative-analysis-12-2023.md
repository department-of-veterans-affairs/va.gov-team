## Debt Portal Comparative Analysis  
12/2023

## Background

In [previous research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/research-findings.md) for the Debt Portal, some participants noted that they felt there were too many pages and that important features were hidden.

Summary of some of the comments that were made about the issues on the Debt Portal:

-   One participant felt the payment button was hidden
    
-   One participant stated he would have liked to see the Notice of rights and responsibilities link featured on the first page
    
-   “If anything is missing it is links to the new travel pay system. That would be a one stop shop. We all love one stop shopping.”
    
-   "...I would rather have one page with all the information. I don’t feel it is necessary to click through four to five pages to get all your information".
    
-   “I’m not intending to scroll because I’m intending to pay a copay. Now, I’m looking down here and you want me to call somewhere? This landing page does nothing for me in accomplishing my goal."  
      
    



## Goals

## This comparative analysis aimed to observe the following:

-   How do sites show a summary of bills?
    
-   How do they organize the contents of a bill?
    
-   How do they show actions for specific bills?
    
-   How can users pay their bills?
    
-   How do they display an account number (if applicable)? (This is needed to pay on Pay.gov and Pay.VA.gov)
    

  

This analysis will look at the following sites:


1.  The Debt Portal contains information on both copays as well as overpayments. For this comparative analysis we’re interested in health care related sites as well as sites that focus on loan payments.
   
      -   Labcorp – Clinical laboratory
    
      -   MyQHealth – Health insurance portal
    
      -   Navient – Student loans
    

  

2.  The second portion of this analysis will look at accompanying sites that users will navigate to either make medical appointments or pay their copays or overpayment debt
    
      -   Pay.gov – used to pay copays
    
      -   Pay.VA.gov – used to pay overpayments
    
      -   MyHealtheVet – healthcare hub that displays links to handle medical care such as making a doctor’s appointment.
    
    

  
  

## LabCorp

Labcorp’s billing section is easy to navigate to via the main navigation bar.

Each bill summary is displayed within a card. The card prominently displays the invoice number and the primary link, “View Receipt”, on each card goes to a PDF statement for the selected invoice. If a user received a paper bill but it hasn’t appeared on their online account, they can pay the bill by entering the invoice number, zip code, and date of birth.

## MyQHealth

  

MyQHealth by Quantum Health is an insurance portal. The screenshots display medical insurance claims. Users navigate to this page by selecting the “My claims” section on the dashboard homepage after logging in. On desktop, the left column is a fixed column that does not move on scroll and displays ways for users to contact their Care Coordinator.

After clicking on the “Recent Claims” section on the homepage, users will see that information is not displayed in cards like we saw on Labcorp but as horizontal components (screenshot below). The name of the provider is prominently listed on the top left and a button, “View Details” is displayed on the bottom right of the component. A less prominent link with a small icon to indicate that it is a PDF is displayed on the left under the claim number. This link takes users to the Explanation of Benefits.
Above these components are tabs to separate doctor visit claims with prescription claims. It is also possible to search, print, or download claims. Users can display claims by year, member, they can also sort by date of service, insurance paid, and total paid.

Below are screenshots of what the user sees when they select the “View Details” button. It contains information that you will find in the “Explanation of Benefits” PDF link but in a more easy to read format than the PDF.

## Navient

As not all VA debt is healthcare related, it can be caused by disability compensation, education, or pension benefit overpayment. We want to get a sense of how sites that focus on repayment from education loans are structured. Compared to the health care focused sites above, Navient’s interface is not as well structured and the information is not as easy to digest. Not seen on the screenshots is a “Chat with us” button that stays stationary on the page and sometimes blocks information, especially on mobile.

  

This is what users see after they sign in. There are two buttons at the top of the page that allow the user to either select “Quick pay” or “Custom pay”.

Users see the following page after clicking the “View All loan Details” link within the “Your Loans” section. Each loan has an accordion that does not seem necessary as it only condenses and hides two lines of information. All information is displayed  

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/comparative-analysis/images/Navient-loan-start-page.png" width="70%" alt="Navient all loans">  
  

Below is the page users see after they click on a specific loan from the “All Loan Details” page. Seeing a percentage and bar graph of how much has been paid off of the principal and how much is still left helps users understand the full picture.

The “Account History” page is seen after users click the “View all Account History” on the homepage after signing in. Users can see previous actions and payments. Users can sort and filter based on date and type of transaction.

A takeaway from Navient is that the overpayments section on the VA Debt Portal could be more focused on showing what users have paid down on an overpayment and how much they have left to pay.

Above we see the detail page for an overpayment debt. Overpayments may be large amounts which can be overwhelming and stressful to see. Users may think their only option may be to pay it off in one payment. On the Overpayment details page on the left, an action link that reads “Request help with your debt” takes users to the FSR. It could be more clear that “help” involves breaking down the payments instead of them having to pay one lump sum. After a user has been approved for a monthly payment plan, they see the screenshot on the right. The page on the right does not show the total amount due, what has been paid, what is still owed, and when their monthly payment is due.

  
  

## Sites that Veterans with Copays or Overpayments may interact with

## Pay.gov

[https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/25987221](https://www.pay.gov/public/form/start/25987221)

  
  

Without logging in, we are able to view the first step on the progress bar, “Before you begin”. This page notes that users will need their VA account number and payment amount of account balance. The request for the amount due tells us that the account number will not pull up the dollar amount so Veterans will need to know how much they owe and enter it manually.




Below is a preview of the form that can be found on the “Preview Form” button. This is a helpful feature that allows users to know what to expect before signing in.

Users can click on the blue “Where do I find my Account Number?” link on the Account Number section to see the Account Number section on their bill highlighted in red.

## Pay.VA.gov

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/comparative-analysis/images/pay.va.gov-intro.png" width="70%" alt="Pay.VA.gov introduction">

From previewing the form, we can see that users will need their File Number, Payee Number, Deduction Code, and Payment Amount. Unlike Pay.gov, it does not appear that there is a link that serves as a guide to show users where they can find that information. Additionally, the information is hidden on the Debt Portal. Users will have to know to navigate directly to the individual overpayment details page and open the accordion, “Pay online”. Users are also currently unable to access their Debt Letters on the Debt Portal as they were taken down temporarily.

Below is a screenshot of the “Debt Details” page on an overpayment. The information needed to pay a bill on Pay.VA.gov is under the accordion, “Pay online”.

## MyHealtheVet

[https://staging.va.gov/my-health/](https://staging.va.gov/my-health/)


MyHealtheVet is moving to VA.gov. This page acts as a healthcare hub and provides what participants in the past study have referred to as “one stop shopping”. Veterans can find links to make doctor appointments, view lab results, message their doctor, be reimbursed for travel to appointments and pay their copay bill. Primary information is displayed in cards in categories with a maximum of 3 links per card.

A link to file a claim for travel reimbursement is next to the pay copay bills. At least one participant had noted that this information belongs together as Veterans will have a travel claim after traveling to a doctor’s appointment.
