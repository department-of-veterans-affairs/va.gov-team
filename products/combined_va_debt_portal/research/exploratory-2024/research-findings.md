## Research Goals

First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new). [See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Then, describe your goals for this research

### OCTO Priorities

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

-   Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
    

Additionally:

-   Decrease Veteran confusion and time it takes to review, manage or resolve their debt
    
-   Optimize Veteran experience and align to Veteran feedback
    
-   Allow DMC, VHA and others to promote a singular experience to Veterans to ease in communications and access to portal financial matters
    

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

Other key moments this research touches key moments in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    
What are you trying to learn from this research?

### Goal 1: Exploratory and foundational

To understand the desirability of a holistic debt portal experience and what Veterans would like to see in one. We will present reaction/idea cards on slides with a word on them for Veterans to give feedback on.

Reaction card terms/ideas:

-   Financial hub
    
-   My VA benefits overview
    
-   Financial resources
    
-   Explain financial terms
    
-   Frequently asked questions
    
-   Personalization
    
-   One stop shop
    
-   Manage my VA debt benefits overpayments
    
-   Manage my copay bills
    
-   Benefits payment
    
-   Travel pay
    
-   Separation pay
    
-   Statement
    
-   Update dependents
    
-   Mobile app
    

### Goal 2: Conceptual and generative

To understand if the combined nature of the debt portal with copayment statements, overpayment debt, and the possibility of other types of debt in one place is desirable and easy to understand, versus separating these into their own pages.

Some participants during the [2022 debt portal research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/research-findings.md) stated they felt there were too many pages and that important features were hidden. The Revised Flow takes out one page, the Overview page, and instead displays all individual copay and overpayment cards on one page.

Since many of the actions that Veterans can take on their copays and overpayments are unique to either VHA or VBA, there are limits on how far we can reduce the number of pages.

### Option 1: Current flow

Original Concept for Debt Portal Copay + Debt Landing page (Current flow):

-   This will allow Veterans to see an overview of all the money they owe VA in one place, which meets Congressional mandates + our users’ expectations
    
-   How the VHA copays and VBA debt data varies won’t be as evident if Veterans drill down into those separate debt types
    
-   Having an overview page instead of showing all detailed debt cards in one view can reduce cognitive load. It could be overwhelming to see a long list of items, especially when it comes to something as sensitive as debts. Copay Email > Debt Portal Unauth page > Debt Portal Summary page > Debt Portal Copay Summary page
    

P1, P2, P4, P5, P6, P8 reviewed this version first:

Current path:  [https://codepen.io/team/Debt-Team/live/XWGQxjz](https://codepen.io/team/Debt-Team/live/XWGQxjz)


### Option 2: Revised flow

Copay Email > Debt Portal Unauth page > Debt Portal Summary page with all debts listed

P9, P10, P11 reviewed this version first:

## Research Questions


#### Part 1: Exploratory and Foundational

- What are Veterans thoughts and preferences about a holistic debt portal vs a simpler one? We will share reaction cards with words/concepts on them (i.e.: “financial resources”, “one stop shop”, etc.) and get Veterans thoughts.
    
- Where do Veterans in different types of financial situations land with a holistic experience vs a simpler one?
    

#### Part 2: Conceptual and Generative

- How would Veterans prefer to see their copays and overpayments?
    
- Does removing the copay + overpayment overview page help Veterans more quickly access information?
    
- Does it increase cognitive burden to see all copay + overview cards at once? The average number of copays within 6 months is three. (It is possible to have 180+ copays within 6 months.)
    
- What would help Veterans easily digest the information on the debt portal?
    

## Methodology


-   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
    
-   Concept study
    
-   [Reaction cards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G7MVZX-w3jyhobl80WlBTUdWMhKVvtKbqX2NqV0uQZQ/edit#slide=id.p) for exploratory research
    

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

#### We hypothesize that Veterans in more difficult financial situations (i.e. experiencing greater financial strain) will want more resources in the debt portal, hence they will lean more towards a holistic debt portal experience.
    
This is likely true. Although we expected to find a correlation between financial hardship and a greater desire to see a holistic debt portal experience, it would seem that Veterans experiencing less financial hardship are also likely to expect a holistic debt portal experience, though a few prefer or expect a more simple experience. Although 2 of 9 participants expressed that they don’t view the VA as a financial resource, the majority expressed interest in a holistic, comprehensive solution.
    


#### Based on previous research in 2022, hypothesis 2: ‘Participants will expect to find their copay bills and benefit debts in one location’ was likely true. We expect that the combined nature of the debt portal will be consistent with the idea of a “one stop shop” echoed by participants across various studies, and that the different types of debt being combined will be easy to understand and desirable.
    
This is maybe true. There was almost an even split between participants preferring to see different types of debt combined on one page (combined), and participants preferring that the different types of debt have their own pages (separate).
    
- A preference for the combined path was indicative of valuing speedier access to important content and actions and efficiency (requiring less clicks and easier findability).
    
- A preference for the separated path was indicative of valuing chunking or splitting of different ideas, perhaps making it easier to process cognitively. Those who favored this path felt that the combined path was “distracting” or “annoying”.

## Details of Findings

#### Finding 1: 
### Veterans we spoke to echoed a desire for a financial portal that is first and foremost easy to use and simple.

On one end, participants wanted to quickly find the information they needed and quickly act on it (such as making a payment). Additionally, participants valued transparency to understand why they owe what they owe, in order to make an informed decision or contest/dispute a bill or a debt.

Participants spoke about financial planning and some expressed a desire to get help with more comprehensive financial aspects of their future such as retirement, VA home loans, and benefits that are available to them. There was also a need to see a breakdown of benefits payments (such as what benefits will they lose if their dependent turns 18).

*Label: PRDT: Debt-portal*

>“Don’t overcomplicate it, keep it simple…If 90% of my questions could be answered from the [VA.gov] homepage from data points feeding into it, that’d be great. It’s when you start digging through the VA website and you end up with some legacy snap-on component, that is how it feels from the main site, it is when it starts feeling kinda clunky… At a certain point I just stop.” -P8

#### Finding 2: 
### Participants all echoed that a one stop shop includes the convenience of doing the most important actions in one place.

-   Seeing my bills and paying my bills at a minimum
    
-   But also: know why I have the bill, what I need to pay it
    
-   2 participants said they would like to see financial recommendations and get help with other things like retirement
    
-   Another participant said he has TBI and being required to login several times to access different areas of VA.gov is difficult
    
>[Do you imagine that these different aspects would be in one place?] <br>“I think the VA is trying to go there and I think it will be good because, like I said, the VA is segregated. It’s segregated to the Veteran because you actually have to go to each one to do it rather than just one spot” -P1

#### Finding 3: 
### The feedback on personalization was mixed. Overall, there was some interest in having a financial hub that surfaces content most important to the participant.

One participant understood personalization as customization. Another said he would prefer that VA prioritize efficiency over personalization, and another was worried that her personal information could be hacked. The 5 of 9 participants that spoke favorably of personalization liked it for different reasons. One mentioned they would like to see the status of their claim. 2 others mentioned they would be interested in a personalized feed with content relevant to them. One participant said he would like to see the information that is most important to him surfaced to the top of the page.

>“I don’t know if this would be helpful. I mean, what are we personalizing? It’s not like we can personalize our benefits or whatever health[care] you’re gonna get.” -P1*


>“That would be awesome. That way everybody could rearrange things the way they want to see them.” -P11**


#### Finding 4:
### Most participants thought "Financial Resources" and "Financial Terms" would be helpful.

Participants self-identified as one of 3 groups: "I am currently experiencing financial hardship", "I have experienced financial hardship in the past", or "I have never experienced financial hardship". The majority of participants in all groups, 7 of 9 participants, thought the addition of this information would be helpful.

Three out of the 4 participants who selected "I am currently experiencing financial hardship" on the screener thought this information would be helpful.

Many stated that defining difficult financial terms when they are mentioned on the VA.gov would be helpful. One participant stated that the government sometimes has different definitions of general financial terms.

**Financial Resources:**

>“Yes absolutely I would hope. Is this directly with debt or is this any kind? I think that having the resources, especially if someone had been unexpectedly put into debt, here are payment options or different things you could refinance. Giving people ideas instead of just a glaring number of this is what you owe,would be super overwhelming to a lot of people.” –P6

>“That would definitely be helpful whether you have a debt or not. It could help with easing your mind.” -P2

>“That would be a good place for assistance with copays, maybe financial classes, links for resources, mortgage calculator. Would be a good place for the VA Home Loan stuff.” -P11

**Financial Terms:**

>That totally needs to be on there. I take for granted sometimes that I understand some things but you have to consider that not everyone has a background in anything like this. -P6

>"Yes, because people don’t tend to know unless you are a CPA or worked at a bank for a longtime. You don’t really know stuff about that. I don’t know if it would have helped in the past but I have learned a lot since my accident. I am not an airmen anymore and have a lot of downtime so I do YouTube research and read articles. When I deep dove into stocks, retirement, pension, crypto... I am not saying put every single term in there but put the ones that are necessary for the hub." -P2

>“There's times I try to find something out and then once I figure it out I forget where I saw it. So going back and starting over. Having the terms explained in depth and how it could hurt you or benefit you. overall what it means.” P11

**Some participants did not see VA as a resource for financial information:**

>“You don’t really look at the VA for financial resources, you’re looking for your benefits and health… It’s not really like they’re there for that.” -P1

>“That’s kind of a weird question for me because I don’t think of the VA as a financial place, like I would have a bank." -P6

#### Finding 5: 
### All participants were excited about the potential of a mobile app and the ability to manage their VA bills and debt in the mobile app.

Many participants had used the mobile but noted that the mobile app does not have all of the capabilities that VA.gov has. They stated they would like for the mobile app to support the functionality that the Debt Portal on VA.gov has such as viewing copays and paying them.

*Labels: PRDT: VA-mobile-app*

>“It is more informative when I would like to see more actionable items on it.” -P8

>“It’s fairly simple, all I use it for is to see the appointment time… check in when I get there sometimes… It is pretty well managed and well stocked on what needs to be done.” -P5

#### Finding 6: 
### When asked for thoughts on "Travel Pay" many commented on difficulties both in person and online.

Not all participants were eligible for Travel Pay as their VA Medical location was not far from them. Many participants stated that they saw very long lines at the office that processes Travel Pay at VA Medical locations.

For those who were eligible for Travel Pay and had submitted a claim online, they stated that the online form was a "clunky system".

The participants further stated that a way to address travel pay in a portal would be helpful.

Labels: PRDT: Travel-reimbursement

>"That is something not a lot of people understand.. I feel like there’s a lot of people who do not do it because they don't understand how to. It would be good to not only give them the information but for them to be able to submit… There’s a window at the VA hospital where there are three people behind really thick panes of glass and a whole lotta aggravated standing around trying to get service." -P6

>“You just hit one of the biggest sore spots for me. It’s an absolutely horrible system, this is one of the snap-on systems… On the VA.gov landing page there is a link there to file for travel pay, then it takes you to another site that looks like it’s from the 90’s, then you have to click on another button to get to the travel pay… You go through a series of snaps to get to your travel pay, it’s a really clunky system. I always put in my direct deposit information but I end up getting paper checks in the mail.” -P8

 

#### Finding 7: 
### There was almost an even split between participants preferring to see different types of debt combined on one page (combined), and participants preferring that the different types of debt have their own pages (separate).

**Original Concept:**  
Participants that preferred the original version (overview + split into type of debt) liked it for the following reasons:

-   Some liked seeing the overall amount first for copays and overpayment debts. They mentioned they would like the convenience of paying the entire bill at once as opposed to individual bills
    
-   One Veteran described it as "choose your own adventure"
    
-   Another Veteran said he liked one thing per page as he gets distracted easily
    
-   They preferred the specificity of individual type of debt pages
    

Participants that disliked the original version mentioned disliking the extra step of having to click into an additional page to see bill details. One participant also mentioned that big debt amounts can be shocking to see. This same participant mentioned that an extra step can be triggering and can lead to a Veteran getting frustrated or triggered and shutting down the computer.

**Quotes supporting the original concept:**

>“For me, I get distracted easily and if you put one thing on one page it would be easier for me. I’d say that I like the first way better. If I had a copy I'd like to see what I had on one page instead of seeing everything like this.” –P4

>“More like a drill down would be better. When you get too many words on a page your eyes start to glaze over.” –P6

>“So basically instead of having all copays and current debts it breaks it out. I like it when you can make it a choice of your own adventure. Like all debts then copays to get more information but I also don’t want to scroll through every site.” –P6

>“Its all on one page, I think I prefer this because at a glance it is all there which I would hope for that and get more details by clicking into it. There’s something annoying about scrolling. This is more comprehensive for me, like I can see the total debt. This is more clear. Wow there are a lot of options, great.” –P9*

>“Okay, yeah. It's more consolidated there. I like this better. It is consolidated and I don’t need to go to every single bill. I can see I have 3 copays that I will pay off right away. And two outstanding debts I could make a payment plan. It is itemized. It could be more efficient with bigger boxes. like here’s a big box, pay 95 or going back instead of check balance have a pay all. Most people know they have to pay copays so just let me pay them.” –P11

**Revised Concept:**

Participants that preferred the revised version (all types of debt on one page) liked it for the following reasons:

-   They described it as "all right here"
    
-   They like being taken directly to where they need to go
    
-   They like less clicks
    
-   They like that the different types of debt are chunked into their own sections
    
-   They liked that they don't have to dig too deep
    

Participants that disliked the revised concept mentioned there was too much scrolling and too much information all at once.

**Quotes supporting the revised concept:**

>“The easier it can be made the better because not knowing the state of mind for the veteran or the disability that extra step could cause some people to shut the computer and not look at it again. It only takes one thing. The easier the better off especially for those with TBI or PTSD. PTSD is horrible and hate for it to be triggered over that.” –P10

>"I can't click on the next one, I have to back out and do another, whereas here you can see it and pay it." –P1

>“The layout, it looks like a statement to me and like you said everything in one place you have it all here and you don’t need to search high or low to pay off the pension stuff then where do I go for the gi payment. No its all right here.” –P2

>“I guess the one on the right breaks it down more than the left side. The one on the left says 3 copays where the right shows the three different bills instead of clicking to see what they are… There’s an extra step, I would rather the right side so you don’t have the extra step.” –P5

>“This gets more to where I want to go and what I have seen in the past with DFAS where things are together and in a simple format without having to dig too deep. Even if this was on the main page, maybe that personalized screen has debts, copays, and then takes you here.” –P8

>“Eliminate the clicks as much as possible. It will make it easier.” –P8


**In order to act on this feedback, we should consider all of the pathways users can take to get to the Debt Portal.**

Emails: Tested in this study. Veterans would prefer less clicks. If the email states that it is for a Copay, it should take them to a Copay page. If the email states that it is for an Overpayment, it should take them to an Overpayment page.

MyVA: Links separately to either the Copay Overview or Overpayment Overview.

MyHealtheVet: Links to Copay Summary page.

Google: Veterans can find varying VA.gov pages depending on their search term.

VA.gov Homepage: In a past study, the most common way participants found the Debt Portal on the VA.gov homepage was through clicking the Payment History page. A link on the Payment History page takes users to the Debt Portal landing page.

*Label: PRDT: Debt-portal*


#### Finding 8: 
### Participants highlighted the importance of surfacing important information sooner so they may view, pay, track, and understand the bill, and take follow up action if needed (such as disputing).

Some participants mentioned wanting to see more information on what the copay charge was for

The information that participants would want to see on a copay charge were:

-   Date of the service
    
-   Type of service
    

  
Detailed copay information is available on statement pages on the copay detail page. One participant noted that the statement information that he receives in the mail is not as detailed as he would like and he sometimes has to call the VA. He stated that they are able to give him more details over the phone.

It would be worth looking into ways we can improve and surface statement data sooner during the user journey. The statement page was not included in this study as it was not the focus of this research. During the last [Debt Portal study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/research-findings.md) all participants were able to locate their statement information.

Participants expressed that they can receive multiple services in a day, and it would be easier to track down and understand the charges if such details were included. These Veterans said that this transparency is important, in case there is a mistake or a double charge.

*Label: PRDT: Debt-portal*

**Quotes**:

>“It doesn’t say what it was about. It just says where the billing is coming from. It doesn’t say if it was an appointment or anything like that. To me the doctor is just as important as the other information. That way you know what you are paying for instead of stating April 1, 2024, you owe a blank amount. It doesn’t show what you are paying other than the balance.” -P5

>“I like it being all on one page but like I said I would rather know what you are paying for. Those details are very important. Was it for the doctor’s appointment or pharmacy.” -P5

>“I think that in this area if someone had 4 appointments in the same day at the same place. I would be curious to know where the copays were for. If I went to ortho and women’s health clinic, I would want to know if the copay was for the right appointment. That would be very important.” –P6

>“Card information, is this all you need: I would want the date of the appointment next to the amount and maybe some information about the appointment like PCM appointment this day or GYN on this day just to be clear. I would forget what it is. Especially if someone goes to the same place for all of their care it would be helpful to know the department/clinic name/ procedure. Something to delineate what the appointment was for.” -P9

>[Would it be important to have the date of service?]<br>
“Yes, so I can say yes I was there and to make sure they aren’t charging me twice. Or no I didn’t go to that appointment and I called you a week ahead telling you I couldn’t make it so I am not paying you that copay. So I would definitely want to see a date of service. Not just that I owe the copay but knowing the date and treatment or medication so I can make sure I was there and went to that visit.” –P10

  

## Additional Insights

-   When given the green light to imagine what would be helpful to them as they reflect on their experiences with VA finances/debt, most participants felt that financial resources and help would benefit them and/or other Veterans. Participants recognized that if not personally beneficial to them, it could benefit their peers.
  
  >"[Financial resources] If it will link me to documents it's not helpful but if there’s financial counselors to link up with and solve issues or tailor a budget. I am one that doesn’t want to read it. I want to sit down and talk to someone. It could be picking the best of homeowner insurers, automobiles, it has to be specifically tailored to the veteran. I am thinking of this in the aspect of a junior soldier, that’s the population that is not served well financially  in the service and they take lumps when they get out. This would be helpful for them when they get out.“ -P8

  >“No, not really. I am pretty knowledgeable on financial stuff so it wouldn’t help me. It could help others but not me.” -P5

    
-   Participants wanted to be informed of benefits that were available to them. They wanted to know about new laws that were passed that impact their current benefits and eligibility for benefits such as the PACT Act.
    

## Recommendations

Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings along with supporting evidence. Review with your team, then edit as needed.

Financial Hub Roadmap Recommendations:

-   Continue to validate financial hub/portal feature ideas and test with prototypes (addition of financial resources and explaining financial terms, allowing Veterans to take important actions on their debt in the mobile app, making it easier to update dependents, and adding travel pay reimbursement near copays)
    
-   Work with CAIA to update legacy financial literacy pages and incorportate them into the financial hub
    

Design Recommendations:

-   Combine the amount and the place or type of debt on the cards for those who use screen readers    

     -   One participant in this study used a screen reader and stated he thought the amount and reason for the amount was disconnected.
    

-   When a link mentions a specific type of debt, either a copay or an overpayment, the link should take the user to that specific place on the Debt Portal and not redirect the user to the Debt Portal landing page.
    

-   Many participants stated wanting to access information in fewer clicks.  
   > "You mentioned the $95 [copay] in the email, ok, take me to it." -P8
    

-   Work with the Pay.gov team to understand and improve the user journey from Debt Portal to payment.
    

      -   One participant had accidentally paid more than was due on their copay because it was not clear on Pay.gov how much they owed.
    

-   Deepen understanding of the statement data that is available and explore ways to surface statement data in a way that is easier to locate.

## Further research needed

If there are demographics that were not included in this study or you discovered that more research should be done, make note of that here.

-   Continue interviewing Veterans in different types of VA debt situations (benefits overpayments and medical debt)
    
-   Continue interviewing Veterans in different age groups/life stages (especially Veterans 18-25, and Veterans 65+)
    
-   Interview more Veterans that use assistive technology
