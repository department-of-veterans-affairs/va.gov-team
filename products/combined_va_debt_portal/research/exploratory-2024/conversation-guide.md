# Conversation Guide for Debt Resolution Team, Exploratory and Concept Study, Roadmap and debt portal IA, February 2024
## Prep/Getting to know you (10 minutes)

Welcome [name]! Thank you so much for your time today. How are you?

My name is Charlotte and I work on a team with other designers and researchers at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. [purpose, role] This work is meaningful to me because I believe that those who have served have a right to these services.  [meaning]

Today we will be talking about VA debt. We want to make the process of addressing VA finances and debt easier. My goal today is to learn from you what would make this online experience helpful and easy to use.

Next, I want to explain my role better. I am a consultant for the VA and my role is to talk to Veterans like you to understand the challenges you face in the space of VA debt. I am gathering information to help improve the experience of managing or resolving your debt. The limits of my role are that I am not the final decision maker on the experience, but I can surface issues and challenges that come up in research to the VA.

This will be a 2 part interview.

In the first part, we will be imagining together what this experience could look like. In the second part, I’ll share the current experience as well as another option we are thinking of, and ask for your feedback. [topic]

[Rapport building]

A couple of housekeeping things before we get started.

You’ll notice there are a few people on the call already. They’re my colleagues and they’re here to listen and to learn. Is that ok with you? [permission] [Turn on cameras and greet participant]

Your comfort and wellbeing are very important to us. Sensitive topics might come up, and if at any point you want to take a break, please let me know. If you don't feel comfortable answering certain questions, please let me know and we can move on. If you want or need to stop the interview at any point, just let me know. You will be compensated for your time regardless. [comfort and consent]

Finally, your identity will be kept confidential, and any information we take away from the interview will be stored securely. [confidentiality]

Do you have any questions for me? [opportunity to ask questions]

Just want to ensure the next 1 hour and 15 minutes are still good for you today? [time expectations]

-   Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to ensure we’ve captured your feedback accurately.  
      
    
-   If yes: Would you also be comfortable if we wound up using a short video clip of our session to help my internal colleagues learn from your experience? In these clips, we edit or blur out any information about participants, like your on-screen image. No feedback is attributed to participants by name. After analysis is complete, all session recordings are destroyed.
    
-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to ask for your confirmation again that you are okay with me recording this session and potentially sharing video clips with internal colleagues. [permission]
    

## [Service Experience/Context Building] (5-8 minutes)

This next question is for me to get to know you better as a Veteran, and it’s about the adaptation period after your service in the military.

When did you return to civilian life after your service, and what was the most surprising or challenging part about adapting back to civilian life?

Thank you for sharing your experiences. Next, we will move on to the VA debt portion of the interview.

## [Part 1: To understand the desirability of a holistic financial hub] (25 minutes)

As I mentioned earlier, in this interview we would like to learn from you about what an ideal/optimal financial and debt online experience would look like. As we’re talking today, please think about financial experiences you’ve had in the past or more recently, and what was great or not so great about them.

Can you please fill in this sentence:

“ When I think about a financial hub to manage my VA copays and VA benefits debts, the most important thing is that it…”

I have a few more questions:

-   Have you seen the VA.gov debt portal before?
    
-   What have you used this portal for in the past, if anything?
    
-   On a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being extremely helpful, and 1 being not at all helpful, how would you rate the helpfulness of this debt portal?
    
-   Have you had any VA debt before? This could be copay bills or VA benefits overpayment debt. If so, can you briefly tell me, what was the most challenging or most surprising part about the debt or the process of resolving it?
    

In this next part of the interview, I will be sharing some reaction cards with ideas we’ve thought could be a part of a financial hub or portal. Today, the current debt portal experience allows Veterans to get help with their VA benefits overpayment debt and copay bills, and make payments.

In a future version, we’d like to imagine what else could be a part of this experience. I’ll take you through these reaction cards one by one, and I’d like you to tell me if this is something you think would be helpful to have in this online experience, and why or why not.

I will be asking you follow up questions to understand more about your thoughts about these ideas. The information you share today will help us shape this future financial hub experience, so please remember to be honest with your feedback as we’d like to make this the best experience possible for Veterans like you.

Here is an example of a card. It’s simple, just a one word concept.

Ok, let’s get started.

When I think about an ideal portal on VA.gov to help me with my VA finances, it would be helpful if it had a section for…

  

Card 1 - 15

1.  Financial hub
    
2.  My VA benefits overview
    
3.  Financial resources
    
4.  Explain financial terms
    
5.  Frequently asked questions
    
6.  Personalization
    
7.  One stop shop
    
8.  Manage my VA debt benefits overpayments
    
9.  Manage my copay bills
    
10.  Benefits payment
    
11.  Travel pay
    
12.  Separation pay
    
13.  Statement
    
14.  Update dependents
    
15.  Mobile app
    

What are your thoughts on this idea?

Follow up questions to ask:

-   Why?
    

Probe to gather more info

  

-   Tell me more about that
    
-   Can you expand on that
    
-   What do you mean by that
    
-   How do you feel about that?
    

Gather underlying reasons and motivations: why people say or do certain things

  

-   Tell me why you felt that way.
    
-   Tell me why you did that
    
-   Why is that important to you?
    
-   Why does that stand out in your memory?
    

## Part 2: Debt Portal, immediately actionable feedback for debt portal (20 minutes)

  

In the first part of the interview, we imagined what an ideal financial hub would look like.

In this second part, I’m going to share with you what the current experience, known as the debt portal, looks like. I’ll be sharing 2 versions with you that we are considering.

Here is the link to the first version. Please take a moment to review it.

-   Do you have any immediate thoughts about the way the information is presented here?
    

  

Now I’m going to show you the second version of this debt portal.

  

-   What are your thoughts on this experience compared to the previous version?
    

In the first version, the debt portal summary page showed you your copay bills and VA overpayments debt on one page. Then, it took you to separate pages for copay bills and VA overpayments.

  

This second version showed the debt portal summary with all copays and overpayments cards on the same page.

  

-   Which layout makes more sense to you personally?
    

-   If I were to tell you that in the future we will have other types of money owed in this portal, how does that affect your thoughts about this experience? Would you prefer to see these all in one page, or in their own separate pages?
    

## Consent to use video clips – 1 minute

-   I want to return to the question I asked you at the beginning. After everything we’ve talked about today, are you still comfortable with me possibly sharing a video clip of this session with my VA colleagues?
    
-   As a reminder, I will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA colleagues with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
    

-   If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
    

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.

-   Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
    

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for all Veterans.

[End of session]
