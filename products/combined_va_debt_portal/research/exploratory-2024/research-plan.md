# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Exploratory and Concept Study, Roadmap and debt portal IA, February 2024

## Background

The first iteration of the debt portal had separate pages for overpayment debt and copayment statements. Veterans needed to visit the Debt Portal to see any benefit debts they had while they had to go to the Medical Copay Tool (a different place) to see any medical copays that they had acquired as a result of health care visits.

In 2021, a dashboard-like experience where Veterans are now able to see all of their VA debts, debt letters and copayment statements in one place was created. The overarching goal was to allow Veterans to view *all their VA debts online and decrease the time it takes to resolve those debts while meeting congressional mandates.

This solution has been designed to empower the Veteran to see all their debt and copayment statements. We envision it will also grow to include future options that can help the Veteran to manage those debts such as requesting a waiver, submitting a dispute, offering a compromise, setting up a payment plan, and viewing payments made towards their debts. When Veterans make a submission, that information is routed to VBA and/or VHA.

Research was conducted on Debt Letters (overpayments) ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/debt-letters-mvp/research)) in 2020, Medical copays ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research)) in 2021, Combined Debt Portal ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research)) in 2022. We seek to perform additional foundational, exploratory research that can inform the long term vision of the debt portal and the roadmap. We will also share the debt portal summary page in the second part of the interviews in order to understand whether overpayments and copays should continue to have their own summary pages.

  

### OCTO Priorities

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

-   Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

Additionally: 

-   Decrease Veteran confusion and time it takes to review, manage or resolve their debt
  
-   Optimize Veteran experience and align to Veteran feedback
    
-   Allow DMC, VHA and others to promote a singular experience to Veterans to ease in communications and access to portal financial matters
    

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

Other key moments this research touches key moments in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

## Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?


### Goal 1
**Exploratory and foundational**

To understand the desirability of a holistic debt portal experience and what Veterans would like to see in one. We will present reaction/idea cards on slides with a word on them for Veterans to give feedback on.

Reaction card terms/ideas:

-   Financial hub
    
-   My VA benefits overview
    
-   Financial resources
    
-   Explain financial terms
    
-   Frequently asked questions
    
-   Personalization
    
-   One stop shop
    
-   Manage my VA debt benefits overpayments
    
-   Manage my copay bills
    
-   Benefits payment
    
-   Travel pay
    
-   Separation pay
    
-   Statement
    
-   Update dependents
    
-   Mobile app
    

Example:

<img width="360" alt="reaction-cards" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/5553542/34e8e12f-cda9-4192-b5e5-946d3dfdf746">

  

### Goal 2
**Conceptual and generative**

To understand if the combined nature of the debt portal with copayment statements, overpayment debt, and the possibility of other types of debt in one place is desirable and easy to understand, versus separating these into their own pages. 

Some participants during the [2022 debt portal research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/research-findings.md) stated they felt there were too many pages and that important features were hidden. The Revised Flow takes out one page, the Overview page, and instead displays all individual copay and overpayment cards on one page. 

Since many of the actions that Veterans can take on their copays and overpayments are unique to either VHA or VBA, there are limits on how far we can reduce the number of pages.




### Option 1: Current flow
Original Concept for Debt Portal Copay + Debt Landing page (Current flow):

-   This will allow Veterans to see an overview of all the money they owe VA in one place, which meets Congressional mandates + our users’ expectations
    
-   How the VHA copays and VBA debt data varies won’t be as evident if Veterans drill down into those separate debt types
    
-   Having an overview page instead of showing all detailed debt cards in one view can reduce cognitive load. It could be overwhelming to see a long list of items, especially when it comes to something as sensitive as debts.
**Copay Email > Debt Portal Unauth page > Debt Portal Summary page > Debt Portal Copay Summary page**

### Option 2: Revised flow

**Copay Email > Debt Portal Unauth page > Debt Portal Summary page with all debts listed**

[Link to prototype for revised flow](https://www.figma.com/proto/OiiDTTVTCf8j0GngRg0xxD/Combined-VA-Debt-Portal?type=design&node-id=152-16358&viewport=260,390,0.25&t=EINFwT8EPigmh19P-0&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=152:16358&show-proto-sidebar=1)

### Research questions

Part 1: Exploratory and Foundational

1.  What are Veterans thoughts and preferences about a holistic debt portal vs a simpler one? We will share reaction cards with words/concepts on them (i.e.: “financial resources”, “one stop shop”, etc.) and get Veterans thoughts.
    
2.  Where do Veterans in different types of financial situations land with a holistic experience vs a simpler one?

Part 2: Conceptual and Generative

3.  How would Veterans prefer to see their copays and overpayments? 

4. Does removing the copay + overpayment overview page help Veterans more quickly access information? 

5. Does it increase cognitive burden to see all copay + overview cards at once? The average number of copays within 6 months is three. (It is possible to have 180+ copays within 6 months.)

6.  What would help Veterans easily digest the information on the debt portal?

### Hypothesis


-   We hypothesize that Veterans in more difficult financial situations (i.e. experiencing greater financial strain) will want more resources in the debt portal, hence they will lean more towards a holistic debt portal experience.
    
-   Based on previous research in 2022, hypothesis 2: ‘Participants will expect to find their copay bills and benefit debts in one location’ was likely true. We expect that the combined nature of the debt portal will be consistent with the idea of a “one stop shop” echoed by participants across various studies, and that the different types of debt being combined will be easy to understand and desirable.

## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

### Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

-   Pilot participant email: [ TBD ]
    
-   Date and time of pilot session: [ TBD ]
    
### Research sessions

**-   Planned dates of research: 2/21 - 2/28**
**-   Study can begin Wednesday 2/21**

### Length of sessions

-   Session length: 75 minutes
    
-   Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
    
-   Maximum Sessions per day: 3
    

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants).
