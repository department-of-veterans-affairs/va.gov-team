This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings


### Finding #1

**Most participants thought "Financial Resources" and "Financial Terms" would be helpful**

Participants self-identified as one of 3 groups: "I am currently experiencing financial hardship", "I have experienced financial hardship in the past", or "I have never experienced financial hardship". Most participants in all groups thought the addition of this information would be helpful. 

Three out of the 4 participants who selected "I am currently experiencing financial hardship" on the screener thought this information would be helpful.
Many stated that defining difficult financial terms when they are mentioned on the VA.gov would be helpful. One participant stated that the government sometimes has different definition of general financial terms. 

*"General financial terms aren't helpful to me, however, as I've learned, the VA and the government may have slightly different definitions of financial terms."* -P8


### Finding #2
**When asked for thoughts on "Travel Pay" many commented on difficulties both in person and online**

Not all participants were eligible for Travel Pay as their VA Medical location was not far from them. Many participants stated that they saw very long lines at for the office that processes Travel Pay at VA Medical locations. 
For those who were eligible for Travel Pay and had submitted a claim online, they stated that the online form was a "clunky system". 
The participants further stated that a way to address travel pay in a portal would be helpful. 

*"Not something a lot of people understand. A lot of people do not do it because they don't know how to."* -P6


### Finding #3
**Mixed feedback on Copay/Debt Overview page**

Participants who liked the Copay/Overpayment Overview page commented that they 
- Liked seeing the total amount of all the Copays and the total amount of all Overpayments.
- Thought the other version (all cards on one page) was "too jumbled" 
- Liked being able to drill down
- Liked less scrolling 

Participants who liked all Copay and Overpayments cards on one page stated:
- Liked that it took them to the copay mentioned in the email with less clicks
- Like that it gets rid of an extra step
  
*"You mentioned the $95 [copay] in the email, ok, take me to it."* -P8

*"Yeah, I'd it'd be nice to see things more consolidated, here's all your copay balance. Most people don't care where exactly. They're gonna be more likely to [click on] details on all my debt. And then they're gonna be willing to go through the itemized portion."* -P11


### Finding #4

**Some participants mentioned wanting to see more information on what the copay charge was for**

Detailed copay information is available on statement pages on the copay detail page. One participant noted that the information that the statement information he receives in the mail is not as detailed as he would like and he sometimes has to call VA. He stated that they are able to give him more details over the phone. 

It would be worth looking into ways we can improve and surface statement data sooner during the user journey.

The information that participants would want to see on a copay charge were: date of the service, and the type of service. 

They expressed that some Veterans receive multiple services in a day, and it would be easier to track down and understand the charges if such details were included. These participants said that this transparency is important, in case there is a mistake or a double charge. 

*"To me that is important as the other information. So you know what you're paying for, instead of saying April 1, 2024 you owe $95... it doesn't show what you're paying other than what the balance is."* -P5
