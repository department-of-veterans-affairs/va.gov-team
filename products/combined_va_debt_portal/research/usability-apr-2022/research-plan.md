# Research Plan for The Debt Resolution Team, Combined VA Debt Portal, May 2022 

## Background

[Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/product_outline.md). 

The Combined VA Debt Portal is an authenticated tool that brings together [the VBA Debt Portal](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/) and [the Medical Copay Tool](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/) so Veterans can access information about both their benefit debt and medical copay bills in one place. This initiative is a result of Congressional legislation that requires Veterans are able to find all their debt and bills in one location on VA.gov as well as user research that indicates Veterans expect to find all their VA finances together on the site.  

The VBA Debt Portal launched early 2021 while the Medical Copay Tool soft launched early 2022. Thousands of debt notification letters have been downloaded from the VBA Debt Portal, and stronger communication about accessing copay statements online is planned for after the combined portal is launched. 

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 

- Veterans can manage their health services online 

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information 

- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features 

This research supports increasing these measures:  

- Usage of digital, self-service tools 

- Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population 

This research supports decreasing these measures: 

- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution 

### Veteran Journey

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.  

Other key moments this research touches key moments in the Veteran journey are: 

- Attending to health needs 

- Taking care of myself 

- Managing my declining health 

## Research Goals

The main goals of this study are to:  

- Identify the entry points Veterans expect when accessing information about their debts or copays  

- Validate if it's intuitive to Veterans how to navigate between their debts and copay bills 

- Verify the labeling of ‘debts’, ‘bills’, and ‘balances’ as they relate to benefit debts and copay statements  

### Outcome

Currently, debts and bills are available in different locations on the site. This study will both inform us about where Veterans expect to find information about their debt + bills as well as advise us about how intuitive this iteration of the combined portal experience is.  

Additionally, we’re planning to run this usability study in production with the tool hidden behind a feature flag, so this will allow us to recruit folks who use assistive technology.  

### Research questions

1. Where do Veterans expect to find information about their benefit debts and copay bills while on VA.gov? 

   - How do the expected entry points differ between finding debts vs copay bills? 

     - Disability or health care hub pages

     - Resources and support articles

     - My VA

     - Email notifications

   - Is there other financial information Veterans expect to find in the portal, such as payment history?

2. How do Veterans interact with their copay bills and debts within the portal?

   - How confident do Veterans feel about resolving their debts and bills with the information provided?

   - How do Veterans feel about the amount of information provided on the debt/bill overview pages and detail pages?

3. How clear is the navigation between the 'debt overview' page, 'current VBA debts', and 'current copay balances' to Veterans?

   - Are Veterans able to successfully navigate back to the 'debt overview page' from a debt or copay bill detail page?

4. How does the labeling of debts and bills compare to how Veterans conceptualize those items?

   - Is it clear what a copay bill is vs a benefit debt?

### Hypothesis

1. Most participants will search for a link to their debts and bills within one of the four quadrants on the VA.gov homepage 

2. Participants will expect to find their copay bills and benefit debts in one location 

3. Participants may want more real-time transaction data regarding their debts and bills  

4. Participants may want to view their debt and copay bill details before resolving them, so they may think there’s too much content on the ‘current debts’ and ‘current copay bills’ pages 

5. Participants will understand the difference between a copay bill and benefit debt, but may be confused by the differences in payment and resolution options with those debts and bills  

6. Participants may not think the ‘Your other VA bills’ or ‘Your other VA debts’ section is prominent enough  

## Method	

This usability study will be conducted remotely via Zoom with participants that are sighted, visually impaired, and use assistive technology.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

Using Perigean recruiting, we would like to schedule **20 participants** in order to achieve 8-10 completed sessions. 

### Recruitment criteria

#### Primary criteria (must-haves)

- All participants must be Veterans 

- All have a computer, tablet, or smartphone and be willing to be complete their session on one of those devices 

   - During the session, be willing to share a web browser window on their device 

   - Have a working microphone on their device 

   - Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen

- **All participants must be LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov.** Participants will likely not know what this means, so please confirm this prior to testing. This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov and having them go to the VA.gov profile. If they are prompted to verify their identity, that means they are LOA1 and they are not suitable for testing. If they can see the profile, they are LOA3 and can participate in testing.

- **All participants must be comfortable providing the email address they use to sign into VA.gov. We need this information 2-3 days before the study begins in order to give participants access to the tool in production.**

#### Participant groups

To understand how Veterans interact with the portal depending on their experience with debts and copay bills, the primary criteria has been split into two groups. 

[Please refer to these screener questions and correlating diagram](#screener-questions-and-group-diagram).

**Group 1: Enrolled in VA health care** 

- **15 people** who are enrolled in VA health care 

   - At least **10 people** who: 

     - Have received a VA health care copay bill within the past 6 months **and** 

     - Have had at least one of the following VA Debts: CH 33/Post-9/11 GI Bill, CH 34, CH 35, or Compensation & Pension 

   - At least 3 people, or **maximum 5 people** who:  

     - Have received a VA health care copay bill within the past 6 months **and** 

     - Have never received a VA debt 

**Group 2: Do not receive VA health care copays**

- At least 3 people, or **maximum 5 people** who: 

   - Haven’t received VA health care copay bills within the past 6 months **and** 

   - Have had at least one of the following VA debts: CH 33, Post-9/11 GI Bill, CH 34, CH 35, or Compensation & Pension

#### Demographic must-haves 

**Note:** The following demographic criteria is our goal, but we understand that historically it's been challenging to recruit participants with VA debt.

- At least 6 people who use a screen reader 

- At least 10 people must identify as Black, Hispanic/Latina/Latinx, or Native

- At least 10 people must identify as having a cognitive consideration

- At least 10 people must identify as other than male

- At least 10 people are without a degree or professional certificate

- At least 5 people are under 35

- At least 5 people are over 55

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves) 

- At least 6 people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender 

- At least 5 people who live in a rural or remote area 

- At least 5 people who live in a major metropolitan area 

- At least 3 non-native English speakers 

### Screener questions and group diagram

#### Screener questions 

1. Which of the following describes you?
  * I use VA health care and have received a copay bill in the past 6 months (Group 1)
  
  * I use VA health care and do not receive copays (Group 2)
  
  * I do not use VA health care (Group 2)

2. Veterans can incur debt with VA, usually as a result of a VA overpayment. Debts include: CH 33/Post-9/11 GI Bill, Compensation & Pension, CH 34, and CH 35 debts. Have you ever had a debt balance with VA, not including health care related debt (like co-pays)?
  
  * Yes (If Group 1, admit at least 10)
  
  * No (Admit maximum of 5 for Group 1 and maximum of 5 for Group 2)
