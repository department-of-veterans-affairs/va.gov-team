# Research Goals
The Combined VA Debt Portal is an authenticated tool that brings together  [the VBA Debt Portal](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/)  and  [the Medical Copay Tool](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)  so Veterans can access information about both their benefit debt and medical copay bills in one place. This initiative is a result of Congressional legislation that requires Veterans are able to find all their debt and bills in one location on VA.gov as well as user research that indicates Veterans expect to find all their VA finances together on the site.

The VBA Debt Portal launched early 2021 while the Medical Copay Tool soft launched early 2022. Thousands of debt notification letters have been downloaded from the VBA Debt Portal, and stronger communication about accessing copay statements online is planned for after the combined portal is launched.

### Veteran Journey

Debt can happen at any stage in  [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)  after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches key moments in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health

### The main goals of this study are to:  

- Identify the entry points Veterans expect when accessing information about their debts or copays  

- Validate if it's intuitive to Veterans how to navigate between their debts and copay bills 

- Verify the labeling of ‘debt’, 'copay', and 'bills'



# Research Questions


1. Where do Veterans expect to find information about their benefit debts and copay bills while on VA.gov? 

   - How do the expected entry points differ between finding debts vs copay bills? 

     - Disability or health care hub pages

     - Resources and support articles

     - My VA

     - Email notifications

   - Is there other financial information Veterans expect to find in the portal, such as payment history?

2. How do Veterans interact with their copay bills and debts within the portal?

   - How confident do Veterans feel about resolving their debts and bills with the information provided?

   - How do Veterans feel about the amount of information provided on the debt/bill overview pages and detail pages?

3. How clear is the navigation between the 'debt overview' page, 'current VBA debts', and 'current copay balances' to Veterans?

   - Are Veterans able to successfully navigate back to the 'debt overview page' from a debt or copay bill detail page?

4. How does the labeling of debts and bills compare to how Veterans conceptualize those items?

   - Is it clear what a copay bill is vs a benefit debt?

# Methodology 


This usability study was conducted remotely via Zoom. Participants either logged into their account where the feature was turned on for them or they looked at a UXPin prototype optimized for desktop.


# Hypotheses and Conclusions


1. Most participants will search for a link to their debts and bills within one of the four quadrants on the VA.gov homepage 
	- *Likely True.* All but one participant scanned the four quadrants although not all of them clicked on a link within the four quadrants. Four participants clicked on 'View your payment history' and one clicked on 'Check your claim or appeal status'.

2. Participants will expect to find their copay bills and benefit debts in one location 
	- *Likely True.* All but one participant thought of copays as a type of debt, he stated "Defining it as copay causes me to not consider it debt."

3. Participants may want more real-time transaction data regarding their debts and bills  
	- *Not enough information.* Because of few login issues and a lack of participants with current bills, not all participants were able to view their actual copay and debt information to comment on how timely the data was. One participant who was able to view their actual information stated that there was previously an erroneous charge on their account that was taken care of but was surprised when it still appeared on the Combined Debt Portal. He quickly looked at the date of June 10th and realized the information had not yet been updated on the portal. One participant noted that he expected information to be updated within 24-72 hrs. 
Another participant noted that the information he's received is not always updated in a timely matter:
	
     > _"Sometimes, I’ve had it in the past where I’ve paid the debt but it’s not reflecting or a debt I’ve paid in the past is showing up as unpaid."_

4. Participants may want to view their debt and copay bill details before resolving them, so they may think there’s too much content on the ‘current debts’ and ‘current copay bills’ pages 
	- *Maybe True.* Participants talked about the ability to either quickly view details or quickly pay their bill based on their situation. Several participants noted that they had to go through too many pages to get to the information they were looking for. One participant noted that there was too much text and he prefers to scan websites and not read every line.

5. Participants will understand the difference between a copay bill and benefit debt (*Likely True*), but may be confused by the differences in payment and resolution options with those debts and bills (*Maybe False*)  
	- Participants did understand the difference between a copay bill and benefit debt. They were able to locate those where to pay and where to request financial help. Although they were able to find those links, some participants felt that links for important features such as a pay link were hidden and that there were too many layers of pages.

6. Participants may not think the ‘Your other VA bills’ or ‘Your other VA debts’ section is prominent enough  
	- *Not enough information.* We did not receive enough participants who had both copays and debts. Most participants began at the summary page and knew it existed before being asked to navigate to it. The few who did not see the summary page were still able to navigate to it.


# Key Findings

1. How participants defined **copays, debt, and bills**: Participants defined **copays** in relation to money owed for medical related expenses. **Debt** as money owed, usually through overpayment from VA. Most participants defined **bills** as similar to debt, as money owed.

2. Most participants looked on the 4 quadrants of the homepage for a link to handle their debt/copay

3. Most participants did not have issues navigating from copays to debts and vice versa when starting from the summary page. We don't have enough data to know if this will be an issue if they start from a detail page.

4.  Most participants were able to locate how to request financial help

5. Most participants were able to locate how to view statements

6.  Most participants were able to locate how to pay their debt/copay

7.  Some participants felt there were too many pages and that important features were hidden




# Details of Findings 


## 1. How participants defined copays, debt, and bills


|Term| How participants defined the term |
|-----------------|--|
| **Copay**                | Participants defined copays in relation to money owed for medical related expenses |
| **Debt**                | Participants defined debt as money owed, usually through overpayment from VA |
| **Bill**                | Most participants defined bills as similar to debt, as money owed and many viewed it as a statement for money owed |
<hr>

> _"A copay I would pay in conjunction with any visits that I have, but I could owe money to the VA for more than one reason. If they overcompensated me for something or if they ... when I was going through vocational rehab, I think they messed up one of the payments. When I got divorced and then remarried, I was still getting paid for having a spouse. All of those things were VA debts but I, in no way, consider them copays."_

### Copay
**Participants defined copays in relation to money owed for medical related expenses**
    
   > _"A copay is when you're paying whatever insurance doesn't cover for service that you had."_
   
  
 
### Debt

 **Participants defined debt as money owed, usually through overpayment from VA**
    
 Most stated that a copay could be a debt. Five participants stated that debt was an overpayment from VA. One participant stated that defining it as copay causes him to not consider it debt.
    
  > _"Bill is something that is due now. Debt is money you owe, debt is something you owe from the past."_
    
 > _"Debt is an overpayment that I owe them back."_

### Bill
 **Most participants defined bills as similar to debt, as money owed**
 
Participants stated that a bill could be for a copay or debt and thought of it as a statement for money owed.
    
 > _"Bills being a request for me to pay my liable for my debt to the VA."_
    
Some participants had more nuanced definitions of the term 'bill'. 
    
  > _"A bill is: I am being shown what has been paid and what I may owe. It does necessarily mean I owe money."_
    
  > _"A bill is a debt that I incurred. An overpayment is a debt that was forced upon me by the VA."_

## 2. Most participants looked on the 4 quadrants of the homepage for a link to handle their debt/copay

While looking at the 4 quadrants on the homepage, participants were most likely to either select or mention thinking about selecting the *'View payment history'* link on the homepage.

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/images/va-4-quad.png?raw=true" alt="4 quadrants" width=500>

The *[View your payment history](https://www.va.gov/va-payment-history/)* page contains a link at the bottom of the page to *[Manage your VA debt](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/)* that most participants who viewed the page clicked on. 

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/images/view-payment-history.png?raw=true" alt="View payment history page" width=500>

Some participants stated they would utilize the search feature. One of those participants was not able to locate the search feature on mobile. 

If they wanted to search, search terms they mentioned they would try include: 

- *how do I apply for post 9/11 gi bill*
-  *GI Bill overpay*
-  *Statement overpay*
- *Post GI Bill*
- *Co payments*
- *copay*
- *debt*
- *debt management*


> "I would go under records I would assume. I don’t see any other links under it that would show. Well under disability it says see **payment history**. Under education I see look at your **payment history**. I would just click on one of the ones that says **payment** and see where it would take me."



## 3. Most participants did not have issues navigating from copays to debts and vice versa when starting from the summary page. We don't have enough data to know if this will be an issue if they start from a detail page.

Most participants began at the summary page and knew it existed before being asked to navigate to it. The few who did not see the summary page at the beginning of the session were still able to navigate to either the copay or debt page utilizing either the 'View other VA debt' link or by clicking on the breadcrumb.

One participants saw the 'View other VA debt' link but noted that the text was small and it appeared hidden:
> _"Almost like they don't want people to pay their copay."_

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/images/other-bills.png?raw=true" alt="View other VA debt link" width=400>


## 4.  Participants were able to locate how to request financial help

Some participants saw the *'Request help with your bill'* on the prototype that was not clickable. One participant saw the link but stated he would call. Another participant stated he thought the link might go to a live chat or a messaging system where he would get a response within 24 hours. He also mentioned being able to send a photo of a bill he already paid in order to dispute a charge.

## 5. Participants were able to locate how to view statements

Some mentioned expecting to immediately see a PDF statement but were able to locate where to download the PDF statement. One participant mentioned that the PDF statement showed more detail than the statements he gets in the mail. Some participants noted that there were characters (`&nbsp;`) , "gibberish", added within their statement. 

## 6.  Participants were able to locate how to pay their debt/copay
Participants either located the "Pay online" accordion that transferred them to pay.va.gov or they would select "Check your balance to resolve bill" and click "Pay your copay bill".
>_I guess I would click this link that says 'check your balance and resolve your bill'. Click on the 'how to pay your copay bill' and hit the plus button to open each window and either pay online as long as there is no fee or pay by mail."_
>
<table style="border-color:white !important;"><tbody>
        <tr><td valign="top" border=0><img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/images/where-to-pay-1.png?raw=true" alt="Where to pay" width=460> </td><td valign="top" border=0><img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research/usability-apr-2022/images/where-to-pay-2.png?raw=true" alt="Where to pay" width=460></tbody>
        </tr></table>

## 7. Some participants felt there were too many pages and that important features were hidden

Some participants stated there were too many layers of pages where the only navigation available were breadcrumbs. They wanted more information on one page with important links such as a pay button at the top of the page. One participant stated he would have liked to see the *“Notice of rights and responsibilities”* featured on the first page. He mentioned that he received that information on a paper bill in the past and it helped him understand his rights and who to contact. 
    

> _"I just feel like they are a bunch of functions thrown on different page. If you had a matrix on the page with details and a button to pay each individual debts, dispute this debt, financial help, and download the statement. It feels like a lot of space and no organization. I think they are all the same with a series of pages with various information. I would rather have one page with all the information. I don’t feel it is necessary to click through four to five pages to get all your information"._
  
 > _"I'll follow your cookie crumbs but I'm not happy about it."_
 
While on the status page, one participant commented on how it appeared as if the link to pay was hidden:
> _"You’re showing this person all the things they owe, but it doesn’t jump out at me how to pay the VA. It would be up here in the top right corner and everywhere I’m talking about what they owe the VA, I’d expect a large green button that says, “Pay the VA” and it would take me to where I would pay the VA. ..."_
 _"I would go to “check your status and resolve your debt.” This again is a question of the blurriness of a copay or debt. I’m not intending to scroll because I’m intending to pay a copay. Now, I’m looking down here and you want me to call somewhere? This landing page does nothing for me in accomplishing my goal."_    
 





# Additional Insights

> "_I like the experience. Sometimes with VA.gov. I know this about myself, the way I organize things is in priority, so I like the active directory. Sometimes on VA.gov is does not feel like that, it is like MapQuest. Making turns until I get to the thing I want. I know I was looking for the statement and for the copay it was right there, but the debt was too many turns. That is also my thing for the whole VA.gov."_

> _"I am not sure if that is possible or not. Being able to log in and go straight to your debt. Sometimes I must sign in and go through 2-3 other menus to get to my debt. I don’t know if that it possible. Like your most visited sites. Or a dashboard for each user."_

>_"If anything is missing it is links to the new travel pay system. That would be a one stop shop. We all love one stop shopping."_


# Recommendations


* Look into ways of consolidating pages and surfacing important statement data and pay link sooner

* Look into ways to make 'View my other VA debts' link more prominent and consider using the term "Copays" instead of "Your other VA bills" when linking to the copay page

* Consider using the term "overpayment" when referring to debt caused by an overpayment. Several participants mentioned overpayment when defining "debt". One participant stated he liked when it was mentioned, "so it doesn't make you feel fraudulent and makes the dispute process easier".

* Eliminate `&nbsp;` characters on the copay statement page
  

# Next Steps

 - Review content and user flow and assess whether pages can be consolidated
 - Review design and whether important statement information and a pay link can appear sooner to users
 - Review design on copay and debt pages and determine whether the 'Other VA debt' link can be more prominent and clear
 - Discuss where it would make sense to include the term "overpayment"
 - The issue of `&nbsp;` characters appearing on the statement page has already been fixed



# Further research needed

Further research should be conducted involving Veterans who have both debts and copays within the last 6 months.

This research does not include the perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups:
* Gender: Women
* Race: Asian
* LGBTQ+
* Other than honorable discharge
* Immigrant origin
* Expat (living abroad)
* Users of Assistive Technology other than hearing aids
