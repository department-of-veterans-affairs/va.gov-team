This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings



1. **Participants defined copays in relation to money owed for medical related expenses**

   > "A copay is when you're paying whatever insurance doesn't cover for service that you had"


2. **Participants defined debt as money owed, usually through overpayment from VA**

  - Most stated that a copay could be a debt. Five participants stated that debt was an overpayment from VA. One participant stated that defining it as copay causes him to not consider it debt. 
   
    > "Bill is something that is due now. Debt is money you owe, debt is something you owe from the past."
    
    > "Debt is an overpayment that I owe them back."


3. **Most participants defined bills as similar to debt, as money owed**

  - Participants stated that a bill could be for a copay or debt and thought of it as a statement for money owed.
  
    > "Bills being a request for me to pay my liable for my debt to the VA."
    
  - Some participants had more nuanced definitions of the term 'bill'.
  
    > "A bill is: I am being shown what has been paid and what I may owe. It does necessarily mean I owe money."
    
    > "A bill is a debt that I incurred. An overpayment is a debt that was forced upon me by the VA." 

4. **Most participants did not have issues navigating from copays to debts**

  - Participants were able to navigate to the summary page where they were able to view all of their copays and debts. However, most participants began at the summary page and knew it existed before being asked to navigate to it. The few who did not see the summary page were still able to navigate to it. 


5. **Most participants looked on the 4 quadrants of the homepage for a link to handle their debt/copay**

  - Some selected 'View Payment History' under Disability or Education "because it says 'payment'". There is a link near the footer of the [Payment History page](https://www.va.gov/va-payment-history/) to Manage your VA debt that several participants located.
  - Some utilized the search feature and entered terms such as: "debt" and "copay".

    > "I would go under records I would assume. I don’t see any other links under it that would show. Well under disability it says see payment history. Under education I see look at your payment history. I would just click on one of the ones that says payment and see where it would take me."


6. **Most participants were able to locate how to request financial help**

  - If they were not able to find it, they were able to quickly locate the number to call for assistance.


7. **Most participants were able to locate how to view statements**

  - Some mentioned expecting to immediately see a PDF statement but were able to locate where to download the PDF statement. One participant mentioned that the PDF statement showed more detail than the statements he gets in the mail.


8. **Most participants were able to locate how to pay their debt/copay**

  - Participants either located the "Pay online" accordion that transferred them to pay.gov or they would select "Check your balance to resolve bill"  and click "Pay your copay bill".

9. **Most participants did not have issues navigating from copays to debts and vice versa**
  - Most participants did not have both debts and copays and began on the summary page, not the copay page that contains the "Your other VA bills" link. Of the few who started their journey on the copay or debt page, all were able to navigate to the debt or copay page either via breadcrumbs or the "Your other VA bills" link. One user noted that that the "Your other VA bills" link was hidden.
  
   > "Almost like they don't want people to pay their copay."
