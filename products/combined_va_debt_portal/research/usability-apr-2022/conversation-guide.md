## Intro -- 5 minutes 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\]. 

I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes to make sure we accurately represent your feedback. 

For this feedback session, we're here because VA is working on a way for Veterans to be able to access information about their VA debts and copay bills online. As part of this effort, our team has created a new tool that we'll be looking at today. Your input could help us make the experience easier to use by Veterans like you. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

**This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

**In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing you. We're testing these resources to learn how we can make them better for all Veterans. I welcome any and all feedback, and I won't not be offended by any opinions you express.

**If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You can take a break from the session or end it altogether. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

**During this session, I'm going to have you sign into the new tool we've built in order to make sure it works for your needs. This means we'll be looking at your actual account information.** I'd also like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

* If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording to the cloud._

* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm up questions -- 5 minutes 

I'd like to start by learning more about your experience with VA health care and debts. 

### Experience with Medical Copays 

**1. Are you currently enrolled in VA health care?**

   - _If yes:_

      - Do you pay a copay for health care visits?

      - Do you pay for prescriptions? 

   - _If no: move on to the Experience with VA Debt questions_

**2. Have you received a letter in the mail from VA containing health care or prescription charges within the last 6 months?**

   - _If yes:_

      - Tell me more about that letter you received

### Experience with VA Debts

**3. Have you ever had a debt balance with VA, not including health care related debt like co-pays?** (If needed: Debts are usually a result of an overpayment and can include CH33 or Post-911 GI Bill, Compensation and Pension, CH 34, and CH 35 debts.) 

   - _If yes:_ 

      - Tell me more about this debt

         - What type of debt was it?

         - When did you receive this debt?

         - How did you resolve it?

### General questions

**4. Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account?** 

**5. Do you know your username and password?** 

   - _If no:_ Are these readily accessible? Could you get them? 

   _If the participant cannot remember or retrieve their login credentials, let them know that this is necessary for the test and proceed to the closing statements._

**6. Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today?** 

   - _If needed:_ I'm asking this question because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed. 

**7. Can you tell me which web browser you use?** 

**8. Today we'll be checking out a new tool on VA.gov. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me so I can follow along while you interact with it?** 

   - _If yes: Thank you! Please share your screen, and we can get started._ 

   - _If no: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, proceed to the closing statements and end the session._

## Task one: Navigating to the tool -- 10 minutes 

For the next portion of our session, we're going to chat about VA.gov. Please open a web browser of your choice and navigate to VA.gov. 

### Experience with VA.gov

**1. How familiar are you with VA.gov?** 

   - _If familiar, consider asking:_

      - What are some reasons why you come to this site?

      - How often would you say you visit this site?

   - _If unfamiliar, consider asking:_

      - What VA sites do you normally visit?

      - What are your impressions of this site? 

### Navigating to the tool

* _Veteran only has either a medical copay OR a VA debt:_

   * Let's say you can access information about your \[copay bill / VA debt previously mentioned\] on this site. Talk me through what you would do to find that information.

   * Let's say you can access information about your \[copay bills and debts previously mentioned\] on this site. Talk me through what you would do to find that information.

   * What are your thoughts about how you found this page?

      * How does this compare to how you'd expect to find this page?

* _If the Veteran doesn't navigate to the tool, direct them to the content page either through the site or by pasting the content page's link (link TBD) in the Zoom chat_ 

   * What would you do next?


_**Things to watch for:**_

* Where does the participant navigate to from the home page? 

   * Do they search in the four quadrants, use the search feature, sign in? 

* What key words does the participant look for?

* Did the participant successfully navigate to the tool?
