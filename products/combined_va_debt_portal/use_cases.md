# Combined VA Debt Portal - Use Cases

**Last updated:** 5/31/2022

**Description:** Track and maintain the various use cases that exist for a given product and is
best maintained alongside the product outline.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this document is for designers, PMs, and engineers to align
early on on potential use cases and edge cases so these things aren't coming up
randomly and late in the process. We recommend the team schedule a 30 minute
meeting to brainstorm all use cases/edge cases early on. Examples of cases that
could be captured here include: "Veteran logs in but is not LOA3ed.", "Veteran
searches and gets no results.", etc.
