Emily

Recording in progress. So just to confirm sorry the recording wanted to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio. As we talk today.

2

0:00:12

P2

Yes.

3

0:00:13

Emily

Great.

4

0:00:13

Emily

Let's going

5

0:00:13

Emily

okay. Alright. And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip for the discussion today with the Va partners.

6

0:00:20

P2

Of course, of course.

7

0:00:22

Emily

Okay, great. Thank you. All right. Now, onto the actual discussion. I'd love to know just a little bit about you as a veteran branch of military. Sorry. What branch of military do you serve? And when did you retire? Separate.

8

0:00:37

P2

I served in the [redacted]. I went in in 79 and got out in 86.

9

0:00:43

Emily

Okay.

10

0:00:44

P2

And I quit working well over 10 years ago.

11

0:00:53

P2

I

12

0:00:55

P2

was diagnosed with [redacted] and was deemed disabled by social security. So I've been disabled. I do have a part-time job. I'm [redacted], and I work a couple days a week doing that.

13

0:01:13

Emily

Wow! That sounds pretty interesting, actually, alright, so I'd love to know what sort of involvement you have with veteran affairs could be both the past and now, and such as any if you do go to their facilities. Talk with folks there. Things like that.

14

0:01:31

P2

Yes, I get the majority of my health care through the Va. I do see a local doctor just to have that as a oh, I need to see someone like right now.

15

0:01:43

Emily

Kind of a thing.

16

0:01:46

Emily

Got it? And do you use, or currently the website and or the mobile app.

17

0:01:55

P2

Both on a regular basis.

18

0:01:57

Emily

There you go. Excellent! What? What sort of things do you use the app for as opposed to the website.

19

0:02:07

P2

the same thing. I go in. And you know, if I'm at my computer. And I think I Oh, look, you know, let me go check my prescriptions, or what appointments do I have? Or if I'm sitting in my chair and I'm go. Oh, gee! I wonder if I have an appointment, or I just loaded my pills up in my little Dixie cups. Oh, gee! I need to order some pills. I'll hop on the app and check appointments or order refills or check tracking.

20

0:02:31

Emily

Okay, great.

21

0:02:34

Emily

And is there any any specific reason you choose to use the app for those? For those things as opposed to the website.

22

0:02:43

P2

No, there's it's whatever device I'm nearest. I prefer

23

0:02:48

P2

the computer. I really dislike doing things on on the phone.

24

0:02:55

Emily

yeah, okay, so whatever is closest got it? Okay? So we're going, to move over to the financial portion of the discussion and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have 0 information about anything any financially related to the Va.

25

0:03:14

Emily

So so I know you said that you have the the majority of your your health care through the Va. So can you just briefly explain experience with medical Copays through the Va.

26

0:03:31

P2

The only copies that I have are for my prescription drugs.

27

0:03:35

Emily

Okay.

28

0:03:36

P2

And

29

0:03:39

P2

actually, and I don't know if I'm jumping ahead, or if this is what you were asking. I learned that I was doing something wrong last year that I had not been told, and and it was like good news, bad news. It's like, wait a minute. I've been giving away money that I didn't need to.

30

0:04:04

Emily

Oh dear!

31

0:04:04

P2

Then. So basically in a nutshell, yeah, in a nutshell, I didn't know that after I had paid $[redacted] worth of

32

0:04:13

P2

copays for my medicines. I didn't have to pay any more co-pays.

33

0:04:18

Emily

No.

34

0:04:19

P2

What I was doing because I thought I was being proactive is, I would go to the website, go down to what do I owe you.

35

0:04:27

P2

and I would make a payment. Well, I was told that the website does not jive with reality.

36

0:04:34

P2

and then

37

0:04:36

P2

only to make payments when you got a bill in the mail. If you don't get a bill in the mail.

38

0:04:42

P2

don't don't make any payments, and I thought that was a pretty huge disconnect.

39

0:04:48

Emily

Huh? Okay, interesting.

40

0:04:51

Emily

all right. And do you recall how how you learned about this that you should only wait until you're told specifically to pay.

41

0:05:01

P2

So what happened is that

42

0:05:04

P2

We didn't have any money, and I was calling to ask if I could make a payment

43

0:05:12

P2

later than the due date on on the bill, and the young lady on the phone said, Hold on just a moment, let me check something, and she came back, and and then she and said, You owe nothing, and informed me about

44

0:05:25

P2

the disconnect between the website and reality.

45

0:05:30

Emily

Hmm, okay, got it. Okay, and so then, so at this point, you learned that you needed to wait until you are specifically told to make a payment. Do you recall so? How? How are you getting these notifications when you do actually have to make a payment.

46

0:05:46

P2

It's a letter in the mail.

47

0:05:48

Emily

No, okay, got it alright.

48

0:05:53

Emily

And so up until then you had been going. So you sorry you were logging into you're going to va.gov to make payments there.

49

0:06:02

P2

Yeah, yeah, pay.gov is where I make my payments. But we're at on the Va. Website is where it says, Hey, you owe money.

50

0:06:11

Emily

Okay.

51

0:06:11

P2

And so

52

0:06:14

P2

I would use that information, jump to pay.p.gov, and and make that payment.

53

0:06:20

Emily

Okay, got it

54

0:06:22

Emily

alright and do is this a regular monthly notification that you sent? Or do you recall how often you get the letters.

55

0:06:32

P2

I get.

56

0:06:33

P2

I get the letter monthly until I hit the $[redacted] mark, and then the letters don't come anymore.

57

0:06:40

Emily

Okay? So they just start. And is there was there any indication of when you did hit that mark?

58

0:06:49

P2

No.

59

0:06:50

Emily

No got it. Okay. They just stop sending you letters.

60

0:06:53

P2

I'm yeah.

61

0:06:55

P2

yes, that's that's that's the the metric that I'm using. I I just want to say something. My phone might overheat from an extended zoom call.

62

0:07:07

Emily

Oh, okay.

63

0:07:08

P2

And if it does, it may just it may disconnect us. I can continue. If it does happen, I can continue with a phone call. But the zoom, the video is is pretty taxing, and I apologize for that.

64

0:07:23

Emily

Okay? Well, the most in moment we're gonna be getting onto some screen sharing stuff. So we will. We'll see how far we can get

65

0:07:32

Emily

a

66

0:07:34

Emily

take it as it is. If you want to turn. Yeah, if you want to turn off your video that if that in case that saves

67

0:07:42

Emily

some battery, or I'm not sure how it works in terms of overheating.

68

0:07:46

Emily

You're certainly welcome to do that.

69

0:07:48

P2

And it wouldn't.

70

0:07:49

P2

That would be awesome. Let me figure out.

71

0:07:52

Emily

Yes, you should be able to tap on the screen and then at the bottom, I believe there's gonna be a little camera.

72

0:07:58

Emily

Yep, there we go.

73

0:07:59

Emily

Okay, yeah. So hopefully, that gets us a little more time.

74

0:08:02

Emily

Okay. And then separate from the copayments. Do you know, if you have had any debts as a result of any benefit. Overpayments in the past.

75

0:08:14

P2

No.

76

0:08:14

Emily

You have not. Okay. Great. Okay. And I'm going through my questions. You've already answered a bunch of those so great.

77

0:08:25

Emily

alright so outside. I know, obviously the lack of communication. In terms of when you actually need to pay something. Is there anything else that might make things easier for you in regards to the co-payments.

78

0:08:45

P2

No, I mean, it's I'm a very tech, savvy person. My career was.

79

0:08:51

P2

you know, 25 years in the [redacted]

80

0:08:57

Emily

Huh!

81

0:08:58

P2

So you know, I'm real familiar with software and hardware, and

82

0:09:04

P2

the whole system is is quite easy to navigate and use.

83

0:09:11

Emily

Great good to know. Okay.

84

0:09:13

P2

I'm really happy with my.

85

0:09:15

Emily

5, v. 8.

86

0:09:15

P2

Experience.

87

0:09:16

Emily

Glad to hear that all right, always looking to make it better. So that's you know. That's why why you're here, all right. So now we're going to move on to the prototype section. Let me have you share your screen and let me know if you need help. With that.

88

0:09:35

P2

Bear my screen. There we go.

89

0:09:47

P2

okay. I tapped it, and I'm I've got the spinning wheel of death.

90

0:09:50

Emily

Great love, that.

91

0:09:52

P2

And now it's wanting me to choose an application I'm assuming. That's that app. You had me download.

92

0:09:59

Emily

No, not yet. So that are you on on, Android.

93

0:10:03

P2

Yes.

94

0:10:04

Emily

Okay? So at the bottom, there should be a list of it. Yeah, a list of apps at the bottom. You want to select zoom.

95

0:10:11

P2

You got it.

96

0:10:13

Emily

And then that should.

97

0:10:14

P2

And.

98

0:10:15

Emily

Yeah, there's another tab.

99

0:10:16

P2

Alright.

100

0:10:17

P2

Yeah. Okay. It's allowed.

101

0:10:19

Emily

Alright, not seeing it.

102

0:10:22

P2

And start. Now.

103

0:10:23

Emily

There we go. Okay, perfect. I just had to wait a second. Okay, and so now let me have you switch applications and open up the figma app that you downloaded.

104

0:10:36

P2

Okay.

105

0:10:49

Emily

Okay. So go ahead and click on log into figma.

106

0:10:54

P2

Okay. Now, I did not sign up for instruct.

107

0:10:57

Emily

Directions perfect. I have. I have a login.

108

0:11:00

P2

I'm okay.

109

0:11:03

Emily

Yeah, alright, I'm just waiting for it to catch up.

110

0:11:06

Emily

Okay, there we go, all right. So the email is gonna be VA test 0 0@gmail.com.

111

0:11:27

Emily

Oh, just yeah.

112

0:11:28

P2

Well.

113

0:11:28

Emily

Yep, there we go. You caught it before I did.

114

0:11:32

Emily

Okay? And then the password is VAVA. VAVA.

115

0:11:37

Emily

I had to do 8 characters, so wanted to make it as easy as possible.

116

0:11:45

Emily

Okay, go ahead and tap log in. And then it's gonna send me to my email. So give me just a moment. Let me just refresh. And the authentication code is 6, 0 1, 1,

117

0:12:03

Emily

6, 4, 5.

118

0:12:06

Emily

Okay, now, hopefully, that'll log in. It's spinning, and it's thinking.

119

0:12:12

Emily

all right. Continue with mobile app

120

0:12:17

Emily

alright. Now it's opening. Okay. So now I will get you the

121

0:12:24

Emily

oops. There we go copy that

122

0:12:28

Emily

alright in the Zoom chat. I am sending you a very long link.

123

0:12:35

Emily

So you may have to. Yeah, you have to switch back to zoom to see that there we go.

124

0:12:43

Emily

If you tap on that it should show up at the bottom.

125

0:12:49

P2

Yes.

126

0:12:50

Emily

Under chat. There we go alright. Go ahead and open up that one.

127

0:12:55

P2

And go ahead and tap the link.

128

0:12:56

Emily

Yes, please.

129

0:13:02

Emily

all right, it is working. It's just taking a little bit.

130

0:13:05

Emily

When once it loads, you can.

131

0:13:08

P2

Settings.

132

0:13:09

Emily

Yeah, I shouldn't have to. You shouldn't need to do any of that. It's just always tells people at the start.

133

0:13:16

Emily

But it's still thinking. Come on, figma

134

0:13:48

Emily

getting close.

135

0:13:48

P2

Doing something.

136

0:13:49

Emily

It is doing something. I have hope.

137

0:13:55

Emily

I mean, as someone who works in technology. You know, technology just doesn't always work the way we want it to, but it's it's moving in the right direction.

138

0:14:04

P2

Okay.

139

0:14:14

P2

all right.

140

0:14:15

P2

Look at that.

141

0:14:15

Emily

Great. So we are on the home screen of our pretend mobile app right now. So before I have you click anything where show me, or just tell me, I guess where you believe you're gonna find those copayments that you would owe.

142

0:14:49

P2

I would click on the the details, see details under last payment?

143

0:14:54

P2

Well, that probably might not work.

144

0:14:56

Emily

Okay.

145

0:14:57

P2

But that would be a good start.

146

0:15:01

P2

or or show one of the 2.

147

0:15:04

Emily

Okay, looking at a payment. Got it any any other spot that might make sense for you to to look for these co-payments.

148

0:15:22

P2

No, that that would be it, I mean, maybe if I clicked on profile.

149

0:15:29

P2

And you know well, there's nothing there. So yeah, that would be it.

150

0:15:33

Emily

Okay, got it? So I'll tell you where they actually are. So they're gonna be under the the the payments tab on the lower portion. There the the lower part of the screen.

151

0:15:43

P2

Yeah.

152

0:15:45

P2

I just saw that didn't go down that far.

153

0:15:48

Emily

Okay, got it. You didn't look at the bottom all right. Got it? So now that you are here, and you can, I'm not gonna have you tap into anything yet but thoughts on the name of the payments Tab, as being a place where you would look for these copayments.

154

0:16:06

P2

Yes, yeah, this looks like it's pretty much everything I'd need.

155

0:16:12

Emily

Okay, do they? Can you think of anything else? That? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

156

0:16:18

P2

No no go ahead.

157

0:16:19

Emily

Oh, I was. Gonna say, it's so just noting that the payments, Tab was not something you looked@firstst Any thoughts on

158

0:16:28

Emily

maybe a different name, or or a different way that would make more sense to you in terms of finding the co-payments.

159

0:16:36

P2

Well, I know.

160

0:16:38

P2

I mean, I'm just brainstorming here, but I know a lot of apps when you log into them for the 1st time. They kind of give you a little, you know, hey? And they, you know, here's an arrow, and here's a bubble, and it says, Hey, you go here to do this, this and this, and then there's you know. It kind of gives you a tour the 1st time you log into it.

161

0:16:57

P2

That would have, if

162

0:16:59

P2

and I always do. You know, I always click and read all that stuff. So something like that had been present at the beginning of using the app. Then it would have been. I would have known where to go.

163

0:17:10

Emily

Sure, okay, got it. Got it? So now that you so yeah, I got it. So yeah, I've definitely seen lots of those on on new apps that I've download downloaded thoughts on the the naming of the section, it being payments. How is that confusing? Does it make sense? What? What do you feel of that.

164

0:17:31

P2

That that that's a hundred percent spot on.

165

0:17:35

Emily

Alright

166

0:17:36

Emily

right and then excuse me. And then the information that is here on this page. I know we're just. We're just pretending that you might have overpayment debts, even though I know you have not experienced that thoughts on the information presented here specifically about Copays before you actually tap into any more information.

167

0:18:05

P2

no, I mean

168

0:18:08

P2

like the direct deposit information. I I have no idea what that would be used for.

169

0:18:13

Emily

Hmm, okay.

170

0:18:14

P2

I imagine, veterans with higher disabilities and other things that might make more sense for them. For me. It's I, just.

171

0:18:23

P2

you know. I just owe the Gov. A money every month, and.

172

0:18:26

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay.

173

0:18:26

P2

Of things. So I just I would automatically I would automatically go to the Copay

174

0:18:32

P2

section and and would ignore, nor everything else.

175

0:18:36

Emily

Okay? Sure, that makes sense. And how about the the small bit of info under the word copays, the 2 50 due for 2 bills thoughts on that in terms of what might be useful when you're 1st opening up this tab.

176

0:18:52

P2

Yeah, it'd be not. You know it it

177

0:18:56

P2

I mean it. Regardless of what it says. I have to go into it to

178

0:19:03

P2

you know, as you know, when you make a payment through pay.gov you have. There's that long account number that you have to type in. So I'm going into this in hopes of getting that account number.

179

0:19:15

Emily

Yeah.

180

0:19:16

P2

Because it's different every time.

181

0:19:18

Emily

Oh, the the account number is different.

182

0:19:22

P2

It seems to be.

183

0:19:24

Emily

Got it. Okay? I actually was not aware of that.

184

0:19:26

P2

Had it. I've had. I've had it.

185

0:19:27

P2

Yeah, I've had it different. I've had it

186

0:19:30

P2

change on me at times, so.

187

0:19:32

Emily

Got it. Okay.

188

0:19:34

Emily

all right. So let me have you, and you're welcome to hop around. But find out what you currently owe for copayments. In this pretend situation.

189

0:20:03

P2

Well, looks like I owe

190

0:20:06

P2

the Va clinic $200, and it looks like the Tampa Hospital wants 50.

191

0:20:15

Emily

Okay.

192

0:20:17

P2

And can I? Can I click on details? Or is that.

193

0:20:20

Emily

Sure. Yep, yeah, you can. You can go ahead.

194

0:20:23

Emily

Just just one of them is, is is active.

195

0:20:31

P2

There we go!

196

0:20:35

Emily

What sort of sort of information I know you said the the account number is gonna be useful, other things like, what else are you looking to find when looking at a Copay bill.

197

0:20:47

P2

So

198

0:20:49

P2

the the 2 pieces of information is the account number, and and how much? Because they ask you to type in how much you you want to pay and

199

0:21:00

P2

I also look at the due date so I can. I guess there's a fee. If you're late. I think it's a $35 fee or something like that. With your payment and I have to. I have to juggle that payment with social security payments and things like that. So what you have here

200

0:21:19

P2

thing that I look at.

201

0:21:21

Emily

Okay, okay, so not, nothing will be missing from our. For of what you of what you're thinking of, for what you would need.

202

0:21:29

P2

Yeah.

203

0:21:29

P2

Yeah, nothing's missing.

204

0:21:31

Emily

Okay? Got it?

205

0:21:34

Emily

And are you?

206

0:21:37

Emily

for for your own personal code base? Are you visiting different Va locations, or is it all one that you're generally visiting.

207

0:21:46

P2

It's just one.

208

0:21:47

Emily

Just one. Okay, got it.

209

0:21:51

Emily

Okay? And I know you said that you notice that on the previous page we've got $50 here, and $200 for another location. How clear is that it? It? The the fact that it is 2 different locations there.

210

0:22:07

P2

Oh, it's very clear.

211

0:22:09

Emily

Yeah, okay.

212

0:22:10

P2

Yeah.

213

0:22:11

Emily

Got it.

214

0:22:13

P2

Yeah, whoever's doing this good job.

215

0:22:16

Emily

Alright! Great

216

0:22:18

Emily

sounds good. So if you were to pay off a copay, what sort of communication might you want to see if any within the app, for when you do pay off a particular copay.

217

0:22:39

P2

was it?

218

0:22:40

P2

That's kind of a funny question. When I make a payment I would expect to see the

219

0:22:47

P2

you know the confirmation that I've made the payment and just just like I do now. They also tell me, you know, it may take hours or day, a couple of days to process. And they, I get an email. One thing that's really nice is that

220

0:23:04

P2

I can. It asks, you know, is there someone you want a courtesy copy that you've paid this. And I always put my wife's email address in there so that she knows she knows that. You know I paid it.

221

0:23:18

Emily

Hmm, and and that's within pay.gov is that right.

222

0:23:22

P2

Yeah, that's pay.gov.

223

0:23:25

Emily

Okay, got it.

224

0:23:31

Emily

Okay? Let me see, let me have you? Go back, to, oh, sorry, I, skipped over a question, what else? I know you said grabbing account number and knowing when things are due. What else would you want to do here? If anything regarding your co-payments.

225

0:23:57

P2

Well, you know

226

0:24:01

P2

I would probably go to the statement.

227

0:24:04

Emily

Okay.

228

0:24:05

P2

And either. I have a a nas setup.

229

0:24:11

P2

and I have folders for Va. Stuff. I might just

230

0:24:17

P2

pull up the Pdf. And then just save it onto my storage device.

231

0:24:22

Emily

Oh, okay.

232

0:24:23

P2

Just for my record.

233

0:24:26

P2

Oh, I did not! Did I do that? I'm sorry.

234

0:24:29

Emily

That's okay. You can go. We will. We will get to that shortly. Okay, so you you often save the the statement. Pdfs, or you would want to save the statement. Pdfs.

235

0:24:39

P2

Yeah, yeah.

236

0:24:40

Emily

And is that something? Where are you? Is that something? You could do from your phone is that something, you need to do from your computer.

237

0:24:51

P2

Well, I would say, if I were on my phone I would save it to either my Google drive or my onedrive. And then eventually, when I got to, my computer, would

238

0:25:00

P2

move it over to my Nas.

239

0:25:02

Emily

Okay, okay, so since you mentioned, you can go ahead and and open up a Pdf statement here.

240

0:25:13

P2

Well, that looks very familiar.

241

0:25:17

Emily

All right. Yeah. Any other thoughts. Is this something you would be reading on your phone like, what? What? Exactly are you? Are you doing with the the statement. Pdfs.

242

0:25:30

P2

I wouldn't.

243

0:25:32

P2

Yep.

244

0:25:34

P2

Well, 1st I'd make sure that the payment amount matched what the previous screen just said, but other than that, it would be.

245

0:25:41

P2

you know, down, you know, download and save.

246

0:25:45

Emily

Okay.

247

0:25:46

Emily

got it. So you. So you're just downloading here? You're not. You're not, or most likely not, viewing it here.

248

0:25:51

P2

Yeah.

249

0:25:52

P2

yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's financially irresponsible of me, but I don't go through every drug and make sure. You know I just it's

250

0:26:04

P2

I just assumed the Va. Is doing the right thing here in their billing, which is naive of me, I know, but

251

0:26:10

P2

you know there's really no way to check it.

252

0:26:15

Emily

Okay, got it? Alright. You can go ahead and and click done. And are you ever looking at older statements? Or really just, the most recent one.

253

0:26:28

P2

I I've never had any any

254

0:26:33

P2

time that I ever wanted to go back and look at any old, old statements.

255

0:26:37

Emily

Okay, got it? If we're just gonna pretend you want to look at, let's say, March, would you? Where? Where might you look for an older statement here.

256

0:26:52

P2

Let's see, I'm going to go back.

257

0:26:58

P2

You want me just to drive it.

258

0:27:00

Emily

Yeah, yeah, you can just show me where you believe you would find it.

259

0:27:04

Emily

It's thinking, there we go. Good.

260

0:27:09

P2

And then va payment history.

261

0:27:15

Emily

Okay, you're looking at there.

262

0:27:18

P2

And I'm clicking.

263

0:27:21

Emily

Yeah, that that part isn't active. So okay, so you would look under payment.

264

0:27:25

Emily

Yeah, a lot lot of it being a prototype. A lot of things are not are not connected.

265

0:27:31

Emily

Okay? Any. Any other places. You might look for older statements.

266

0:27:47

P2

not on.

267

0:27:49

P2

No, this I mean, this is the money.

268

0:27:51

P2

Tab, right? So this this you've got. I've got history of my payments. I've got direct deposit information which I don't use if I've made an overpayment which I've never done well, I I have. But I didn't know. Anyway, if I thought I did an overpayment. I would look if the if my, if if a dollar amount showed up in overpayments.

269

0:28:12

P2

I would be calling the Va. Because I would assume something is very wrong.

270

0:28:16

Emily

Hmm, okay. Yeah.

271

0:28:18

P2

And and the co-pays. Just to look at what I currently owe. This is 1 1 stop shopping.

272

0:28:26

Emily

Got it. Alright. So now I'm gonna have you tap into a a hidden link, the gray part just below where it says Copays. Let me have you tap that once.

273

0:28:42

P2

Oh, look at that! I got a pop.

274

0:28:45

Emily

That's right. Try try just a brief which it should be within the the prototype. But yeah, just

275

0:28:51

Emily

tap the the gray area, like, right like, right below where it's.

276

0:28:56

P2

Oh, yeah.

277

0:28:57

Emily

Yep, you got it. Okay. And now.

278

0:28:59

P2

Okay.

279

0:29:00

Emily

And

280

0:29:01

Emily

Tap Co. Actually wait. Let me ask a couple of questions first, st which I skipped my apologies. So I know you said, you just know to

281

0:29:10

Emily

to go to pay.gov. You're very experienced with that

282

0:29:14

Emily

thoughts on the version that we just saw.

283

0:29:18

Emily

not having any any direct link over to pay.gov.

284

0:29:29

P2

Well, that would be convenient, I mean, you know the but I will tell you I'm

285

0:29:34

P2

I'm pretty leery about clicking links. I don't even have pay.gov saved on my on the ribbon toolbar at the top of my browser. I always type them in.

286

0:29:47

Emily

Got it.

287

0:29:48

P2

Just because I'm paranoid about the bad, bad people in the world.

288

0:29:53

Emily

Got it all right.

289

0:29:56

Emily

Okay, so let me have you? Oh, yeah, go ahead.

290

0:29:59

P2

No, I was just going to say. The impression I'm getting from this is that

291

0:30:05

P2

that my like, I'm I'm going to be able to make a payment through this app.

292

0:30:12

P2

It doesn't. It's not clear to me that I still need to go to pay.gov to do that.

293

0:30:18

Emily

Okay, got it

294

0:30:19

Emily

would. If you were to see. So if, if, like, this is something that may actually be built,

295

0:30:26

Emily

how do you think you would make a payment if we're if we're we're pretending that this this is actually built, the way that you're seeing it right now?

296

0:30:37

P2

Okay. Well, I would go to Copays, and then

297

0:30:44

P2

I would do a review. Details.

298

0:30:50

P2

And oops. I did not mean to do that. And then

299

0:30:57

P2

somewhere, like maybe underneath the the go to your current statement. Maybe if there was another little rectangular box that said, Go to go go to pay.gov.

300

0:31:11

P2

you know.

301

0:31:14

Emily

Okay, got it. So

302

0:31:16

Emily

so you know, pretending that this the way you're seeing it now, if it might be built that there would not be a link. What do you think? The likelihood that you would use? It would be knowing that there, that there's not that specific link that you just referenced.

303

0:31:35

P2

I would use the app or use with no, with no link.

304

0:31:40

P2

I'm not sure I understand the question.

305

0:31:42

Emily

I guess I'm I'm wondering, how how you feel about using the app to to view things that you might be pay, that you might have to pay, but not have that that direct link available.

306

0:31:56

P2

Oh, that's fine! I mean, it's kind of like what's what it is now. So you know.

307

0:32:01

Emily

Okay.

308

0:32:02

P2

Yeah, it would be, okay. Oh, this!

309

0:32:04

Emily

Alright sounds good. Okay, so let me have you go. But if you want to just tap the payments on the lower right. I'm gonna have you go back to that screen. There we go, and then scroll to the bottom and tap the little gray, the the the blank gray area again to have you switch to another version. For some reason it switched back so hopefully.

310

0:32:29

P2

I'm tapping.

311

0:32:34

Emily

If it doesn't work I'll send something else. But

312

0:32:39

P2

Maybe if I like, I don't know, go back and then come back into it.

313

0:32:45

Emily

No try.

314

0:32:47

Emily

So yeah, like, like the the gray area just below the word bills. For example.

315

0:32:52

Emily

if you tap that once it. I know it worked before so it could just be. The prototype is being a little bit slow, in which case I will send you a different link.

316

0:33:01

Emily

Give me just a moment.

317

0:33:09

Emily

Alright

318

0:33:14

Emily

holidays. I just have to bring that up slowness on my end.

319

0:33:23

Emily

Okay, with payment.

320

0:33:31

Emily

Okay? So I'm gonna send you a different link right there. Okay, go ahead and open the new one.

321

0:33:39

P2

Okay.

322

0:33:41

Emily

Okay.

323

0:34:16

P2

My poor little phone.

324

0:34:17

Emily

It's trying.

325

0:34:19

Emily

I know it's almost there. It's getting there.

326

0:34:24

P2

Come on.

327

0:34:25

P2

I can see it. There we go. Okay. So go ahead and go back to that. That payments tab on the bottom right.

328

0:34:35

Emily

Yep, and then tap into copays again on the bottom.

329

0:34:44

Emily

Okay, there we go. This is the right one. Okay, so a couple we're gonna get. Actually, you know, so let's let's this is, this is a little bit different. So I know you, you talked about how you might do a payment.

330

0:35:00

Emily

Now that it's different, let me have you walk me through. How? How you would do a payment now that we've got a slightly different design here.

331

0:35:08

Emily

Sorry for that, for that.

332

0:35:10

P2

Oh, okay.

333

0:35:11

Emily

Hospital or Yeah Veterans Hospital in Tampa.

334

0:35:13

P2

For the 1st one. Yeah, so so

335

0:35:15

P2

so in Tampa, I see the pay bill, so I'd be very happy, and I will click that. Oh, look at that!

336

0:35:23

P2

That's so cool.

337

0:35:25

P2

Now, do people actually, where do you pay in person at? I've

338

0:35:31

P2

that's a new one on me. But anyway, I would go to. I I

339

0:35:35

P2

I'm sorry I would tap on the pay.gov.

340

0:35:38

Emily

Okay, good. And and you can go ahead and do that. And I promise I'm not. Gonna have you enter in any financial information whatsoever. This is, just to understand the experience.

341

0:35:50

P2

And I am clicking. Leave? Oh, there we go!

342

0:35:58

Emily

Okay? So and have you paid with pay.gov on the phone.

343

0:36:06

P2

No, I always do it on my computer.

344

0:36:09

Emily

Got it. Okay, great and maybe you scroll down there just wanted to get to one thing. Go to continue to the form. I'm not. Gonna have you add any information beyond this, but just wanna get to that so it should look familiar. And I know you said that you always need to grab your your account number.

345

0:36:31

Emily

Thoughts on

346

0:36:33

Emily

finding that that account number like, if you were actually paying on the phone. What would you be doing from here now that you've clicked over to pay.gov.

347

0:36:43

P2

Well, I would be cursing going. Why didn't they give me a link to copy my account number before I got here?

348

0:36:50

Emily

Okay.

349

0:36:51

P2

Other than that I would go back to this and

350

0:37:01

P2

I'm not sure what I'm looking at.

351

0:37:04

Emily

Yeah, that.

352

0:37:04

P2

Points.

353

0:37:06

Emily

I, I.

354

0:37:06

P2

Gonna go.

355

0:37:07

Emily

Tap on that recent. And let's just see what happens.

356

0:37:12

Emily

I love when technology isn't quite working the way that I think it should work.

357

0:37:17

Emily

Boo-poo!

358

0:37:29

P2

I really enjoy doing this. I'm excited to help make things better.

359

0:37:35

Emily

I'm good.

360

0:37:36

P2

So this this is just, you know.

361

0:37:38

P2

Find me up anytime you need need need need need to test something.

362

0:37:42

Emily

Well, there's often a lot of people looking to test various things. Okay, so

363

0:37:48

P2

Yeah.

364

0:37:48

Emily

Tap on the payment.

365

0:37:49

P2

So I would go to.

366

0:37:51

Emily

Well, yeah, we're gonna try. This is the different and scroll to the bottom and try tapping into that that gray rectangle again. And we're gonna see if I can switch over to the other version. Yes, okay, good. It worked and tap into copays again.

367

0:38:08

Emily

So I'm gonna check out and get you back to where you were. Okay. So you had done the from here.

368

0:38:14

P2

So.

369

0:38:15

Emily

Yep.

370

0:38:17

P2

Right, and now I would. I would go over to review details.

371

0:38:22

Emily

Okay, go ahead and do that.

372

0:38:26

P2

And then, Oh, look! There's a copy button I didn't see before.

373

0:38:30

Emily

Right? Okay.

374

0:38:31

P2

Thank you.

375

0:38:34

Emily

Alright. So now that won't actually do it.

376

0:38:36

P2

And then.

377

0:38:38

Emily

Yeah, we would just pretend that.

378

0:38:39

P2

And then I would.

379

0:38:40

Emily

And then you would.

380

0:38:41

P2

Go back to pay.gov, and

381

0:38:46

Emily

And I won't, and nothing nothing will copy. So that was just

382

0:38:50

P2

Yeah.

383

0:38:51

Emily

Just just fake there, now that you see how it's it may work in an ideal world. Thoughts on that, on, on having that that copy option and getting back to pay.gov.

384

0:39:03

P2

That's that's normal method of operation, for, like almost everything you do when you're dealing with.

385

0:39:10

P2

you know, even I. I use a password manager, one password, and a lot of websites aren't integrated with that. And so I have to go in.

386

0:39:19

P2

copy the the username, go back, put it paste it in, go back to one password cop tap and it copies the password. Go back to the app. I'm very comfortable with that, because I do it multiple times a day. My wife, on the other hand, I would tell you that if she were having to deal with this she would have a meltdown.

387

0:39:37

Emily

Hmm. Oh, okay.

388

0:39:41

P2

She? She doesn't hop between apps. Very well. That just seems.

389

0:39:45

Emily

The flipping.

390

0:39:47

P2

Beyond her.

391

0:39:47

Emily

Like, yeah, okay, got it.

392

0:39:50

Emily

And then. So now that you've seen roughly how this might work in terms of copying, knowing you would have to flip applications. What do you believe? The likelihood of using this version that had the direct link, and had the copying

393

0:40:09

Emily

compares to the 1st version that did not have the payment link.

394

0:40:15

P2

This is now one-stop shopping, and I love that.

395

0:40:21

Emily

Okay, got it.

396

0:40:23

Emily

And let me have you tap to sorry return to figma, and hopefully, it will behave and least stay where it was before. Let's find out.

397

0:40:35

Emily

Okay, there we go. Excuse me. Okay, good. So we're gonna we're gonna pause on the the payment conversation. So we're going to pretend that you have seen an error. This particular you look at this statement to realize, hey? I didn't actually attend this particular date, or maybe there was a prescription didn't have, or you know, something. What would be your next step in terms of

398

0:41:04

Emily

possibly correcting, or yeah, what? What would you believe you you would do if you see something that you don't believe you need to pay.

399

0:41:11

P2

Well, I would

400

0:41:14

P2

either hit payments or the the go back, you know, to co-pays. I want to get back to the payment screen, and then there was

401

0:41:30

P2

you know it would be. It would be a combination of looking at payment history.

402

0:41:34

Emily

Okay.

403

0:41:34

P2

And and so I could line up past bills with past payments.

404

0:41:42

P2

And then

405

0:41:45

P2

I would go back to the Copays, where it

406

0:41:50

P2

you know where it says I have a bill to pay.

407

0:41:55

P2

I would make a note of the Tampa, but I would. I would do the review details, because I'm I would bet you good money that they're in that statement in the Pdf.

408

0:42:08

P2

that there's a phone number in here somewhere. I can call.

409

0:42:11

Emily

Okay, so you'd be looking for a number. Got it.

410

0:42:14

P2

Yep, and I mean, do you want me to do that?

411

0:42:18

Emily

No, no, it's okay. You can go ahead and click click done.

412

0:42:22

P2

Oh, yeah.

413

0:42:24

Emily

Oops!

414

0:42:24

P2

Here's an oops I can't zoom.

415

0:42:28

Emily

There is so that's a pro tip thing. If you tap once it should do a little fake. Zoom there. Yeah, that's

416

0:42:35

Emily

there you go!

417

0:42:36

Emily

Limitation of the prototype. But and.

418

0:42:39

P2

Okay.

419

0:42:40

Emily

Reality. You would be able to, you know, do the the 2 finger things. So yeah.

420

0:42:45

P2

Yeah. And there's see statement questions. I'd call that number first.st

421

0:42:50

Emily

Okay, got it. You did that first.st Okay, go ahead. Go ahead and click done there. Would there be any any other information or guidance you might be looking for outside of calling that number that you found on the statement.

422

0:43:06

P2

I can't think of any I mean I I know. I know there's an over they're telling me I owe money. I don't believe I do think there's a number. I'm hoping that connects me to the right person. If not, they will hopefully connect me to the right person. And it, you know we'll we'll go from there.

423

0:43:22

Emily

Okay, got it? And then second question, actually, since you mentioned this was a bit of real life, you would you. You had called someone when when there, there was concern about about payment. If you were gonna pretend that you didn't believe you had the money to pay a specific bill. Would you? Would you still call? You believe? I know you had mentioned that there was a phone call you had done before.

424

0:43:49

P2

Yeah, I I would call, you know. I mean I I

425

0:43:53

P2

there's always that fear that if I if I mess up.

426

0:43:57

P2

you know I lose my Va. Benefits. So I'm very proactive about, you know, at least, and if even if there was nothing that they could do.

427

0:44:07

Emily

-h.

428

0:44:07

P2

At least they could put. They could put notes in the records that, hey? He called, and it'll and notified us that the payment was going to be late. He said he could pay in full on this date, so that you know they know that I'm not just neglecting them.

429

0:44:22

Emily

Right? Okay, got it? And were you so like when you had to make a call before how did you become aware that there might be options for let's say, delaying a payment, for example.

430

0:44:37

P2

Well, we never got into that conversation because she

431

0:44:41

P2

She informed me that I'd already paid met my $[redacted], and I didn't know anything, and I was like, Oh, oh, you know, Bonus.

432

0:44:53

Emily

All right, and then

433

0:44:57

Emily

Let me have you tap on the help on the upper right.

434

0:45:03

Emily

I want to get your thoughts. I think you had

435

0:45:06

Emily

tapped on it earlier, accidentally, yeah. So thoughts on the the topics here. If this might be something you would use or

436

0:45:16

Emily

yeah, what? What your thoughts on these are.

437

0:45:27

P2

I think you've got it pretty much covered. It's if I have a question. If I

438

0:45:32

P2

can't make a payment, or I need some assistance or something, if I

439

0:45:38

P2

am adamantly disagreeing with the bill, I there's that, and if let's say

440

0:45:49

P2

you know, I know that just a few months ago.

441

0:45:53

P2

after a certain organization visited social security. My wife didn't get a social security check, and we had to go down to social security.

442

0:46:03

P2

Anyway, we'll leave that there. So yeah, if I if my social security stopped, I would definitely be using that bottom

443

0:46:12

P2

option.

444

0:46:13

Emily

Hmm, okay, got it. If you wanna go ahead and and and tap into into that one just to see where that goes.

445

0:46:28

Emily

and I believe you should be able to tap that as well.

446

0:46:33

Emily

Oh, maybe. Okay. Sometimes this is this, one's a little wonky sometimes.

447

0:46:38

P2

Yeah, it's it's kind of you. Yeah, you can see, it's kind of not wanting.

448

0:46:43

Emily

Thinking.

449

0:46:43

P2

You all here.

450

0:46:44

Emily

Yeah, that's okay. That happens sometimes. I'll go ahead and click close there.

451

0:46:52

Emily

Okay?

452

0:46:54

Emily

And all right.

453

0:46:58

Emily

so thoughts on this experience on our on our pretend app compared to how you have done things on vi.gov. I know you mentioned this is like a 1-stop shop. Other thoughts on the information here, the experience of

454

0:47:18

Emily

seeing the Copays and potentially paying.

455

0:47:22

P2

So as as my method. My mo right now is, I get the bill.

456

0:47:30

P2

I sit down at the computer

457

0:47:32

P2

and I go to, you know. I look. I look the bill over real quick

458

0:47:37

P2

go to pay.gov, and I pay it.

459

0:47:41

P2

This, you know, would be

460

0:47:48

P2

If I didn't have that piece of paper, this would be a a perfect option.

461

0:47:56

P2

because it provides me with everything I need to make that payment.

462

0:48:00

Emily

Okay, good to know?

463

0:48:03

P2

So so you know, you know, here's here's the thing that that

464

0:48:08

P2

that I would worry about, knowing that there is a disconnection between the current website.

465

0:48:15

P2

And the getting the bills in the mail, you know.

466

0:48:23

P2

I would be a little leery of I wonder if that disconnect

467

0:48:28

P2

is still in place with this new app, or if that has been been resolved.

468

0:48:34

Emily

Got it. Okay? And oh, sorry. Go ahead.

469

0:48:37

P2

No, you know. And then the other thought would be, well.

470

0:48:40

P2

if there's no Pdf. If they show. No, you know, if if there's no, if there's a Pdf of a bill.

471

0:48:49

P2

I'm assuming that Bill is also being mailed, so I would be very confused.

472

0:48:55

Emily

Hmm, okay.

473

0:48:57

Emily

Thoughts on

474

0:49:00

Emily

how? That could be less confusing to you to, so that you know you're looking at the correct information.

475

0:49:07

P2

So the yes, I do have a thought about that now. I don't know.

476

0:49:13

P2

if that $[redacted] Copay cap is standard, for

477

0:49:19

P2

you know, people, you know, I only have a [redacted]% disability. So if that's kind of standard.

478

0:49:24

P2

maybe there could be a little running total somewhere that says, you know

479

0:49:32

P2

you've you know it's like copays, and it it'll have, you know, to date. You've paid $500 slash

480

0:49:41

P2

of the $700. That's your cap

481

0:49:44

P2

kind of a thing, you know.

482

0:49:45

P2

I'm saying.

483

0:49:46

Emily

Yep. Yep.

484

0:49:47

P2

Something like that.

485

0:49:49

Emily

Okay.

486

0:49:50

P2

That would make me feel really comfortable, that oh, hey! They're they're actually tracking this for me.

487

0:49:56

Emily

Got it. Okay? So more communication on just how close you are to that to that cap.

488

0:50:02

P2

Now.

489

0:50:03

Emily

Okay, and then any other thoughts specifically on how any of these pages or sections are labeled.

490

0:50:13

Emily

anything that might make it more clear for you.

491

0:50:22

P2

No, they're they're you're talking about like at the bottom of the page.

492

0:50:26

Emily

Yeah, it could be the bottom, or really any any of the the pages that you've gone through. If there is any parts that

493

0:50:32

P2

No, it it's it's it's very similar to what I deal with now. I mean, if I want to go to health that brings me to the appointment thing, and the and the refills and

494

0:50:44

P2

and the tracking and stuff and and

495

0:50:49

P2

I'm assuming at some point that would also let me get into my download. My health records.

496

0:50:55

Emily

Hmm, okay.

497

0:50:56

P2

The

498

0:50:57

P2

benefits that just that's always just you know, your [redacted]%. And this is how much you get a month. And that's usually all that that ever says

499

0:51:08

P2

and then and then the payments is is very.

500

0:51:13

P2

very straightforward. I will tell you that I just discovered on the current system.

501

0:51:19

P2

How to

502

0:51:21

P2

order my supplies for my [redacted], and some stuff for my [redacted] which I thought was really cool.

503

0:51:28

Emily

Oh, okay, did you recall how you learned how to do that?

504

0:51:33

P2

I stumbled upon it.

505

0:51:35

Emily

There you go!

506

0:51:39

Emily

And that was on.

507

0:51:40

P2

Push buttons.

508

0:51:41

Emily

And I'm sorry was that on the app or on the website.

509

0:51:45

P2

It was the website.

510

0:51:46

Emily

Website. Okay, got it?

511

0:51:48

Emily

Well, it's nice to discover. Discover new things. Then.

512

0:51:52

P2

Yeah.

513

0:51:53

Emily

Okay, and then anything else you'd like to share? Specifically regarding managing finances that we have not already gone over in regards to the Va. In the app.

514

0:52:07

P2

No, I I thought your section there with the help was covered the bases. I mean.

515

0:52:14

P2

this is, this was, some people have worked pretty hard.

516

0:52:18

Emily

All right. Got it.

517

0:52:19

P2

Where you've gotten so.

518

0:52:21

Emily

Okay. I.

519

0:52:22

P2

Job.

520

0:52:22

Emily

Oh, yeah, thank you. So I I know you said that you would like if you I forgot to follow up with this like if you had questions, or if you wanted to thought that they made an error, you would call

521

0:52:34

Emily

any thoughts of if you might use that that help section we looked at to find information first, st or just go directly to calling.

522

0:52:51

P2

I would.

523

0:52:53

P2

That's a good question.

524

0:52:55

P2

When I thought there, when I needed help, I didn't go to.

525

0:53:01

P2

I didn't do any web searching or do anything. I just grabbed the phone number office an old statement and made a phone call.

526

0:53:08

Emily

Okay, got it

527

0:53:12

Emily

all right. Sounds good. And then I'm gonna check in with my team here. If anyone has any questions, Natasha, Natalie, if you have anything, please unmute yourself and

528

0:53:25

Emily

asks, ask here, excuse me.

529

0:53:33

Emily

Okay, I'll take that as a No. So now that we've I think that is everything but I want to check in once again. Now that we've had the whole conversation. Are you still comfortable? If we potentially use a video clip of this with our Va. Partners.

530

0:53:52

P2

Oh, yes, of course. Anything to help make this better, I mean, that's the whole point of the conversation.

531

0:53:58

Emily

It is, it is all right. Well, yeah, that is all we have really appreciate you taking the time. It's always helpful, as you know it's very important to to talk with with veterans to get

532

0:54:09

Emily

your exact experiences, so I'm sure you'll have fun doing more of these in the future. Paragene will be reaching back out, sending you a thank you. Note also a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans.

533

0:54:25

Emily

and that is it for me, so I really appreciate your time. Thank you so much, and I hope.

534

0:54:32

P2

Very welcome.

535

0:54:33

Emily

Your day.

536

0:54:34

P2

Oh, thank you, and I hope all of you have a great day, and thank you again for allowing

537

0:54:40

P2

participate.

538

0:54:41

Emily

Alright sounds great. Thank you so much.

539

0:54:44

P2

Good, good. Have a good day.

540

0:54:45

Emily

Emily

Gordon out

2

0:00:02

Emily

alright. So now that we are recording just want to confirm, are you okay? If I record the audio and video here today.

3

0:00:09

P5

Yes.

4

0:00:10

Emily

Okay, great. And would you? Okay, if I potentially show some clips of this conversation to our Va partners?

5

0:00:17

P5

Yes.

6

0:00:18

Emily

Okay, great. Thank you so much, so great. So let's I'd love to hear just a little bit about yourself specifically as a veteran what branch of the military do you serve when you retired or separated.

7

0:00:34

P5

[redacted] separated 2013.

8

0:00:38

Emily

Okay, got it?

9

0:00:40

Emily

And what sort of experience have you had with veteran affairs since then?

10

0:00:46

P5

I'm disabled veteran. I use the healthcare, use educational benefits.

11

0:00:51

P5

travel claims, those those kind of things.

12

0:00:54

Emily

Okay, good and have you? Or how much experience have you had using the Va website? And or the Va app.

13

0:01:03

P5

Both. I think I'm pretty close to expert.

14

0:01:07

Emily

Okay.

15

0:01:08

P5

Look at the logins, you know.

16

0:01:10

P5

messaging the clinics. And yeah, I feel very well acclimated for somebody who doesn't work for the Va.

17

0:01:18

Emily

Oh, got it? And in what? In what cases do you choose to use the app over the website?

18

0:01:27

P5

As much as I can and and a lot of it's just because it's just. It's the apps great for anything. You look up what you got paid if

19

0:01:38

P5

basically anything. With the exception of like educational, it's just easier to use the website

20

0:01:45

P5

for some reason like. It's that web like post 9 11 gi. Benefits, for instance, are well queued. But anything healthcare related.

21

0:01:53

P5

or to check the claim or benefits disability like letter, like, it's everything you need or to generate letters that you might need.

22

0:02:06

P5

you know. So it's yeah, made basically anything minus like educational.

23

0:02:11

Emily

Okay, got it. So you're using it for most things sounds like.

24

0:02:14

Emily

okay, and now we're just going to move into the the financial portion of the discussion. So I want to make sure you're only sharing what you're willing. I have no additional information about your finance. Oh, sorry! Go ahead.

25

0:02:26

P5

I'm an open book. That's fine.

26

0:02:28

Emily

Oh, got it. Okay? Sorry. All right. So first, st we're going to be discussing debt. So have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for any sort of like benefit, overpayment, debt.

27

0:02:41

P5

Ye? Yes, yes, I have.

28

0:02:43

Emily

Okay, and it, whatever level you're comfortable. Could you tell me just a little bit about that experience?

29

0:02:50

P5

I have. Most recently I I have a book stipend post 9 11 Gi. Bill overpayment from the spring or late winter, for like $[redacted].

30

0:03:02

P5

I have. I actually have not received the letter for it. I just view it as kind of small potatoes, and they're very. I just figure it. It was in an over site on the Va. And I got overpaid and and.

31

0:03:19

P5

They track that stuff very well. So I figured it is a legit debt. I just don't know how they're gonna I think it. I I glanced at it on. That's how I learned. So I was looking up my post 9, 11 gi benefits. And then somehow, I scroll over, and there was this thing like, you have one debt, and I'm like, What is that?

32

0:03:37

P5

So I I've never received a letter. And when I received the letter. It's going to be very confusing, and I just take it as they're very fair, firm, and consistent, so I I believe it's right. And then I had a

33

0:03:51

P5

overpayment of like [redacted] bucks

34

0:03:55

P5

a couple of years ago is before Covid had been 2,017 or 2018, and then I disputed it, and I just don't remember the details of so long ago and

35

0:04:06

P5

end up squashing it. I never. It got squared away or something. And yeah

36

0:04:14

P5

was from either [redacted]. I want to say it was from [redacted].

37

0:04:23

P5

yeah, I just. I just don't remember. It was so long ago. And

38

0:04:27

P5

I yeah, I just. It's out of sight, out of mind.

39

0:04:30

Emily

Okay, got it. And for that one were you sent a letter for that one? Do you recall you were okay, got it.

40

0:04:36

P5

Yeah, it's cause I I used to get the letter and

41

0:04:39

P5

I would call, and somehow it it had to do with the school. I was going to [redacted] at the time, and they weren't doing something right. And when they did ended up washing it clean. So

42

0:04:51

P5

okay. So it was taken care of. Got it.

43

0:04:54

Emily

And then for the current one, where you said you owe the the $83, but haven't received any letter. When you were you able to find any information when you did happened upon it? Like, when it might be due, or like any other information.

44

0:05:08

P5

Yeah, there wasn't much information. It was something book and supply stipend, and would notice I would get that $[redacted], and you know what it was. Probably I think it was from May and

45

0:05:19

P5

the school when I graduated the last day was like April something, and I think they Re. They did it for May and error. So I just don't have much issue with the debt. I don't. I'm not gonna dispute it. I don't think, but I don't. Yeah.

46

0:05:38

P5

Know the details out? Yeah.

47

0:05:41

Emily

All right. And then how about for have you had any experience with medical co-pays through? Va.

48

0:05:48

P5

No, no, nothing, no worries, issues anything, healthcare.

49

0:05:53

Emily

Okay, got it.

50

0:05:56

Emily

And any in regards to the the overpayment debt that you that you stumbled upon. I know, I said, you haven't received a letter. It may be confusing when you do any thoughts on what could be made easier in terms of the communication from Va.

51

0:06:14

P5

No, I in here I don't know, too. It could have got lost in the mail. The Va. Is really good about sending letters. I don't have mail issues where I'm at. I again. This was a couple of weeks ago. I learned about it. Now. I'm curious to log in and just kind of peak my curiosity about it, even though I'm not that worried about it. Just be again, because they're very diligent like these things.

52

0:06:36

P5

It just it. It probably is an overpayment of $[redacted].

53

0:06:43

P5

yeah, I just, I just really haven't put much food to thought on it.

54

0:06:46

Emily

Okay, great, all right. So now I'm going to have you share your screen. And then we're going to go through downloading figma and get things going there. Let me know if you need help to share your screen.

55

0:07:22

Emily

Alright! It is starting.

56

0:07:25

P5

No.

57

0:07:26

Emily

I think you just have to tap anywhere outside of that stuff. Perfect. Okay, so now let me see if you, if you're able to download the figma app. We'll just do it right here. If you're able to get to your app store.

58

0:07:42

Emily

Let me know if you need help. With that

59

0:07:50

Emily

I just.

60

0:07:51

P5

Spell that again. FIGM. A.

61

0:07:52

Emily

FIGM. A. Yeah. So the top one where it just says Figma.

62

0:07:56

Emily

and yep, the one halfway down that will be.

63

0:08:00

P5

That's.

64

0:08:01

Emily

Yep, that one.

65

0:08:06

P5

Nope.

66

0:08:07

Emily

We're not paying for anything, I promise

67

0:08:16

Emily

you may have to open up the app store again. Yeah, just make sure it's where did it go?

68

0:08:23

Emily

Okay? Oh, there we are. Must have gotten paused for some reason.

69

0:08:27

P5

And.

70

0:08:28

Emily

Oh, done alright and wait for that to show up.

71

0:08:34

Emily

Okay? Installing almost there. All right.

72

0:08:39

Emily

Alright. So we go to login to figma.

73

0:08:44

Emily

Yeah, continue there.

74

0:08:46

Emily

Okay, so for email, it's gonna be VA test 0 0 0@gmail.com.

75

0:08:56

Emily

Oh, one more 0. It's 3 zeros.

76

0:09:00

Emily

Yep.

77

0:09:06

Emily

okay. And the password is VAVA. VAVA.

78

0:09:13

Emily

They need 8 characters. And I try to make it easy.

79

0:09:17

Emily

Okay? And then I just need to send you a confirmation. Give me just a moment opening up the email over here. Okay, I can see it. And all right, the authentication code is 4, 2, 5,

80

0:09:30

Emily

7, 3, 9, 4.

81

0:09:35

P5

Okay.

82

0:09:37

Emily

Get that going and continue with mobile app.

83

0:09:41

Emily

Give it just a moment.

84

0:09:45

P5

Okay.

85

0:09:47

Emily

Try. Okay. Alright. Now. Give it just a moment. I don't click on that just yet. I am just getting you. There. We go

86

0:09:57

Emily

within the zoom app. I'm gonna send you a link.

87

0:10:03

Emily

So yeah, go back to Zoom. And that should be, think you may have to

88

0:10:08

Emily

tap somewhere in the top to get back to. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, there we go, alright. If you tap, and then there we go chat at the bottom.

89

0:10:23

Emily

Yeah, the the the chat notification. On the bottom left.

90

0:10:28

Emily

Yep, there you go alright. So tap that extra long link.

91

0:10:32

Emily

All right, we're doing well. So technology wants to cooperate.

92

0:10:42

Emily

All right. It worked. I love technology works. Okay, so now, here is our pretend mobile app. So right now don't click on anything quite yet. But as as of course you've you've said you've you use the app on a regular basis, so this should look mostly familiar without without having anything. Where would you expect to find any any indication of money that you owe to Va.

93

0:11:13

P5

Messages, I would say.

94

0:11:18

Emily

Okay? Any other thoughts. So is that right? So you'd mostly go into messages. Other thoughts of other places. You might go.

95

0:11:30

P5

Benefits the lower, which is where we are?

96

0:11:33

P5

No, that would be it. Yeah.

97

0:11:38

Emily

Okay, got it? So it's actually where we are thinking about putting. This is actually under the payments. On the the lower, right? So any thoughts is that that wasn't 1 that you mentioned.

98

0:11:50

P5

Oh!

99

0:11:50

Emily

Any thoughts on how that might be more clear if there might be a different title that would be more appropriate. You think.

100

0:12:00

P5

Good question. See, I'm so mindful of payments. Is this your P, your your payment history? And if you have to change direct deposit which now everything streamlined to one. You only do one direct deposit and

101

0:12:14

P5

you know, I like this overpayment debt thing, and then copays.

102

0:12:22

P5

yeah, I don't think you so. You got home health benefits, payments. I wouldn't want to add another toggle on the bottom.

103

0:12:30

P5

Very well thought out, in my opinion.

104

0:12:32

Emily

Okay, got it? Any other thoughts regarding this particular page? I know you said you. You like the the clarity of breaking up the overpayment and debt.

105

0:12:42

Emily

How about sorry. Go ahead.

106

0:12:45

P5

No, I don't. I think this looks really good.

107

0:12:48

Emily

Okay, got it? And

108

0:12:51

Emily

how about the the information that is below the word overpayment debts? Any thoughts on from just from a high level. Other types of information you might want to see. There.

109

0:13:04

P5

No, because it has due for 4 deaths.

110

0:13:08

P5

I don't know what you would, could put without taking up more space and making it more. You know something convoluted.

111

0:13:15

Emily

Okay, got it.

112

0:13:18

Emily

And then actually, let me have you go back? Just to that payments, page just for a moment and one more question on that. If. Yeah, yeah. There, yeah.

113

0:13:27

Emily

thoughts on. Since I know you said that payments you always think of

114

0:13:32

Emily

that are that are sent to you any thoughts on the organization of this. Now that this will be including both money comes to you, and money going out.

115

0:13:44

P5

No, because I can see the whole page payments you that, and bills like this is very well thought out, in my opinion.

116

0:13:51

Emily

Okay.

117

0:13:53

Emily

Alright, great.

118

0:13:53

P5

Sharing user.

119

0:13:55

Emily

Okay, good to know. All right. So yeah. So now, if you want to tap into the overpayment debts where I know you were you were going a moment ago? And actually, I'm sorry. Go back. Go back to payments.

120

0:14:10

Emily

Yeah, there we go. Scroll to the bottom. Just gonna send you to kind of a little hidden link. If you can tap in the the empty gray section below Copays tap that once I'm gonna get. Yeah, okay, perfect.

121

0:14:24

Emily

All right. Yes. Now we're good, all right. And oh, go back. We're under Wonder Copay. Sometimes the

122

0:14:32

Emily

this thing is a little little a little bit finicky.

123

0:14:35

Emily

Yes, perfect. Thank you. All right. If you want to tap into overpayment debts.

124

0:14:41

Emily

we're under co-pays. Yeah. So tap overpayment debts. Let me see? Yeah, okay, now we are perfect.

125

0:14:47

Emily

So thoughts on the information presented here, how clear would it be to you to see just how much you currently owe.

126

0:15:01

P5

Hmm, no, I I think this is really good.

127

0:15:05

P5

I mean, you got the green

128

0:15:07

P5

showing Arrow like on the post 9 11 Gi. Debt bill for books and supplies. You got the question mark.

129

0:15:17

P5

You know.

130

0:15:19

P5

So obviously, this tuition contact us department treasury sounds like it's very convoluted, very complicated. You know the disability compensation one. We're reducing your benefit. And as long as I get details that's good.

131

0:15:32

P5

Oh, this. Yeah, this is pretty good.

132

0:15:37

Emily

Okay?

133

0:15:38

Emily

So we're going to look at. Oh, actually, one question. If you have a a new debt that comes how would you expect to to be notified, and to and to know that there is a new debt.

134

0:15:54

P5

Well, I think it'll be good if there's and I don't know. Maybe I'm not set up for it. On the Va. App about notifications like if you had say your monthly disability thing hit, and it had a notification. Now, I don't need that. I don't track it that closely, but I could see for most people it would be important. But if you could sign up for notifications and get that like, I get notifications, I believe if I no, I don't

135

0:16:22

P5

like if I get an email, I think I do from a healthcare

136

0:16:26

P5

person like a nurse nurse practitioner, maybe. But it's been so long. I just don't recall.

137

0:16:32

Emily

Hmm.

138

0:16:33

P5

You know, I forget how I know that I'm getting.

139

0:16:37

P5

Yeah, there's a way to get a notification. That's probably the only thing would be kind of cool.

140

0:16:42

Emily

All right, got it. So we're going to just focus on that top one, the post 9, 11 for housing. What would you need to know for for this particular debt? What's what's important to you?

141

0:16:58

P5

Kind of like a

142

0:16:59

P5

like an access to the letter. So like, if you go into Va disability like, you can basically get all your letters on your iphone.

143

0:17:06

Emily

Hmm, okay.

144

0:17:07

P5

Generate letters. Obviously, you don't need to generate a letter here, but like to be able to quickly access the VA Letter would be very helpful, I would think. I would like to be able to do that. And then

145

0:17:22

P5

payment due dates.

146

0:17:24

P5

Yeah, kind of the transaction history which you have. Oh, I see it. Now you got this these letters. 1st command letter second, yeah, I really wouldn't add anything, because it's

147

0:17:35

P5

you want to keep it simple and to the point. So looks really good, actually.

148

0:17:40

Emily

Okay, got it? So since you specifically mentioned the the letters, can you? Can you tap into that the details again of that top one.

149

0:17:50

Emily

Yeah, there we go. Yeah. Thoughts on the information presented here regarding the letters on the bottom.

150

0:18:04

P5

No, as long as you click it. I mean, you got the date. You got the 1st letter, second letter, chronological order. I don't think anything better you can do.

151

0:18:11

Emily

Okay, so would you. Would. Would you expect to be able to? To to view the letters here?

152

0:18:17

P5

I would. I'm just, from personal history I just know there's no way to do that in the app. But it it would be very easy instead of having to go to the VA website on a desktop. Like the VA app is really good. The only thing it's not easy with is it doesn't touch anything post 9/11 Gi. Bill. And anything that's

153

0:18:37

P5

so. Those 2 are incorporated. I mean, the app would be perfect. You would never have to use the site you you have the face id cause that dhs login stuff like it can be like complicated. And then I do like did me. But I think for some reason I have one from like a work old work email, so that even gets convoluted. But like the Va app is. So it it's everything it needs to be. And it's nothing that it's not. And it works perfect. So

154

0:19:07

P5

I think this looks really good. Actually, I wanna

155

0:19:11

P5

critique it. I'm also not very critical of apps. But I'm I'm easy to please. But this, yeah, just I'm trying to think of it from someone else's.

156

0:19:20

P5

You know, have a different perspective. You know what the perspective is. I think this is perfect.

157

0:19:26

Emily

Okay, got it? So yes. Any other information that you would feel necessary?

158

0:19:33

Emily

From for the for the for this particular debt.

159

0:19:37

P5

No, but especially like with the debts, because I mean, you can kind of snowball things get worse. There's a way to get notifications on your phone. It'd be super easy.

160

0:19:45

Emily

Oh, okay, notifications about like, what? What specific notifications would you want?

161

0:19:50

P5

You have a new letter, or you have a, you know, a new amount owed, or hmm

162

0:19:56

P5

payment received like those kind of things.

163

0:19:59

Emily

Okay, got it.

164

0:20:01

Emily

And then,

165

0:20:03

Emily

if you have paid off a debt, what would you expect to see in the app once that has been paid off.

166

0:20:12

P5

Just a transaction history. So you have, like late fee, partial payment, just like debt, close or closure of that would be bolded so July whatever. 25, th to about 5 closure of debt received via Ach! Minus whatever, and then, like an asterisk, your debt is resolved.

167

0:20:32

Emily

Okay, great

168

0:20:33

Emily

sounds good. And then would there be other things that you would expect to be able to do from from from this screen regarding this debt.

169

0:20:46

P5

no, I understand how the Va. Doesn't take credit cards, but it'd be kind of cool if you could

170

0:20:51

P5

pay with a credit card to resolve the debt.

171

0:20:54

Emily

Okay. Good.

172

0:20:55

P5

Like there's a payment thing.

173

0:20:58

Emily

Okay.

174

0:21:00

Emily

so yeah, so since you you would like some sort of payment ability, for a credit card, so, if this were built in real life? Especially since you specifically mentioned that you would like some sort of way to pay by credit card. How likely would you? How likely would you? Use it? Do you believe.

175

0:21:23

P5

Like, if I had a debt of something significant like, I mean again, this $[redacted] just skips my mind with the busyness of life, but it was $830. You know, I'm tracking it every couple of days. So yeah.

176

0:21:38

P5

at least a couple of times a week.

177

0:21:41

Emily

Okay, got it.

178

0:21:42

P5

Getting under 100 bucks is insignificant.

179

0:21:44

P5

Okay?

180

0:21:45

P5

Again, I I know, like with the 9 11 bill, like they count it down to the days of payments. So it's not really a dispute like it's not an insurance issue of yeah, this this Karen community provider didn't bill right like that. I would be hawking, but I know, like they they calculate the benefits. Post 9 11 Gi. Bill to the actual day, so I take them as very accurate, so.

181

0:22:10

Emily

Okay, got it

182

0:22:12

Emily

if you're so if if again, if this is is built in real life, what would be your

183

0:22:20

Emily

but yeah, let's head back to figma.

184

0:22:25

P5

Go ahead!

185

0:22:26

Emily

Yeah, if you so if this were built in life, how would you expect to make a payment? Or I guess, what? What would you do in in order to make a payment from this debt?

186

0:22:39

P5

Well, I think it'd be cool if you have like a little bar like, why might I have this debt, resolve this debt, or pay this debt, and then you can click. And then, if you have Va disability of significance, you know, maybe they give an option of they can pay it out over 6 months or you know. Pay now with a credit card. Those kind of things would make it easier.

187

0:22:59

Emily

Okay, how about if if there there were not those options? That that you just suggested what what do you think your next step would be in order to to pay it.

188

0:23:10

P5

I mean the letter I would assume. You know there'd be a little blurb on the letter about how to resolve, or where you can mail the check, and

189

0:23:18

P5

you know, be nice in the letter they sent a self addressed, stamped envelope, or, you know, like the business reply, Mail thing.

190

0:23:27

P5

yeah, that's all.

191

0:23:29

Emily

Okay. Got it. Alright. Let me have you tap on the the payments button at the bottom right again.

192

0:23:38

P5

Okay.

193

0:23:39

Emily

Yeah, there we go, and then scroll down to the bottom and you tap into that blank gray area again for yeah, perfect, all right and then go back to overpayment debts.

194

0:23:52

Emily

Okay, so now we're going to get to the payments in just a moment. But 1st we're going to pretend that you don't believe you are going to have the finances to make a payment soon. We'll go with this top that same debt. Talk to me about what you would do in that situation. If you're if you're pretty sure you're not going to have the money soon to to make a payment.

195

0:24:22

P5

Well, I would just look at the letter and get the phone number.

196

0:24:25

Emily

Okay.

197

0:24:26

P5

But they should maybe have a little tab kind of like resolve the debt

198

0:24:30

P5

like a resources tab.

199

0:24:33

P5

You know that would be kind of cool. Where then? It has a number, or you know.

200

0:24:40

P5

I don't know.

201

0:24:41

Emily

Okay? Well, you can. You can start start to to tap through here and just walk me through what what you think you would do in this situation.

202

0:24:48

P5

Well, resolve the debt. Maybe for other users. They could be available resources. But yeah, click, resolve the debt, pay online other ways to pay. Well, yeah, just request help. That'll work.

203

0:25:01

Emily

Okay. Great.

204

0:25:02

P5

Keep this up requests, yeah.

205

0:25:08

Emily

Okay? And then thoughts on on on those options that came up when you tapped the request, help outgo. Yeah, which should go back.

206

0:25:17

P5

Yeah, I think it looks really good. I mean.

207

0:25:20

P5

it's simple. You have pay online other ways.

208

0:25:23

P5

What's the other ways pay by phone pay by mail. Okay?

209

0:25:27

P5

Request how maybe there will be a 4th button and then put dispute that on the bottom.

210

0:25:33

P5

because someone might not realize request, help is dispute the debt right.

211

0:25:37

Emily

Got it. Okay.

212

0:25:38

P5

Yeah, start your yeah. So just move that out. And then we have a 4th little blurb above, close between, request, help, and close of dispute that make sense.

213

0:25:49

Emily

Okay? So let's let's pretend that. Specifically, you are. You are looking to to get help because you're not. You're not sure you're gonna have the money. Yeah, walk me through what? Exactly you would do after you. You tapped that request. Help.

214

0:26:05

P5

Request a payment plan.

215

0:26:07

Emily

Okay.

216

0:26:08

P5

And that's call us. I mean, that's all you could do. Right. Mail call request. Yeah. So just to have something with the payment plan.

217

0:26:18

P5

Maybe have a link for financial counseling

218

0:26:22

Emily

Okay. Spanish counseling.

219

0:26:26

Emily

yeah. And then and then the second question, I know you. You touched upon it. But if you are quite sure that one of that. Let's say this particular debt. You don't know it is an error. What would you do in that case?

220

0:26:43

P5

Request help. So

221

0:26:45

P5

I would just expect to have like a phone number or somewhere, you can mail correspondence.

222

0:26:53

P5

Yeah, I mean, basically, it's walking you through how to dispute it. I mean.

223

0:26:57

Emily

Okay.

224

0:26:59

Emily

got it? Any other? basic info. Obviously, there's a lot of information here. But any other information you think you would want to have particularly if you are looking to, let's say, dispute a debt or looking for other help.

225

0:27:12

P5

No, this is very, you know. Here's what you need. That's smart.

226

0:27:24

P5

talks about the process time burden. So you kind of know it's gonna take an hour.

227

0:27:30

P5

Oh, yeah, I like this a lot.

228

0:27:32

Emily

Okay, great. And were you I think you are. But I want to confirm have you always been aware of these options like to request, help, or extend the payment or debt. You or you have not been.

229

0:27:45

P5

No, no.

230

0:27:48

Emily

Got it? Any other ways that you think that could be any any any more clear, so that people know that those are options.

231

0:27:56

P5

No, I can't think of anything.

232

0:27:58

Emily

Okay, great, and then walk me through how you would. So this is a different version here. But yeah, walk me through steps you would take for paying, and I promise it won't have you enter any actual information.

233

0:28:14

P5

Yeah. Yeah.

234

0:28:18

P5

I would just have, like a again, a paid resolve debt.

235

0:28:22

P5

So pay online.

236

0:28:28

P5

that takes me to the website. I mean, it'd be kind of cool if I didn't have to go to paid up like if that was incorporated here, and I could just

237

0:28:35

P5

there was like a little kind of

238

0:28:38

P5

enter your credit card number kind of thing, or.

239

0:28:41

Emily

Okay, so pay directly here. Got it. So knowing that there there is not if yeah, if you can continue that that pay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, continue that. And we're just gonna

240

0:28:54

Emily

look at the at this one again. I won't have you enter anything in

241

0:29:00

Emily

So yeah, so this is what the information comes to. Yeah, there we go, the next one. So let me have you look at the the bottom section there kind of below the the blue bars. Yeah. As to what information, and let me know your thoughts on where you.

242

0:29:20

P5

Yeah.

243

0:29:20

Emily

Information, okay, go ahead.

244

0:29:22

P5

I would just have something like, if you can do like, yeah, maybe

245

0:29:32

P5

set a file number like you put your social in

246

0:29:36

P5

or put file number slash social security number. So you can pick payee number. That's confusing

247

0:29:44

P5

person entitled May. I guess that's your name?

248

0:29:47

P5

Deduction code.

249

0:29:49

P5

Okay, that's easy. But here the problem is, you got all these dang codes too.

250

0:29:55

P5

Like, I use chapter 31, and it's hard. I always mix it up with chapter 35. And there's chapter 33.

251

0:30:01

P5

So maybe there's less options.

252

0:30:04

P5

So it's kind of like if you go into the Va app and you want to message your doctor. They have so so much like you can. A chaplain, you know.

253

0:30:15

P5

You know. LGBT, you know.

254

0:30:19

P5

caseworkers, you have all these doctors, and you have somebody like in my region that's like [redacted], like it's kind of confusing. So I hear how you have like

255

0:30:31

P5

30 or 40 things like it's almost too much like a deduction code. Maybe. Just give me the codes of things that are applicable. The the debts I have.

256

0:30:40

Emily

Okay, got it?

257

0:30:42

P5

Yeah.

258

0:30:42

Emily

And and where? So, knowing that this is confusing and thoughts on how you would actually find all the information that you do have to enter. If you were actually making a payment in real life here.

259

0:30:57

P5

I just I mean, yeah, deduction. There's too many deduction codes. Just keep it simple. And then

260

0:31:02

P5

person entitled, I would get rid of that because you don't.

261

0:31:06

Emily

So knowing. So this, this page is actually not, we're not changing this. So knowing that this won't change thoughts on where you would actually find the information that is required.

262

0:31:18

P5

Well, it just be hopefully back at the letter that you can download, and

263

0:31:23

P5

it'll have the file. You know all that information.

264

0:31:26

Emily

Okay. So if you if you had gotten to this page, what what would you be doing if you were actually trying to make a payment.

265

0:31:37

P5

Putting in the payment amount my name, daytime phone.

266

0:31:43

P5

I have to find a deduction code. Obviously.

267

0:31:48

Emily

And then where? Yeah, where? Where would you be going to? To find that information that that that you have to enter.

268

0:31:56

P5

I guess the letter is is where I would try to find it.

269

0:31:59

Emily

Okay, got it. So you would, you would open up that letter.

270

0:32:02

P5

Yep.

271

0:32:02

Emily

Okay, and then let me have you switch back to the figma app.

272

0:32:11

P5

Yeah.

273

0:32:12

Emily

Yep, and then tap on. Go back

274

0:32:16

Emily

so thoughts on. Oh, sorry. Go so tap on overpayment debts again.

275

0:32:22

P5

And then go to yeah, do the the resolve debt again. We're just gonna go back to the other page. We were just at.

276

0:32:31

Emily

Oh, sorry. Yeah. So so tap on overpayments right here and then tap on. Yeah, there we go, and then tap on pay online, we're just gonna go back to where we were. Yeah, so thoughts on, the information here, knowing that you were needing to enter stuff on the pay site.

277

0:32:52

P5

No, I guess I could jot this stuff down.

278

0:32:54

Emily

Okay.

279

0:32:56

P5

But that'd be kind of cool if you can do like a copy and paste. But I get it, you know.

280

0:33:00

Emily

Okay, so you'd want to copy paste from here. Okay, and thoughts on the clarity of providing this information. Now, now that we see that it, it does have to be entered into the other application, or sorry the other site.

281

0:33:18

P5

It's very clear I get. I understand it now.

282

0:33:22

Emily

Okay, are there since you said you, you understand it now, are there other ways that could make it more clear.

283

0:33:29

P5

Not really without getting into like click on this video. And then, you know.

284

0:33:33

Emily

Just take.

285

0:33:34

P5

Longer, so I'm 1 of those less is more. But this is, you know, pretty simple. And

286

0:33:42

P5

now that I digested it.

287

0:33:44

Emily

Okay, got it? How about thoughts? On having to switch applications like in this case from figma to a browser. To get the information.

288

0:33:56

P5

Yeah, it would be easier just to stay in the app. But if you can't do it, you can't do it right. But.

289

0:34:01

Emily

Yeah.

290

0:34:01

P5

I think anything. The Va. Again, the Va app is perfect. The website is this, it's this convoluted. It's not as easy to digest like

291

0:34:10

P5

like you can go to a lot of websites like, I'm not saying like Espn. As an example, like their desktop site is the same as their app site. It's like all it is is a shortcut. But the Va. I use the it's almost like the cliff notes, is the app, and that's all I want cliff notes. It's the websites, usually too convoluted compared

292

0:34:31

P5

to that.

293

0:34:31

P5

Yeah, that's how I do it.

294

0:34:34

Emily

Yeah, got it. Okay? And then, so if this experience that we've just gone through was built in real life, how likely would it would. Would you use it? Do you believe.

295

0:34:47

P5

The app, I all day long.

296

0:34:49

Emily

Well, well, specifically, for like this, this debt in in regards to there is the the link to pay.

297

0:34:59

P5

I would definitely use it, because this is easier than you know

298

0:35:04

P5

mailing it in like. Here's the address.

299

0:35:07

P5

Mail it in. Yeah.

300

0:35:08

Emily

Okay, got it? And then how about.

301

0:35:11

P5

Awesome.

302

0:35:12

Emily

I missed that.

303

0:35:14

P5

Yeah, like here, like we, we, my wife and I, we rarely write checks. So I would have to find the checkbook.

304

0:35:19

P5

You know, you gotta pay for checks like it's just easier. Keep it simple.

305

0:35:23

Emily

Okay, got it? And then how about comparing this experience here? When I say that, I mean specifically, like paying on a different website coming and coming back to the app versus the other version with the app, where there was no link to pay thoughts on, which is which you would prefer.

306

0:35:45

P5

Oh, definitely with the link.

307

0:35:47

Emily

Okay?

308

0:35:48

P5

I want to take it from A to Z, like I know about my debt. Understand why it's there. How do we resolve it?

309

0:35:54

Emily

Got it? Okay? And then, after you have made a payment, what do you expect to see? And how quickly do you expect to see

310

0:36:04

Emily

Whatever's going next.

311

0:36:06

P5

Just, you know. Maybe there's a note like it takes 24 h to reflect, or 72 h. That's fine. If it takes up to a week. I want to want it to be longer.

312

0:36:14

P5

But and then again to get a notification or not. Yeah, a notification that says, Hey, the debt is resolved.

313

0:36:24

Emily

Okay.

314

0:36:25

P5

Have some kind of receipt emailed to you, and then mailed to you as well that they.

315

0:36:28

Emily

Okay, okay, got it.

316

0:36:31

Emily

So so so some sort of notification of how long it'll be until you get that. And then also the emails and notifications.

317

0:36:38

P5

Yes, ma'am.

318

0:36:39

Emily

Okay, got it? Alright. Any other thoughts on how any of these sections have been labeled? If you want to go back to the the the payments. Page, looking around.

319

0:36:52

P5

I know.

320

0:36:52

Emily

Anything else that could be more clear.

321

0:36:55

P5

No, I like the little hazard triangle green chart, but this is pretty good.

322

0:37:02

Emily

Okay, got it. And I'm gonna have you look at the co-pays now, I I know you said you haven't had any copays. So we're just gonna pretend. But yeah, so looking at this copay page, how clear is it? How much you owe overall from looking at this.

323

0:37:22

P5

Very easy current balance, you know. Kind of gives me the triangle. So I got something coming up.

324

0:37:28

P5

This next 1, 200 sounds like it's kind of complicated, which is why contact

325

0:37:34

P5

and then it shows one that's kind of paid off. And it'll be nice that you know this, this South Hillsboro one gets removed. We have current back 0, like I don't.

326

0:37:46

P5

But maybe maybe they keep it there for a couple of weeks to make it so. People know.

327

0:37:50

Emily

Oh, okay, and.

328

0:37:51

P5

Do I owe anything on this? So maybe it pays for 30 days and then gets removed.

329

0:37:58

Emily

Oh, God! And would there be a place? Okay? So you'd want to leave it on there for maybe 30 days or so. There be any place that you would want to see, any copays that have already been paid off.

330

0:38:10

P5

No, I don't cause. Then you're just adding more to it. It takes up more speed and time, so no.

331

0:38:16

Emily

Okay, got it?

332

0:38:19

Emily

Okay? And then thoughts on how? If, in case it is different, like how quickly you would want to see something here when you do have a new pay, let's say you just had an appointment, and you then go to the app. How quickly would you expect to see information here about what you owe for that Copay.

333

0:38:37

P5

Like 72 h would be nice.

334

0:38:39

Emily

Okay, got it alright.

335

0:38:42

Emily

And then we'll just look at this top one, the James A. Haley Veterans hospital. What information would be helpful for you.

336

0:38:52

Emily

Yeah, what would you be looking for.

337

0:38:55

P5

Current statement, Provider medic. No, this is pretty pretty good.

338

0:39:04

P5

So it's just like a checking ledger. It has chronological.

339

0:39:09

P5

Yeah.

340

0:39:10

Emily

Okay, got it.

341

0:39:11

Emily

and then and then tell me again, with that top one how clear is it about when when the payment is due for it.

342

0:39:23

P5

Very clear payment or request help by July 30.th Very simple.

343

0:39:28

Emily

Okay, good.

344

0:39:30

Emily

Alright. And then if you are again, a similar scenario that, we are making up with the other one of you don't believe you're gonna have the money to to pay this?

345

0:39:42

Emily

Where would you expect to find, or what? What would be your your next step if you.

346

0:39:48

P5

Kinda to click the pay bill and to have something kind of request, help, or

347

0:39:54

P5

payment, assistance, or something under pay in person.

348

0:39:58

Emily

Okay, got it?

349

0:40:00

Emily

Yeah. Any any other place you might look for? For for guidance on what to do next.

350

0:40:07

P5

No.

351

0:40:08

Emily

Okay, got it and

352

0:40:13

Emily

and let me have you? So since we looked at at payment with the other one, let me have you walk me through, how you would pay this bill here.

353

0:40:24

P5

Click, pay bill.

354

0:40:26

P5

pay by phone, silly pay by mail pay in person. Be nice to have a pay online, you know.

355

0:40:35

P5

Click, pay online and then have a place where I put my social in my name.

356

0:40:41

P5

select credit card and then put like like, normal pay with credit card online stuff.

357

0:40:48

Emily

Okay with with the options that were there, what? What do you think you would? You would do.

358

0:40:55

P5

Definitely not paying person.

359

0:40:58

P5

I would try to do the pay by phone doing. I could call and give them a credit card number would be kind of easier

360

0:41:05

P5

pay by mail. Okay? Then I gotta get into a stamp situation or or pay on pay.gov. That's what I would do.

361

0:41:13

Emily

Okay, got it?

362

0:41:14

P5

Yeah.

363

0:41:14

Emily

Yeah, so you can, you can go ahead.

364

0:41:16

Emily

And okay, what? What do you think would make it more more clear, since since since you said that, you.

365

0:41:21

P5

Say, pay, just say, pay online.

366

0:41:23

Emily

Okay, got it?

367

0:41:25

P5

Or pay by credit, card.

368

0:41:27

P5

Cool. That'd be.

369

0:41:30

Emily

Okay, and actually, I forgot. Let me have you close this. I'm gonna have you go into the review details first? st

370

0:41:38

Emily

Oh, sorry of that of that top, go pay.

371

0:41:41

Emily

yep, and then again, I'm, gonna have you attempt attempt to pay it and just see what

372

0:41:49

Emily

experiences

373

0:41:51

P5

They,

374

0:42:00

P5

okay.

375

0:42:01

Emily

To continue to the form, yeah.

376

0:42:03

Emily

just wanna get to this one.

377

0:42:07

Emily

Okay, there we go.

378

0:42:08

P5

All my information like this is confusing. Part 1, 2, 3, 4.

379

0:42:13

Emily

Okay.

380

0:42:14

P5

Payers full name, email, address, payment amount.

381

0:42:18

P5

It'd be nice to have it all right here where you can just veteran's name.

382

0:42:23

P5

I don't.

383

0:42:25

P5

Something. I don't need 5 parts. Just give me one.

384

0:42:29

Emily

Okay.

385

0:42:29

P5

So get rid of that.

386

0:42:31

Emily

Okay, where? Where would you expect to find as you said, the the 5 parts of that of that account number up there.

387

0:42:39

P5

Well on the letter. Yeah.

388

0:42:41

Emily

Okay.

389

0:42:42

P5

But yeah, to go back to it. They have something where I just put it's kind of like, if if I'm buying something online, I can literally to have it all on one page is great. If I have a thing on the bottom credit card information

390

0:42:55

P5

for debit, credit, debit, card information.

391

0:43:00

Emily

Okay, what would make it? As I said you would, you would look to the letter for that information. How about anything within within the app that might make it easier.

392

0:43:11

P5

No, if I can get off the letter, that'd be fine.

393

0:43:14

Emily

Okay, got it? Let me have you switch back to figma. We'll pretend you're we're going back to the Va. App.

394

0:43:27

P5

Okay.

395

0:43:32

P5

I'm in Figma.

396

0:43:34

Emily

Oh, where this is? Zoom. Yeah, there we go. Okay.

397

0:43:39

Emily

Let me say that. Wait for that to see where this ends up 2, 2.

398

0:43:49

Emily

Okay, tap on payments. We're just gonna get you back to where we were.

399

0:43:54

Emily

So tap on payments on the the lower right?

400

0:43:58

Emily

Okay, and then scroll to the bottom and tap in the the blank gray area

401

0:44:04

Emily

great, and then tap on Copays

402

0:44:10

Emily

alright and go back into review details of that top copay.

403

0:44:20

Emily

Okay? So yeah. Thoughts on pretending that that we've we've switched back and forth from the the browser of the payment. And then coming here? What? What information would you be looking for here, or might you be looking for.

404

0:44:38

P5

It's got everything I need. The ledger pay bill option current statement.

405

0:44:47

P5

Be cool. There's a go to current statement. But there's a tab for click here for previous statements.

406

0:44:54

P5

So above statement charges, but below the Pdf

407

0:44:58

P5

go to current statement something previous statement. So if you are confused and that would be helpful, but.

408

0:45:06

Emily

Oh, okay, so you'd want you'd want to see previous statements up here.

409

0:45:09

P5

Yeah, that'd be nice.

410

0:45:11

Emily

Okay, got it? And how about specifically for paying? Since we are looking@pay.gov earlier.

411

0:45:21

P5

You know, above Pdf statements, but below the June 1st Ledger

412

0:45:26

P5

pay bill online would be nice.

413

0:45:29

Emily

Okay, different from where you'd found it before.

414

0:45:34

P5

Correct.

415

0:45:35

Emily

Okay.

416

0:45:37

Emily

Do you know why you would? You would prefer to have it next to Pdf. Statements as as opposed to up top.

417

0:45:48

P5

oh, it's right here. Pay Bill. I some reason I forgot that. No, that I I believe my last. Just take that out pay bills perfect.

418

0:45:55

Emily

Okay, pay Bill got it? And how about to the the information that that you were having to fill in

419

0:46:02

Emily

on the pay.gov.

420

0:46:07

P5

Yeah, just outside of having, like the 5 account number thing or ledger. Everything else is perfect. Just a simple page where I can put my name, my address, maybe my social, and then the amount I want to pay.

421

0:46:19

Emily

Okay. Do you think thoughts on the copying? This account number here.

422

0:46:27

P5

Copy that'd be perfect. I what I would do is just jot it down on a sticky pad, but.

423

0:46:32

Emily

Okay, would you use the the copy action that's here toward the top.

424

0:46:38

P5

I didn't know there wasn't. Oh, I see it! Oh, absolutely! I would.

425

0:46:41

Emily

Okay, thoughts on how to make that more clear.

426

0:46:47

P5

Maybe instead of blue. Make it green.

427

0:46:49

Emily

Okay.

428

0:46:52

P5

Or put copy and paste, or something, because most people

429

0:46:55

P5

I don't know you might mix copay with copy, and your eyes just play that trick on you. Oh, it's missing! Copay.

430

0:47:02

Emily

Okay, so copy could be misread as Cope. I haven't thought about that. Right? Okay.

431

0:47:07

Emily

all right, and go ahead and just tap that I forget. There we go. Okay, yeah. So copy there.

432

0:47:14

Emily

If that if had, had you seen that would, do you think that would be helpful in order to.

433

0:47:20

P5

Barry.

434

0:47:20

Emily

And pay. Yeah, okay, okay, great.

435

0:47:25

Emily

All right. And since you had mentioned the statements, how are are you? Are you currently using any any statements for really any other any anything else in your life?

436

0:47:39

P5

No.

437

0:47:40

Emily

You're not okay, got it.

438

0:47:42

Emily

and let me have you tap on the the current statement here. Since you mentioned that.

439

0:47:52

P5

Perfect.

440

0:47:53

Emily

Okay.

441

0:47:59

Emily

thoughts on, using this this statement within the app.

442

0:48:07

P5

I would use it because I wouldn't want to check out, especially when you start getting into hundreds of dollars. Like.

443

0:48:12

P5

yeah, definitely need the easy access to statements.

444

0:48:15

Emily

Okay, got it

445

0:48:17

Emily

and thoughts on. Would there be anything else you would you would do with them outside of of looking just to to double check all the charges.

446

0:48:27

P5

No, I would just. I would want to just cross reference.

447

0:48:30

Emily

Okay, so he's looking at there. Okay? And then for older ones. Since you mentioned that. What instances would you be looking for older statements?

448

0:48:40

P5

Well, just to double check my math, or to, you know, figure out why that was created. So if you have go to previous statements.

449

0:48:47

P5

Parentheses, Pdf. Would be nice underneath.

450

0:48:50

Emily

Okay, got it. I see. I see. Okay.

451

0:48:54

Emily

And I believe those are all my questions. Natasha, if you have anything just speaking to my other colleague here. If you have anything you wanted to ask, feel free to unmute and ask here.

452

0:49:11

Emily

okay, anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances with Va, or specifically with the app.

453

0:49:21

P5

No, I mean just some more stuff you can put in the app without leaving. The site is easy a lot of times to leave the site. You gotta re log in credentials, and like just to have a face. Id is unbelievable, you know, when I go to my bank account like my chase, app like it, my members, my face id. I don't ever have to use a password like.

454

0:49:41

Emily

Oh, yeah. Okay.

455

0:49:41

P5

For like simplicity. So that's it for me.

456

0:49:46

Emily

Got it great, all right. Well, those are those are all my questions so happy that you were able to to share things with us, always always helpful to speak with veterans of it, helping to to improve things. So hopefully, we'll have some some new improvements soon. And yeah, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

457

0:50:11

P5

I hope you have a great weekend, is it? Do you send a is it like a

458

0:50:18

P5

like a gift card link? Or is it via check? I was.

459

0:50:21

Emily

Paragene is going to be reaching out directly to you. I actually don't know the details, but they will be be in touch soon about that.

460

0:50:29

P5

No, I was just curious, but no anything. Yeah, just as simple as possible is what people want, and at least me and then the anything that keeps you from having to log into a government website. But using a government app with the face Id is is a million bucks. In my opinion.

461

0:50:46

Emily

Got it makes sense alright. Well, thank you so much. Hope you have a great weekend.

462

0:50:51

P5

You as well. Thank you, ladies.

463

0:50:53

Emily

Bye.

5

0:00:25

P6

Yes!

6

0:00:28

Emily

Great. Thank you. So first, st I'd love diving into the conversation. I'd love to know a bit about you as a veteran, at whatever level. You are comfortable. Sharing, of course, could be a branch you served in when you retired or separated.

7

0:00:47

P6

I am a [redacted]. I served 10 years. I left the [redacted] as a [redacted]

8

0:01:01

P6

I separated in 2011 October of 2011

9

0:01:12

P6

And I settled here in [redacted]. I was actually a recruiter here [redacted] for 4 years.

10

0:01:20

P6

And then I separate it from

11

0:01:22

P6

[redacted] as a recruiter. And just stay here in [redacted].

12

0:01:28

Emily

Alright got it? And how about any experience you've had with the Va. What sort of experiences? And have you had.

13

0:01:38

P6

I've had pretty decent experience with the Va.

14

0:01:45

P6

I go to the Va for my my healthcare more recently.

15

0:01:54

P6

Also, I've used I've actually coming out of homelessness myself.

16

0:02:01

P6

So I've also used the different programs for like the veterans housing voucher.

17

0:02:13

Emily

Okay.

18

0:02:13

P6

Choice voucher and

19

0:02:16

P6

and like the case managers and different things like that to help me get back.

20

0:02:22

Emily

Oh, great!

21

0:02:23

P6

To where I was before.

22

0:02:25

Emily

Okay, amazing

23

0:02:28

Emily

and can you tell me what sort of experience you've had with the Va website and or their mobile app.

24

0:02:45

P6

I'm sorry over there, and.

25

0:02:49

Emily

I'm curious to know what sort of experience you've had with the Va website or the mobile app.

26

0:03:02

P6

The the mobile apps and website are, pretty good. The website more so is

27

0:03:12

P6

pretty decent. I've used it for

28

0:03:15

P6

use it for various things like using for like.

29

0:03:21

P6

when I was using my GI Bill for school. I've used it for, of course, like my healthcare

30

0:03:30

P6

communicating with like providers and things like that, ordering prescriptions

31

0:03:37

P6

different things like that same thing with the app

32

0:03:41

P6

as far as the app goes, I think it could be

33

0:03:46

P6

it could use a little bit more. I guess it is.

34

0:03:53

P6

It could stand to grow more

35

0:03:57

P6

have more features added, and things like that.

36

0:04:01

P6

But to make it boring usable and

37

0:04:07

P6

be so, I'll be able to do the same thing. You know, on the go, as I would be able to do on. So the website is pretty good. The mobile app. It's decent enough. But pretty better.

38

0:04:23

Emily

Okay, got it? What? What specific actions do you tend to make on the app as opposed to the website?

39

0:04:32

Emily

Yeah.

40

0:04:35

P6

I'm sorry. What was that?

41

0:04:37

Emily

Oh, what what action? Or when would you choose to use the app over using the website?

42

0:04:45

P6

I mostly use the app for when I'm setting trying to set an appointment with the provider, or just like refilling my prescriptions.

43

0:04:57

P6

or seeing any messages messages I may have from one of the the providers.

44

0:05:07

P6

That's about it.

45

0:05:09

Emily

Okay? And for those, can you tell me why you like using the app better as opposed to the website?

46

0:05:17

P6

Just because it's quicker, is it's quicker to and easier to navigate. I can just get in the app, and you know you is, you know, right there quickly available to get to.

47

0:05:32

Emily

Any, and you said that there the the app could could use some improvement. What? What sorts of things are you thinking that you would prefer to have in the app that just aren't there yet.

48

0:05:47

P6

I would I would say things like

49

0:05:51

P6

like, if I like. Add add things such as the

50

0:05:57

P6

You know the education piece like, you know, using your Gi bill, or you know the stuff that you have to go through for using that

51

0:06:08

P6

also.

52

0:06:12

P6

For things like, if you want to. You know, submit

53

0:06:18

P6

your disability, disability claims and things like that, you can

54

0:06:23

P6

be able to use it doing that versus having to go online added benefit.

55

0:06:32

P6

Things like if you wanted to get updates on. You know, the status of your disability claims something like that.

56

0:06:43

P6

I think various things like that just more added to it than just the medical portion.

57

0:06:48

Emily

Okay. So more than just medical. Okay, got it. Excuse me.

58

0:06:53

Emily

Okay. So now we're going to move into talking about the financial portion of the discussion, and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have 0 information about you or your finances. So up until now this is all anonymous here 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for any benefit overpayment?

59

0:07:24

Emily

We just lost him.

60

0:07:31

Emily

Shannon. I'll just wait a moment to see I know the reception seemed to be not the greatest on his end, so

61

0:07:40

Emily

maybe he's having a little trouble.

62

0:08:13

Emily

There we go it coming in now.

63

0:08:27

Emily

No, dropped again just after, I admitted. Let's see if he comes back.

64

0:08:34

Emily

There we go. Okay, here we go.

65

0:08:48

Emily

You able to hear me again.

66

0:08:50

Emily

You're on mute.

67

0:08:50

Emily

Oh, there you go! Yeah.

68

0:08:54

P6

Sorry. I'm not sure what happened.

69

0:08:56

Emily

Okay, I just figured it was some kind of connection drop, you know, that happens with technology. Sometimes like, we'll just wait. And hopefully, you're able to join again. So happy you are back.

70

0:09:07

Emily

So the I'll just repeat the question, because I don't know when exactly you dropped. Yeah, curious to know if you have had experience with owing the Va. Money for any overpay or benefit overpayment.

71

0:09:23

P6

Yes, I do. Did do

72

0:09:27

P6

I had an overpayment with my gi bill

73

0:09:36

P6

for some courses I took. I think I ended up drop dropping my course early.

74

0:09:45

P6

And I ended up owing the Va. For

75

0:09:50

P6

for that that portion that I dropped.

76

0:09:53

Emily

Yeah, got it? Okay?

77

0:09:54

Emily

And do you recall, how you were notified of this originally.

78

0:10:03

P6

I think I may have received a letter in the mail.

79

0:10:07

Emily

Okay.

80

0:10:10

P6

Yeah, I think it was a letter in the mail.

81

0:10:13

Emily

Okay? And eventually oh, lost him. Again.

82

0:10:33

Emily

go is back.

83

0:10:41

Emily

Hello.

84

0:10:49

Emily

are you able? To hear? Me, now.

85

0:11:05

Emily

86

0:11:11

Emily

87

0:11:19

P6

Oh yes!

88

0:11:20

Emily

Oh, I can, all right. I can hear you now.

89

0:11:24

P6

90

0:11:25

Emily

91

0:11:54

Emily

Here we go. Is returned.

92

0:12:02

P6

No, okay. So what? It was right now.

93

0:12:05

Emily

Sounds like you're back.

94

0:12:09

P6

Yeah.

95

0:12:13

P6

Okay.

96

0:12:15

P6

Alright.

97

0:12:16

Emily

You, you're able to hear me. Excuse me, are you able to hear me?

98

0:12:20

P6

Yes.

99

0:12:20

Emily

Okay. Great great

100

0:12:24

Emily

Where did I leave off there? Oh, okay. So you were explaining the overpayment debt, and you had received a letter. Do you recall? What are, how you're notified of exactly how you needed to to pay off or or resolve the debt.

101

0:12:47

P6

It was explained in a letter.

102

0:12:51

P6

How we either I could repay the deck. Let me just flat out, I think also.

103

0:13:01

P6

it may have been like a some type of payment option.

104

0:13:05

P6

Okay.

105

0:13:07

P6

payment plan option. And I think there was an also option to dispute the to dispute the debt.

106

0:13:15

Emily

Hmm, okay.

107

0:13:17

P6

Something.

108

0:13:18

Emily

Okay, got it? And oh, excuse me

109

0:13:23

Emily

Do you recall? Were were you? Were you making payments on this, or were you resolving it other ways.

110

0:13:34

P6

Well, at the time I just I didn't have the funds to

111

0:13:40

P6

hated it so kind of just let it

112

0:13:46

P6

be what it was. Just because I I had so much going on at the time. That that was kind of like my concern.

113

0:13:55

Emily

Hmm, okay. Got it?

114

0:13:58

Emily

Okay, was there. Overall. How was the the communication from? Va in terms of

115

0:14:07

Emily

yeah. How? How how? How well did they communicate everything?

116

0:14:14

P6

As far as like

117

0:14:18

P6

the the letter, I mean, and how I resolved it, and everything. That was pretty clear and laid out. I also saw the same thing

118

0:14:29

P6

eventually, later down down the line on on the website.

119

0:14:35

P6

I'm not sure is I kind of ran into it by accident when I was just kind of like going through the website. And it explains it the same, pretty much the same type of way.

120

0:14:46

P6

So I mean, it's pretty clear to explain the debt, and you know how to resolve it, and things like that.

121

0:14:55

Emily

Okay. Great and was there anything that could have been made easier with the whole? With with everything, with with the communication, any sort of options.

122

0:15:10

P6

I would say.

123

0:15:15

P6

I don't know, I guess. Probably like before you know.

124

0:15:19

P6

a debt like that happens, you know.

125

0:15:22

P6

there being like some form of

126

0:15:25

P6

explanation or some type of you know something that would tell me like, you know, if you drop a class at this point in time. Then this is what you may owe something something like that.

127

0:15:38

Emily

Yeah.

128

0:15:40

Emily

okay. And then thoughts on how you want to, how you might want to receive, like a communication like that of of letting you know that if you do this step it may lead to deaths.

129

0:15:56

P6

Preferably electronic, like, I think

130

0:16:00

P6

most communication nowadays is electronic versus paper. A lot of times I get paper mail, and it just ends up being junk mail or something like that. So

131

0:16:14

P6

I'll usually.

132

0:16:16

P6

I usually check my emails and things like that before I would, you know, go through paper mail, because usually paper mail ends up just being

133

0:16:24

P6

junk mail and I try to, you know. Make sure. I select

134

0:16:30

P6

electronic options on everything I do, so I can keep up with things. But

135

0:16:38

P6

Sometimes that's not always an option.

136

0:16:40

Emily

Okay, yeah. Got it.

137

0:16:42

Emily

And have you also had any experience with medical copayment through? Va.

138

0:16:51

P6

Yes, that. More recently.

139

0:16:56

P6

Because before I wasn't using the Va because I wasn't aware that, you know, I was able to use the Va

140

0:17:06

P6

so I was. I had my own insurance prior to that through my employer.

141

0:17:15

P6

And I'm so I'm sorry I lost track of what I was saying.

142

0:17:20

Emily

Oh, I I there's just a general what experience you've had with medical co-payments, which sounds like you. Just you just answered, so yeah. And so,

143

0:17:31

Emily

oh, yeah, go ahead.

144

0:17:33

P6

Oh, yeah. So now then, I real. And then I started receiving mail paper mail saying that I had to pay a co-pay. And I'm like, Okay, well, I wasn't aware of that. And you know, at the time I didn't have

145

0:17:51

P6

income at the time. And So

146

0:17:58

P6

then, when they said I had, I had co-pays to pay, then I had to go back. And they said, There's ways you can, basically

147

0:18:07

P6

You.

148

0:18:14

Emily

Stopped again.

149

0:19:10

Emily

I heard a little bit, but not much just now.

170

0:23:53

Emily

Shannon, any thoughts on your end. I'm wondering if it might be better to

171

0:23:59

Emily

cancel just we haven't been able to talk more than like a minute at a time.

172

0:24:04

Notetaker

Unfortunately, at this time, because of the length that they've already been on the call. They're already considered complete.

173

0:24:11

Notetaker

So if you wanna stay on and still get little pieces of information, we can.

174

0:24:17

Emily

Sure. Yeah.

175

0:24:18

Notetaker

So it's really up to you. If we want to just keep letting him get on and then get one question at a time.

176

0:24:26

Emily

Yeah.

177

0:24:26

Notetaker

That'd be good to have him not turn on his camera, because when he hasn't turned on his camera he's been on longer.

178

0:24:33

Emily

Yeah, yeah, I I think you're right there. Yeah, I I'm gonna

179

0:24:39

Emily

share my screen to have him so that he's not also sharing his screen, and hopefully, that will help things.

180

0:24:47

Notetaker

I was gonna suggest that as well.

181

0:24:50

Emily

Yes, yes, you've read my mind. If he's a okay, he's admitting, admit him back again.

182

0:24:57

Emily

Just need to log on to zoom on my phone.

183

0:25:42

Emily

Are you able to hear me yet?

184

0:25:56

Emily

If you're able to turn off your camera? That might

185

0:26:01

Emily

might help a little bit if you're able to do that.

186

0:26:06

P6

Oh, I'm sorry I missed that.

187

0:26:08

Emily

Oh, say, well, it it looks like your camera's off. But just in case it's not off. Yeah, why don't you go ahead and turn off your camera, and hopefully, that will make things a little better.

188

0:26:19

P6

I hope so.

189

0:26:20

Emily

Yeah, I know.

190

0:26:26

Emily

If you keep on a little longer I'll wait till that is off.

191

0:27:10

Emily

It looks like you're back on. I'm not seeing is your? Is your camera off now? Just wanna make sure.

192

0:27:18

P6

Yes.

193

0:27:18

Emily

Okay, great. Alright. So we'll keep that off.

194

0:27:22

Emily

And hopefully, it'll work to keep that a little longer. Hopefully, technology will will work in our favor a little bit.

195

0:27:31

Emily

so the I do want to. I don't think I heard an answer, or maybe it was when you would logged off but for the co-pay bills. How had you know, or how? How were you

196

0:27:46

Emily

told that you that you had these to pay.

197

0:27:50

P6

I received a letter in the mail.

198

0:27:55

Emily

Okay.

199

0:27:57

P6

And once I saw the letter. It kind of explained the same way

200

0:28:04

P6

as the the other deck did as far as how to go about.

201

0:28:11

P6

You know, taking care of that debt.

202

0:28:16

P6

And it also had, like an option that that if I had like financial difficulty, or something that like that

203

0:28:24

P6

that I could use that as well.

204

0:28:27

P6

Okay.

205

0:28:29

P6

In addition to that, they were going by my, like, my previous year's income, or something like that.

206

0:28:39

P6

So they didn't have like an updated like financial.

207

0:28:44

P6

I guess updated financial information.

208

0:28:48

Emily

Okay.

209

0:29:14

Emily

Alright. Looks like you're back. Let me know if you can hear me.

210

0:29:17

P6

Oh yes!

211

0:29:18

Emily

Okay? Great. Yeah. So last year that it turned out they didn't have your updated income information. And that. And that's that's when I lost you.

212

0:29:29

P6

Right? So I could submit like a new financial, new financial information or updated financial information.

213

0:29:39

P6

And then that way.

214

0:29:43

P6

I could clear the debt that way as well, because they would have updated information. So I wouldn't be

215

0:29:49

P6

required to pay the co-pay based off of my new financial information.

216

0:29:54

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay, got it? And then any thoughts on how that whole process, specifically regarding the co-pays, might have been made any easier for you.

217

0:30:12

P6

I guess.

218

0:30:14

P6

I mean it was pretty laid out, and everything. Again. It's 1 of those things you don't know until you know the situation happens that

219

0:30:24

P6

you're gonna I will copay. So I mean, if there was something ahead of time like saying.

220

0:30:31

P6

You know, when you visit. Va

221

0:30:36

P6

kind of like knowing ahead of time what to expect.

222

0:30:43

P6

actually visiting a gang hadn't been before, so there was like something

223

0:30:49

P6

some type of. I don't know

224

0:30:54

P6

something ahead of time that can to explain to you how the the process works. Once you start using the Va hospital system.

225

0:31:03

P6

That would have been helpful.

226

0:31:06

Emily

Okay, makes sense.

227

0:31:09

Emily

Okay? So I'm I'm gonna switch things around. I, originally was, gonna have you share your screen. But looking at what technology is doing? I'm actually gonna share my screen. So it's gonna be a little bit different. I'm gonna have you look at a prototype from my phone. So give me just a moment. I've been setting things up screen

228

0:31:34

Emily

oops.

229

0:31:46

Emily

Alright. So here is my screen here, and give me just a moment.

230

0:31:53

Emily

Alright! Are you able to see a pretend app on your phone? Now?

231

0:32:09

Emily

I want I wasn't able to hear. And are you? Are you? Are you able to see the the pretend app on your phone now.

232

0:32:16

P6

Yes!

233

0:32:17

Emily

Okay. Great. Okay, so I'm not. This is only gonna be you looking and and talking out loud. Since this won't be anything that you're actually using. So this is the your pretend va app here? So if you may look familiar, since I know you said you you did have the Va app

234

0:32:40

Emily

But if you were going here first, st where be? Where would you expect to find

235

0:32:50

Emily

Oh, we just lost him again

236

0:32:55

Emily

back.

237

0:33:05

Emily

Okay, are you able to hear me now?

238

0:33:07

P6

Yes.

239

0:33:08

Emily

Great. Okay? So, looking at this this pretend app, where would you expect to find information on like medical copays and overpayments if you were looking here.

240

0:33:22

P6

I would say the bottom right where it says payments.

241

0:33:27

Emily

Okay, got it?

242

0:33:29

Emily

And is there any way that that could? Obviously you went straight there? But thoughts on the title of that, it being named payment would be there be anything else that might be more clear.

243

0:33:50

P6

I mean payment works, but

244

0:33:58

P6

maybe something different if it because it's

245

0:34:02

P6

more so geared towards, you know. The I'm guessing overpayments, or something like that.

246

0:34:13

P6

So maybe I'm not sure.

247

0:34:17

Emily

Okay? Good. Alright. So since, yeah, that's fine. So I'm gonna tap into payments there since you mentioned that and so this is actually the I'll just scroll down. But this is this is the whole, the whole thing right here. And then thoughts on what you are looking at in terms of clarity on what you're seeing.

248

0:34:46

P6

Think I'm waiting for the next you.

249

0:35:17

Emily

Okay? So yeah, so thoughts on on what you're seeing. So this is me tapping into payments. Just like you expected thoughts thoughts on what you're seeing here, knowing that you've got

250

0:35:31

Emily

both copays and overpayments.

251

0:35:36

P6

Okay? Yeah. Now I see it this way. It makes

252

0:35:41

P6

more. Says that. Why, it says payments. Because it's you know payment

253

0:35:50

P6

to a person, and also anything that they may always will be payments that back to the Va or due to the Va.

254

0:36:01

P6

okay, yeah.

255

0:36:02

P6

It makes more sense. Now.

256

0:36:04

Emily

Oh, okay, got it since you said it makes more sense now. What could have made it even easier before?

257

0:37:33

Emily

Okay, you able to hear me now.

258

0:37:37

P6

Yes.

259

0:37:38

Emily

So yeah, if if there, let's know any any thoughts since you said it, it makes sense. Now that you're here, that that label of payments. If there's anything that could have made it even more clear.

260

0:37:56

P6

I don't know. Maybe a a

261

0:38:00

P6

instead of the title being payment, something like.

262

0:39:38

Emily

You. You're kind of just you're about to tell me any ideas you had for a different name for this section that is, payments.

263

0:39:49

P6

I would say. Probably I would use maybe financials or something like that. Purchase payments.

264

0:40:01

Emily

Okay.

265

0:40:05

P6

Yeah.

266

0:40:06

Emily

Yeah, no, that's great. Thank you. Okay. So now, I'm gonna

267

0:40:11

Emily

Go into the overpayments here. So I'm going to tap into overpayment debts. Here, we're gonna get to this section. So thoughts on the clarity of what you're seeing here.

268

0:40:28

Emily

Scroll down just a little bit

269

0:40:32

Emily

really on on like what information you would want to know for each of these debts, that in this pretend situation you owe.

270

0:40:51

P6

Don't see that screen yet.

271

0:40:53

Emily

Oh, okay, and I will wait.

272

0:40:58

Emily

What what are you seeing now? Is it blank or something?

273

0:41:02

P6

No, it's just. It's still in the payments screen.

274

0:41:07

P6

with payments to you and your Va. Debt and bills.

275

0:41:11

Emily

Oh, interesting! It's a little little slow to catch up, all right.

276

0:41:17

Emily

See? I'm actually gonna jump ahead.

277

0:41:20

Emily

Let me know when you so I've just switched it to a screen that says, dropped again.

278

0:41:37

Notetaker

You might want to switch back to the other screen. So when he jumps on he sees that previous screen first.st

279

0:41:43

Emily

Yeah, it's a good one.

280

0:41:45

Emily

Thank you.

281

0:42:01

Emily

Be coming back in

282

0:43:06

Emily

bidding again.

283

0:43:15

Emily

Keeps dropping after I hit, admit. Unfortunately.

284

0:43:35

Emily

Okay, let me know what are you seeing on screen right now? What page.

285

0:43:45

P6

Still loading right now.

286

0:43:47

Emily

Loading all right.

287

0:44:01

P6

No.

288

0:44:02

Emily

Is it like a little the little spinning wheel sort of thing.

289

0:44:06

P6

Yeah.

290

0:44:08

Emily

Okay, gotta love that one. I've experienced that plenty. Of course

291

0:44:14

Emily

I'll I'll just wait till it it. It show the the screen itself shows up on your end. Then I just had

292

0:44:21

Emily

couple other questions.

293

0:44:50

P6

Now, I'm sure, for the rest of the day I won't have any other problems.

294

0:44:53

Emily

I know right.

295

0:44:55

P6

Smooth.

296

0:44:56

Emily

After that, just not the 1 h really trying to right.

297

0:45:01

Emily

That's always the way I know.

298

0:45:06

Emily

So is it? Is it? Still thinking about showing you an image.

299

0:45:11

P6

Yeah.

300

0:45:12

Emily

Okay. Well, let me. I'll just ask a couple of questions while that is going. If we get to it cool. If not, that is totally fine. When so I know you said when you had received the letter for the overpayment, the benefit overpayment lost again.

301

0:46:00

Emily

Not if it'll help, but I'm gonna attempt to

302

0:46:04

Emily

stop sharing on my end. I wonder

303

0:46:11

Emily

if he gets back on? I'll try sharing again

304

0:46:15

Emily

when in doubt restart things. That's how I the only way I know how to fix things

305

0:46:27

Emily

coming in again.

306

0:46:57

Emily

All right. I stopped my screen. Share my my hope is that

307

0:47:02

Emily

maybe I'll try again. See if it works. Are you able to hear me and see my video first? st

308

0:47:08

P6

I can hear you.

309

0:47:10

Emily

Okay, but it's not showing any any video at all.

310

0:47:16

P6

No.

311

0:47:17

Emily

Okay, all right, then we'll just. We'll just skip that. I'll ask. Ask a couple more questions. So I know you said when you received the letter for the benefit overpayment? And it there were options listed.

312

0:47:32

Emily

I think you said like for general help. If you need help, repay payment plan things like that. Do you recall when you 1st started getting the bills for Copays? Was there something similar for options in case you're not able to pay, and things like that.

313

0:47:50

P6

Yes, there was

314

0:47:52

P6

It had like

315

0:47:54

P6

similar options. As far as you know, ways. I could resolve the debt. I could just pay pay the bill or make payments, or I could dispute it

316

0:48:06

P6

and then the other thing about the financial my own financial

317

0:48:14

P6

situation as far as what they were going off versus what my actual current

318

0:48:21

P6

financial situation was at the time.

319

0:48:26

Emily

And was that so? I know you said you learned that they had outdated information. Did you know that from those 1st letters about the Copay bills? Or did that come later? That discovery.

320

0:48:39

P6

Oh!

321

0:49:11

Emily

Yeah, they add, I'm not sure if when you cut out but at least I the last question I'd asked was

322

0:49:18

Emily

when when it when you discovered that they had outdated information for your income was that at this did you learn that at the same time that you were 1st receiving these Copay bills? Or did that come later?

323

0:49:32

P6

I believe that came later with me kind of like putting

324

0:49:36

P6

putting different pieces together. And then I kinda like.

325

0:49:42

P6

realize that later. That they were going by like you know what I was

326

0:49:49

P6

previously making like the previous year, or whatever

327

0:49:53

P6

so kind of like, went back and like, Hey.

328

0:49:56

P6

thinking like, Oh, this isn't right. Financial information.

329

0:50:03

P6

and then I had to go dig a little bit more to find out that you could submit a new financial

330

0:50:10

P6

I guess, like a financial report of what you're making, and then that will better reflect of. You know my current situation.

331

0:50:18

Emily

Hmm, okay. Got it

332

0:50:20

Emily

under the when you discover was that was that over over the phone. I forget how you how you made that discovery.

333

0:50:29

P6

That was through the website, kind of like.

334

0:50:35

P6

just piecing different pieces together from what I got received.

335

0:50:40

Emily

Hmm.

336

0:51:09

P6

Oh!

337

0:51:12

Emily

Yeah, yeah.

338

0:51:13

Emily

I last heard you were, you were piecing together the information with things you found on the website was that I want to make sure I got that right.

339

0:51:22

P6

Yes, so basically, like when I was when it was basically showing, telling me from the letter how I could.

340

0:51:29

P6

you know

341

0:51:32

P6

dispute the debt or something like that. Then I learned that they go off like financial information. And so then from there, I kinda like.

342

0:51:42

P6

learn that you can actually update your financial information

343

0:51:49

P6

through another part of the website.

344

0:51:52

P6

And then by updating that, I kind of figured out like, when I update this, then I can dispute it better because my information will be updated. Financial will be updated.

345

0:52:05

Emily

Okay. So so then you would, you would update it all.

346

0:52:13

P6

Yes.

347

0:52:14

Emily

Okay, got it. And is that something? So I know you said you were on the website. Is that? Oh, lost again.

348

0:52:28

Emily

I go ask the one more question I was about to ask, and then wrap up, because it's only it's about 3 of here it comes

349

0:52:48

Emily

alright.

350

0:52:50

Emily

Okay. So you said you had. You had updated things on the website. And is that so that that financial update since we talked about, you wanted to have more things in the app. Is that something you would have wanted to do in the app.

351

0:53:09

P6

That would definitely be beneficial.

352

0:53:12

Emily

Okay.

353

0:53:43

Emily

okay, so last year, did, it would be beneficial to have that app of updating your financial information. I'd love to know why, why you would you you would have preferred to do it in the app, or you would have liked to do it in the app.

354

0:53:59

P6

Just because, like

355

0:54:04

P6

hopefully, it would be tied into that, you know, payments or whatever section you want to call it that way. You kinda

356

0:54:13

P6

know, ahead of time that you know that

357

0:54:16

P6

all that stuff is kind of like tied together. All that goes together is as one piece how they're determining your copayments based off your you know your whatever, your fine, your own financial information, as far as your income and things like that.

358

0:54:37

P6

That way. I don't have to go

359

0:54:40

P6

kind of like searching around myself and figuring it out by myself is kind of like

360

0:54:45

P6

it will be laid out together.

361

0:54:47

Emily

Okay, so everything together. Okay, got it great. Well, we are at time. And Nope logged out again.

362

0:54:54

Emily

I want to say goodbye, and then we'll wrap up hopefully. He comes back.

363

0:55:15

Emily

You able to hear me yet.

364

0:55:17

P6

Yes.

365

0:55:18

Emily

I was about to wrapping up. But yeah, I really appreciate you taking the time. I'm sorry technology was not was not working in our favor today. But like you said, it'll probably work great for the rest of the day, but we certainly got got some good information. It's always good to talk with our veterans. Just to understand experiences and what works and what does not work. So I appreciate you taking the time. And I hope you have a great rest of your day.

366

0:55:46

P6

Thank you. And I'm so sorry about my my technology. And I hope you all have a great rest of your day as well.

367

0:55:55

Emily

Great. Thank you. Take care!

368

0:55:57

P6

Thank you.

Emily

Recording.

2

0:00:02

Emily

There we go. So just to confirm, are you okay? If I record the audio and video as we talk today.

3

0:00:09

P7

Yes, I'm perfectly fine. Yeah.

4

0:00:11

Emily

Great. Thank you. And would you? Okay, with potentially showing our Va partners some clips from today's session.

5

0:00:19

P7

Yeah, that's perfectly fine.

6

0:00:20

Emily

Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. So on to oh, excuse me. First, st I'd like to know? Just a little bit about yourself as a veteran. What branch were you serving in when when you retired or separated.

7

0:00:36

P7

I really need to disclose all the information.

8

0:00:40

Emily

Oh, sorry! Sorry! I wasn't quite hearing that.

9

0:00:43

P7

Oh, I mentioned no! Do I really need to disclose all of that? I don't feel comfortable.

10

0:00:48

Emily

Okay, got it? Okay? Sure, no problem.

11

0:00:50

Emily

Okay. And then excuse me. At whatever level you're comfortable. What sort of experience have you had with Va. In terms of any sort of if you've gone to any any buildings or any sort of use on the website, or app.

12

0:01:05

P7

Yeah, I think everything. So far I've had. I've had a good experience for the most part. I think that sometimes it's like, it's very stressful, a lot of the, for example, the medical benefits. It's like very straightforward. They're really clear. I think maybe on the when it comes to the finance side. That's where I find that maybe I might be struggling a little bit with, and I think that's where probably

13

0:01:34

P7

looking for the most guidance.

14

0:01:38

Emily

Okay, got it?

15

0:01:40

Emily

Excuse me, and are you? Are you often or, ever on the va website and or the mobile app.

16

0:01:48

P7

I am on, especially on the mobile, on the mobile app.

17

0:01:53

Emily

Okay, yeah.

18

0:01:54

Emily

and are there. So are you? Are you only on the mobile app, or occasionally on the website as well.

19

0:02:00

P7

Also on the website. I think maybe the way my brain works is that sometimes when I'm dealing with finances, I think I need to work out my laptop. I think I find myself that because it's a serious interaction I'm gonna be engaging with. I think I need my laptop. So when it comes to like anything, finance, debt related. That's when I would use my laptop for the most part.

20

0:02:26

Emily

Okay, finance and lots of got it. In. In what cases would you choose to use the mobile app over the website?

21

0:02:34

P7

The mobile app. I think I found myself when I'm just like checking, like you know, any benefits, or I think, especially if I need to book any medical appointments prescriptions. That sort of thing. I gravitate. I see. I gravitate myself to just like picking up my phone and doing that.

22

0:02:55

Emily

Okay, got it? Great.

23

0:02:56

Emily

Okay? So we're going to be moving on to the financial portion. So I want to make sure that you're only sharing what you are willing. I have 0 information as to any sort of financial information records with you, so I only know what you would you choose to share.

24

0:03:14

Emily

So first, st we're going to be talking about both a little bit of medical Copays and or benefit overpayment, 1st wondering if you've had experience with owing the Va. Money.

25

0:03:30

P7

Yes, I do. I think I think at some point I fell behind on certain payments. And yeah, I was trying to maybe find a way to just let you know. Repay that. But I did. I did fall behind in that regard.

26

0:03:44

Emily

Okay, you got a 5 pm, do you recall? Exactly how or when? Oh, yeah. More how you were you. You were notified of the money that you had to pay.

27

0:03:56

P7

I was notified through a letter. So I think this is when it comes to. I think I think it becomes more top of mind when I receive a paper letter. And that's how I would get my notifications. I don't think I feel comfortable doing paperless, so that's what I prefer just getting a paper letter.

28

0:04:15

Emily

Oh, oh, you're not! You're you said you're you're not comfortable, doing paperless.

29

0:04:18

P7

Yeah, I think I find myself. Maybe I might distract, or sometimes I find them a little. I might miss them, or hard or it's a bit hard for me to find them. I think maybe I forget that I get that notification. Maybe so. I prefer getting them on on an actual, you know, envelope like snail mail.

30

0:04:39

Emily

Got it?

31

0:04:39

P7

It's top of mind. Yeah.

32

0:04:40

Emily

Okay, you prefer to get all right. Got it? And then what is or what? What prompts you to make payment, or like. How how do you know when you may need to make a payment.

33

0:04:53

P7

I think what I do. I just set myself up, either on a weekend just set aside some time just to go through my mail. And that's when I was like, okay, I think I could make the payment this time around at least a minimum and that's what I know I would I would describe some time. So a lot of manual stuff.

34

0:05:17

Emily

Okay, so you're covering your time. And do you are you getting a letter each time you have to pay? Or is it less frequent than that.

35

0:05:26

P7

I definitely get letters. When it comes to copayments. Frequently. So so yeah, it's like, no regardless like or treatment. I will get a letter. And that's when I would know that. Okay, I need to make a co-payment. Or if there's anything outside of that, I need to pay.

36

0:05:47

Emily

Okay, got it. And then how about? And for outside of of copayments, if there's any debt that you have, is that something you're you're receiving every time you need to make a payment, or less frequently.

37

0:05:59

P7

I think I think it's less frequently. I think maybe I probably get that letter. Maybe probably about I will say maybe quarterly, maybe every 3, every 3 or 4 months I would get a reminder that, hey, you have this like outstanding balance? Yeah.

38

0:06:18

Emily

Okay, got it. And with that, so with the ones that you get quarterly, are you? Are you making payments more often than that? Or are you making the payments quarterly when you receive the letters.

39

0:06:29

P7

I think, I think when I get the letter quarterly, that's when I know, okay, I'm I need to make a payment. I think, yeah.

40

0:06:38

Emily

Got it all right. And thoughts on. If there are any ways that things could be made easier in regards to any like having having to make the payments either for the the debt or for the medical co-payments.

41

0:06:56

P7

I think I think when it comes to medical Co payments for the most part. That's something, I think, because it happens more frequently. I'm on top of it a lot more, I think, when it comes up any debt outside of that.

42

0:07:09

P7

Sometimes I'm looking for, maybe, like, you know, if maybe down the line. I could get some kind of just like, you know, option where maybe some of the debt might be forgiven, or or or or to work out some kind of like, you know, plan where? Yeah. Like, you know, I could

43

0:07:27

P7

of.

44

0:07:28

P7

They make those payments much more doable for me.

45

0:07:33

Emily

Okay? And is there? What sort of communication is there now in regards to helping to make these payments more doable?

46

0:07:41

P7

So far, so far, just. The correspondence I received is just like this is your outstanding balance, and this is how like you know the payments that you should be making and so I've tried to adhere to them as much as possible.

47

0:07:56

Emily

okay, so so right now, it sounds like, there's there's not any communication, in regards to making anything easier to pay is that right.

48

0:08:03

P7

Yeah, I think so far, I that I remember, you know.

49

0:08:08

Emily

Got it.

50

0:08:09

Emily

and then thinking of both the copayments and the the debts. I know you said the copayments you're receiving fairly often, and then the debt you're receiving less often, maybe quarterly. How are you? Are you thinking of those as being similar types of money that you pay, or different? Or I'm wondering how you categorize those in your head.

51

0:08:37

P7

Yeah, I think of anything when I when I look at medical payments, because it involves my health and well being and I think just because of the frequency of the reminders, and because I think I just see them on my app.

52

0:08:53

P7

on my, on my phone, I think they become very much top of mind priority. That sort of sense. And I think, for, like any outstanding balance, I think it's more just like I know that. I need to make those payments. But I think just like, because of my income and everything. I think it's just

53

0:09:16

P7

adds that stress. And so I just wait for that letter to arrive. Just so. Yeah, just have to make that payment. But I think that's how pretty much just like, you know. Ensuring that I'm taking care of myself physically and mentally. Once.

54

0:09:35

Emily

Hmm, okay, got it? Got it?

55

0:09:37

Emily

Okay? I'm gonna have you? We're gonna move on to some screen share and eventually get to the prototype. Could I have you share your screen now, and let me know if you need help making that happen?

56

0:09:52

P7

Let's see.

57

0:10:03

Emily

All right sharing screen. That was nice and easy. I love that.

58

0:10:06

P7

Yeah.

59

0:10:07

Emily

And now let me have you open up the figma app that you had downloaded.

60

0:10:15

Emily

and I'm going to give you a login in just a moment. There we go, all right. And so so oh, yeah, they're just about to say you can swipe my video out of the way you read my mind.

61

0:10:23

P7

At least I'm tech savvy? Somewhat.

62

0:10:26

Emily

Perfect, easy peasy. So let me have you go to log into figma. And I'm going to give you some credentials here.

63

0:10:36

Emily

Okay, so the email is VA test 0 0@gmail.com.

64

0:10:48

P7

Okay.

65

0:10:49

Emily

And the password VAVA. VAVA.

66

0:10:54

Emily

There is a minimum of 8 characters.

67

0:10:57

P7

Oh, it's 8 characters. Okay?

68

0:10:59

P7

Oh.

69

0:11:03

Emily

Yes, all right. And then it's just gonna prompt me for a code. Okay, there we go. That's coming through. So let me have you type in 4, 7, 0

70

0:11:14

Emily

3, 9, 4, 3.

71

0:11:20

Emily

Okay. Now, let's hopeful. This works continue with mobile app.

72

0:11:27

Emily

All right. So I'm going to give you a link. Give me just a moment.

73

0:11:33

Emily

I will do so in the zoom chat. Okay. Just sent that from into the Zoom chat.

74

0:11:45

P7

okay.

75

0:11:47

Emily

Yeah, the extra. There we go.

76

0:11:51

Emily

Okay, hopefully, that comes out. It's working. I like, when things start working.

77

0:11:58

Emily

Oh, that was faster than than normal. I like it all right. So here we have the fake app home screen. So before I have you tap on anything just looking at this and pretending this was you opening up your mobile app thoughts on where you might find money that you owe, and this could be both the debts and the copayments.

78

0:12:25

P7

Yeah, I think opening this app.

79

0:12:30

P7

I think if anything I would probably look at maybe I would probably check messages just to see if I had any notifications regarding any of those outstanding debts, or if that were empty, then I will tap on payments at the bottom, right.

80

0:12:52

Emily

Okay. Got it. Thoughts on that payments that you mentioned in terms of the title. How clear or not clear might that be as a place to find that information.

81

0:13:04

P7

I think it's I think it's clear enough. I think. I'm inclined to have. Maybe payments might be anything I might be receiving. But then that's why the benefits tab is there? I think payments is very clear enough.

82

0:13:22

Emily

Okay, got it? Any thoughts on any title that might be even more clear.

83

0:13:28

P7

I think maybe I think maybe either maybe payments, or maybe if I provide something that says balance, or just maybe just just straightforward to it, just like outstanding balance. Would be great. Just so like I know exactly where that option is.

84

0:13:49

Emily

Okay, got it? Alright, and since you mentioned the payments, let me have you go ahead and tap into payments.

85

0:13:58

Emily

Okay? So now that you're seeing this screen again, I'll ask you any thoughts, especially knowing that this is called Payments thoughts on the information that you're seeing here in terms of the clarity of calling it payments.

86

0:14:14

P7

Yeah, in terms of payments. Payment history to you. Yeah, I think it's very straightforward. I like it. I like how it's

87

0:14:26

P7

quickly. Just categorize into 2 separate boxes if you will, maybe payments to you. So that makes sense that anything that I'm receiving from the Va, and then any debt that I have. That oh, to the Va, so so yeah, I think it's very. I think it's very clear. And understandable. Yeah.

88

0:14:53

Emily

Yeah, great. And then how about the the brief bit of information that is below both overpayment debt and copays the amount. And then how many debts or bills? What other are? Is there other information you might want to know, just as a super high level from this page.

89

0:15:12

P7

No, I think of anything I think of anything. Maybe I'd be curious to know if

90

0:15:20

P7

if maybe they could separate debts, or maybe just like if I'm about to click on overpayment, that's it. Maybe there'd be some kind of option to help me pay those make those payments more easier.

91

0:15:39

Emily

Oh, okay. So so, something from this page to to clearly make it easier to make those payments.

92

0:15:44

P7

Yeah, I think maybe it says copays maybe just mentioned, maybe medical Co pays or prescription copays just so. Just so. I know.

93

0:15:55

Emily

Oh, oh, even even more clear! On what type of Copays.

94

0:15:58

P7

Yeah, maybe that. But I but I imagine that maybe if I click on the arrow, maybe it will give me more information. But I think, just like looking at it from an high level. It's it's very understandable. Yeah.

95

0:16:11

Emily

Okay, got it. So first, st we're gonna look just at the the overpayment section and you can tap into anything, scroll around and stuff. But let me let me get a sense of of what you are from this app, like what you believe that you currently owe, according to all this fake data here for specifically for the overpayments.

96

0:16:33

P7

Yeah. So according to the information I'm given, yeah, I owe $2,760. That. Oh, and this is according to here.

97

0:16:50

Emily

Okay and let me have you get even more information on these, just to see how clear everything is laid out.

98

0:16:57

P7

Okay, should I check on the arrow?

99

0:16:59

P7

Yep, yeah. Yeah. It's right on the the overpayment. That's yep.

100

0:17:02

Emily

Yeah. So so again, just yeah, give me a brief overview of just what you're seeing here in terms of clarity, of of how much you owe with with this this fake example. Here.

101

0:17:15

P7

Yeah. So I think here is it shows the 4 debts that are part of that in the payment. I do see here that one of them the post focus. I think it's really it's already been paid for. So that's really out of the picture. But it's nice to have that I think maybe this is a reminder that

102

0:17:41

P7

I was able to make that that, or it's no longer top of mind. But yeah, but everything else. I do see. The balance that I owe and of course I think maybe what I

103

0:17:56

P7

appreciate a little is the the next steps to approach these steps.

104

0:18:08

Emily

Okay, so so since you mentioned next steps, what? And just the the this top one is active here, but what it. What information would be important to you specifically in regards to next steps, that you might have to take.

105

0:18:22

P7

I think maybe I think maybe that's probably what maybe I'm not being fine to click on review details. Like, for example, like the one at the bottom contact the Department of Treasury. If I click on review details, I hope that maybe I'll be given some sort of maybe direct phone number. And I can do like a generic phone number to try to see if I could work that balance out

106

0:18:50

P7

at least, for, like the disability, pension, and compensation and pension that I do see that, for example, at least fair enough. They give me the warning that benefits will be reduced or can be enacted. So yeah, we'll definitely click on review details to see what's gonna be the outcome of that.

107

0:19:13

Emily

Okay. Well, since you said the details, let me have you tap on the details for the top one, the housing one, and let me know if, like, yeah, with the information here, how complete or incomplete is are things here that you would need for your next steps.

108

0:19:34

P7

Let's see.

109

0:19:42

P7

Yeah, I think it's I think it's complete. Enough. I think it's no. I think it's very complete. Yeah. It shows me again, like the the balance that I currently owe. When I need to. Make that payment or give them a call to see if maybe I can work the date out somehow.

110

0:20:05

P7

I do like this signal. Why might I have this that I do like that reminder. So I don't think at least I don't have this

111

0:20:14

P7

thinking that like, where did this come from? At least there's context behind that debt. And then I know I do like the

112

0:20:25

P7

the the history of the payments I've made, and I think if anything, also the the letters I've been receiving. Yeah, I think this is also a a good post that I appreciate.

113

0:20:38

Emily

Okay? Great in regards to the the debt letter history. What are how? How would you use that that section? What? What would be helpful for you right here.

114

0:20:49

P7

I think maybe I think for me it would be just like the the dates. I think maybe that's when I would, you know, at least for me, like well, I can't let this

115

0:21:00

P7

keep just like, you know, snowballing and so I think that, for example, April 1st 2025. It kind of says a mental reminder for me that. Okay, that's when they sent the letter. And I really need to get on on top of this.

116

0:21:16

Emily

Okay, so is, is the the information here sufficient? Seeing exactly the date the letters were.

117

0:21:23

P7

Yeah, I think if anything ever wanted to see the letter, I'd be curious to know if I could like tap on it the 1, st 2025, 1st demand letter and see if the letter will pop up or Pdf of it. But yeah, I think I find this section very helpful.

118

0:21:40

Emily

Okay, great. Got it, and then see what else? Here, if you let's say you did pay this debt off completely, what information would you want to see that that may or may not indicate that.

119

0:21:56

P7

If I pay this debt completely, I think we I think that letter history. I would want maybe some kind of this, like final letter or something indicating that. You're. You know this debt is close and that you've made your final payment.

120

0:22:14

P7

And yeah, and maybe like, no, whether it's in yellow, maybe something in green or a balance of 0, just letting me know that there's no further action or activity required on my end.

121

0:22:27

Emily

Okay, got it? And are there other things that? You know, we're, we're gonna pretend that this is being built in in the app. So about what you're seeing here? Are there other other things that you would expect to be or want to be able to do from here?

122

0:22:47

P7

Yeah, I think if anything, what I'm looking for. Interestingly enough, I'm looking for, maybe like, kind of what banks have like a payment option. So I'm looking for like, oh, I know that I owe in this case 830. I'm I'm looking for a way to, maybe. Okay, well, let's let's make a payment right now. I don't see that. So maybe I'm looking for that. Yeah. Or maybe just because

123

0:23:15

P7

because this because of how much I owe. I'm looking for, maybe just a button or something, just to let me know like, Hey, how can I? Maybe? How can we work something out so that I can continue to make these payments? At a more, maybe tailored approach. Given my income.

124

0:23:38

Emily

Okay. So you you'd want something to to potentially work with you to make the payments and also something to make the payments.

125

0:23:46

P7

Yeah, I know that like no, I don't. I saw the previous option that they had some sort of like, you know, contact us, and we'll work something out or something along those lines. But I don't know, I'm thinking, maybe kind of like

126

0:24:00

P7

kind of like with other apps like or paypal, where you could just automatically, just opt in into maybe a way to consult to maybe break this payments apart or make them more doable. Yeah, I'm kind of looking for that. Maybe like an option. Here.

127

0:24:21

Emily

Okay, got it? Yeah, that makes sense. So noting that you have stated those things that you want that are not here. If this were built in real life, as is without the payment options and without the communication about how how they could they could work with you, how likely would you be to use it as is.

128

0:24:42

P7

I would. I would likely very. I would. I would use it. I think maybe I think maybe it's very. It's very clean. It's very informative. It provides me everything about like, you know the payments that I've made, including any late fees, that sort of nature. So I think with that in mind?

129

0:25:02

P7

Yeah, it would definitely. I would see myself. Adding it to my well, that's maybe being more comfortable. Seeing this on my phone and engaging with it with making payments, or having that in top of mind.

130

0:25:17

Emily

Okay, got it. And I'm gonna so we're gonna get back. Get back to the payments in just a moment. But let me have you go one screen back to the the debts page is one other question I had.

131

0:25:29

Emily

Yeah. So if you were going to pretend that there is a new debt that you have incurred in this in this pretend situation, how would you expect to be notified? Obviously you would. I know you would get the the debt letter, but in terms of the app. How might you expect to to know that that information is in here?

132

0:25:51

P7

Yeah, I think maybe I think if it if if I haven't got the letter, but I know that I owe something, then probably I would go here again under payments, and see if maybe try refreshing the page and see if it's there.

133

0:26:08

P7

or or if it's not there just yet. Then probably I'll just go to my home to the home page. Maybe the bottom left, and I guess wait until I get some kind of push notification or some kind of internal notification, letting me know that where it's gonna be posted, or when it's posted.

134

0:26:30

Emily

Okay, got it.

135

0:26:31

Emily

And all right, let me have you tap on the payment section i'm going to have you and scroll all the way down we're going to get to a little hidden section. The blank gray area below Copays. Go ahead and tap that.

136

0:26:46

P7

Focus, or the blank.

137

0:26:48

Emily

The the blank area that's below. Could the copays?

138

0:26:53

Emily

Yeah, there, perfect. Okay. And let me have you tap into the overpayment debt section again.

139

0:27:00

Emily

All right. So again, we're going to look at this very top one, the housing we're going to pretend that since we've talked about looking to to get help in terms of making different payment structures. What would you want to do if you were looking to make a different payment plan or something for this top on this debt, for housing.

140

0:27:29

P7

Yeah, I think maybe I think if I'm looking for maybe some kind of maybe different option, or maybe a more tailored option. And I would click on or tap on our resolve gap and see if maybe they could provide me with some

141

0:27:47

P7

options where we could have it with no mutual benefit or understanding. Okay.

142

0:27:52

Emily

Okay? Oh, yeah, you can go ahead and do that. Since you mentioned it.

143

0:27:57

P7

Okay?

144

0:27:59

P7

Yeah. So so yeah, I, I like this, like, how? Like, yeah, I can either pay online or other ways to pay. I think maybe I'd be inclined to, by the way, click on other ways to pay. Just so. Maybe it would give like no more options.

145

0:28:18

Emily

Nice.

146

0:28:18

P7

To calculating this debt.

147

0:28:21

Emily

Okay, yeah. Yeah. If you want to go and tap through that, some of these are are actually linked in the prototype here.

148

0:28:27

P7

Okay.

149

0:28:28

P7

Okay. So pay by phone pay by mail.

150

0:28:33

P7

Yeah, give- give them a call.

151

0:28:39

P7

But

152

0:28:43

P7

no, that's.

153

0:28:44

Emily

Information here. Would there be something else you might be looking for?

154

0:28:48

P7

Yeah, I think maybe pay by mail. I think I think I imagine that I thought that I thought that I would be getting. Maybe in my mind I thought that maybe there'd be other options where maybe I can. They can help me with just like, you know. making these payments much more doable. But instead, I got that. What if I can't pay online? Then I could do this

155

0:29:14

P7

pay that post $10, either on the phone or by mail. So I think my mind was just thinking about something else. But yeah.

156

0:29:24

Emily

Okay, I'll have you go ahead and tap close there.

157

0:29:28

Emily

And yeah. Thoughts on what? What would you be? What would you expect to find, under the the request, Help, Button.

158

0:29:38

P7

Request help, I think. I think, initially, I thought that maybe initially, I thought that by tapping on request help. That's when I would anticipate to maybe get a phone number or something to contact them. That's what I initially thought. But now that I see the other ways to pay is going down. That phone number. Then, I imagine, request to help now

159

0:30:03

P7

should be, I hope, ways that maybe I could make these payments much more doable for me.

160

0:30:13

Emily

Okay, yeah. And you can. You can go ahead and tap or request help. And just see how that lines up with what you're expecting.

161

0:30:20

P7

Yeah, yeah, this is exactly what I was. I was looking for initially. Yeah. So I think I think, by the way, I would tap on request a payment plan.

162

0:30:34

P7

just to see like, you know, what options?

163

0:30:37

P7

So

164

0:30:39

P7

so yeah, I think it gives me just like, you know, general information. I think, knowing me either, like, you know, I will try going online and see if I could work something out. Obviously to ask ea otherwise, if I find that tricky or cumbersome, then maybe I'll just give them a call directly

165

0:31:04

P7

and before before I proceed with that? I'll I'll probably also click on and see again. I know what I can do. And I think and I think maybe because he starts to request for that help.

166

0:31:21

P7

I might be inclined to actually tap on that and see if I fit that requirement when it comes to putting out the paperwork and see if I'm eligible for any further help or the legal.

167

0:31:36

Emily

Okay? Yeah, you can go ahead and tap on the the debt relief one and see if if this page looks like it would be, it would be helpful from what we have. And obviously I'm not going to have you read everything but just a quick skim. If this would be be helpful for you if you, if you were for help.

168

0:31:56

P7

Yeah, I think if anything it looks, it looks very promising. Da da da.

169

0:32:03

P7

Yeah, I think if anything

170

0:32:10

P7

request I like how it it kind of it gives you. By the way, the step by step, as like no, what? What information they're gonna need, and the timeline whenever we have time for just the process step by step. I do like. How like they mentioned how long it'll probably take. So I really do appreciate that. Because you never know

171

0:32:34

P7

just like how much time I need to carve out. I anticipated. Maybe I thought that maybe I would just it would just take me 1520 min to submit it. But I do like how they give me the actual timeframe. So that's very helpful and I do like how the start. The request is mentioned at the top and bottom, and it's indicated in green, so I don't know. Maybe just for me. The green just makes me a bit more optimistic.

172

0:33:04

Emily

Okay, great. Let me have you tap on done here on the upper left yep, and then

173

0:33:12

Emily

oh, if in case you or let's say you believe that you don't actually owe this money, this particular debt for housing? Would it be clear what your next steps would be if you don't believe you, you owe this bill. I'm sorry this this debt.

174

0:33:29

P7

Yeah, yeah. So so yeah. So if if I feel that, maybe this was posted by error, or maybe the debt that I owe is higher than what I anticipated. Well, if there's maybe some sort of discrepancy, then yeah, I would click on then I think it would tap on request help.

175

0:33:54

P7

And then I think I saw an option. Yeah, here. So we click on on dispute this, that yeah, I would tap on that start here, that dispute.

176

0:34:05

Emily

Okay, great. I'll have you close this one.

177

0:34:10

Emily

So overall how I know you said when you have received the debt letters in person. There really wasn't any communication in terms of any help you might be able to request overall. How? How have you become aware that it is possible to request help from Va. Or any other resources in that in that sense.

178

0:34:35

P7

Oh, me, personally, I well, I think I think for me personally, maybe just like, you know, going online and maybe doing a quick Google search but I think maybe just for me, maybe, like, you know, I haven't. Maybe you know, had the time, or I really don't know how. Maybe

179

0:34:56

P7

time consuming. That might be, or if it's even worth exploring. So I don't know. Maybe that's why I haven't attack with that, or make that approach but maybe just seeing the options here, like, you know, on this, on this screen, on my phone. I don't know. Maybe just holding in my hands. It kind of gives me a sense of just like it's not.

180

0:35:20

P7

it's it. It could be maybe easier. And maybe I should have done this maybe a while back.

181

0:35:26

Emily

Okay, so you, it sounds like you, you would. You would want more communication just to

182

0:35:31

Emily

just give like laying out options.

183

0:35:35

P7

Yeah.

184

0:35:36

Emily

Okay, got it.

185

0:35:38

Emily

And then we're going to pretend that you are ready to make a payment on this particular debt on this particular debt for the housing. Walk me through how you might, and again, I'm not going to have you enter in any payment information, I promise, but walk me through what your steps would be if you are ready to make a payment through here.

186

0:35:59

P7

Yeah. So I will want to make a payment. I'll probably click on resolve that and then, because yeah, probably

187

0:36:10

P7

how seamless this experience has been. Then I probably click on pay online.

188

0:36:17

P7

Okay. So it provides me with the details. And then from there I would have to click on or tap on pay on pay and I think from there it will just take me to like, you know the other page where I could make the payment.

189

0:36:41

Emily

Okay, let me let me have you tap on that. And again, I'm not gonna have you type in anything real, so you will not make any payments, I promise.

190

0:36:48

Emily

Yeah, you can continue through that to.

191

0:36:51

P7

So if you click on view, let me open here.

192

0:37:01

Emily

So here we have the the and and have you have you encountered this site before?

193

0:37:06

P7

Yes, I have.

194

0:37:07

Emily

Yeah, okay, got it. Okay? So I'm not. Gonna have you read everything? But let me have you just skip right ahead and tap on the the Blue green button on the upper left. I think it says pay online. It's very tiny. I can't actually tell.

195

0:37:21

P7

Yeah, it's yeah. It's.

196

0:37:23

Emily

Yeah, line. There we go. Yeah, okay. And then, I just want you to scroll down to where you you would be entering information. Not again. Not gonna have you do that, but thoughts on the process of entering the required information here.

197

0:37:42

P7

Yeah, I think. I think it's very yeah. It's it's very straightforward. I do like how in the previous page, they did give me the just like as a as a reminder, just the information that I should be entering. Just so. It's when I make a when I make a payment, it's tethered to that, that. But yeah, I think if anything, it's it's very straightforward. And very clear.

198

0:38:11

Emily

Okay, got it? And what would be your process if you were to to be making a payment on your phone here in in terms of getting the the required numbers into this.

199

0:38:24

P7

I think I think for me my process would normally be that I already have all of my personal information just like on on the iphone, on the notes, on the notes app. So whenever I need to make a payment, I just use that and of course, if they're asking for any, maybe a reference code, or or any of that, that any additional information?

200

0:38:49

P7

Then I take a note of that. But yeah, I think everything more or less. It's it's the same.

201

0:38:55

Emily

Okay, okay, so so you would be using your your notes app instead sorry, or to to copy the information.

202

0:39:02

P7

Yeah, so like, no, anything, anything that's personal. Fine. Yeah, I would just use my notes. App. That's why I would just kind of have my own, like no personal information from my own reminder.

203

0:39:14

Emily

Okay, got it? And talk to me about the experience of of having to use multiple apps to do this, since, of course you mentioned using the notes app, and then having to open this page as well.

204

0:39:26

P7

I think, I think, where I was kind of maybe hoping for. And initially was when I was making the payment online. I was kind of hoping that all of the information it would just be

205

0:39:38

P7

already tied to my personal information. So all, all I need, I just thought, all I need to do, which is maybe enter the amount.

206

0:39:46

P7

and then maybe confirm my bank and then make a payment, and that'll be the end of that. But yeah, that's why I felt like, you know, the very seamless. But if I need to, just like, you know populate here this page again with my information and all of that. It's it's not a huge lift, I think. Maybe I think maybe for me it's just like something with the process. I'm comfortable with it.

207

0:40:16

Emily

Okay, got it? And if if and actually, let me have you, switch, back to the figma app

208

0:40:27

Emily

yep, and then go to go back, so we'll get there. Yep, so pretending that this feature is built in the app as is just like using paying just like we we talked about how how likely would you be to use to to use the app as is here.

209

0:40:49

P7

If I were to use the app as is yeah, like with the with the payment, and then having to tap on that link, and then and then going over to the other Gov page and and confirmation. Yeah, I would. Still, I would still use it, I think, for me even though that kind of want, that seamless portion, I think maybe for me mentally, because I'm seeing the official, the official Gov. Page. It gives me like

210

0:41:17

P7

it probably gives a much more sense of confidence that.

211

0:41:20

Emily

Hmm.

212

0:41:20

P7

Receiving my payment as opposed to. If I maybe make the payment here. And if, whatever reason, there's an error now, I don't know if

213

0:41:31

P7

if our payments in the limbo, or if they got it or not, so maybe just doing it on the government page, gives me a much more sense of like security and confidence.

214

0:41:41

Emily

Okay, so is, would you? Would you actually rather have that payment in the the official Gov page, as opposed to within the app.

215

0:41:50

P7

I think I think I think for me. I would still prefer to have it on the app. Personally, I would like to have an app. But-. But if it's if, if, for whatever reason, that's not possible, and I just need to

216

0:42:05

P7

use the link, I'm perfectly fine. Also doing that.

217

0:42:09

Emily

Okay, got it? And then compare for me the this version here, which we have the payment through the pay.vi.gov. Versus the version that we looked at before that did not have any payment. Options talk to me about which one you might prefer, and why.

218

0:42:30

P7

I would definitely prefer this option, the one that I'm looking at right now.

219

0:42:34

P7

I love. How excuse me! I like how you know, in the review details again. It just gives me a quick sense of just you know where my debt is. And any of my payment history in that regard. But I do like how it has a separate option. So resolve that and it helps, and it gives me a sense of just like know that? I don't know. Maybe because I like the word resolve that or that phrase. It gives maybe a sense of maybe

220

0:43:02

P7

comfort that maybe like no they're looking out for me to kind of like, you know. Help tackle this that together.

221

0:43:10

Emily

Okay, looking after you. I like that.

222

0:43:13

Emily

Got it. And then any other thoughts regarding the screen, or really any of the screens we've looked at so far, any any labels or the sections or pages are labeled anything that might be that might make things more clear for you.

223

0:43:32

P7

I think I think maybe

224

0:43:35

P7

no, I think it's i i like it. I like how like, you know, for example, here, pay a request. Help by May 1, st 2025. I like how it's in bold letters, just to remind me. I also like no, the the colors of it like make it very simple and plain. So I'm not getting, you know, bombarded with too many

225

0:43:57

P7

bells and whistles, which is a lot of yeah. So I think it's, it's very clean. And like, I said before, I do like the resolve that option. And yeah, and maybe kind of was hoping that maybe resolve that, but would also be at the bottom these other 2 deaths. But

226

0:44:15

P7

but yeah, I I really like the aesthetic. It's very concise and clear.

227

0:44:19

Emily

Okay, got it? And then if you, if you're able, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this, what you're seeing here would compare to anything you're seeing on va.gov, on on the website in terms of any any overpayment debts, and just in terms of the experience, or things that have been like. How how clear things are.

228

0:44:43

P7

Yeah, I think maybe I think now that you know, I think about doing it on my laptop and then doing it here. I like, how like I said, like, how very clean it is. Very straight to the point.

229

0:45:01

P7

yeah, I think it's just like not having it on my phone. It's, I think, for me, it's just it's extremely aesthetically pleasing. Because I know, like on the laptop, maybe I could get distracted, or or they get too many, too much information on the page. And I think here, on on my phone, on the on this app, it it just gives me the the correct amount of information that I need. Without being

230

0:45:29

P7

overwhelmed by so many options.

231

0:45:31

Emily

Okay, too many options. Alright. You got it and let me have you tap on the the payment section again. One more small section. I want to go through before before we wrap up. In regards to the co-pays. Let me have you tap into that.

232

0:45:49

Emily

And then thoughts on, you know similar question as I had asked with the overpayments, but thoughts on the clarity in terms of bills here, how much you owe for Copays in this pretend situation.

233

0:46:04

P7

Yeah. So I think so far, it's more or less the same amount information and overview. So I do like how it informs me when my payment is due, or when I should reach out in case I need any help. I like how I think what was missing? Maybe in the previous page with the payments

234

0:46:31

P7

was this information that contact the Department of Treasury? And here's the phone number. So I do. I do appreciate that. Just like that contact information. And I think your co-, your Co pay bills for the past 6 months. That's informative, I think. I think that gives maybe a a sense of comfort

235

0:46:54

P7

for me, because at least I know that the amount the amount balance that I owe is up to date, and that's something that I've just let. There let it just rest there, for

236

0:47:06

P7

on and on.

237

0:47:08

Emily

Okay, got it. And let me have you tap into the top one. The James A. Haley Hospital hospital in Tampa, to look at the information here.

238

0:47:19

Emily

and see what information would be important to you if you if you had received, or if you were, you were looking at this particular bill.

239

0:47:29

P7

Yeah, I think, it's

240

0:47:32

P7

yeah. My information I'm giving it. It's it's standard I think maybe I think I might be inclined to be go to maybe premise statement and maybe see just like

241

0:47:45

P7

the actual maybe paperwork of it all. But yeah, it's it's the option to pay Bill right away. So I think maybe just because I do like that option.

242

0:48:06

Emily

Okay, great and since you mentioned the statements, what would you be looking for with the statements? How? How are you using them?

243

0:48:15

P7

I think for me, just like my statements might be just like if there's as a reminder, maybe. What kind of treatment one of the service that I got. So instead of seeing here that well, $50 and that's that

244

0:48:31

P7

I would like to let you know just as a reminder for myself. See? Well, why do I owe that much, and maybe just see the statement, and maybe say, Oh, it was maybe for X or Y service. And so I think for me, it's just that reminds me of like, know the context behind that payment.

245

0:48:49

Emily

Hmm, okay, good and and let me have you. Look at a statement to just see like how how you would be. I know you said you would. You would review it? To make sure to see what is on there. Is there anything else you would do with the statements from the phone.

246

0:49:05

P7

No, I think if anything

247

0:49:08

P7

no, I think I think for me it would just be just that I think. I think, because I know I would still be in kind of pay it to pay it online. But I think for me, my my peace of mind is maybe just looking at it. Then just knowing what the context of the bill is.

248

0:49:32

Emily

Okay, you're just looking at them. Got it? Okay, maybe tap done there, please.

249

0:49:38

Emily

And let's pretend that you are ready to make a payment you can walk me through. How? You would be making a payment for this particular one.

250

0:49:48

P7

Yeah, so I've got the options is pay bill. So we'll click on that and then, yeah, probably probably this is so seamless. I'll go on pay.gov, so I would like track on that, and go from there.

251

0:50:05

Emily

Okay and let me have you go go through that as well.

252

0:50:16

Emily

Okay, and just scroll down. I know there's a lot to read, so I don't. Wanna

253

0:50:19

Emily

have you and tap on. Continue to the form again, not going to have you enter in any real information.

254

0:50:26

Emily

And then scroll down a little bit. So yeah, thoughts on how you would get the the account number that you would need into into this page.

255

0:50:39

P7

Yeah, I think here. So I think here, either. I would check maybe my my notes app and see if if I have that information

256

0:50:51

P7

or if the information that I have is the one that they're asking for that regard, or otherwise, just to be on the safe side and not and avoid any discrepancies or errors. Then I would definitely just tap on whether I find my account number just to be in the safe side that I'm providing the correct information.

257

0:51:14

Emily

Okay? And when you mentioned again, you're gonna use the the notes app is, is that like, are you? How? How are you getting the information into the notes app? Is this something you're you're copying or forwarding, or how are you actually putting it in? There.

258

0:51:30

P7

Yeah, some just copy and pasting. So if there's something, if like, if there's information or anything that's given to me, that maybe it's personal, or something of account number or an Id or something. Then I just said, That's I just copy and paste that maybe it might be relevant in the future.

259

0:51:56

Emily

Okay, let me have you, Tab. I'm sorry not tab switch back to the figma app.

260

0:52:01

P7

Okay.

261

0:52:03

Emily

Yeah, and then go to go back

262

0:52:05

Emily

close. Yeah. Okay. So thoughts on on copying the account number from here into the paying website. We just had.

263

0:52:16

P7

Yeah, yeah. So I think so I think I would go. I would probably copy that account number into my

264

0:52:27

P7

into my notes app, maybe again, like, you know, it just looked at a very important number that is, gonna be tabit to me. I do see how like when it's now I look at it. It's broken into 5 parts. So maybe that might be the information that they're looking for. When it comes to making that payment but I would still, I would still tap on or click on the how to find my account number.

265

0:52:52

P7

just to be just to double or triple check on my end. Yeah, just to avoid any any errors or yeah.

266

0:53:00

Emily

Oh, from the the payment site you would tap on how to find your account number.

267

0:53:04

P7

Yeah, I would say, yeah, just so, because I know that I am entering the the correct information. And it's not just a coincidence that

268

0:53:16

Emily

Okay, and then thoughts on. If you ever might use the copy button here on this on the app for the account number.

269

0:53:27

P7

I think I think I would. I think I would. I would definitely copy but then I imagine that on the other page, because I see 5 separate lines. Then then I don't know if they want me to like.

270

0:53:43

P7

enter it into just like line 1, 5, 3, 4, line 2, 1 0 0 1. So if I copy and paste it, I'm just gonna be doing a lot of just like pasting and deleting. Yeah.

271

0:53:57

Emily

Got it. Okay, got it.

272

0:53:59

Emily

Okay? And we are just about time. So I believe those are all my questions I'm going to check in with my colleagues here. If anybody has

273

0:54:08

Emily

questions. Natasha, Michelle Ashley, if anyone would like to unmute and ask, you may do so now.

274

0:54:23

Emily

Okay, it looks like no one asked questions. Any other final thoughts you'd like to share in regards to finances and all the designs we've been looking at.

275

0:54:35

P7

No, I think this is a really really clean design. There's a lot of comfort around the design. So so, yeah, I do like like I said before, just like and the other payments page. Nothing helping me with something like that, I think. I think it's very well designed. It's very crystal clear.

276

0:54:58

Emily

Great. Thank you. Well, this has been really great. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us. It's it's really great to hear directly from veterans just you know about about your experiences here. So I appreciate, appreciate that. And that is all for us today. And I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

277

0:55:19

P7

Absolutely okay. You're very welcome, and take good care.

278

0:55:22

Emily

Okay. Thank you. Take care.

279

0:55:23

Michelle

So much.

280

0:55:24

P7

Thank you. Goodbye.

## P8 Transcript

1

0:00:00

Emily

That. So

2

0:00:02

Emily

progress. So again, can, I'd like to confirm, are you okay? If I record the audio and video video as we talk today.

3

0:00:11

P8

Yes.

4

0:00:12

Emily

Okay, great. And are you okay? If we potentially show some clips from this session to our Va partners.

5

0:00:20

P8

Yeah.

6

0:00:21

Emily

Okay, great. Okay. So now we'll get into the conversation. So I'd love to know a little bit about you as a veteran, whatever you're comfortable sharing with, of course, such things as what branch you served in when you retired or separated.

7

0:00:38

P8

Okay. My name is [redacted]. I was in the [redacted] from [redacted] of 2,001 up until 2,013 did [redacted]

8

0:00:50

P8

okay, that's it.

9

0:00:52

Emily

Okay, great

10

0:00:53

Emily

and then let to know any sort of experience you have had with veteran affairs just pretty high level to see how sort of interactions you've had with with the organization.

11

0:01:06

P8

I've used my gi bill with them, and then I've also I have my

12

0:01:14

P8

compensation. But I'm disabled. So I get my service connected disability through the Va.

13

0:01:20

P8

And then also I go to the [redacted] Va. Medical Center for all my calls, everything.

14

0:01:27

Emily

Over healthcare. Okay? Got it?

15

0:01:29

Emily

And then talk to me about how much you are using or not. The Va website and or the mobile app.

16

0:01:39

P8

Never really used the mobile app I've logged in a couple of times, but never really found use for it. I've used the website especially, for, like refill my prescriptions. Then, also, when I need to contact one of my providers, I do this. Your messaging like, I need to refill one of my prescriptions. It's easier than calling and going through

17

0:01:59

P8

the operator and waiting in call center forever. And then also, for, like filling out my gi Bill did that through. Va. Of course, the E-benefits portal that used to be. I think it's all under login.gov. Now.

18

0:02:15

Emily

-

19

0:02:15

P8

Have quite a bit of experience with it. I've probably been there about

20

0:02:19

P8

once or twice a month to refill prescriptions or schedule appointments, and do all that for my medical.

21

0:02:26

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay? And then you said you had. You had tried to use the mobile app. What what made you stop, or what like. What might you have been looking for that you weren't finding there.

22

0:02:37

P8

I just rarely use my phone for Internet and everything. So it wasn't really if I'm only using going to the website a couple of times a month. There's no real reason to download it now.

23

0:02:49

Emily

Got it.

24

0:02:50

P8

The that on my phone, for never be used really.

25

0:02:55

Emily

Okay, good. Okay. So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion. So I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have no additional information about any sort of financial, really anything in regards to the Va. So this is as anonymous as you would like it, so can I have you tell me

26

0:03:17

Emily

if you have had experience with owing the Va. Any money, and then, if if again, if you're comfortable if you, if you could tell me about any experience you might have had.

27

0:03:28

P8

Yeah, I've had several times. It's happened. There's been

28

0:03:32

P8

overpayments on like for my gi bill, because.

29

0:03:39

Emily

Okay.

30

0:03:40

P8

They send out a check early. So this overpaid. It was like [redacted] bucks that I still owed to the

31

0:03:47

P8

for that overpayment. That's really where I've gotten into trouble before is just with dropping class, and it not catching up in the system quick enough.

32

0:03:55

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay.

33

0:03:56

P8

You know we're paying for.

34

0:03:57

Emily

Sure.

35

0:03:58

Emily

And do you recall how you've been notified? Of the of these various situations.

36

0:04:06

P8

Let's see, I've always received a letter on the regular mail.

37

0:04:12

Emily

Okay, and then thoughts are sorry. Sorry. Skip ahead there. What's been your method for any sort of payment that that you've made for some of these past debts.

38

0:04:26

P8

I just let it come out of my next. Whatever's coming next month.

39

0:04:30

Emily

Okay, great. And was there anything that you feel could have been made easier from the Va. With that, either with with communication or or anything else in regards to these debts.

40

0:04:46

P8

Not really. I mean, I guess the fact that I was only notified via mail. So.

41

0:04:53

P8

I guess that's 1 thing. Maybe if they send me an email, it'd be a little bit better

42

0:04:59

P8

snail mail works. I mean, I was notified about that.

43

0:05:02

P8

At least I didn't just all of a sudden see a surprise coming in my next call and

44

0:05:07

P8

just disappearing, or something like that. So.

45

0:05:10

Emily

That's a good.

46

0:05:12

P8

Okay, go ahead.

47

0:05:12

P8

Maybe send me an email. I don't know what else I could really do.

48

0:05:17

Emily

Okay, you would. You would prefer an email, or you would also want an email.

49

0:05:24

Emily

And then any I know you mentioned that. You? You have at least some health care. Do you have experience with medical co-payments through Va.

50

0:05:35

P8

No, I've always been service connected, so I've never had to do.

51

0:05:40

Emily

Okay, great

52

0:05:43

Emily

so let me have. I'm gonna we're gonna move into the prototype section. Here, let me have you share your screen and let me know if you need any help walking you through that process.

53

0:05:55

P8

Do I do that?

54

0:05:59

P8

So it should just.

55

0:06:00

Emily

Yep, yeah. You should be able to tap once, and at the bottom there should be a share button. It's usually labeled with the word share, I believe.

56

0:06:34

Emily

all right, and we're working. I love it all right. So now we're gonna leave this as is. Now let me have you open up the figma app that you've had downloaded

57

0:06:50

Emily

all right and tap the log into figma. I'm going to give you some test credentials here.

58

0:07:00

Emily

Okay, so the email is VA test

59

0:07:10

Emily

0 0 0

60

0:07:16

Emily

at gmail.com.

61

0:07:27

Emily

okay? And the password, it's going to be the letters. No, we're not going to create anything, and then the password is going to be the letters Va. Repeated 4 times. So VAVA. VAVA. All lowercase.

62

0:07:43

Emily

Alright. Go ahead and log in. And then that's gonna prompt. A.

63

0:07:47

Emily

yeah. Give me, okay, I'm going to give you the authentication code, which is 5, 9, 9,

64

0:07:57

Emily

8, 6, 6, 8.

65

0:08:03

Emily

Alright. Go ahead and log in and continue with mobile app.

66

0:08:12

Emily

What's that is

67

0:08:13

Emily

up alright? Just you can tap out of that. Okay? So now I'm gonna send you a link. I'm gonna send it within the zoom chat. And okay, if you open up zoom again, you should have a chat or sorry a link there.

68

0:08:30

Emily

Yep, go and tap on that, please.

69

0:08:40

Emily

Alright. This is loading. Give it just a moment to come through.

70

0:08:47

Emily

All right. So here we have your fake app, home screen?

71

0:08:53

Emily

So if you if you could, yeah, there we go. I was. Gonna say, clear that message perfect. So first, st I'm not going to have you tap on anything quite yet, but pretending you are opening the mobile app here. Where would you expect to find any information from money that you owe, for example, from an overpayment.

72

0:09:16

P8

Maybe in Claims

73

0:09:18

Emily

On the claim. Okay? Good. Any claims, any any other questions?

74

0:09:22

Emily

I'm, sorry.

75

0:09:23

P8

In the bottom, under, maybe in the bottom, under benefits or payments.

76

0:09:28

Emily

Okay, okay. Got it?

77

0:09:31

Emily

Any other? Oh, yeah, any any other thoughts you have where you might find it.

78

0:09:38

P8

Maybe it's maybe in the latest payment, but.

79

0:09:45

Emily

In what time.

80

0:09:49

P8

I was thinking, maybe under the see details.

81

0:09:52

Emily

Okay, got it?

82

0:09:52

P8

That's David.

83

0:09:56

Emily

Okay. So since you mentioned both the benefits and payment sections on the bottom, we will find it under payments. And I'm wondering any thoughts you might have for making that even more clear. That that's where you might find that information.

84

0:10:17

P8

No with it, just saying payments alone. It's

85

0:10:21

P8

kind of making me think about what they paid me, and it's only showing like what's been sent to me, but

86

0:10:28

P8

I don't know. It makes sense. I don't. I don't have any suggestions as to making it really much clearer.

87

0:10:35

P8

It's 1 of those things where you just gotta explore around and find your way.

88

0:10:39

Emily

Sure. Sure. Yeah. Okay, so let me have you tap into that payment section

89

0:10:46

Emily

and then over before you can scroll around. But don't yet tap on anything, thoughts on how this is structured, especially knowing the title of payments, and what might make more sense if anything.

90

0:11:02

P8

So this is actually pretty clear, and you got your payments. And then history 1,000 information.

91

0:11:10

P8

This is pretty clear and simple. I like this.

92

0:11:14

Emily

Got it

93

0:11:15

Emily

and talk to me about the. So in this case we're going to pretend that you do have copays in this in this pretend world. But talk to me about the the brief information that is below both the words overpayment debts and copays. What sort of high level information might you want from this page.

94

0:11:37

P8

I think just telling you like, how much is gonna be due, how much you owe.

95

0:11:42

P8

And maybe there's like a deadline on when we need to pay it.

96

0:11:49

Emily

Okay. Deadline. Go.

97

0:11:49

P8

Really does deadlines. I'm not sure about that. So.

98

0:11:53

Emily

Okay.

99

0:11:55

Emily

Alright oh, sorry. Go ahead.

100

0:11:58

P8

Good.

101

0:11:59

P8

This seems pretty good and clear.

102

0:12:01

Emily

Okay, got it. Alright, as as I said, the only other thing you might want to know is, is any deadline right here?

103

0:12:10

Emily

Okay, let me have you so I'm gonna have you tap into the the overpayments to get your thoughts on how clear it is on overall, what you currently owe in this pretend situation.

104

0:12:26

Emily

Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. It hit it payments again. I think that was is the

105

0:12:31

Emily

copays. I'm going to get you to the overpayments.

106

0:12:34

P8

Yeah. There, the over tenants.

107

0:12:37

Emily

Yep.

108

0:12:39

P8

Okay.

109

0:12:41

Emily

Yeah, there you go. Perfect. Yeah. So, looking at the information here, how how clear is it for how much you are currently owing in this pretend situation?

110

0:12:56

P8

Yeah, real clear, because it directly says your current balance. So

111

0:13:05

P8

yeah, that's really clear.

112

0:13:06

Emily

Okay. Any other information you would want to have on this page for seeing the overall, what the different debts are.

113

0:13:17

P8

No, I don't know how you make.

114

0:13:19

P8

There'd be more information.

115

0:13:23

Emily

Alright got it so we're just gonna look at the the top one, the post 9 11 Gi. Bill for housing and if you want to tap into that let me know what information would be important to you in regards to for this particular debt, just just for this topic. Yeah, there we go.

116

0:13:44

P8

Okay, here you do have a few days. That's

117

0:13:48

P8

yeah. Your balance in your due date is the most important for you in your transaction history.

118

0:13:57

P8

Oh, and it gives you like. I didn't know you get like keys in the game.

119

0:14:01

P8

It's good information.

120

0:14:10

P8

Oh, okay, yeah, that give you your letter. History.

121

0:14:13

Emily

It's pretty.

122

0:14:15

P8

Pretty, thorough.

123

0:14:18

Emily

Okay? Since you mentioned the the letter history. What? How? How useful is that to you? What what would you be using that for?

124

0:14:29

P8

I'll just remember it just reminded me of how they always notify me through letters, but.

125

0:14:33

Emily

Hmm.

126

0:14:34

P8

I know there's like a timeframe of when somebody get the letter that you have like 90 days, I think it is before where you can appeal it. So, just remembering that you have that timeframe is, or if you were to know that that deadline is there.

127

0:14:51

Emily

Okay.

128

0:14:52

P8

You know which date to go by for that.

129

0:14:56

Emily

Okay, would there be? So as I said, like knowing the date is important. Anything else in regards to the debt letter that you might want to know here.

130

0:15:04

P8

Now the most important thing is the date.

131

0:15:06

Emily

Okay, just the dates. Got it. And then

132

0:15:12

Emily

what? Yeah. And any other information that might be useful for you here for this particular debt.

133

0:15:20

P8

See

134

0:15:24

P8

maybe from when it was you actually like it, says the post. 9 11 Gi. Depth for housing, but it doesn't say for like which month that housing was either an overpayment

135

0:15:37

P8

or like for why it occurred, I mean

136

0:15:40

P8

oh, there's actually right there, I see. Why might I have some more information.

137

0:15:47

Emily

Okay, do you want? You want to tap on that and just see if if that would would be sufficient.

138

0:15:53

P8

Any common reasons to actually have the reason would be helpful to know

139

0:15:58

P8

well, why are you being charged this money for that month? But.

140

0:16:03

Emily

Hmm, okay.

141

0:16:06

Emily

So so you, you would want additional information. It sounds like.

142

0:16:16

Emily

would there? Would. Would there be more information? You would want.

143

0:16:20

P8

Yeah, which like for basically, which month I got, I'm being charged for.

144

0:16:27

Emily

Got it. Okay.

145

0:16:28

P8

That payment? Or if it's like, even when you go to like Co payments, what off? What appointment am I being charged that copayment for stuff like that that is usually found in the

146

0:16:39

P8

the letters that they send out to.

147

0:16:46

Emily

Okay, got it? And then so additional information it sounds like. And then what else would you expect or want to be able to do from here in regard to this particular debt.

148

0:17:02

P8

Nothing under here, I think, besides that, it's pretty good.

149

0:17:05

Emily

Okay, got it? And pretending that this is built in real life. And again, we'll kind of suspend relief because I believe belief, because I know you said you don't. You aren't currently using the app. But thoughts on, how likely you would use this

150

0:17:25

Emily

if it were were actually.

151

0:17:26

P8

No problem.

152

0:17:27

P8

Still, probably do it online, just through my computer, because I'm so used to doing it that way. There's

153

0:17:33

P8

no real need to change over, to now.

154

0:17:38

P8

But if I didn't have a computer, of course this would make a lot easier.

155

0:17:43

Emily

Sure. Yeah, sure got it. Okay? And

156

0:17:48

Emily

so I know you said that for the debts you've had, it's it's been. It's been taken out of your your benefits. How about if if let's say you had a debt where you you were actually making financial payments to the Va.

157

0:18:06

P8

I would like to know? Basically, like.

158

0:18:09

P8

when my payments do, what are the charges? I'm late on that payment. What happens if we miss a payment? Is there

159

0:18:17

P8

the Grace period, or anything like that?

160

0:18:20

P8

And then maybe, like, if I'm

161

0:18:23

P8

if I can set up in the automated automatic

162

0:18:27

P8

charge to my card to make those payments stuff like that.

163

0:18:31

P8

Okay? Got it helpful.

164

0:18:35

Emily

And then if you so since you talked, you talked about the being able to set up payments from your card, etc, knowing that you're that you're not seeing that here thoughts on again. How how likely it would be that that you would that you would use it.

165

0:18:55

P8

If it was, depends on if it was something that I can only do on the app, or if it's also available.

166

0:19:03

P8

like, if it's available online. I'm gonna do it, too.

167

0:19:08

Emily

Okay, so just depending, if you can do it on on your computer as well.

168

0:19:13

Emily

Okay. Alright, let me have you tap the the payments button on the lower right again. I'm gonna get you to a different section.

169

0:19:22

Emily

Alright scroll all the way down, and the the blank gray area toward the bottom. Tap that area once

170

0:19:32

Emily

all right perfect, and then go back into overpayment debts.

171

0:19:39

Emily

Okay? So again, we're going to look at this, this top debt from housing. We're going to pretend that

172

0:19:49

Emily

you believe that this debt is in error. You don't actually, either you don't think it should be this amount, or you don't think it should be there at all. What would be your next steps.

173

0:20:04

P8

I'd be probably going under review details.

174

0:20:08

Emily

Okay.

175

0:20:10

P8

Do you want me to click it?

176

0:20:11

Emily

Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you can go and tap in just to see what? Yeah, find the information here. And

177

0:20:16

Emily

if this will be sufficient.

178

0:20:26

P8

That's again. It doesn't give you the information. Why.

179

0:20:31

P8

oh, from like what month it was from so.

180

0:20:34

Emily

Okay. Yep.

181

0:20:35

P8

That'd be nice to have to clarify, while why I have to pay.

182

0:20:41

Emily

Sure.

183

0:20:46

Emily

And then thought, thoughts on what you do. If you believed that this was somehow in error, what what? Your next step would be.

184

0:20:55

P8

Ouch!

185

0:20:56

P8

Maybe you resolve that, but it's kind of request

186

0:21:01

P8

Oh, it's really not that clear on what you can do when you're here.

187

0:21:06

Emily

Okay, what do you think would make it more clear?

188

0:21:12

P8

Under the Request Help I see "dispute this debt." Having this on the main portion.

189

0:21:18

P8

The main portion after you click on it.

190

0:21:22

Emily

Oh, you mean like where it says, result.

191

0:21:26

P8

Yeah, under having underneath that, having an option for dispute, that'd be.

192

0:21:30

Emily

Got it. Okay to have it separate. Okay, alright. And then

193

0:21:37

Emily

and and same same question like, if let's say you, you were actually making payments, but didn't believed you didn't have the money

194

0:21:46

Emily

thoughts on on your next steps for that in in terms of

195

0:21:51

Emily

seeing if there could be other other arrangements for payment.

196

0:21:57

P8

Probably would be under resolve other ways to pay.

197

0:22:01

Emily

Okay.

198

0:22:05

P8

Oh, just pay by phone, pay by name, didn't really answer that. So

199

0:22:12

P8

know really what you can do besides calling and contacting them.

200

0:22:19

P8

So maybe if you have, like, an actual options

201

0:22:25

P8

under the resolved debt of John, help pain or request help

202

0:22:31

P8

in paying that, or something like that, I don't know if you don't have the money. What are you supposed to do.

203

0:22:37

Emily

Got it. Okay, yeah. Let me have you actually tap back into that resolved debt section that you were just there? Yeah. And then tap on the request help?

204

0:22:52

Emily

See? You?

205

0:22:54

Emily

Yeah. And and okay, yeah.

206

0:22:55

Emily

any thoughts on on how to make that clear? Since it seems like it was, it was not clear that that's where you might go to get this information.

207

0:23:07

P8

Springing the debt row

208

0:23:11

P8

into here, and it says, request that kind of gives you makes you think that it's like

209

0:23:17

P8

asking for help in using the app itself, requesting help with the payment.

210

0:23:26

Emily

Got it? Okay? Alright. So.

211

0:23:28

P8

Moving it to the front wouldn't help.

212

0:23:33

Emily

Alright, and then once, if you can tap the the request, help once more thoughts on the different sections that that, it's offering, under request, help in in terms of clarity.

213

0:23:52

P8

Dispute is the what we were talking about earlier.

214

0:23:57

P8

Oh, this is clear and simple. I like this.

215

0:24:03

Emily

Okay, got it

216

0:24:04

Emily

and let me have you scroll down. Just tap on. I think it was the second one under the start. Your debt dispute.

217

0:24:14

Emily

Just have a curious to get your thoughts on that.

218

0:24:20

Emily

I'm sorry. Start your request for debt help. Sorry I misspoke.

219

0:24:25

Emily

Yeah. And just I'm not gonna have you read everything, and of course, but have a look through here and give over overall thoughts on the information provided here.

220

0:24:38

P8

That tap. 2 things.

221

0:24:44

P8

What else?

222

0:24:49

P8

We're kind of a starting.

223

0:24:54

Emily

Yeah. Yeah.

224

0:24:56

Emily

Yeah. The the start. Your request for dead help.

225

0:25:08

Emily

Yeah. Tha thoughts on the information.

226

0:25:11

Emily

Please go ahead.

227

0:25:14

P8

Just brings you to the form that you need to fill out.

228

0:25:18

P8

Events.

229

0:25:20

P8

you know, even Pre fills information for you. So that's actually pretty nice and simple, and start your dispute.

230

0:25:27

P8

It's hopeful.

231

0:25:29

Emily

Alright great! Let me have you tap on. Done there, please.

232

0:25:36

Emily

Okay, and then, we're gonna pretend that you are ready to make a payment. Walk me through. How you would do that here.

233

0:25:54

P8

Resolve that.

234

0:25:56

Emily

Okay.

235

0:25:57

P8

Pay online.

236

0:26:06

P8

It looks like this just brings you to Va website, though. So you can't really pay it inside the app. I'm guessing.

237

0:26:14

Emily

Hmm, okay. Yeah. Thoughts. Yeah. Let me let me have you. Again. I will not. I promise I will not have you enter any actual payment information? But go ahead and and tap on the that. That pay button.

238

0:26:37

P8

Okay. So this is basically just bringing back into the Internet site. So

239

0:26:42

P8

it'd be nice to be able to do it through the app itself. Because I guess now, I'm gonna have to log into my

240

0:26:50

P8

log, actually, log into my login.gov account kind of mix to

241

0:26:57

P8

makes it pointless to even use the app. If you have to go online. In the 1st place.

242

0:27:03

Emily

Let me have you tap the the button that says pay online. There's 1 there's there's 1 at the top there, on the upper left.

243

0:27:13

Emily

just to get to the next page.

244

0:27:17

Emily

and then scroll down a little bit again. I know there's a lot to read, so I won't have you read everything, and I'm not going to have you actually enter any information in but scroll down a little bit more.

245

0:27:29

Emily

Yeah. So the so the section where you would have to enter the information here, thoughts on the process here

246

0:27:39

Emily

in terms of if you are actually making a payment.

247

0:27:45

P8

So.

248

0:27:47

P8

It's all of the information that

249

0:27:49

P8

I've never done it before. I didn't know you needed like that

250

0:27:52

P8

payee number and all that. I guess that's on the letter that they send you

251

0:27:57

P8

kind of makes it seem a little bit more complicated than it needs to be.

252

0:28:01

Emily

Oh, got it

253

0:28:02

P8

Just be able to put in your card number on the app and make a payment.

254

0:28:08

Emily

Okay.

255

0:28:09

P8

It's the government. So I guess everything gets complicated.

256

0:28:15

Emily

Got it. Thoughts on. Let's say, if you were to doing this in real life, what would you be doing to find all of the required information that they have here.

257

0:28:28

P8

It's on my letter. That's another good point about what I said in beginning on having an email sent to you.

258

0:28:35

P8

Because what if I had accidentally threw out my letter. I can get that payee number is what they're asking for.

259

0:28:45

P8

The deduction code. I don't even know all that means, but

260

0:28:50

P8

so if I don't have my letter and kind of out of luck.

261

0:28:53

Emily

I see. Okay, yeah. Let me have you switch back to the figma app right now.

262

0:29:07

Emily

See? I mean, oh, okay, let's see if it brings it back to where we were.

263

0:29:13

P8

Probably shouldn't just hit that.

264

0:29:16

Emily

I give it just a moment to load.

265

0:29:20

P8

Okay.

266

0:29:22

Emily

Okay, and then tap on payments to walk you through getting to specifically where we were. Yeah. So go ahead and tap on the payments, button on the lower right.

267

0:29:33

Emily

Yep, and then scroll down and again tap once into that blank gray area at the toward the bottom.

268

0:29:41

Emily

Okay, and then tap on overpayment debts.

269

0:29:45

Emily

It's just getting us back to where you were.

270

0:29:48

Emily

Yep and yeah, again to review details. We're gonna look at that top one again

271

0:29:58

Emily

and resolve debt and go to pay online. This is just getting us back to where you would have been because the prototype kicked us out. Unfortunately, so, thoughts on this information being shared

272

0:30:15

Emily

on the app.

273

0:30:18

P8

Information is.

274

0:30:20

P8

Oh, okay, this is actually helpful. Because on the pay online thing was asking for like that payee number. And then the deduction code

275

0:30:30

P8

that they required a letter having that here makes it

276

0:30:34

P8

see? I don't need to go hunting for my letter to fill it out. So that's nice to have on here.

277

0:30:40

Emily

Okay, great thoughts on how? This could be even more clear in in terms of notifying you that the information is here to pay online.

278

0:30:55

P8

Yeah, I don't know how you make it more clear than listing it out like they do.

279

0:31:01

Emily

okay? And what might if if you were making a payment on the phone what might be your process to getting the information that you that you need into the the government website to pay.

280

0:31:17

P8

Either finding the letter, or if I'm doing on the phone, I can go into this app. And right here, give me all the information I need. It looks like.

281

0:31:27

Emily

Okay? And then thoughts on switching between the apps between. In this case, our fake va app, and then the

282

0:31:37

Emily

payment site.

283

0:31:40

P8

Nice to have it all rather than having to switch between things like that.

284

0:31:48

Emily

If if if it's app, oh, sorry! Go ahead.

285

0:31:51

P8

But I mean, it's

286

0:31:53

P8

it's simple. It's gives you the direct link to click on so can't really make it simpler.

287

0:32:00

P8

more clear than that, I guess. Besides having your own one.

288

0:32:05

Emily

Okay, got it? And if if things were built in real life with like this, this payment process here

289

0:32:15

Emily

again, knowing I know you know you don't actually use the app at least right now. Thoughts on how likely it would be that you might use it for this.

290

0:32:25

P8

And might use it for this. When I, after finding out that you need this information for the payment.

291

0:32:32

P8

I'm not prepared to have to dig around to find the letter I might have throughout the weather efficiently. So

292

0:32:38

P8

having the information right here mixed with that, okay, got it.

293

0:32:44

Emily

Okay? And then, compare for me the likelihood of you of using the app in this scenario, where it does have the payment option versus the other scenario, where there was no payment. Option.

294

0:33:01

P8

This I more likely use it where you can pay.

295

0:33:04

Emily

Rather than not having that option.

296

0:33:07

P8

Having it as well.

297

0:33:10

Emily

Alright got it, and thoughts are how? How would you?

298

0:33:15

Emily

Because it is 2 different applications. How do you believe you would? You would get the information, let's say, like the file number, for example, from the app over to the payment site.

299

0:33:30

P8

Well, I think it opens that up in new window, or right now it doesn't because we got kicked out.

300

0:33:39

P8

So.

301

0:33:39

P8

No, I would need mine. I wouldn't

302

0:33:43

P8

maybe having it to where it pops up in a separate window rather than it. Taking away this screen that I'm looking at right now and then, after I click on the

303

0:33:55

P8

the va.gov site like being able. Seems like you can't switch back after you click.

304

0:34:02

Emily

Hmm.

305

0:34:04

P8

Or she.

306

0:34:06

Emily

Okay. Yeah, I mean, pretend. But there, there, there would be 2 different applications. I mean, I'm just wondering what what you believe your process would be in order to, let's say, put them the file number

307

0:34:18

Emily

over into the the payment site.

308

0:34:23

P8

Does this allow copy?

309

0:34:25

P8

This won't allow you to copy, it doesn't look like, so I guess I'd have to write it down.

310

0:34:30

Emily

Got it. Okay.

311

0:34:31

P8

Just switch back and forth.

312

0:34:34

P8

That I'd probably write it down.

313

0:34:36

Emily

Oh, oh, oh, you would. You would write it down first.st

314

0:34:40

Emily

Got it? Okay?

315

0:34:42

Emily

And yeah. Any any other thoughts on on that experience. Of like you said you having to write it down and then switching applications to make payments.

316

0:34:58

P8

Maybe if there's under where it says, Pay this debt online, maybe there's a little

317

0:35:05

P8

description saying you're gonna need this information for your payment

318

0:35:11

P8

like just telling you that you should write it down if you don't have the letter with the file number, and just something to remind you that you're gonna need it.

319

0:35:19

Emily

Okay. On this page or on on a previous screen?

320

0:34:56

P8

On this page.

321

0:35:25

Emily

Got it. Okay, what what do you think would be would be useful to have.

322

0:35:29

P8

Let me just saying, like

323

0:35:32

P8

when you make your payment, you're going to need your file number and payee number.

324

0:35:39

P8

Little reminder on this screen that you're gonna need this information before you leave the screen.

325

0:35:45

Emily

Okay, before, yeah. Wh. What do you think would make that more clear than than what is written here?

326

0:35:51

P8

Oh, well, there's nothing here that tells you that you're gonna need this.

327

0:35:56

P8

You all right, you'll need to provide the following details. Okay, I maybe just saying

328

0:36:06

P8

I guess they do explain it.

329

0:36:09

P8

But kind of it doesn't tell you that once you click on the pay on pay.va.gov

330

0:36:15

P8

thing that's gonna take this information away from you.

331

0:36:19

Emily

Hmm, okay.

332

0:36:20

P8

Maybe being able to copy it.

333

0:36:22

P8

It doesn't let you trying to do like a copy and paste with my.

334

0:36:28

Emily

Okay, but it won't let me

335

0:36:31

Emily

got it. Okay, and then any other thoughts, I actually wanna hit the the back link at the top left there

336

0:36:43

Emily

any any other thoughts regarding this.

337

0:36:47

Emily

the screens here, the payment score, the payment information screens? That might make things more useful.

338

0:36:55

P8

That's nice and clear and concise.

339

0:36:58

Emily

Okay, great, and let me have you tap on the payment section again on the lower right.

340

0:37:06

Emily

I'm gonna go through there we go. So I know you said in in real life you don't pay. You don't pay any copays in this, but in this pretends situation you will. So I have a couple of questions here, let me have you tap into copays toward the bottom there first, st

341

0:37:26

Emily

and then thoughts here overall on what information would be important to you in regards to any sort of Copay bills.

342

0:37:40

P8

This is pretty clear, and it tells you which clinic it's from, or give you review details, so

343

0:37:50

P8

I don't know how you can make it any better than it is here.

344

0:37:54

Emily

Okay, got it? And let's look at this this, that top one, the James A. Haley hospital.

345

0:38:01

Emily

In terms of any any information you would need in regards to this particular Copay Bill.

346

0:38:10

P8

Okay.

347

0:38:16

P8

due date.

348

0:38:23

P8

Zoom, it looks like I've never done it before, so I'm not sure what else you would.

349

0:38:30

Emily

Okay, got it all right.

350

0:38:33

Emily

And are there? Are there any instances where you receive statements? And that doesn't have to be with with Va. Just with any sort of other other account. You might have that where you receive statements, statements.

351

0:38:48

P8

Oh, yeah, I get all my like, my bank statements, my credit, card statements, everything comes online.

352

0:38:54

Emily

Okay, got it? And what like overall? Are you using those? How are you using those? If so.

353

0:39:02

P8

They just stay in my inbox, something that I need to dispute on. I don't even look at them.

354

0:39:11

Emily

Okay, you're you're only looking. If you if you need to check something.

355

0:39:15

P8

Yeah.

356

0:39:16

Emily

Got it. Okay?

357

0:39:18

Emily

So pretending again, jumping, pretending that you do have copays thoughts on potentially using the statements here.

358

0:39:29

P8

I mean, if I had Copays, if I ever needed

359

0:39:33

P8

needed to dispute something that they're trying to charge me for, or anything like that I need to like having the statements here would be very helpful.

360

0:39:43

Emily

Hmm. Okay.

361

0:39:46

Emily

Do you know what you might do with the statement? Exactly. I know you said you. You'd want you'd want to have them if you have to dispute anything. Yeah, what what might you do with them?

362

0:39:54

P8

Just in case, just in case like having

363

0:39:58

P8

having them there. I mean, you don't know if you need to dispute them until you actually see the statement. So.

364

0:40:04

Emily

Okay, and let me have you open up the statement to see what this looks like. Here.

365

0:40:12

P8

The Pdf, so the current statement.

366

0:40:16

Emily

Yep.

367

0:40:23

Emily

yeah. Thoughts on how how useful it would be to have this in the app here.

368

0:40:31

P8

Mean the same thing just

369

0:40:34

P8

nice to actually, it's basically looks like just a scan version of your paper when they send you.

370

0:40:40

Emily

Okay.

371

0:40:41

P8

So it's nicer than having the paper one.

372

0:40:44

Emily

Okay. Yeah.

373

0:40:45

P8

Easier to keep track of.

374

0:40:46

Emily

You're not gonna throw it out. So on accident.

375

0:40:51

Emily

Okay? Well, there, since you said it's easier to keep track of anything anything you'd want to do in regards to keeping track of the statements.

376

0:41:00

P8

Like, I said, in case you have to dispute something, or if there was an overcharge or anything like that.

377

0:41:09

Emily

Okay, let me have you click done there?

378

0:41:14

Emily

So as a sense you brought up. If there's something that you wanted to, that you needed to dispute what would be your process for dispute, for, for starting to dispute.

379

0:41:29

P8

I can't see anything here.

380

0:41:31

P8

Maybe on your paid bill.

381

0:41:33

P8

Okay.

382

0:41:37

P8

we'll just

383

0:41:42

P8

oh, request help!

384

0:41:52

P8

It looks like it's giving me an option.

385

0:41:57

Emily

What what sort of information would you be looking for?

386

0:42:04

P8

like how it kind of was under the overpayments where you can actually go into a section like there was a dispute option under the blue pay bill

387

0:42:15

P8

right here, but it's not giving any options at all for that. So they have something something there.

388

0:42:26

Emily

Okay, let me have you. Yeah, let me close that

389

0:42:31

Emily

and then tap on the the help section on the upper right.

390

0:42:39

Emily

Yeah. Thoughts on the information presented here, and how useful that might be.

391

0:42:45

P8

This helps with that most of the time when you see a hope option in the upper right, you're thinking, like me. Personally, I think that that's more

392

0:42:55

P8

help using the app. Not actually help with your copays.

393

0:42:59

Emily

Okay, got it?

394

0:43:00

P8

So that's where that can get a little bit confusing.

395

0:43:05

P8

Let me talk to her.

396

0:43:07

P8

Do you have like a you see how it says Copay. Help at the top. Do you have that as an actual option to click on rather than just under help.

397

0:43:16

Emily

Okay, so that's under the main screen.

398

0:43:19

Emily

Okay? So so labeled as Copay help instead of just help.

399

0:43:23

P8

Exactly.

400

0:43:24

Emily

Got it. Okay, that makes sense.

401

0:43:26

Emily

And then, we're gonna pretend that you are ready to make a payment here for this one walk me through your process to make a payment, and again, it won't have you enter in any actual information.

402

0:43:41

P8

Pay bill, and then we probably do the thing on, save out there the same way that

403

0:43:49

P8

as we did for the overpayment.

404

0:43:52

Emily

Okay, let me let me have you go ahead and and tap on that.

405

0:44:00

Emily

and scroll down and tap on. Continue to the form in the middle of the page.

406

0:44:08

Emily

Yep, yeah, I can do. There we go

407

0:44:11

Emily

and then scroll down a little bit. Just gonna have you skip most of this? Oh, yeah. So right here. So just a little bit above.

408

0:44:21

Emily

Yeah, right there. So yeah. Thoughts on finding finding the information here, the the account number and how you might go about that.

409

0:44:32

P8

I would probably click on. Where do I find my Va. Account? Number.

410

0:44:37

Emily

Okay, got it. Let me have you switch back to the figma app.

411

0:44:44

P8

How can I switch? If I hit the X will.

412

0:44:47

Emily

Oh, sorry I switch switch applications within the phone. Go back to Figma instead of the browser that you're in right now. Yep, yep, exactly.

413

0:44:56

Emily

Yep, right here

414

0:44:58

Emily

and let's see, yeah. Tap it like likes to just kick us out of things which is annoying.

415

0:45:06

Emily

Alright, let that go.

416

0:45:09

Emily

Let that load up a bit.

417

0:45:13

Emily

Okay scroll and tap payments on the lower right. I'm gonna get you back to exactly where we were.

418

0:45:20

Emily

Tap on. Sorry I'm sorry. Go back one screen, go to the back to the payments, page.

419

0:45:26

Emily

yep, and then scroll down and tap into the blank gray area at the very yep perfect tap on co-pays.

420

0:45:35

Emily

and again go into the review details here.

421

0:45:43

Emily

Alright. And then so yeah, so thought again. So this would be where you would actually get get back. But thoughts on finding the information you would need here for.

422

0:45:54

P8

The copy option here if they didn't have that for the overpayment. But having that here is very helpful where you can click on it and copies your account. Number.

423

0:46:06

Emily

Okay? Great.

424

0:46:10

Emily

Okay?

425

0:46:11

Emily

And let me see.

426

0:46:16

Emily

Hi, other other thoughts to share regarding anything you're seeing here with the co-pays. Any information that might also be useful.

427

0:46:32

P8

Yeah, no units.

428

0:46:35

P8

Nice and simple. I like it.

429

0:46:37

Emily

Alright simple is good.

430

0:46:39

Emily

And then any thoughts specifically how things are labeled. If there's anything else that would make things more clear. I know you, said the help button. It would be more helpful if it said Copay. Help. But yeah, any other sections that might be

431

0:46:54

Emily

rename that make things more clear.

432

0:46:59

P8

I've never really done Copays before, so I don't know how much more you would need. Besides, this

433

0:47:04

P8

so looks looks good.

434

0:47:07

Emily

Alright got it all right, and I believe those are all my questions. I'm gonna check in with my colleagues. If anyone has any additional questions that I have not covered here. I don't see anything in the chat, but if anyone wants to unmute and ask, you may do so now.

435

0:47:34

Emily

all right, I'll take that as a no, but that is all we have. I really appreciate your time, Brandon. It's always so important to have to talk with veterans about going through these experiences to see what is important, and see how we can potentially make things better for everybody. So thank you for taking the time with us.

436

0:47:57

P8

Yeah, of course.

437

0:47:58

Emily

Yeah, and I know will be reaching out to you shortly. I don't know. At some point, at some point they'll be reaching out to you regarding this. And yeah, that is it for us today. And I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

438

0:48:15

P8

Thank you. Have a good one.

439

0:48:16

Emily

Thanks! Take care!

## P9 Transcript

1

0:00:02

Emily

Ask you yet again. So now that we are recording, are you okay? If I record video and audio today.

2

0:00:09

P9

That's fine!

3

0:00:10

Emily

Alright great. And are you okay? If we potentially use a clip the clips of this to show our Va partners.

4

0:00:18

P9

That's fine!

5

0:00:19

Emily

Alright great. Okay. So just general questions. Love to know a bit about yourself, and whatever you are, comfortable, sharing as a veteran what branch you served in, if you, when you retired or separated.

6

0:00:35

P9

Yeah, I actually I served in the [redacted] from 2,006, 2,010. And then after that, I decided to separate and go to college instead. And then, after I worked for the [redacted] as I started there. Well, I've had different positions prior to that, like from a

7

0:00:58

P9

out like private sector. But pretty much like in the software, tech tech side of things. Just put it that way.

8

0:01:06

Emily

Okay. Good.

9

0:01:06

P9

So it's working like a [redacted]

10

0:01:12

P9

But yeah.

11

0:01:13

Emily

Okay, great. And then what sort of experience have you had? With Va.

12

0:01:21

P9

So I had, like I had

13

0:01:23

P9

couple of surgeries from the Va. And yeah, I've I've used

14

0:01:30

P9

Yep, prescription medications. Psychiatrists, I believe.

15

0:01:38

P9

They? Oh, no, for Va they they sourced it out. It's not a it's not a Va's

16

0:01:45

P9

psychiatrists. It's a they

17

0:01:47

P9

sourced it out so like outside, I think, is what they did. And then they just they just paid for it. And then, yeah, so like, I, I use va like here and there when I can.

18

0:01:57

P9

1st like, for things that are not like very, very urgent that I need like tomorrow, you know, like urgent care if I would just go to like my my doctor for those kind of things, but otherwise, like I try to use it, since it's free.

19

0:02:12

Emily

Okay, yeah. Got it? And then, what sort of experience have you had with the Va website? And or the mobile app.

20

0:02:21

P9

I used to use just the website, because I didn't like clogging my phone with like apps and stuff like that. So that's why, like, I didn't have fig figma on my phone. That's why I was using my ipad earlier, because where I had my

21

0:02:34

P9

figma, but but lately, probably in the past year or so, because I've done a number of

22

0:02:42

P9

meetings with with prison technologies. And then I use the Va app to you know, to do some testing, so I figured like I might as well just keep it there. So whenever I and then since then I use it for let's say I wanna request for refill for

23

0:03:00

P9

medication or I believe I did set up an appointment through there one time. But I'm just so used to like doing it in the website that sometimes I'm most of the time on my computer, anyway. So I just, I would just go to like Va

24

0:03:14

P9

back over. I forgot the website exactly. It's in my bookmark. I just do it through there. But otherwise, I just kept the app in my on my phone for like quick things. So if I'm not around my my computer, I just use the app.

25

0:03:27

Emily

Okay. Alright. So if you're if you're not close to your computer and any other reasons you might choose to use the app over your computer.

26

0:03:36

P9

just for mobility, I guess. Yeah, if I'm just not around there, because, like, if I'm on my workstation, I'm also I'm over there like, you know, I don't usually like when I work. I don't.

27

0:03:47

P9

I have my phone like

28

0:03:49

P9

away so that I don't get distracted. So that's why like I use my my, yeah, my workstation like you know, for everything else.

29

0:03:59

Emily

Got it. Okay, great, all right. So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion. So I want to make sure that you're only sharing what you're willing. I have no additional info, or I have no information whatsoever about any sort of finances for you. So any, let's know any experience. Have you had experience with owing the Va. Money such as for benefit overpayments.

30

0:04:25

P9

There is

31

0:04:27

P9

a co-pay couple of years ago, and there's 1, i believe, last year. Think last year, not too long ago, say that

32

0:04:35

P9

there was a copay, but I end it ended up getting I believe they're getting

33

0:04:41

P9

nulled, or yeah, I ended up not paying for it. I talked to him about it. I forgot where it was. But I had like a physical mail in letter, for it.

34

0:04:51

Emily

Oh, God, okay. So it was. It was for this Copay.

35

0:04:54

P9

Ye, yeah. And then I called the Va. About it. I I did it through the phone, and then it was I believe it was for my heel, because I did my

36

0:05:03

P9

my Achilles. And then, since they they tore my Achilles and not like completely. But it was like almost completely ruptured. But

37

0:05:12

P9

They.

38

0:05:14

P9

since they couldn't get the appointment, for in the next 30 days I they had to go outside. I believe it was for that.

39

0:05:22

P9

And then I called the Va. About it. Because they got the letter. And they told them, Yeah, it's supposed to be like for free.

40

0:05:30

Emily

Oh, God, okay, alright! So outside of that, it sounds like you. You have not received Copays or or have there other vendors.

41

0:05:36

P9

Have

42

0:05:38

P9

a while ago from one of my prescription, but had since stopped taking my my prescription, for, like antidepressant anti-anxiety. It's kinda like, you know.

43

0:05:49

P9

didn't want to take any of that anymore. So like, that's that's where I receive A click.

44

0:05:56

Emily

Okay, got it.

45

0:05:57

Emily

And is that you said you had received a letter any other way, that you were given information about these past copays.

46

0:06:07

P9

No, it was just a letter that I saw. It was a mail in letter, and there was one more letter asking me. I don't know if this is

47

0:06:16

P9

in relate in relation to my vam

48

0:06:20

P9

what it could benefits. But it's asking me if I use the Va. I believe it was last March.

49

0:06:27

P9

because there's like a bill. I was like, I use my doctor for that, so I don't know how I re. I remember the date, but I got a Va. Letter saying that

50

0:06:37

P9

this is not a bill, but you know it's like a charge.

51

0:06:40

Emily

Oh, okay.

52

0:06:40

P9

Saying that

53

0:06:42

P9

you know, if you use the Va. I was like, no, I use my regular doctor, so I don't know how we'd go through. Va, so I was kind of confused. But yeah, get it.

54

0:06:52

Emily

Okay, and it sounds.

55

0:06:54

P9

It says it's not a bill, but it was like a a bill. It it's not billed to me, but it's just like there's a charge, so I don't.

56

0:07:01

Emily

Okay. Yeah.

57

0:07:02

P9

Confusing.

58

0:07:03

Emily

Yep, that makes sense. I'd be confused, too, as well.

59

0:07:06

Emily

Okay. So it's it sounds like and correct me if I'm wrong that you haven't actually paid any of these co-pays that were sent to you. They were like they were all in error. Is that right?

60

0:07:18

P9

It was, I paid the the copay for the medication that I used to take.

61

0:07:21

Emily

Got it? Okay.

62

0:07:23

Emily

all right. And do you so for that medication, Copay, what? How? How did you know when you needed to make a payment, and what was what was prompting you to make those payments.

63

0:07:34

P9

I got a fiscal letter.

64

0:07:36

Emily

Okay.

65

0:07:38

P9

Through the mail.

66

0:07:40

Emily

Okay, and outside the the one confusion that you certainly mentioned. Anything else, that might be made easier in regards to these copay notifications.

67

0:07:55

P9

I would say an email would be easier. Because

68

0:08:00

P9

like, I said, I didn't start using the app up until like last year, because I was kept on re downloading it to do these these appointments. So I figured just

69

0:08:09

P9

I just you know, download it. I know there's like notifications on there. But like I have all notifications turned off on my phone like I said, like, I know, you have my phone when I work. So like, I'm not gonna get that. So like, usually, I get a lot of my, I prefer like email notification, because you have like a set time to check my emails. And then I go through. Then I see my emails. But as far, no notifications to have.

70

0:08:34

P9

even if I have the Va app right now, all of my notification on my phone. They're just all turned off because they get like distracted so easy. Nothing will. Yeah, not even like a a text message is like, off also. So like, yeah. So I would say, email would be good. But physical mail is also works. But

71

0:08:56

P9

you know, I don't know, like, sometimes, like fiscal mail could be lost. So I could. Yeah.

72

0:09:04

P9

But yeah, I've never got an email bill from the Va. Not that I.

73

0:09:09

Emily

Got it, and then what has been your method for paying these these pre previous co-pays?

74

0:09:16

P9

So usually when I see, like, you know, the Physical Mail, it says, like, go to website a call, I'll just call them. Since I already have it right there.

75

0:09:25

Emily

Yeah, okay, alright, and let me go. Have you go ahead and share your screen?

76

0:09:33

P9

Okay, on my phone. Let me see.

77

0:09:35

Emily

Okay.

78

0:09:39

P9

Okay.

79

0:09:43

P9

Scott. Rocket.

80

0:09:49

Emily

Alright! There we go, perfect and let me have you open up the figma app, and I'm gonna give you a a login to use.

81

0:09:59

Emily

Okay, go ahead and log in.

82

0:10:08

Emily

Okay, so the email that you'll use is VA test 0 0 0@gmail.com.

83

0:10:24

Emily

And the password is gonna be 8 characters. Va repeated 4 times. So Va, all lowercase.

84

0:10:36

Emily

okay? And then I'm gonna get you an authentication code. Give me just a moment.

85

0:10:44

Emily

There we go. Okay, so the code will be 4, 9, 5, 1 0 0 8.

86

0:10:54

Emily

Okay, go ahead and log in.

87

0:11:00

Emily

Okay, continue with the app. And I'm gonna get you a link in just a moment.

88

0:11:06

Emily

Alright, so no need no click on anything quite yet. Let me

89

0:11:11

Emily

I'm gonna send you the link through zoom. So you should see in your zoom chat the link.

90

0:11:28

P9

Do I stop sharing first.st

91

0:11:30

Emily

So just tap in the middle, and at the bottom you should see. Yeah.

92

0:11:34

P9

Oh, I see. Okay.

93

0:11:35

Emily

Yep, there we go so tap in the extra long link there, and if you wanna swipe my image off to the right, then you don't need to

94

0:11:43

Emily

see me. There we go. All right. Give it just a moment

95

0:12:03

Emily

hopefully. This works. Sometimes it's a little on the slower side.

96

0:12:10

Emily

Alright. This seems promising.

97

0:12:14

Emily

Alright. So here we have your pretend app home screen. Here. You can tap outside just anywhere outside of the the little help. There we go perfect. So without I'm not going to have you tap anything quite yet, but from looking around here you can scroll as much as you want. Where would you expect to find these copays that you might owe in this if you were on the app.

98

0:12:40

P9

Payments.

99

0:12:41

Emily

Okay?

100

0:12:43

Emily

Great. And yeah, thoughts on in this. In this scenario, we're going to pretend that you also have overpayment. That's in addition to copays. But thought actually, well, 1st you clearly went straight to payments thoughts on the title of that. Would anything be more clear.

101

0:13:05

P9

No, it literally just says co-pays right there. So it's it's pretty straightforward, you know, unless you don't know what that means.

102

0:13:15

P9

yeah, and overpayment and debts like that's pretty much, you know, outstanding due or same thing. Overpayment debts.

103

0:13:24

P9

it's kind of is that a for overpayment desk.

104

0:13:31

P9

Does that mean like the Va. Overpaid you, and you have to pay them back.

105

0:13:35

Emily

That was exactly what I mean. Yes, yep.

106

0:13:37

P9

Okay, okay, just making sure.

107

0:13:39

Emily

Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah. And how about? Okay? So it looks like the things are pretty clear here on this page. How about the specifically the word payments on the bottom right where you would originally tapped. I know you went straight there to find.

108

0:13:57

P9

Yeah.

109

0:13:58

Emily

Yeah, any thoughts on. If that could be even even more clear in terms of where you would find the co-pays.

110

0:14:05

P9

No, actually, that was that was very clear. That's without even like, you know. As soon as you I logged in here

111

0:14:14

P9

when you asked me like, Where would you find your your copays like? That's the 1st thing that came to my mind, like the under payments, because, you know. That's that's where I would expect it to be. That's a that's a very, very clear right there.

112

0:14:27

Emily

Great, all right.

113

0:14:29

Emily

And then thoughts on what information you want might want to see. So like right now, there's a bit of info under both overpayment debts and copays

114

0:14:40

Emily

any thoughts on what would be important to see as a really high level. When you open up this page.

115

0:14:49

P9

Let me see here

116

0:14:54

P9

history, direct deposit.

117

0:15:04

P9

I would maybe not necessary. But

118

0:15:09

P9

your va debt and bills. No, no, actually, that's that's that's right, because you're the one paying I was. I was thinking something else.

119

0:15:17

Emily

Okay.

120

0:15:18

P9

No, I was, I would say, that's that's that's fine right there, because it clearly says, like what you need to pay at the bottom right there, the bottom 2.

121

0:15:27

P9

I was thinking like I was looking for like something that

122

0:15:34

P9

What's that?

123

0:15:37

P9

If I click on one of these like it'll show me the okay, the what they're for.

124

0:15:49

P9

Okay. Now that

125

0:15:50

P9

that looks that looks good because, like these 2 are bundled together, the overpayment it does because those are the. Those are the things that you need to pay, and it it separates the the co-pays with your actual overpayment. That Va

126

0:16:04

P9

that you know that that paid you.

127

0:16:08

P9

Question for these like for over payments? When would be like A, How would that

128

0:16:17

P9

work with a BA Va like they overpaid you.

129

0:16:21

Emily

Yeah.

130

0:16:22

P9

Is your doctor, or.

131

0:16:24

Emily

No, it's not good. I don't. I haven't heard that example. For what example I've heard is if you were signed up for some classes, and then for some reason, had to drop a class, but had already already received the money to take that class. That would be.

132

0:16:39

P9

Okay.

133

0:16:40

Emily

That would be an example of an overpayment.

134

0:16:43

P9

Gotcha. Okay, okay? Got it? No, I think this this this looks good because you have the the co-pays and then and the overpayments separated. So like, you know, exactly like where to go. And if you want to prioritize one or the other, you know.

135

0:16:58

Emily

Okay, great. So for the the co-pays, let me have you tap into that and see about the information presented. And just what you feel would be important for you to know, for the co-pays here.

136

0:17:17

P9

So this one says you have submitted.

137

0:17:25

P9

So for the middle 1, $200, I noticed that

138

0:17:33

P9

these 2, the top and the bottom. It says like

139

0:17:37

P9

when you paid it, and when when it's due.

140

0:17:42

P9

Just wondering why the middle one doesn't say that.

141

0:17:45

Emily

Okay, so is that I'll take from that that you you'd want to know more information on. Why, it says to call instead of.

142

0:17:53

P9

Yeah.

143

0:17:54

Emily

Okay, got it any other?

144

0:17:58

Emily

Because if if I was like, you know, if I had like a.

145

0:18:01

P9

One thing that I would prioritize if if it was me was to have to see exactly when I need to pay it by, you know, like, let's just say like

146

0:18:11

P9

like, I'm 1 of those people like.

147

0:18:13

P9

oh, I have time. I like kind of like procrastinate, even though like debate right now. But I still wanna see, like, you know.

148

0:18:21

P9

right away when when it's gonna be due. So that

149

0:18:25

P9

yeah. So that's 1 of those things.

150

0:18:28

P9

And yeah, for this one. For example.

151

0:18:31

P9

the very bottom says payment submitted.

152

0:18:35

P9

Oh, that's a 0.

153

0:18:36

P9

Okay, so that one's already done right, so there's no balance. So I would say, this one is not necessary then, if it's already

154

0:18:46

P9

paid off it, it should be under like payment history, or something like that which I believe I saw on the previous page.

155

0:18:52

Emily

So you you wouldn't even want to see it right here.

156

0:18:55

P9

No, because like when I click on these, because I would think that when I click on on the the payments,

157

0:19:04

P9

the copays, I would think that these are the ones that are outstanding, not the ones that are, you know... because, like over here. If I go back.

158

0:19:14

P9

I got VA payment history. That's that's where I would think that would go.

159

0:19:18

Emily

Okay, got it. Okay.

160

0:19:19

P9

Yeah.

161

0:19:20

Emily

Okay, yeah. So back into Copays perfect. So looking at that top one, the James A. Haley veteran hospital. What information would you need to know for this one here.

162

0:19:35

P9

So this one is actually perfect right here, like as it is. And then you could review the details because it tells you exactly what you

163

0:19:41

P9

what you need to pay, how much you need to pay. And well, it tells you how much you need to pay, and then, when you need to pay it by. Those are the 2 important

164

0:19:52

P9

or 2 important details right away that I want to see if if it was, you know, if I was looking at something, and then I could go and review details and what it's for, you know.

165

0:20:01

Emily

Okay.

166

0:20:02

Emily

Yeah. Oh, yeah. If you want to go.

167

0:20:04

P9

Right away. What what I want to see is these 2 go ahead.

168

0:20:09

Emily

Yeah, so is that.

169

0:20:10

P9

And then.

170

0:20:10

Emily

Not on this. Hmm.

171

0:20:12

P9

This page. Let me just take a look at it.

172

0:20:17

P9

Script balance 50.

173

0:20:25

P9

Yeah. So this one has a breakdown of everything.

174

0:20:29

P9

But what is this at the bottom?

175

0:20:38

P9

Okay, so this tells me, since it's $50, I have to pay the 1, 2, 3

176

0:20:47

P9

for the 1st 4 is pretty much the breakdown of the $50.

177

0:20:51

Emily

But.

178

0:20:53

P9

This the ones that you've paid already.

179

0:21:01

P9

Okay, so what I'm getting out of this is

180

0:21:05

P9

This is for for pretty much like one let's just say

181

0:21:15

P9

what's the word I'm looking for

182

0:21:18

P9

service. Let's just say like for let's just say this is for your knee, right like, because I have a lot of knee issues for Va, this for my right knee. Let's just put it that way. So these are all the these are all the the co-pays and

183

0:21:32

P9

and past past payments for my right knee.

184

0:21:36

P9

That's just, you know, kind of like you saying it's an example, because I see, like a payment of $45 right here.

185

0:21:42

Emily

Oh, okay, so, so grouped, this is, this is.

186

0:21:44

P9

Their group. Yeah, they're they're group into, like, you know, 1 1, i guess, like medical issue.

187

0:21:50

Emily

Okay, got it.

188

0:21:51

P9

Okay.

189

0:21:52

Emily

What are there?

190

0:21:53

Emily

It's. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

191

0:21:57

P9

I would say over here, I would. I would just put the

192

0:22:07

P9

what I owed for now like, let's say like, because when I click, click on that bill

193

0:22:13

P9

and let me just go back real quick.

194

0:22:15

P9

So when I click on this bill, $50,

195

0:22:18

P9

I would say, separate these actual balances from the payments already received.

196

0:22:26

P9

So that it's clear that's exactly my balance, you know.

197

0:22:31

P9

And then the payment received could be like, yeah, because, like, they're kind of grouped into one. If you look at it.

198

0:22:37

Emily

Okay, got it?

199

0:22:39

Emily

Or early, think, yeah, go ahead.

200

0:22:43

P9

Or just have, like all my

201

0:22:46

P9

the the breakdown of the $50. And then, if you really want to see, like your past payments. You could go to like your statements, or.

202

0:22:55

P9

yeah, so like you could see like your past payments on there. Because

203

0:22:59

P9

If I was looking at it. I just want to see right now, like what the breakdown of the $50 is like.

204

0:23:06

P9

you know, like, if I wanted to see something else like past payments. I could just go like the statements or the the

205

0:23:11

P9

payment history on the 1st page.

206

0:23:14

Emily

Oh, okay, so so it's it's not really clear. Now, just what exactly the the $50 is is from.

207

0:23:21

P9

Yeah. So that's what I'm that's what I'm most concerned about. If I owed $50, to look at what it's for.

208

0:23:30

P9

You know, these 1, 2, 3, 4, right here and then these right here could be a different one. Because when I was looking at when I was scrolling down the

209

0:23:38

P9

what I noticed like I was counting

210

0:23:41

P9

the the amount, the $20 to $5,

211

0:23:45

P9

$5, and the other $20 right here. And then I started seeing the negative 45, and it starts seeing the $5. You know, it's kind of like I understood it like looking at it. But looking at just

212

0:23:56

P9

maybe like other people's, you know, they

213

0:23:59

P9

might cause confusion. But I mean, that's I. I understand, like what it's what it's doing.

214

0:24:06

P9

But it'd be nice to just have that breakdown of the $50 over there.

215

0:24:11

Emily

Okay, good and we're gonna pretend that

216

0:24:17

Emily

that. You you see an error here you like something is listed where you're very sure you, let's say, didn't attend that appointment or something. What would what? What would you do in that in that sense, or in that instance?

217

0:24:31

P9

Okay. So let's say, outpatient care for optometry.

218

0:24:38

P9

Yeah. So let's say, like, if I didn't attend this one, I would.

219

0:24:43

P9

I can click on it.

220

0:24:46

P9

I would. I would try to

221

0:24:48

P9

Yeah, we try to tap on it and see, like, you know, if there's any more information.

222

0:24:52

Emily

Oh, God!

223

0:24:53

P9

If you know. Maybe like provider contact info kind of like to confirm with the provider the office of sales provider

224

0:25:04

P9

that I didn't go that outpatient care for optometry that day, you know, or at least like some somewhere to con contact. Va.

225

0:25:13

P9

yeah, because I can click on anything right now. Maybe it's not done yet.

226

0:25:17

Emily

Yeah. Try scrolling up. I think there's 1 that might be active. Let me see. It's the the the top. Yeah. Would this? Would this at all be helpful to you?

227

0:25:30

Emily

Yeah, it would be helpful, because there's a billing reference right there. It would be nice to.

228

0:25:35

P9

To have like contact information. Because, like, if I was, if I was to look at that, hey? I didn't do this. I wanna be able to like contact whoever I need to right away, instead of like trying to dig in or call the Va like

229

0:25:48

P9

Va general number, which I would get bounced around, you know.

230

0:25:53

Emily

Okay? And so where would you expect to? Since you mentioned calling someone? Where? Where do you believe you would go to look for a number to call.

231

0:26:04

P9

I would try to click on help first.st If I was me like the 1st thing I would do is pop right.

232

0:26:09

Emily

Okay.

233

0:26:10

P9

And see you know what I can find out of there.

234

0:26:13

P9

If not, let me look at the the previous page.

235

0:26:17

P9

Page. If there's any any contact information at all, anywhere.

236

0:26:24

Emily

Was as I.

237

0:26:25

P9

How would?

238

0:26:26

Emily

Yeah. Go ahead.

239

0:26:29

P9

Go ahead. Sorry.

240

0:26:30

Emily

Oh, I was gonna say, since since you mentioned the the help button, if you wanna tap on that here.

241

0:26:41

P9

Okay. So

242

0:26:43

P9

So let's say, let's go back to that 1st one.

243

0:26:47

P9

I don't know if the help is gonna change.

244

0:26:50

Emily

I forget if the help is connected.

245

0:26:52

P9

It is.

246

0:26:52

Emily

It might not be. Oh, it is. Yeah, alright.

247

0:26:55

P9

So it's it's it's a if you have questions about your copay bills. Okay? So

248

0:27:01

P9

you have a. You have the number

249

0:27:04

P9

on here about the copay bill. So yeah, that's that's the 1st thing I would do. So you you guys have that there already. But is this like the just the general number for the Va. Or is this like the number for

250

0:27:20

P9

in regards to this bill.

251

0:27:22

Emily

So what what would I mean as

252

0:27:24

Emily

around? What? What would? What would make it more clear as to what the number actually is that you're seeing.

253

0:27:34

P9

Health resource center.

254

0:27:40

P9

What is this for outpatient care? Family medicine?

255

0:27:47

P9

So this tells me it's more of a general number. But I mean that that would.

256

0:27:54

P9

It would be fine as long as it relates to

257

0:27:59

P9

the actual Va va services that I that I receive rather than just a general Va. Number is that, does that make sense or.

258

0:28:09

Emily

Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yes. You do want a more, a more focused number.

259

0:28:12

P9

Yeah, because, like, I've I've had that happen to me before I leave those 2 years ago where

260

0:28:19

P9

I saw a number. It was I was using my my computer, and I saw a number. And I called that number, and they put me on hold to transfer me. And then another transfer. After that.

261

0:28:32

Emily

Got it.

262

0:28:32

P9

So if if this number is actually like, it doesn't have to be the the providers. Actual number, you know, but someone that could help you right away rather than like putting me on hold for them to find out which one it is. And then.

263

0:28:45

P9

you know, yeah. So more like, I guess, like

264

0:28:49

P9

someone that could help me, but not like the the very 1st number that the Va. Would would give you like.

265

0:28:56

Emily

Yeah, okay? And then, you know a similar question. We're gonna pretend that you don't believe you have the money right now to make this payment. What would what might you do in that situation?

266

0:29:10

P9

I would call

267

0:29:12

P9

the the outpatient or not the outpatient. This number right here, and then see if they have, like, some type of like

268

0:29:20

P9

payment plan, or anything like that.

269

0:29:24

P9

Or what would be even more helpful, because, you know, sometimes, like people would rather avoid

270

0:29:32

P9

you know, social interaction when when they're setting up payments. I would, I would think, if they have like, you know, some type of link right here to do like a payment plan.

271

0:29:44

Emily

Hmm, okay.

272

0:29:46

Emily

Where? Where?

273

0:29:47

P9

You said, you know.

274

0:29:48

P9

Oh, where would I?

275

0:29:50

P9

Where would that?

276

0:29:51

P9

Yeah, exactly.

277

0:29:55

P9

So are we talking about? Just just for this

278

0:30:01

P9

for each of them, or just for all of these.

279

0:30:05

Emily

Let's say, for like for like for that, that $50 payment since you mentioned a a repayment plan, where would you hope or believe to find any information regarding a potential repayment plan.

280

0:30:21

P9

I would say.

281

0:30:24

P9

just under payments. Hold on! Let me go back to the payments here, and then over here

282

0:30:33

P9

and pay bill.

283

0:30:39

P9

Is this so when you try to pay a bill, does it go?

284

0:30:44

P9

It doesn't do through the app.

285

0:30:47

Emily

Right.

286

0:30:49

P9

Gotcha. Okay?

287

0:30:52

P9

Yeah. Like, I said, like, when I've done it before. It was by phone when I received the letter. So I've not actually never paid in the app. I don't believe so. That makes sense.

288

0:31:01

P9

So I would say, that's what I would do what I just did right now on the pay bill and see like if there's like a payment plan that I could do.

289

0:31:11

Emily

Got it. Okay. So you.

290

0:31:12

P9

$50. Yeah.

291

0:31:13

Emily

Perfect. Let me have you tap on close here.

292

0:31:18

P9

It won't.

293

0:31:20

Emily

It won't. That's never good.

294

0:31:22

P9

Yeah, no, no. Actually, I'm trying to tap and.

295

0:31:26

Emily

Try typing.

296

0:31:26

Emily

And outside, I might just have to.

297

0:31:29

P9

Yeah.

298

0:31:30

Emily

Go back all right. Nothing is responding. If you're.

299

0:31:35

P9

No.

300

0:31:36

Emily

Okay.

301

0:31:37

P9

Looks like zoom is working, though.

302

0:31:39

Emily

I know one. Why don't you go back to zoom? And then re tap that link from yes, the chat

303

0:31:48

Emily

when in doubt start over. That's my answer to everything. Oh, come on, come on, figma.

304

0:31:54

P9

Let me let me quit Sigma, and then recap that.

305

0:31:59

Emily

That was gonna be my next thing. You read my mind.

306

0:32:06

P9

I wonder if this, if it just got stuck? Let me tap on that again just to

307

0:32:11

Emily

Sometimes it. It just gets slow. Alright, so tap on payment. Tap on Copay.

308

0:32:16

Emily

Yeah, there we go.

309

0:32:20

Emily

So I'll have you swipe. My my.

310

0:32:25

P9

All right.

311

0:32:25

Emily

Getting out of the way.

312

0:32:26

P9

Ouch!

313

0:32:26

Emily

It just a little more space. Yeah.

314

0:32:30

P9

Where did I go for that.

315

0:32:32

Emily

So what?

316

0:32:32

P9

Pay bill. I believe.

317

0:32:33

Emily

I'm gonna have you do one thing first.st

318

0:32:36

Emily

We'll get back to the to the pay bill, but tap on the the help and the help section we were at before.

319

0:32:46

Emily

and if there's anything there that I know you said you would probably call, but if there's anything else that you might there for, or that you might find.

320

0:32:52

P9

Oh!

321

0:32:53

Emily

For repayment.

322

0:32:56

P9

There's how to request debt relief. And if you can't pay future co-pays, that's that's the

323

0:33:02

P9

That stuff.

324

0:33:04

P9

1st thing I would click on the the second one right here or this one.

325

0:33:09

P9

And also if you have questions about your copay bills is one of the ones that I would click on. But if you're wondering what the top one that I would pick if I wanted to. See if there's if there's a payment plan. I would say

326

0:33:24

P9

this one, because, it not, it's not quite debt relief, but

327

0:33:30

P9

I guess like it. It kind of like for me. It kind of sounds like it's more in the on the side of like, okay, like, what can I do to like get help to make payments and anything like that?

328

0:33:41

Emily

Okay. Can you think of? Would there be anything that would make that even more clear? To to go there for any sort of debt, relief.

329

0:33:52

P9

So I guess, like what we're talking about is to make payment plans right a debt. Relief is more like

330

0:34:00

P9

trying to ask if there's a way for you to to waive your

331

0:34:05

P9

your co-pays or your debt, so I guess, like

332

0:34:10

P9

it would be more clear. Let's say like, if

333

0:34:15

P9

if I go to like, if you have questions about your bills like, if it has like information about like this to to request for payment plan.

334

0:34:23

P9

you know. Yeah, like deferred payments or anything like that.

335

0:34:29

P9

I just thought about that that, really, because, like, I kind of bundled it into one where you know payment plan, and that really.

336

0:34:36

P9

But I guess they're different. Because if you're asking for debt relief that means just kind of like wipe it out, or something, or wave it.

337

0:34:43

Emily

Okay? So would could, could that be more clear here in terms of finding what's available.

338

0:34:50

P9

Yeah, I would say, like, if you guys could either have it under this. If you have questions about your call.

339

0:34:59

P9

pay bills have like A, you know. If you have questions about your bills or want to do

340

0:35:06

P9

payment plan, it could be under here also. Or if you, wanna but another

341

0:35:13

P9

drop down saying about like something about

342

0:35:18

P9

payment plans. But you know you don't.

343

0:35:21

P9

But at the same time you don't want this to be filled up with a lot of drop downs.

344

0:35:26

P9

So

345

0:35:27

P9

let's say like, if you want to keep it as is with 4 4 dropdowns, you could put it right here.

346

0:35:35

Emily

Okay. Yeah.

347

0:35:36

P9

Because, you know, that's more like, yeah, that's more like a question.

348

0:35:39

Emily

Got it? Got it? Okay? And then

349

0:35:41

Emily

How oral, were you aware that there are these options that you're seeing here of like requesting debt, relief, and and finding information on on a payment plan. Things like that.

350

0:35:56

P9

No, I actually did not know anything about like a debt relief from Va. Because I figured.

351

0:36:01

P9

you know, if you owe something you just kinda owe something. But then, you know, it's

352

0:36:05

P9

it's different people's

353

0:36:10

P9

You know, people people have like different situation in life so that they may need it.

354

0:36:18

Emily

Okay, got it. I'll have you tap on close here.

355

0:36:23

Emily

Okay, so

356

0:36:26

Emily

Other things you would expect or or hope to be able to do from here.

357

0:36:34

P9

Let me just look around real quick. See what else it has.

358

0:36:44

P9

There's a statement

359

0:36:53

P9

yeah. So like, just what I mentioned earlier about having the

360

0:36:57

P9

co-pay separated with your previous payments, because

361

0:37:02

P9

I just for for me like it just has nothing to do with with my co-pay.

362

0:37:08

P9

Right now, what I'm worried about is what I need to pay, and when I need to pay it so.

363

0:37:15

P9

I would just say, just keep these 4 right here.

364

0:37:19

P9

And then I see the Pdf statement right there. Also. It's it's at the top and the bottom. So that's good.

365

0:37:25

Emily

Okay.

366

0:37:27

P9

So yeah, that's.

367

0:37:29

Emily

Are, are Pdf. Statements something that you use now for anything.

368

0:37:33

P9

Yeah. So let's just say, not for

369

0:37:38

P9

like in particular from Va, but like, let's just say like banking information, right? I see. Like just the the rundown of what I have. But if I want to dig into it, then that's when I would use the Pdf statement. So

370

0:37:51

P9

if if I if I have like my previous payments, that's where I was, that's where I would expect it, I believe.

371

0:37:59

P9

And yeah, so that's that's what I would. That's what I would go if I really want to like, you know. Audit everything.

372

0:38:07

Emily

What I paid and what I owed. Yeah.

373

0:38:09

Emily

hmm, okay, and let me have you open up one of the statements here to see if just how how useful that might be here on the app.

374

0:38:20

Emily

So pretend you've opened up this statement here.

375

0:38:24

Emily

So is this something, I guess. How? How would you use the statements? And I said you would like audit things?

376

0:38:33

Emily

Specifically, on.

377

0:38:34

P9

Yeah.

378

0:38:35

Emily

Phone. How might you use it?

379

0:38:39

P9

So I would go directly to like the oh, actually this! Let me see here it might be. Let me just zoom it in.

380

0:38:46

Emily

So if you tap once, that's yeah. If if you tap once.

381

0:38:49

P9

Okay.

382

0:38:50

Emily

A little fake zoom.

383

0:38:51

P9

Got it.

384

0:38:52

Emily

Prototype, limitation.

385

0:38:54

P9

Okay, so it it says right here.

386

0:38:57

P9

all of my my charges, which is pretty much the same thing as the the one in the front.

387

0:39:03

P9

The not the front, the the previous page, and it doesn't have your previous statement of.

388

0:39:14

P9

I would think that, you know, like,

389

0:39:16

P9

I guess statement balances just for the month.

390

0:39:19

P9

Hmm, okay, yeah. So if this is all you have for that statement, then that's what I would expect.

391

0:39:26

Emily

Got it. Okay? And then would you be doing anything beyond viewing the statements on the phone?

392

0:39:38

P9

No like in the in the app.

393

0:39:41

P9

I would just look at the what I would usually do when I've when I've done this on a, you know, like for banking information. I would look at the whatever

394

0:39:50

P9

the charges for the month, and what I need to pay, and see if they add up, I really wanna audit it. But this in this particular situation, you only have these 4. So.

395

0:40:02

Emily

Okay. Got it? Alright. Let me have you tap on done there, please.

396

0:40:07

P9

So we're pretending that if if this is built in real life, if the if the app had this section in real life here, like you're seeing.

397

0:40:17

Emily

How likely do you think it would be that you might use it.

398

0:40:23

P9

The the Pdf. Statements.

399

0:40:26

Emily

Really this, this whole thing that would that we've looked at. So, viewing this, viewing the information, looking at the Pdf, seeing when things are due.

400

0:40:35

P9

I would use it if

401

0:40:39

P9

you know, if it's actually, if it's usable right now, I I would. I would say it's it's usable as it is. I understand it.

402

0:40:46

P9

And if let's say because the Pdf is A

403

0:40:52

P9

is very minimal, I would say that

404

0:40:56

P9

it may not really be needed

405

0:40:59

P9

for me, like, let's say, like, if I'm just looking at the

406

0:41:02

P9

statements, because, like for for va statements, S.

407

0:41:07

P9

Got it for me, at least like for me. It would be very rare to have like

408

0:41:13

P9

a lot of a lot of information there on the on the Pdf. Statements so like.

409

0:41:20

P9

I will just have them in a page

410

0:41:22

P9

and then make this make it still available via Pdf statement. But like I would just have everything in the pages like this, but separate

411

0:41:31

P9

your your what you need to pay with these. I would use this if

412

0:41:37

P9

you know, if I just need to. I need to look at it and pay it on the app rather than

413

0:41:43

P9

calling the phone. It'd be much easier if I could just pay in the app, too.

414

0:41:47

Emily

Okay? Good. Yeah. So since you specifically mentioned paying in the app. And right now, this version is not would that. Would that be still be something that that you would use, knowing that there wasn't the option to pay right here.

415

0:42:02

P9

Actually, I would rather use that than to call, because the reason why I paid over the phone before when I got the physical mails is like to call this number.

416

0:42:10

Emily

Hmm.

417

0:42:11

P9

So.

418

0:42:12

Emily

Yep. Okay.

419

0:42:13

P9

That's that's what it's in front of me.

420

0:42:15

Emily

Yes, got it all right. Let me have you tap on the payments in the lower right? I'm gonna get you to another version, and we're gonna quickly go with that and so scroll all the way to the bottom

421

0:42:27

Emily

and tap on the blank gray area toward the bottom. There, yeah, there we go, perfect. And now tap on Copays.

422

0:42:35

Emily

Okay? So again, we're going to go through again. That top one, the James A. Haley hospital

423

0:42:42

Emily

walk me through. We'll pretend that you are ready to pay. Walk me through. How you would do that. Here.

424

0:42:52

P9

Yes, so let's just say I already reviewed it. I'm ready to pay.

425

0:42:56

P9

I'll just click on pay bills, and if there's a hey? You know I'm

426

0:43:05

P9

I would pay in pay.gov.

427

0:43:07

P9

since there's you know, it'll take you to a website, anyway, instead of paying by phone or by mail definitely not pay by mail. I wouldn't even do that.

428

0:43:18

P9

Yeah, I would just pay and pay.gov.

429

0:43:21

Emily

Oh, there you go! You could click this time around.

430

0:43:24

P9

And then.

431

0:43:25

Emily

Go ahead and do that.

432

0:43:27

Emily

I won't. I won't have you enter anything in, I promise.

433

0:43:35

Emily

And I'm gonna I'm gonna skip most that. But scroll down a little bit. I'm gonna have you go to continue to the form the blue one there.

434

0:43:45

Emily

Okay, and then scroll down a little more. We're just going to get you to the one specific area. So the the account number thoughts on

435

0:43:55

Emily

finding the information you would need in order to make the payment, and where, where.

436

0:44:00

P9

Ah yes

437

0:44:01

Emily

Active fines, I would say.

438

0:44:03

P9

I would click on "where do I find my VA account number?" Because I don't know that off top of my head. Or, if I do have it any of my paper mail.

439

0:44:14

P9

mail.

440

0:44:15

Emily

Okay. Okay.

441

0:44:17

P9

yeah. But usually, if I'm already here, I would just click on that. How? Where do I find the account? Number.

442

0:44:24

Emily

Yeah, okay, and let me have you switch back to the figma app.

443

0:44:29

Emily

See? If it wants to cooperate.

444

0:44:35

Emily

Okay? And click on, go back and then close

445

0:44:41

Emily

and let me have you go into review details there?

446

0:44:48

Emily

Oh, sorry of the yes, there we go.

447

0:44:53

Emily

Thoughts on. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

448

0:44:56

P9

There's pay bill right here.

449

0:44:58

Emily

Okay.

450

0:45:00

P9

Okay, so same thing. Yeah, I would. I would pay and pay that golf.

451

0:45:04

Emily

Okay, how about getting that? I know you said you would you would look up where to find the account number.

452

0:45:12

P9

Yeah, it's a i see it there, and I would just copy it.

453

0:45:16

Emily

Okay.

454

0:45:17

P9

So that's very helpful right there, because so is this account number the

455

0:45:24

P9

the Your Va. Account number? Or is this the account number of that bill?

456

0:45:29

Emily

A great question I do not know, but I know it's the one you would need in pay.gov. So.

457

0:45:34

P9

Okay.

458

0:45:35

Emily

Sure what the what? The full number is. Okay? So you would. You would copy that there anything else that might make it even easier for you in terms of getting that in that account. Information over to pay.gov.

459

0:45:51

P9

I would say, can I go back real quick to co-pace.

460

0:45:55

Emily

Yep.

461

0:45:57

P9

Oops. I click over, clicked it.

462

0:46:02

P9

I would say like, because if I was ready to, unless I'm ready and review details.

463

0:46:08

P9

Then I would see it there.

464

0:46:09

P9

But if I was, you know, like if I just if I didn't want to review the details already know it. Let's just say, let's put it this way. So I reviewed the details because I do this all like all the time

465

0:46:21

P9

I would review the details, and I know I have like

466

0:46:24

P9

25 days to pay it off. I'm like, Okay, well, I'll I'll pay it off later. I don't know why I do that. Just a procrastinator, I guess. But already know the the information. So I would go back, maybe 2 weeks later, and I want to pay the bill already. Right? What I would do usually be, since I already know I would just pay the bill.

467

0:46:45

P9

It'd be nice to have that information there. The the account number.

468

0:46:50

Emily

Hmm, okay. Oh, like right here.

469

0:46:54

P9

Yeah, because like, I said, like, that's the type of thing that I would do

470

0:47:00

P9

is I would review it. And then, okay, it's good to go. I'll pay it later. I I don't know. Why did I just do it? But you know it's 1 of those situations where I go back to Va

471

0:47:11

P9

app, you know, if if I was to use the app

472

0:47:15

P9

and then I would just click on pay Bill, because I already know what the bill is.

473

0:47:18

Emily

Yeah, okay.

474

0:47:19

P9

And then I would just follow this prompt, and then I would go to Va. Pay, pay.gov, and then now have to click on. Where do I find it? And then now go back to the app, get it, and then put it there. It'd be nice to have it right there already, you know.

475

0:47:32

Emily

Yeah, okay, got it? And then so knowing having this experience where at least it it is possible to pay, even though I know it's switching applications. What would be the likelihood? You would use this version if it were built in real life.

476

0:47:50

P9

I would rather use this version, because.

477

0:47:53

Emily

Okay.

478

0:47:53

P9

It. It'll you know.

479

0:47:55

P9

I I avoid like calling and being on hold, or anything like that, I could just pay it off online. Easy.

480

0:48:03

P9

Like, I said. The only reason why I paid it through phones because it was right there, and it told me it like to

481

0:48:09

P9

call or mail, or something like that, so I was like, alright, let me just call this, take care of it, but.

482

0:48:14

Emily

Okay, got it? Got it?

483

0:48:16

Emily

Okay? I think those are all my questions. Anything else that you haven't already shared in regards to, let's say, any of the labeling of the section, or just any of the other experiences regarding the Copays here.

484

0:48:34

P9

no, I would say, like, those are the the concerns that I that I you know that I have, but especially the the pay bill. That's probably one of the the bigger ones that I that I want to mention is to have the account number somewhere already.

485

0:48:49

Emily

Yeah, okay.

486

0:48:51

P9

Yeah. So that's like one of the big ones.

487

0:48:54

Emily

Alright makes sense alright, and I'm just gonna check in with my colleagues. If anybody else has any quick questions, feel free to unmute now and ask them.

488

0:49:09

Emily

Okay, I'll take that as a no, and we are a minute over time, and I do apologize. But thank you so much for taking the time to go over this with us. It's super important for us to actually talk with veterans and see how you are experiencing the various things that we are looking to build. So thank you for taking the time with us today.

489

0:49:31

P9

No worries, thank you for for doing this. Make make it easier, for you know, for us.

490

0:49:38

Emily

Working on.

491

0:49:38

P9

Been calling.

492

0:49:40

Emily

Yes, exactly, that's the goal. Alright, thanks so much. Hope. You have a great rest of the day.

493

0:49:46

P9

Thank you, you, too. Bye.

Up into like vas from [redacted] as well. So I've been.

20

00:01:26

P10

To quite a few different vas.

21

00:01:28

Emily

Yeah, sounds like it, all right.

22

00:01:30

Emily

And what sort of experience have you had with the with with Va's website? And or the mobile app.

23

00:01:39

P10

I've been using both quite regularly since 2017. I've seen, like all the improvements that they've made over the years. It's definitely become a lot more user friendly. And then I've been seeing the updates that's been added to the app in the last couple of years as well. So.

24

00:01:58

Emily

Okay.

25

00:01:59

P10

I would say, the advancement of the softwares, and everything like that has been

26

00:02:07

P10

pretty good it's been has been slowly modernized.

27

00:02:13

Emily

Nice, alright and in excuse me. In what? Instances? Would you use choose to use the mobile app over the website.

28

00:02:24

P10

The mobile app. I can just do like the 2 step authentication with my finger, or whatever. So it's definitely quicker.

29

00:02:34

P10

And

30

00:02:37

P10

if I so pretty much, you can do everything, I believe, on the mobile app, except like, do travel claims.

31

00:02:46

P10

yeah. So it's it's

32

00:02:48

P10

it's comparable to the to the website. Now, there's a few things that you can't do on the mobile app but prime all the primary thing task and everything you can just do from your phone. That's what I've noticed.

33

00:03:01

Emily

Okay, got it. And so you said, Is it you mentioned the the authentication? So is it. Is it easier on the mobile app. Is that why you're choosing that I just wanna make sure I'm understanding when you're.

34

00:03:12

P10

Yes, faster, it's faster. It takes seconds. It takes seconds if I do it, to go through the website I have to

35

00:03:20

P10

go through if id me, and maybe it takes like a minute

36

00:03:25

P10

to go through that process. So.

37

00:03:29

Emily

Okay, got it great. So now we're moving on to the financial portion of the discussion. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have absolutely no information about you or your finances for the Va. So 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for things like benefit, overpayments.

38

00:03:52

P10

Yeah. So I was in school from [redacted]. And I was in the [redacted] program. So there was a overpayment

39

00:04:05

P10

and I think December of last year it finally got paid off. So they took like [redacted] bucks a month, for

40

00:04:13

P10

I don't know. Maybe a year, I think.

41

00:04:15

Emily

Got it.

42

00:04:17

Emily

Okay? So so it sounds like that was paid off by your your benefits being reduced. Is that right?

43

00:04:23

P10

It they got it automatically withdrew from my monthly deposit.

44

00:04:27

Emily

Got it. Okay, all right. And do you recall how you originally notified of this debt?

45

00:04:36

P10

So I wasn't notified.

46

00:04:38

Emily

You weren't okay.

47

00:04:40

P10

I wasn't notified.

48

00:04:42

P10

And then I just I just happened to look at my deposit amounts one day.

49

00:04:47

P10

and I was like, Oh, that doesn't look right. So I end up calling the BA. And then they end up explaining to me that

50

00:04:56

P10

I had a school payment overpayment, so.

51

00:05:04

P10

I may have received the letter, but I do not recall receiving a letter.

52

00:05:08

Emily

Okay. They they said they had milled one.

53

00:05:11

P10

Yeah.

54

00:05:11

Emily

Got it. Okay.

55

00:05:14

P10

And then, like on the on the website. If you see like overpayments, it never showed up there.

56

00:05:22

Emily

Oh, okay, interesting. Okay. So it wouldn't. Didn't show up there.

57

00:05:24

Emily

Good.

58

00:05:25

P10

It didn't show up at all, so I was just getting deducted. That [redacted] bucks, and the only way I knew what it was is, I have to call and confirm.

59

00:05:35

Emily

Hmm, okay.

60

00:05:37

Emily

Got it? Alright. And then thoughts on how that whole process could have been made easier for you.

61

00:05:48

P10

Some type of.

62

00:05:50

P10

I mean, we live in a kind of a digital world these days. So some type of notification within the app or some type of email notification would have.

63

00:06:02

P10

Helped. Because.

64

00:06:06

P10

yeah, I mean, sometimes the the Va knows you multiple letters when you're going through the claims process. You're going through appointments and stuff like that. And every letter, if I get it digitally

65

00:06:19

P10

like I may not open up the mail immediately. So just having some type of digital notification would have

66

00:06:27

P10

assisted me. And you know, understanding what was happening.

67

00:06:30

Emily

Got it. Okay.

68

00:06:32

Emily

sounds good. Okay. And then, switching gears a tiny bit. Have you had any experience with paying any medical co-payments through the Va.

69

00:06:44

P10

I think I only did it once, and that's when I 1st got a service connected. I think it was in [redated] only did only did a a copayment once, and it was like $50 ago. Since then I have never paid anything.

70

00:07:02

Emily

Okay. Got it? Alright. So let me have you have you share your screen now, and let me know if you need any help doing that.

71

00:07:12

P10

Okay.

72

00:07:27

P10

you just hit the share button right?

73

00:07:30

Emily

Yep.

74

00:07:31

P10

And then.

75

00:07:32

Emily

Extra permissions.

76

00:07:34

P10

And then screen. After that.

77

00:07:36

Emily

Yep.

78

00:07:44

P10

So it was giving me a list. Do I choose zoom.

79

00:07:47

Emily

Yeah. So it's 2. Zoom should probably be at the bottom. It's usually alphabetical.

80

00:07:50

P10

Yeah, yeah, it's disabled art.

81

00:07:57

Emily

Alright great and then let me have you share screen. So let me have you open up the mobile app figma. Now.

82

00:08:10

P10

Okay.

83

00:08:24

P10

I have it opened.

84

00:08:25

Emily

Okay. And I'm gonna get so go to login. I'm gonna give you some test credentials. Here.

85

00:08:39

P10

All right.

86

00:08:40

Emily

Okay, so the email is going to be VA test 0 0

87

00:08:51

Emily

at gmail.com.

88

00:08:59

P10

And the password is gonna be VAVA VAVA.

89

00:09:04

Emily

8 characters.

90

00:09:12

Emily

Okay? And I'll just need to get the authentication code. So give me just a moment.

91

00:09:20

Emily

Okay, it's gonna okay. Code is 6, 0, 6,

92

00:09:28

Emily

7, 9, 7, 3.

93

00:09:39

Emily

All right, continue with the app.

94

00:09:49

Emily

Okay? And then I'm gonna send a link to the Zoom chat.

95

00:09:56

Emily

If you can switch back to zoom and open up that message to tap on this link.

96

00:10:17

P10

It's an error.

97

00:10:19

Emily

Can you switch back to let me see if it's not available? Try again. Go go back to zoom.

98

00:10:29

Emily

Yeah.

99

00:10:44

P10

Do I need to do this right here? Tap.

100

00:10:46

Emily

No, that you can just tap anywhere outside of that. It just it. Sometimes it's a little bit slow, but it looks like it's working.

101

00:10:55

P10

Okay.

102

00:10:56

Emily

Yeah, there we go. All right. We have it here. Okay, so here we have our fake mobile app here.

103

00:11:04

Emily

So first, st without any sort of tapping. You can scroll around, certainly, but just don't tap. Don't yet tap into anything. Where would you expect to find information on money that you owe specifically for overpayments?

104

00:11:26

P10

I mean it should be on this 1st page.

105

00:11:28

P10

I would think it would be right below last payment.

106

00:11:31

Emily

Okay, what?

107

00:11:36

P10

Something that was like. I don't know if you're getting.

108

00:11:40

Emily

It. It'd be what sorry I missed that.

109

00:11:43

P10

I said. If there was some like itemized thing right below last payment showing deductions that would be.

110

00:11:49

P10

I think that's where it should be, or even on the payments. Page.

111

00:11:53

Emily

Okay. Got it

112

00:11:56

Emily

all right. Thoughts on. Since you mentioned that that payments page thoughts on the the title of that.

113

00:12:05

P10

Payments.

114

00:12:06

Emily

Yep.

115

00:12:13

P10

I mean, I think the the title is clear. I mean.

116

00:12:21

P10

yeah, I think I mean, I think it's fine.

117

00:12:23

Emily

Okay, great. I'll have you tap into that. Since you mentioned that the the payments, tab.

118

00:12:29

P10

Okay.

119

00:12:29

Emily

Okay.

120

00:12:31

Emily

and in this scenario we will. We will pretend that you that you also have medical copays. But thoughts on what you're seeing here, especially as it relates to the the title of payments.

121

00:12:46

P10

I mean, this is.

122

00:12:48

P10

I mean this. This makes sense like the overpayment for debts and co-pays listed here on this page. This makes sense.

123

00:12:57

P10

So.

124

00:12:59

Emily

Okay, got it. And how about the the bit of information that is below the words overpayment debts and below Copays? What sort of information. Might you want to know? There.

125

00:13:13

P10

If I click the arrow, would it list what it's for?

126

00:13:17

Emily

We'll we'll we'll get to that very shortly. But I'm I'm wondering what like what might be the most helpful specifically from this screen to know, for either the overpayment or the co-pays.

127

00:13:32

P10

I think this information is pretty clear like it says the total amount, and then the number of different debts you owe, and then, for the co-pays

128

00:13:42

P10

has a total, and then there's 2 bills. So I mean with

129

00:13:49

P10

I mean, normally, you should know a veteran should know if they have some type of overpayment

130

00:13:56

P10

or copays due cause.

131

00:13:58

P10

When you go to

132

00:14:01

P10

you should get some receipt or notification, or something like that. When you go to the Va. Or to an outpatient clinic for the co-pays

133

00:14:09

P10

and

134

00:14:11

P10

for the debts. I mean. I'm pretty sure a lot of veterans are watching their deposits every month, so

135

00:14:21

P10

If they got overpaid they probably know.

136

00:14:24

Emily

Got it. Okay? Great so if you want, you can tap into the overpayment debt. Since we talked about that.

137

00:14:31

P10

Okay.

138

00:14:32

Emily

And then thoughts here on overall. How clear is it? What what you owe, and what sort of information would you be looking for here.

139

00:14:44

P10

It seems like

140

00:14:51

P10

I mean, I guess it's pretty, is. It looks pretty clear and standard information that I would expect to see that the full sign, the gi bill for housing.

141

00:15:01

P10

I know I've I've heard of veterans getting overpaid for that.

142

00:15:09

P10

I don't know for the for the books how you would get an overpayment for that, but it's listed.

143

00:15:16

P10

And

144

00:15:20

P10

yeah, it looks like it looks pretty straightforward.

145

00:15:23

Emily

Exactly

146

00:15:25

Emily

if and then, in this pretense pretend scenario. If you were to incur a new debt, how would you expect to know that there is something new here.

147

00:15:36

P10

Some type of like on payments like if you put like a

148

00:15:46

P10

So a lot of apps when you have an update. There's like a red dot or something like that. So if you had like, some type of dot or number

149

00:15:59

P10

above payments like when you go onto the app.

150

00:16:02

P10

I see some type of notification. So you click it. And then you can see that information.

151

00:16:08

Emily

Okay, got it, got it?

152

00:16:11

Emily

And then how about if there was a debt listed or a debt here that has already paid, been paid off. What if anything, would you want to see here regarding that debt.

153

00:16:24

P10

Closed.

154

00:16:26

Emily

Closed. Okay.

155

00:16:28

P10

Some type of yeah closed or some type of other

156

00:16:32

P10

wording that says it's been paid.

157

00:16:37

Emily

Okay, got it and let me have you scroll to the top.

158

00:16:44

P10

Okay.

159

00:16:45

Emily

So that the top one for housing. Let me have you tap into that and have a look to see what information would be important to you for this particular debt.

160

00:17:17

P10

So for this or whatever.

161

00:17:21

P10

I mean, all this stuff looks great that I'm seeing here. The only thing that kind of shocked me to see is the late fee.

162

00:17:28

Emily

Okay.

163

00:17:29

P10

If it's being automatically deducted from your Va.

164

00:17:34

P10

Money, your disability compensation.

165

00:17:39

P10

Why would a late fee even be calculated in?

166

00:17:43

P10

That's the only thing that comes to mind immediately. But I mean this, this looks

167

00:17:49

P10

like it should look. I I would say.

168

00:17:54

Emily

Okay, so we'll we'll pretend that this particular debt

169

00:17:59

Emily

has to be directly paid as as opposed to having it being deducted from from your benefits, thought what specifically or what pieces of information would be important for you to know here, knowing that.

170

00:18:16

P10

Well, it has a due date on it, and

171

00:18:27

P10

and I guess at the bottom it it says that

172

00:18:30

P10

you were sent a letter. So

173

00:18:33

P10

I mean, this information looks pretty straightforward.

174

00:18:36

Emily

Okay. Got it

175

00:18:38

Emily

since you brought the the debt letter. What might you use that section for, or what what might be important in regards to the Debt letter, history.

176

00:18:49

P10

If you can click it and see the letter digitally.

177

00:18:56

Emily

Okay, got it.

178

00:18:59

Emily

And thoughts on anything. You might or yeah, any other. Any other information you might want here, or anything you might want to do from here.

179

00:19:15

P10

I mean I see the demand letter

180

00:19:20

P10

When you see the words, why might I have this debt? So if it gives a clear and concise, like explanation. Why.

181

00:19:28

P10

cause maybe you're confused, I guess, and you don't know why, even if you did see the the debt letter down there, so

182

00:19:37

P10

maybe some direct contact information.

183

00:19:40

Emily

Hmm.

184

00:19:42

P10

Or something like that to reach out.

185

00:19:48

Emily

So what I I know you said so. In case you weren't aware why you had the debt. Other reasons you might want to reach out to them.

186

00:19:56

P10

Yeah, so I would. Wanna I would wanna call

187

00:19:59

P10

and talk to someone if I didn't understand why I was being

188

00:20:05

P10

why, there was an overpayment.

189

00:20:08

P10

So some type of contact information.

190

00:20:11

P10

But maybe the debt letter has that on it

191

00:20:14

P10

or the demand letter. I don't know.

192

00:20:18

Emily

Alright. Are there other places you might expect to find contact information.

193

00:20:23

P10

Well, I would assume it might be on a demand letter, but

194

00:20:27

P10

it might not. They'll probably just have a standard Va. 800 number on there. But if I were to well, if you have contact.

195

00:20:36

P10

just added a contact block or something like that

196

00:20:39

P10

up under, why, I might have this debt.

197

00:20:43

P10

That would probably be cool, because.

198

00:20:46

P10

maybe you can just reach out immediately and get a direct person instead of going through the 800 number

199

00:20:54

P10

and clicking all the prompts just to get to someone who transfers you. So if you had direct contact information about this specific debt

200

00:21:03

P10

that would probably be good.

201

00:21:06

Emily

Okay? And then, since you mentioned the why might I have this debt? Let me have you tap into that and see

202

00:21:14

Emily

your your thoughts on the information there.

203

00:21:19

P10

Yeah, that's pretty standard.

204

00:21:22

P10

It's pretty standard, but...

205

00:21:24

P10

It gives you 3 options to ponder.

206

00:21:29

P10

So instead of 3 options, if there was some way to know exactly what it is, and that's why I was mentioning the

207

00:21:38

P10

some type of way to contact about it. A direct line to contact.

208

00:21:44

Emily

Got it. Okay.

209

00:21:45

P10

Like, if you if you're in this situation, you know you're suspended. You know you're on academic probation. You know you withdrew from class or you, and you know you've received duplicate payments. But I would want exactly why

210

00:21:59

P10

that would be helpful, instead of having to think about all 3 of these things.

211

00:22:07

Emily

Okay, makes sense. So was it, is it here you would want the contact information or somewhere else.

212

00:22:15

P10

Maybe below this link that I clicked. [link = "why might I have this debt"]

213

00:22:19

Emily

Okay, I got it. Let me have you go tap close here.

214

00:22:29

Emily

so we'll we'll pretend that this part of the new app is, is built as is just as you're seeing if it were built like this, how? And knowing things that you were looking for, that you were not able to find. How likely do you think it would be that you would use it.

215

00:22:52

P10

I mean, it gives me enough information to go off of.

216

00:22:55

P10

so I would definitely use it just to have some information.

217

00:23:04

P10

I mean, you don't have to look that far like if you just go to payments, it's like 3 clicks, and you know exactly what you're being deducted by. So

218

00:23:15

P10

think that's pretty convenient.

219

00:23:19

Emily

Okay, great let me have you tap on the payments button on the lower right. I'm gonna get you to a different section. Have a few more questions, and then scroll all the way to the bottom.

220

00:23:30

Emily

and then the the blank gray area. Tap once into that

221

00:23:37

Emily

great and then tap on overpayment debts again. Excuse me.

222

00:23:45

Emily

Okay, so this is slightly different. So again, we're gonna look at that this, this top

223

00:23:52

Emily

debt. Here the the debt for housing

224

00:23:56

Emily

thoughts on on the information here and again, what other steps you might want to take from the app here

225

00:24:06

Emily

specifically for for that? Yep.

226

00:24:10

P10

Well, it's definitely a lot different, because it says review details.

227

00:24:13

P10

So I would expect it to give me some type of itemized information, and it gives you a resolved debt. So

228

00:24:21

P10

if you choose to pay hit off, I'm ex.

229

00:24:26

P10

I would assume that. You can just click this, and you know. Get to a payment screen.

230

00:24:32

P10

So there's definitely a lot more information.

231

00:24:35

Emily

Okay? Yeah. And you can. You can go ahead and and tap through and see what what you'd want to do here.

232

00:24:49

P10

Yeah, yeah, like this, pay a line other ways to pay. And you can request help so that

233

00:24:58

P10

that's cool it definitely simplifies, the whole process.

234

00:25:04

Emily

Okay, great.

235

00:25:05

Emily

When when you say simplifies the whole process, can you say more about that?

236

00:25:10

P10

So if I you know, maybe I don't want

237

00:25:15

P10

I wanna take care of this. So I just hit resolve that pay online

238

00:25:23

P10

and then other ways to pay. I can, you know, pretty much. Just click.

239

00:25:27

P10

resolve that hit, pay online or other ways.

240

00:25:31

P10

And then maybe I don't have the money, so hit. Request, help to see what type of services are available. So

241

00:25:39

P10

that's pretty straightforward for me.

242

00:25:42

Emily

Okay. Great.

243

00:25:43

P10

So.

244

00:25:44

Emily

Yeah. So, following up on something you just said, we're gonna pretend that you don't have the money, and you said you would tap the request, help! Let me let me let me have you do that to see

245

00:25:54

Emily

if that would be what you might be looking for.

246

00:26:02

P10

Oh, yeah, that makes sense.

247

00:26:06

Emily

Okay.

248

00:26:12

P10

It's kind of like transunion, or whatever.

249

00:26:16

Emily

It's it's like what sorry.

250

00:26:20

P10

Transunion, like the creditors.

251

00:26:23

Emily

You can dispute

252

00:26:27

P10

Yeah, man, this, this is good. I think this is great.

253

00:26:31

Emily

Great. All right, let me have you close that, and then we'll pretend that you are ready to make a payment. Let me have you walk through that process, and I promise I won't have you enter in any real information.

254

00:26:45

P10

Okay.

255

00:26:54

P10

So should I hit the pay.

256

00:26:57

Emily

Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll. We'll pretend that you are actually going to pay.

257

00:27:01

P10

Okay.

258

00:27:02

Emily

To see what what the process feels like to you.

259

00:27:13

Emily

so I'll have you tap. I know there's a lot to read, so I won't, I'll actually have you? Have you been to this site before? I know you said your your debt was just removed from your benefits? But have you? Have you made any payments through this site before.

260

00:27:25

P10

No, I've never seen this before.

261

00:27:26

Emily

Got it. Okay? Great so again, I know there's a lot. So I'm just gonna have you skip ahead. And there's a there's 2 small pay online buttons that the teal ones is one toward the top and one toward the bottom tap. Either one of those there we go, and then a section in the middle where there are some blank spaces. Let me get your thoughts on

262

00:27:49

Emily

what you would need to actually pay anything here.

263

00:27:54

P10

Okay, so the for the veteran information.

264

00:28:00

P10

The file number pay pay number.

265

00:28:06

P10

I would. I mean, maybe this information. Once you click that link through the

266

00:28:13

P10

through the app. Maybe it should auto fill, because I would know I wouldn't know my phone number offhand. I wouldn't know my pay number off hand as well.

267

00:28:24

P10

So, or the deduction code.

268

00:28:27

P10

So maybe that information needs to be auto filled just for convenience, because you'll be going back and forth

269

00:28:34

P10

like, I'm gonna have to screenshot the file number or copy the file number, which I don't even think you can copy and paste in the app. So

270

00:28:43

P10

maybe that information needs to be automatically filled in. For convenience. If you're clicking through the app,

271

00:28:53

P10

the rest information, first, st name, last name, phone a standard

272

00:28:57

P10

and what amount you want to pay. So that's that's pretty straightforward.

273

00:29:03

Emily

Okay, and let me let me have you switch back to the figma app. Just wanted to have you look@thisfirstst

274

00:29:13

Emily

Okay? Actually hold on just a moment because switch head to. You know.

275

00:29:18

Emily

this. Does this a lot hold on a second.

276

00:29:20

Emily

I'm gonna send you a different link in the zoom, chat.

277

00:29:26

P10

There should be one that yeah, so tap that second link.

278

00:29:32

Emily

It'll just be a slight shortcut to where I want us to go.

279

00:29:42

P10

Okay.

280

00:29:42

Emily

Okay, so tap on payments again, and then overpayment debts.

281

00:29:52

Emily

review details

282

00:29:58

Emily

and resolve debt and then pay online. Just going to get you back to the screen that you were okay. This one. Yes. So my hope was that this screen would stay when when you came back to Figma. But that doesn't always happen. So talk to me about I know you said that it would be convenient for things to Autofill

283

00:30:18

Emily

if they were not. If you were, if you just had this information. And then we're, as you said, going back and forth. Talk to me about how you might do that what sort of experience that might be.

284

00:30:32

P10

Like, I said. I don't think you can.

285

00:30:34

P10

If I held the number just to copy it. Can I do that?

286

00:30:38

P10

I don't think you can copy and paste in the app.

287

00:30:41

Emily

I'm not sure. Well, especially not here. This is Figma. So I'm actually not sure but it was so.

288

00:30:45

P10

Would that be something.

289

00:30:46

Emily

You. Oh, sorry! Go ahead.

290

00:30:48

P10

I don't think you can, for sure.

291

00:30:52

Emily

What? So, knowing that you're not able to copy what else do you think you might? You might do if you were trying to pay.

292

00:31:00

P10

I'll just have to. Just switch screens, you know.

293

00:31:06

Emily

Remember the number type it in. It doesn't.

294

00:31:11

P10

Apps. When you go back and forth it'll remove the numbers.

295

00:31:15

P10

It'll start you over so hopefully. That doesn't happen.

296

00:31:18

Emily

Good point. Okay. Yep.

297

00:31:19

Emily

I also hope that would not. Not one that would not would not happen. Okay, okay.

298

00:31:27

Emily

and then, so okay, we're we're gonna pretend that you have made the payment after you have made the payment, what would how or what? What would you expect to see, and how quickly with with within the app, after you've made that payment.

299

00:31:47

P10

Some type of payment confirmation.

300

00:31:50

P10

I would like to receive an email saying that.

301

00:31:55

P10

your payment was processed. And then when I go, if I go, maybe the balance is reduced.

302

00:32:15

Emily

Okay,

303

00:32:19

Emily

And then oh, I forgot to ask question before since we talked about getting help in terms of payment plans or disputing debts.

304

00:32:30

Emily

How or or had you been aware that there are options like that.

305

00:32:36

P10

No, I did not know that.

306

00:32:38

Emily

Did not. Okay, got it?

307

00:32:40

Emily

And then ask another question that I asked before if the app were to be built just like this, how you're seeing, and that that includes the having to go back and forth between a browser and the mobile app to pay. How likely do you think it would be that you would use it, as is.

308

00:33:02

P10

Well, I mean, that's the only option that you have, and it's the most convenient. I would definitely just go through the process.

309

00:33:10

P10

yeah, I would just go through the process if that was the most convenient option versus going to a browser.

310

00:33:18

P10

Or or talk to someone on the phone. This, I think, is sufficient enough.

311

00:33:26

Emily

Okay, got it. And then how about comparing the 2 versions that we've seen with this one version, one being here where there is the payment option that you'd have to switch back and forth, and the 1st option sorry, the 1st version being where there were not any mentions of payments. Which one do you think you would be more likely to use? And why.

312

00:33:48

P10

Yeah, the second one for sure, because it gives itemized information and options to resolve.

313

00:33:57

P10

However, you choose to. So definitely the second option is better.

314

00:34:01

Emily

Okay, got it.

315

00:34:03

Emily

It's good

316

00:34:04

Emily

and maybe a tap back after overall question. Other thoughts on anything we're seeing here. It could be any additional information you might want to have, or any clarity, or the naming of anything.

317

00:34:26

P10

The only thing, I think, would be a little confusing for veterans who never seen this information before is the deduction code.

318

00:34:36

Emily

Hmm.

319

00:34:39

P10

But but if you're you know you have school benefits and stuff like that you should be aware

320

00:34:49

P10

of

321

00:34:50

P10

all this information as far as like payments. If you did did get overpaid for something. And you know what

322

00:35:01

P10

program you're using.

323

00:35:02

P10

So chapter 30, chapter 31 program that you're enrolled in. So that's all.

324

00:35:11

P10

Everything else good.

325

00:35:14

Emily

Okay, sounds good. And I'll quickly go through another section and maybe you tap on the payments again.

326

00:35:25

Emily

All right. And we're gonna I know you said. You've only had one copay that you can recall. We're gonna pretend that you have Copay. So let me have you tap into the copay information.

327

00:35:36

P10

Okay.

328

00:35:38

Emily

And then thoughts on overall the information presented here. What do you think would be important for you to know.

329

00:35:49

P10

So how's the Va where the copay occurred? Looks like you can redo review the details on what it was for.

330

00:35:58

P10

You can pay the bill.

331

00:36:02

P10

Yeah, this looks pretty straightforward.

332

00:36:05

Emily

Okay?

333

00:36:06

Emily

And for that the the top one, the James A. Haley hospital. What information specifically for that one? Would you need to know.

334

00:36:21

P10

Well, maybe the you can have have the date that the debt occurred.

335

00:36:30

P10

Maybe that is that up under review details.

336

00:36:32

Emily

Yeah, yeah, if you sorry. If you if you want to tap into that, you can see if that that shows you things that you would be looking for.

337

00:36:41

P10

Yes, so it does have that

338

00:36:45

P10

as a medication that you were charged for, and everything. So yeah, this this looks pretty straightforward.

339

00:36:54

P10

it looks like. Also you can. I don't know. The account number was that for, but looks like you can copy that information directly from that which is cool and you can download a statement.

340

00:37:07

Emily

All right

341

00:37:09

Emily

regarding the the statements. Are our statements something that you use could be in really any aspect of your life. Now.

342

00:37:19

P10

For sure. Always download anything I have just to keep on on record in case anything happens.

343

00:37:24

Emily

Got it. Okay? And is that something? You might do from the app, since there, there's the the statements here.

344

00:37:32

P10

Yeah, cause. Now, I can download my benefit verification letter and stuff like that through the app. So having access to these Pdfs immediately it it. I think it makes everything more clear and concise and straightforward.

345

00:37:48

Emily

Okay, great and let me have you tap into that. Pdf, since we've we're talking about that just to get a sense of what is here, and what might be useful for you.

346

00:38:05

P10

I mean, this is an invoice. So. I think this is good. I mean, you can't have everything listed. It has education listed.

347

00:38:19

P10

I don't. If you're paying by mail, you can enter this information. So that's I mean, this looks pretty great. Let me see if there is a

348

00:38:29

P10

Where is it? Oh, so it gives you where to mail it to, and everything like that. So.

349

00:38:35

P10

yeah, this is, I mean, I would assume this would help a lot of veterans with

350

00:38:45

P10

this process, because it it gives you a formal formal documentation on everything. It's like receiving a bill that you for these or whatever. So yeah, I think this should help a lot of veterans

351

00:39:01

P10

that might have overpayments or copays.

352

00:39:07

Emily

Okay, got it all right. You can press done there.

353

00:39:13

Emily

Okay, and then

354

00:39:17

Emily

if you were to, we're going to pretend that you see an error, for, let's say, one of those prescriptions you're sure that you didn't order or didn't didn't arrive. What would you do in that case, knowing that there was an error on this.

355

00:39:33

P10

So you're talking about, for under the statement charges.

356

00:39:37

Emily

Yeah. Yeah. So let's say, like that that. That second medication was something that that you didn't order or or didn't arrive, or something. What what would you do? In that case?

357

00:39:48

P10

I would definitely click it

358

00:39:50

P10

if I could click it and.

359

00:39:53

Emily

That that top one you should be should be able to click. So we'll we'll pretend that you did not actually go to that doctor appointment if you wanna. So I think that one you can click into.

360

00:40:05

P10

Yeah, I would want some type of way to I guess. Dispute.

361

00:40:10

Emily

Okay.

362

00:40:12

P10

Or let them know not receive something like that.

363

00:40:19

Emily

And and what sort of information would you be looking for? In order to do that.

364

00:40:25

P10

So once I click it.

365

00:40:29

P10

Well, I don't know if I if if it's not clicking

366

00:40:34

P10

if there was a way to confirm that you received medication.

367

00:40:43

P10

Or confirm, or deny something like that.

368

00:40:46

Emily

Okay, got it.

369

00:40:49

Emily

Okay, let me have you go back to Copay Bill, just on the upper left there to get one screen back there you go alright.

370

00:40:59

Emily

Any any any place here you might expect to find any like any sort of contact information that we were like we were discussing a moment ago.

371

00:41:10

P10

Well, it should be in on the it's on the Pdf. Right now. I saw it on the Pdf.

372

00:41:15

Emily

Okay. Yeah.

373

00:41:17

P10

So I mean, that has all the information you're gonna need.

374

00:41:25

Emily

Okay?

375

00:41:26

Emily

And then let's pretend that you are ready to pay this. Walk me through what you would do in this case. And again, like before, not going to have you enter in any real information at all.

376

00:41:40

P10

Okay.

377

00:41:46

P10

yeah, it gives you 4 different options. So

378

00:41:56

P10

so I will say that maybe some older vets will probably prefer prefer to pay by phone or mail or in person.

379

00:42:06

P10

Younger bets will, you know, probably definitely opt into the pay online. So

380

00:42:12

P10

I guess it really just depends on the age demographic, on which one, but it definitely gives you 4 options.

381

00:42:19

P10

So, so.

382

00:42:22

Emily

So let let me let me have you go through the process for for paying online.

383

00:42:27

P10

Okay.

384

00:42:35

Emily

And we have you tap on. Continue to the form. We'll just skip over this.

385

00:42:46

Emily

So really, the yeah, so that that middle section there. Yeah. Thought, oh, yeah, yeah. Go ahead.

386

00:42:55

P10

For the account number.

387

00:42:58

P10

Yeah, that's like the same thing from before.

388

00:43:03

P10

Having to remember this number.

389

00:43:08

Emily

Okay, and let me have you switch back to Figma.

390

00:43:11

Emily

With any luck it will stay where we left it. Let's see if that is the case.

391

00:43:19

P10

No.

392

00:43:20

Emily

Nope, go back to go back to zoom.

393

00:43:26

P10

But those.

394

00:43:58

Emily

Okay. And yeah, there we go. Copays review details.

395

00:44:07

P10

Yeah, but you can copy, you can copy this. So, yeah.

396

00:44:10

Emily

Right? Yeah, yeah, I just want to get back to that.

397

00:44:11

P10

Oh, I mean.

398

00:44:15

P10

that's good. Yeah. You can at least copy the number and copy and paste and enter it in. Only thing is like, I will say that

399

00:44:26

P10

when you copy it and then paste it. Is it gonna try to fill in one cell? Or is it gonna automatically add the numbers to all the cells.

400

00:44:36

Emily

The goal is

401

00:44:37

Emily

into all 5. That's a very good question. So I know I know we wanted to do that. I'm not a developer, so I don't know the details of how possible it is. But that's what we want.

402

00:44:47

P10

Yeah, that's possible. I've seen it before, but some web, some websites don't have that functionality.

403

00:44:54

P10

Go into the 1st sale, and then you have to like.

404

00:44:58

P10

delete everything and then enter everything separately. So as long as you copy this and

405

00:45:04

P10

it fills in all the cells on the on the other page. It should be fine.

406

00:45:10

Emily

Okay, got it? Yep.

407

00:45:11

Emily

okay. So those those are my questions here. Anything else to add regarding the stuff that we've looked at, or maybe anything you haven't mentioned on things that could be useful in regards to the finance stuff here.

408

00:45:31

P10

So on this page right here the co-payment.

409

00:45:34

P10

It doesn't have the amount.

410

00:45:37

P10

It doesn't have any information.

411

00:45:40

P10

So so maybe you want to make a partial payment.

412

00:45:45

P10

Or you forgot the total. I don't know so it should at least should have the total amount owned owed, and then you enter the amount you want to pay. So having some type of

413

00:46:00

P10

some type of information on the payment page, so so it's easier, I guess.

414

00:46:09

Emily

Yeah, okay, got it?

415

00:46:10

Emily

Any? So yeah, that's that's a very good point. Anything else that that could be useful from the app.

416

00:46:28

P10

No, I think that's I think that's pretty. That's pretty much all.

417

00:46:34

P10

Okay. They give you a number at the bottom. Give you the hours you can contact. So.

418

00:46:40

Emily

Yeah.

419

00:46:40

P10

And then you're setting the total.

420

00:46:45

Emily

Okay, great so we're at time here. I'm gonna check in with my colleague, Natalie. If you have any questions you can unmute and ask, now.

421

Emily

## P11 Transcript

0:00:02

Emily

Yeah. And I'm just gonna ask you again just to confirm. So it's on the record. Now that we are recording, are you? Okay? If I record the audio and visual today.

3

0:00:10

P11

Yep, that's fine.

4

0:00:12

Emily

And are you okay? If I potentially show any clips to our Va partners.

5

0:00:16

P11

Yes.

6

0:00:17

Emily

Great. Thank you so much. Okay, so now on to the discussion. First, st I'd love to know a bit about yourself as a veteran. This could be. Whatever you're comfortable sharing don't have to go into much detail at all. It could be what branch you served in when you retired or separated. Things like that.

7

0:00:35

P11

Sure I was [redacted] from 2,003 to 2,015, including [redacted], and then got out entirely for several years, and then in 2019, joined the [redacted] Reserves.

8

0:01:03

Emily

Oh, okay.

9

0:01:04

P11

Yep.

10

0:01:05

Emily

And then how about any sort of experience you've had with the Va.

11

0:01:12

P11

So for va healthcare I

12

0:01:18

P11

trying to think I applied pretty soon after I got out because [redacted]. So I've had va health care for, I think, 9 years now. And it's how I get all of my healthcare, and then I've also used the gi bill.

13

0:01:39

Emily

Got it? Okay? And then how about any experience you've had with the Va website and or mobile app.

14

0:01:47

P11

I use. I do not use the mobile app, but I use the website all the time. My civilian job is, I work on ships out in the middle of the ocean, and so, being able to use the messaging and having all my digital health records is gold, because otherwise there's no way I would be able to communicate with my doctors, or get anything set up.

15

0:02:10

Emily

Okay, got it

16

0:02:11

Emily

alright. And so you said you you do not use the mobile app. Any any specific reason? You don't use it.

17

0:02:17

P11

I don't have cell service out at sea.

18

0:02:20

Emily

Good reason not to. Okay.

19

0:02:24

Emily

All right. So now we're going to move to the financial portion of the discussion, and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are comfortable. I have 0 information about any sort of financial records, anything related to really anything about you regarding the Va. So first, st I know, I said. We're going to get to medical payments in just a moment first.st Have you had any experience with owing the Va. Money in regards to any benefit overpayments?

20

0:02:53

P11

I got a notice at 1 point when I used the the gi bill that they had changed their formula, and they were

21

0:03:01

P11

like I owed them X amount of money. It wasn't very much, but then that there was some legislation that it was forgiven, and they were just sending me a notice to let me know, so it was very kind of complicated, but in the end I didn't have to send them any money, which was very nice.

22

0:03:17

Emily

Okay. And was this all in a letter, or how? How did you get the information.

23

0:03:21

P11

Yeah, they sent me a letter in the mail, which again is complicated because I work on ships out at sea. So I think by the time I it even reached me. It was months after the fact.

24

0:03:32

Emily

Okay? And was this? And so I know you said, it was forgiven. Was this all in one communication, or were there multiple communications.

25

0:03:40

P11

Well, I read it all at once, because I only get my mail every few months. It might have been 2 separate letters, but I recall that I learned about it all at the same time.

26

0:03:54

Emily

Okay, that makes sense. Alright. And then how about any experience you have with medical co-pays through the Va.

27

0:04:04

P11

Yeah. So that got that's been messy again. I

28

0:04:09

P11

it. It'll be really nice when it's all digitized, because they send a paper bill, and by the time I get it it's usually past due, and it's very. It's very frustrating, like. The copayments are very small, but it's very frustrating. At 1 point I had to. I was traveling, and I had to go to urgent care.

29

0:04:32

P11

And I went. I jumped through all the hoops, which is really difficult when you're trying to. You know, you're having a medical emergency. The last thing you want to do is spend hours on the phone like before you can even get treated. But I jumped through all the hoops, and then they didn't pay anything. And so that was months and months of trying to get that sorted out and sending letters, and part of it worked, and part of it didn't. And that was really frustrating. And then

30

0:04:59

P11

another experience. I had [redacted] while I was on active duty. So there's [redacted] things I have to do every year. And it's in addition to the normal types of screenings, and so I quite often have a [redacted]in the same year. And

31

0:05:21

P11

oh! What happened was, I went for the [redacted] and the Iv failed, and so they had me come back a couple of days later, and it was referred out, and so, because it showed up as doing the same service twice within whatever the billing period was, I got a bill for the second one that was like $6,000, and it took a long time to get it sorted out that like, yeah. Actually, your Iv failed. And that's why I had to come back like, I'm not gaming the system.

32

0:05:50

P11

But that again. It's really difficult, because you're trying to make all these phone calls that go on for hours and hours. And I'm not retired. I don't have hours to sit around. I'm on a boat in the middle of the ocean. I have to use a satellite phone, so anyways.

33

0:06:04

Emily

Okay, and are you?

34

0:06:05

Emily

You? So now you said you you were, were you receiving letters for each of these bills for for for the co-pays?

35

0:06:15

P11

So for the normal copays they just send a bill in the mail, but it's very erratic like sometimes it can be months before. Like, say, for example, I'm actually seeing my doctor today, and I had a [redacted] yesterday. It might be 2 or 3 months before it even I even get a bill in the mail, and then

36

0:06:36

P11

it's like, by the time I receive it, it's already past due, and certainly by the time I, my mail catches up with me. And so I end up making a lot of phone calls trying to figure out like, is it coming? How much do I owe, and then sometimes it's

37

0:06:52

P11

like I can't figure it out, and I consider myself a reasonably smart person. But sometimes I get charged a copay, and sometimes I don't get charged a copay, and I know during Covid they waived a lot of it, but I think it's back.

38

0:07:04

P11

But then I haven't been charged recently. And so that's further complicated. Because then I don't get a bill. And I'm like, do I actually owe something? And it's past due. And I'm going to pay penalties on it, or is it not being charged? Am I just missing the bill? It's very complicated. Luckily the amounts are relatively small, but it's it's a degree of frustration. I wish I didn't have to deal with.

39

0:07:26

Emily

Okay, got it. And then what? are there other things besides these physical letters that are prompting you to make payments.

40

0:07:37

P11

Well, as I said sometimes, just because in the past I know there's a copayment for, say, a medication or a certain type of visit, and I know that I have consumed those services and not received a bill, and so I don't want to have to pay penalties or have it go to collections or go on my credit record. So I will call and try to figure out how much I owe. But that's like

41

0:08:03

P11

extremely complicated, too. There's not a simple way to just look up a bill.

42

0:08:08

Emily

Okay.

43

0:08:09

Emily

got it? So I'm I can guess a few things from my next question of how? How could things be made easier.

44

0:08:18

P11

I mean, I would just put it. We already have the digital, everything. I would put everything in there. I keep hearing like there's a way to do that, but it's not set up yet.

45

0:08:29

P11

And so, yeah, I would just put everything in there digitally and have it connect to pay.gov, and then you just pay your co-pays right there, maybe even get some sort of push notification or email that tells you like, Hey, your bill just posted. Go take a look at it. That that would be fantastic.

46

0:08:50

Emily

Yeah. And are you so when you do make payments? Are, are you making that through pay.gov? Or is that when you're calling.

47

0:08:58

P11

Yes, I make it through pay.gov whenever I can, unless I don't have a paper bill, or I don't have the information that I need to be able to pay through pay.gov.

48

0:09:08

Emily

Okay. Got it all right. Well, I'm sorry for all that frustration that.

49

0:09:13

P11

Okay.

50

0:09:13

Emily

Sounds good whatsoever. So let me have move on to the next section. Let me have you share your screen.

51

0:09:22

P11

Alright. I don't know how to do that.

52

0:09:24

Emily

Yeah. So if you tap in the middle there, you should have some options at the bottom, one of which should say the word share.

53

0:09:31

P11

Okay, got it screen.

54

0:09:35

Emily

Yeah, share screen.

55

0:09:40

Emily

Alright. There we go, and you can just tap anywhere outside of that. There we go. Perfect. Okay, and now, let me have you open up the figma app

56

0:09:55

Emily

alright and go to log into figma. I'm going to give you a test account here. Yep, continue there.

57

0:10:03

Emily

Okay, the email is VA test 0 0 0@gmail.com.

58

0:10:17

Emily

And the password is VAVA, VAVA.

59

0:10:23

P11

All lowercase.

60

0:10:24

Emily

All sorry. Yes, all lowercase.

61

0:10:27

Emily

Okay. And then I need to get you the code. So give me just a moment for that. My email to refresh. Come on, there we go, all right. And the code is 7, 9, 7,

62

0:10:41

Emily

2, 8, 4, 8.

63

0:10:49

Emily

Okay, and continue with mobile app.

64

0:10:55

Emily

All right. Now I'm gonna send you a link in zoom.

65

0:11:00

Emily

So go back to Zoom to get the yeah, there we go, Emily. There we go.

66

0:11:08

Emily

tap on the extra long one there, perfect. Give it just a moment to load there.

67

0:11:23

Emily

Okay, great. Oh, and then something I forgot to clarify. So when you're on when you are out to see is there a

68

0:11:33

Emily

pew? So yeah, yeah, you use satellite service when you're are you on a computer? If you want to log into anything.

69

0:11:41

P11

Yes, yeah, there's no Wi-fi because of secure like cyber security issues.

70

0:11:46

Emily

Oh, got it? Got it? Okay.

71

0:11:47

P11

So yeah, I can log into a computer. And then I have to use a CAG reader to get into the like VA system.

72

0:11:56

Emily

Okay, got it? Got it? Alright. Okay. So we're gonna here we are on your pretend mobile app, or you can just tap anywhere outside of the the little blue dots here. Perfect. So before I have you tap on anything, you can scroll around, but just don't yet tap into anything. Where would you expect to find medical copays here on this pretend app.

73

0:12:26

P11

I might go to health.

74

0:12:29

Emily

Health. Okay. Got it any other

75

0:12:34

Emily

sound? A little hesitant there. So other other sections you might. You might go to.

76

0:12:40

P11

I might try payments.

77

0:12:42

Emily

Okay.

78

0:12:44

P11

It's very confusing, because I would expect something to say something like bills.

79

0:12:48

Emily

Hmm, okay.

80

0:12:49

P11

But I don't see anything that says bills. It's definitely like a benefit that sounds like, you know, a a Va loan or something and a claim. It's not a claim. It's not an appointment. It's not a message.

81

0:13:04

P11

It's not a disability rating

82

0:13:06

P11

to me. A payment is like people who receive, you know, disability payments from the Va. That's not me. So yeah, I'm not really seeing anything that that jumps out to me. I would want it to say something like bills.

83

0:13:20

Emily

Okay, great. Well, let me have you tap into the payment section.

84

0:13:26

Emily

Okay? So now that we're seeing this, thought, and we're gonna in this, in this scenario, we're going to pretend that you do also have an overpayment debt.

85

0:13:37

P11

Okay.

86

0:13:37

Emily

Thoughts on what information is shared here under the payment section.

87

0:13:45

P11

Yeah, I guess

88

0:13:46

P11

I would make it clearer, like, divide it up by category. So it says, Copays. But I would make it really clear. It's like for healthcare.

89

0:13:55

Emily

Oh, okay.

90

0:13:57

P11

I guess the word copay is associated with healthcare, but in my mind I'm looking for like something healthcare related.

91

0:14:03

Emily

Hmm, okay.

92

0:14:05

P11

Because I don't really other than I use the Gi bill for like a month

93

0:14:12

P11

but other than that.

94

0:14:14

P11

like, I'm not either. I'm not eligible for the other stuff, or I don't use it. And so I, yeah.

95

0:14:21

P11

okay.

96

0:14:22

Emily

And okay. So you'd want copays renamed something that had to do directly with healthcare.

97

0:14:28

P11

Or have it have like a heading above it, or something that says, like Va health or something, you know. Divide it up like

98

0:14:35

P11

gi Bill, va loans disability va health. Whatever.

99

0:14:40

Emily

Got it. Okay, that makes sense, and then thoughts. So I know you said that the word payments was confusing, that you would prefer something like bills. Any any any further thoughts on the title of the section. Now that you're seeing seeing what's inside.

100

0:14:59

P11

yeah, maybe. I mean, if they want to combine payments that are being sent to me along with payments that I have to send to them. Maybe something like financial.

101

0:15:11

Emily

Okay.

102

0:15:14

Emily

makes sense. Okay, and then I'm gonna have you tap into further in just a moment. But 1st so for the the section under where it says, Copays thoughts on anything else you might. What is that where it says? 2 50 due for 2 bills. Anything else you might want to know when you 1st tap into this page.

103

0:15:35

P11

Yeah, I wanna know what the date is that it's due. So it should say, like, due

104

0:15:40

P11

August 1, st 2025, or whatever.

105

0:15:44

Emily

Okay, you want to know due date. Okay? Anything else. At this point you'd want to know.

106

0:15:49

P11

No, that's okay. I just wanna know, like, how long do I have to pay it?

107

0:15:54

Emily

Okay, yeah. Makes sense. All right. Let me have you tap into Copays here, and then let me get your thoughts on looking here, on. How clear it is what you currently owe in this pretend scenario.

108

0:16:19

P11

Yeah, I think this makes sense. I'm assuming that when I click on the review details, it's gonna tell me what the service was in like what the total charge and what my co-payment would be. One thing that

109

0:16:33

P11

now again, maybe it's in the review details, but I

110

0:16:38

P11

would want I need a place where I can get like a Pdf copy of the bill. Because I have

111

0:16:47

P11

like Hsa, and so I can get things reimbursed through there, but I need to be able to submit, not just my payment on it. So I submit the pay.gov receipt, but I also need to send them a copy of the bill, and it can be digital

112

0:17:05

P11

But there needs to be a clear way that I can like download it.

113

0:17:09

Emily

Hmm, okay. And when you download it, what, specifically, would you be doing with it next, knowing that you'll have to submit it.

114

0:17:18

P11

Well, I work for the Federal. So it's through Fsa Feds. But I have to take the digital file and upload it to that. And I think it's similar for people who have other types of Hsas as well.

115

0:17:31

Emily

Hmm, okay. Got it.

116

0:17:33

P11

There's a portal that they would have to upload it to.

117

0:17:38

Emily

Okay. And do you know, if that's something you would be able to do from the phone like, if you were to be able to download the Pdf. From the app.

118

0:17:46

P11

I honestly don't know, because I don't do a lot of stuff on my phone. Since I'm out at sea. I'm assuming the Fsa Feds website has also a mobile app or well, I know I could log in from my phone. The thing is that everything has changed now for all the different logins, and you have to use your cat card for everything. So

119

0:18:07

P11

it's really hard unless you get a Cac reader for your phone. That's why I just do everything on a computer. Well, it's 1 1 of the reasons I do everything on my computer.

120

0:18:17

Emily

All right. That makes sense. Okay, so we're going to look at just this top one here, the James A. Haley Veterans Hospital. Excuse me so if you can tap into it, since you've already mentioned the review details. But what, specifically, would you be looking for? And are things here that you would be looking for.

121

0:18:38

P11

So the current statement is good. That's how where I could get the Pdf, and

122

0:18:43

P11

I could just email it to myself. So even if I download it on my phone, I could email it to myself. And then I could access it from any computer.

123

0:19:06

P11

I assume that this top link is a way that takes me to pay.gov or some other way that I could pay it online.

124

0:19:14

P11

And then I assume that each of these

125

0:19:18

P11

charges I can get more information on.

126

0:19:21

P11

for example, how much the total charge was, what my copay was, how much was written off, etc.

127

0:19:28

Emily

Okay, so I think just that top one is actually filled out. If you want to tap into that and just see I'm sorry. The the top

128

0:19:36

Emily

the outpatient care. Yeah.

129

0:19:39

Emily

Thoughts on info here, and what you would be looking for.

130

0:19:43

P11

Yeah. So this seems really vague. What I what I'm used to seeing is.

131

0:19:50

P11

and maybe this is like, I don't know. Maybe there. This is all there is, but I'm used to seeing like there's a total amount. And then there's like what your copay was or there's like more specifics about what you actually did.

132

0:20:05

Emily

Okay.

133

0:20:07

P11

Like what the I forget what the word, what the but there's like a code like a billing code.

134

0:20:13

Emily

Oh, sure. Yeah.

135

0:20:14

P11

Yeah.

136

0:20:15

Emily

Okay, so you want more information here.

137

0:20:18

P11

Yeah, this seems really vague.

138

0:20:19

Emily

Vague. Okay, too vague. Got it. Let me have you go back to Copay Bill. You can tap on the other. We go perfect. Okay? So you would. You would. Also assume that there'd be a place to pay. Let's say there

139

0:20:34

Emily

was not. What else might you want to do from this section of our pretend app.

140

0:20:43

P11

If there's not a way to pay.

141

0:20:45

Emily

Right.

142

0:20:47

P11

Well, I would want there to be a link, I mean, with the account number here.

143

0:20:52

P11

I could go to pay.gov, and just enter this information.

144

0:20:58

P11

but I don't think the average person

145

0:21:01

P11

would remember that. That's how they could do it.

146

0:21:04

Emily

Okay, got it.

147

0:21:11

Emily

And let's say we're going to pretend here that

148

0:21:17

Emily

you see an error in, let's say, like one of the prescriptions listed was something you didn't actually take, or what wasn't prescribed, or something. What would be your next step if you saw that there was an error in this particular bill.

149

0:21:34

P11

I assume it's with request help. But to me request help is like

150

0:21:40

P11

I need a payment plan, and I can't pay it rather than

151

0:21:44

P11

like. There's a problem with my bill.

152

0:21:46

Emily

Hmm!

153

0:21:50

Emily

And so what? What would you be looking for? And and you can tap into anything you're you're saying.

154

0:22:00

P11

Oh, well, that's useless.

155

0:22:06

P11

yeah, honestly, at this point, I mean, I would just be calling like the Va. Number, which isn't even listed here. So that's kind of frustrating. Maybe I would tap up here.

156

0:22:17

Emily

Okay.

157

0:22:19

P11

You have questions.

158

0:22:24

P11

Yeah, I guess I would do that.

159

0:22:35

P11

yeah. Again, it seems a little too complicated. Like.

160

0:22:39

P11

if I have a problem, I should just be able to like.

161

0:22:43

P11

click a button next to it, and then it

162

0:22:47

P11

like a dispute. This charge button and I click it, and then it like immediately takes me. Ask me, do I want to like chat with someone, or do I want to?

163

0:22:56

P11

You know, go get on the phone with them.

164

0:22:59

Emily

Hmm, okay.

165

0:23:01

P11

It. It seems like too laborious. There's too many buttons to push and like things to navigate.

166

0:23:07

Emily

Okay. So, too too complicated to get to the help you might need.

167

0:23:12

P11

Yeah. Like for each of these charges, you should have a couple of buttons, or maybe if you swipe left or right, some things pop up that, say, like, pay this bill, dispute this charge

168

0:23:26

P11

like request, help paying this bill, or something like that, or payment plan, or something like that.

169

0:23:31

Emily

Okay, got it?

170

0:23:34

Emily

And then

171

0:23:36

Emily

Since you had started mentioning like having trouble paying the bill. Things like that. Were you aware that there were options to to request help for paying a bill.

172

0:23:49

P11

I mean vaguely.

173

0:23:51

P11

it's not something that has been a concern of mine, except when I got the [redacted] bill that I wasn't supposed to get. I was like, Yeah, there's no way I'm gonna pay this one.

174

0:24:03

P11

But yeah, it's not. I mean, Va, health care is extremely affordable. And so

175

0:24:12

P11

for me personally, it's not an issue. But I could understand. I mean, there's homeless veterans who are accessing services, or very low income seniors and disabled people and whatnot, so I can see that it could be difficult for other people.

176

0:24:27

Emily

Okay, good. And when you said you were vaguely aware that there are options, do you recall how you 1st learned even even if it was vague.

177

0:24:36

P11

Oh, goodness, no, I I really don't. I mean, I might have read a news story, or I I couldn't tell you.

178

0:24:43

Emily

Okay, no problem. Alright. So we're gonna pretend that this was built in real life, and with all the the things that you had mentioned such as

179

0:24:57

Emily

I'll let you.

180

0:24:59

P11

Oh, let me send them to the voicemail.

181

0:25:04

Emily

Okay.

182

0:25:05

P11

Let me get back in here.

183

0:25:08

Emily

Okay? So yeah. So we're we're gonna pretend that the app was built as is meaning it. Multi like the things you had mentioned. It takes multiple steps to get any help. There's not any direct link to pay. How likely do you think it would be? You would be to use it.

184

0:25:31

Emily

While you're on land, I should say, knowing that it's not not easy otherwise.

185

0:25:40

P11

I mean, I might look it up just to see what I owe, because I'm not aware of a current way to do that within the website,

186

0:25:49

P11

and to get my billing statements if I needed to submit those like. If nothing had showed up in the mail, and I needed a billing statement, or I was curious. If something even got billed or not.

187

0:26:03

P11

I would use this simply because there's no other way to do it, but

188

0:26:08

P11

I would definitely prefer, if it was just in a section of the website.

189

0:26:14

Emily

Got it. Okay?

190

0:26:16

Emily

And then I know you had mentioned like having the the statement. Pdfs, to be useful if you were looking at older statements. Where would you expect to find those.

191

0:26:29

P11

Oh, goodness!

192

0:26:33

P11

Down here where it says, Pdf. Statements.

193

0:26:37

Emily

Okay. Thoughts on the clarity of that. How easy or difficult it would be to find those.

194

0:26:46

P11

I would just change the label and say something like

195

0:26:50

P11

previous statements or older statements, or something. That's that's what I'm used to seeing like on financial websites. Or you know, my cell phone bill, or something like that.

196

0:27:01

Emily

Okay, makes sense.

197

0:27:03

Emily

Okay, let me have you tap the payments. Button on the lower right i'm going to get you to a slightly different section. Okay? And then scroll all the way to the bottom. And then the blank gray area. Tap into that once

198

0:27:17

Emily

beautiful. Okay, scroll down and tap back into copays.

199

0:27:22

Emily

All right. So again, slightly different. Here again, we're going to look at the James A. Haley hospital again if you want to tap into that, and just see

200

0:27:33

Emily

how how this, how this one compares in terms of the information you would want and the things you might want to be able to do from here.

201

0:27:45

P11

So this is interesting that you can copy the account number, because when you go over to the

202

0:27:51

P11

unless, it's changed in the past couple of months. When you go to the Va. Or P. Sorry pay.gov website, you have to individually enter each collection of numbers and letters.

203

0:28:03

P11

so I don't know that it helps that you can copy. Because even if you go over to that website, you have to individually enter, you can't just paste everything into one box.

204

0:28:12

Emily

Yes, the the hope is that that you will

205

0:28:14

Emily

be able to paste once, and it entering into all 5 boxes. But let let's pretend that does actually work that way.

206

0:28:22

P11

Oh, that would be helpful, I, like that, you can hit pay bill, yeah, that's nice

207

0:28:48

Emily

So for the the the payment. Let me have you walk me through what? And again, I'm not going to have you enter any actual information, I promise, but walk me through what you would do if you were, let's say, ready to make a payment on this particular bill.

208

0:29:06

P11

So I would go to pay Bill here, and then I would tap the one that says Pay on pay.gov.

209

0:29:10

Emily

Okay. And and you can go ahead and do that.

210

0:29:20

Emily

And I'm just gonna have you scroll down. I'm not. Gonna have you read anything. Yeah, and go to continue to the form.

211

0:29:27

Emily

all right and scroll down. So yeah, so I know you said, there's there are the 5 parts to the account. Number.

212

0:29:35

P11

Yeah, so I would. Sorry. I would wish that like this should all be pre filled for me.

213

0:29:40

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay.

214

0:29:42

P11

Right cause. It's tedious. Why should I have to re-enter all of this or that? If I enter my account number that then that would pre fill it.

215

0:29:52

Emily

Hmm,

216

0:29:54

P11

It's very tedious to enter all this, and then I'm always worried that I've like entered something the wrong way.

217

0:30:02

Emily

Okay, all right. So you want things pre-filled.

218

0:30:05

P11

Yeah, I mean, still, the ability to edit it if you needed to, but just like to prompt, that's pre-filled. And then the other thing that's always I've found annoying is the Payment information section.

219

0:30:16

P11

I think it should be similar to like. When you get your credit card bill, you try to pay your credit card bill online. So you have an option where it's like current balance, last statement balance, or you can enter some other amount or like minimum payment or something. It should give you some prompts, because again.

220

0:30:35

P11

one of the issues that I've had is like, I pay off the most recent bill. But then it turns out there were other charges on there, and I have to go back in and pay. It's like I just want to pay everything at once, like it's just. It's a pain in the ass to keep going back and like making more payments. I just want, however much it is. I just want to pay it.

221

0:30:54

Emily

That makes that makes sense.

222

0:30:56

P11

So, being able to prompt some options, would, I think, be very helpful.

223

0:31:02

Emily

Okay, I'm gonna have you switch back to the figma app and let's see if figma

224

0:31:07

Emily

sleep. Okay, so tap on, go back and then close.

225

0:31:12

Emily

So any other thoughts. I know you certainly already explained. You would want things pre-filled. You'd want the amount to give you the options of specific amounts any other thoughts, especially regarding flipping back and forth between an app and then a browser to get to pay.gov.

226

0:31:33

P11

I mean.

227

0:31:34

P11

right? We're supposed to be in like a digital age. It would be nice to just pay in the app like, have it linked to pay.gov. And so it you're just doing everything in the app. My other question is that if you're gonna pay your bill, say, by, I think these other options like phone or mail, if you're gonna pay by phone like.

228

0:31:55

P11

does it immediately connect you to somebody? Or does it just take you to some endless phone tree, and you have to push a million buttons and hope to God that you'll reach someone before like you heel over and die. I.

229

0:32:06

Emily

Okay, got it?

230

0:32:08

P11

What? Well.

231

0:32:09

P11

I would want it what I would. If I'm gonna pay by phone, I would want it to like

232

0:32:14

P11

like immediately connect me to the billing department, and then, not just like in the background, have me on hold, and then like, notify me when somebody's there. Not that I have to really do anything, or wait around, or whatever.

233

0:32:31

P11

Yeah.

234

0:32:31

Emily

It's I should tap on pay by phone. I I don't actually remember what the information. Okay, so it's 3.

235

0:32:37

P11

It's very unhelpful. Okay.

236

0:32:40

Emily

So you you'd wanna know that you're specifically calling the billing department.

237

0:32:45

P11

Yeah, I mean, I think it should connect me like one touch, right? I've already told them that I want to pay my bill. It should be that I just push once, and it

238

0:32:55

P11

like contact me immediately.

239

0:32:57

Emily

Okay.

240

0:32:58

P11

To the right person, and maybe has some kind of pop up that says, like your estimated hold, time is X amount.

241

0:33:06

Emily

Hmm, okay, got it.

242

0:33:09

Emily

I'll maybe tap back there, all right, great. So, again, i'll ask this question, like, I did before pretending that things were built like you're seeing here.

243

0:33:21

Emily

How? What's the likelihood that you would use it with things being as they are here.

244

0:33:37

P11

yeah, I again like, since I have to enter all this stuff by hand on the pay.gov website, it's faster for me to do that when I have a keyboard than to like do it all with my thumbs on a phone. So

245

0:33:52

P11

I

246

0:33:53

P11

you know the value of having a little mobile device like this and having apps is that everything should be more streamlined and interconnected, and you shouldn't have to be typing long essays with your thumbs. So yeah, I don't know that I would be doing

247

0:34:08

P11

that.

248

0:34:10

Emily

Okay, got it. And then how about comparing this version? Or I'm gonna have you compare this version versus the previous one that didn't have any payment link

249

0:34:20

Emily

like. Which which one do you think you might be more likely to use.

250

0:34:25

P11

Yeah, I mean, this one definitely has more features, useful features. So that's good.

251

0:34:31

P11

This is an improvement.

252

0:34:32

Emily

Alright, good.

253

0:34:35

Emily

Alright sounds good. And any other thoughts on could be the labeling, or just any other information presented here that we haven't already gone over.

254

0:34:54

P11

I think this part where it says, pay or request help is kind of useless.

255

0:34:59

Emily

Hmm, okay.

256

0:35:00

P11

Because

257

0:35:01

P11

I would expect that if I click on this down arrow right? It says, pay or request help by July 30.th

258

0:35:09

P11

Well, then, I open it, and it just says you have to pay a request help by July 30.th That's not adding any value to this. If I click the down button especially. They put it like big, and it's a big deal.

259

0:35:21

P11

and they have a down button. I would expect the down button to say 2 things pay or request help right? Because that's what it's saying. Pay or request help. Otherwise, if it's just going to repeat what it's already said, I wouldn't make a down button. I would have it as a banner. That's like your your bill is due by, you know.

260

0:35:42

P11

If I'm going to open this up, I want it to. Then give me those 2 options. Either pay it, or here's a 1 click button that, you know takes me to someone that can help me with

261

0:35:52

P11

a payment plan. Yeah.

262

0:35:55

Emily

No, that makes sense. Got it? And then

263

0:35:59

Emily

compare what you're seeing here to. So I forget when, if you are logging into the website. Are you finding this type of information there? I know you said you're you're often calling them.

264

0:36:12

P11

Yeah, I have done now. Maybe it's changed in the past couple of months, so if so, then I'm not up to speed, but as of, say, 3 plus months ago.

265

0:36:24

P11

I would. I like, searched and searched and searched and searched and searched, and could not find anything, and finally made some phone calls, and they said, Oh, it's a future capability.

266

0:36:34

Emily

Okay, got it

267

0:36:36

Emily

all right. Let me have you tap on payments again on the lower right? I'm gonna have you go. So we're gonna pretend that you do have an overpayment debt. Only if you tap into that section and thoughts on what you're seeing here in terms of information that would be useful for you regarding the debts.

268

0:37:08

P11

I think this one here

269

0:37:10

P11

where it says disability, compensation, and pension debt. We're reducing your benefits each month until your debt is paid. I think that's too vague. I think it should say right here, like

270

0:37:23

P11

we're taking $50 out of each paycheck until it's paid it. Expect it to be paid off by this date, if you you know, if you don't

271

0:37:33

P11

send us more money or something, because I've had

272

0:37:37

P11

God bless the Federal Government! But they screw up my pay a lot for my civilian pay, and so sometimes they have, like an overpayment that that they are taking out of my paycheck, and it says they're like, you know, we're gonna take $500 out of each paycheck for the next 5 paychecks until this is paid off. Here's the total amount. Here's what's remaining, and that way you can at least plan

273

0:38:01

P11

like you know what your take home pay is going to be. So I think, especially for people who are getting disability, compensation or Va pensions. Those are usually people with pretty small incomes, and so they would want to know. It would be extremely important to them how much money is coming out of each check, and for how long.

274

0:38:22

Emily

Okay, so be super specific on what is being what is being taken out, just how long that will, that will last.

275

0:38:28

P11

Correct.

276

0:38:29

Emily

Got it. Okay, and maybe scroll to the top. We're going to look at one specific one, the Gi bill debt for housing, what information, and you can tap into it if you'd like, yeah, information that would be useful here if you had. If you had this debt.

277

0:38:53

P11

Are these links live? Can I open the letters.

278

0:38:56

Emily

Nothing is live here. But what would you expect to be? To be able to do.

279

0:39:03

P11

I would want to know like where this came from, because there's a thing that says, Why might I have this debt? Well, that just sounds like some generic information that's not specific to me. I would want to know exactly why like how this came to be which I assume is in these demand letters at the bottom.

280

0:39:25

P11

but yeah, I'd want to know exactly how they came to calculate it, because sometimes, like you get Gi. Bill housing overpayments if you know you didn't take enough classes, one semester or something, and so maybe it's possible that their records are wrong.

281

0:39:44

P11

I mean, maybe I actually owe them the money. But oftentimes there's some sort of communication problem. So I would want to know exactly what's going on here, so that I would know if it

282

0:39:56

P11

if it's real or not like, if it's accurate or not.

283

0:40:00

Emily

Yeah, okay? And and you would you would expect to find that in the debt letters, or was it somewhere else you would expect to find that information.

284

0:40:07

P11

Well, I think this. Why might I have? This debt is useless. I don't. I don't want like speculative, or some like dissertation on why people might have housing debt like I just want to know why I have housing debt.

285

0:40:21

Emily

Sure.

286

0:40:22

P11

And maybe how I could prevent it in the future if it was. For example, you know the the timing of of classes or something. Maybe there's a way I could stack my classes, so I don't have this type of debt in the future.

287

0:40:36

Emily

Okay, got it? Got it alright. And

288

0:40:42

Emily

we're going to pretend so like, let's say you don't believe you owe this this debt, for whatever reason. What would be your next step?

289

0:40:56

P11

I mean, it says here, resolve, debt. I don't know what that means. I would want to say like dispute, debt.

290

0:41:03

P11

cause resolve sounds to me like some sort of payment.

291

0:41:08

P11

and if I don't believe that I owe it in the 1st place, I don't.

292

0:41:14

P11

I don't really see an easy place where I could dispute it. That's the word I would look for is dispute.

293

0:41:20

Emily

Okay. So billing for a dispute. Okay.

294

0:41:23

Emily

how about if you

295

0:41:26

Emily

we're pretty sure you do owe it. But just need to need need some help with extending the payments. Where might you? Or what? What would be your next step in that situation?

296

0:41:37

P11

See again. I'd want to be able to push down on this

297

0:41:41

P11

drop down and have a button that says like payment plan, or you know, because it says request financial help. But then there's no obvious place here where you can actually do that. So that's just annoying, like you need to request help. But, haha! We're not going to tell you how to do it.

298

0:42:02

Emily

All right. Got it?

299

0:42:04

Emily

So let's pretend that you are ready to make a payment. What would you do in that case?

300

0:42:12

P11

I guess.

301

0:42:16

P11

Gosh!

302

0:42:18

P11

I don't like this word resolve.

303

0:42:20

Emily

Hmm! I.

304

0:42:21

P11

Feel like it should be broken down into like, make a payment, request, help, dispute, charge.

305

0:42:34

Emily

thoughts on, yeah, on, on what? You what? Your what? Your steps would be. If you if you do want to make the payment.

306

0:42:41

P11

I would go to this route. Yeah, resolve debt and pay online.

307

0:42:47

Emily

Okay.

308

0:42:48

P11

I just don't.

309

0:42:50

P11

I would break it down here.

310

0:42:52

Emily

Okay, you want.

311

0:42:53

P11

Instead of like you tap on it first, st and then you get these.

312

0:42:56

P11

I I would say I would break it down right here and have it like, make payment.

313

0:43:03

P11

dispute, debt, like request, payment, plan, or something, or request. What does this say?

314

0:43:10

P11

Request help? That's kind of vague. Yeah, I would have like request, financial assistance, or something like that.

315

0:43:18

Emily

Okay, got it.

316

0:43:20

P11

Request. Help is really vague like that could be anything from.

317

0:43:24

P11

I don't know why I have this bill to. I need to set up a payment plan to like. Is there some sort of grant or forgiveness? Or it could be any of those things.

318

0:43:34

Emily

Okay, got it? Let me have you go to that that request help

319

0:43:44

P11

see that's what I was looking for

320

0:43:48

Emily

so it sounds like you would want each of these things broken out on the previous page.

321

0:43:54

P11

M.

322

0:43:55

P11

Yeah, or at least like a link that takes me to the next page. That shows me this information.

323

0:44:02

Emily

Okay, got it.

324

0:44:14

Emily

And then so yeah, any any further thoughts on that. Besides that, you'd want that sooner rather than having to go through. Request help 1st to get here.

325

0:44:27

P11

I mean, my other thought is just right. The the government is very lumbering. And if you compare this, say to a credit card website.

326

0:44:37

P11

There's not so many steps involved, right? Like request, a payment plan. Well, here's 6 million ways. You can talk to somebody like

327

0:44:45

P11

it should just be like request, a payment plan. All right, let's start doing the steps of it, you know, or like dispute this debt. Well, now, there's some whole other process like it.

328

0:44:58

P11

The there shouldn't be so many steps. If I've already said I want to dispute it. I should immediately be able to, whether it's file a form or talk to a human being chat or on the phone like it should just take me right there. I don't. There's too many steps.

329

0:45:15

Emily

Okay, got it. Let me have you close that

330

0:45:20

Emily

and then, yeah, close that, tap into review, details

331

0:45:26

Emily

and then let me, have you? Pretend that you are gonna pay? I just want to get you through the

332

0:45:33

Emily

yeah. Go to pay online. There we go.

333

0:45:48

Emily

Now, have have you been to this site before.

334

0:45:55

Emily

Happen.

335

0:45:55

P11

Don't think so.

336

0:45:57

Emily

Okay, got it. So let me just have you. The the pay online button, the teal one on the lower left.

337

0:46:04

Emily

Tap into that and then scroll down.

338

0:46:10

Emily

Yeah. So the the section where there are a bunch of form or fields to fill out. Rather, yeah thoughts on the required fields here, and just how easy or difficult would be to to find that information.

339

0:46:27

P11

Yeah, again, I feel like this should be pre-filled, or it should be within the app.

340

0:46:32

P11

It's a pain in the ass to go back and forth between the 2, and like which deduction code and God bless the government! There's it's just way too complicated.

341

0:46:43

Emily

Got it. Okay, let me have you switch back to the figma app.

342

0:46:48

Emily

There we go. And yeah, just hit go back.

343

0:46:51

P11

Like the way to fix the government is not to fire all the people. It's to like streamline operations.

344

0:47:01

Emily

So so, even though it is not the easiest to go back and forth thoughts on the information here, and and knowing you would, you would have to be entering this information over in the the payment site.

345

0:47:19

P11

Yeah.

346

0:47:23

P11

I don't know. I'm trying to think of a way to make this easier, like a button that would let me screenshot it or.

347

0:47:31

Emily

Okay.

348

0:47:32

P11

Or something, so that, or maybe just say like, make it clearer, like

349

0:47:41

P11

the form does not pre fill. So you'll either need to write this down or toggle back and forth just to warn me, because, honestly, I would probably just write all this down on a piece of paper, so I don't have to toggle back and forth.

350

0:47:54

Emily

Okay. So so specifically call out that the form was not, will not remember this information.

351

0:48:00

P11

Yeah, like, it says you'll need to provide these details. But.

352

0:48:05

P11

I think I'm not really fully grasping that I need to write everything down, or that I'm going to need to toggle back and forth in the digital age. I'm like, yeah, yeah, okay, right? Just take me to like where I put my credit card information in, you know, and to then have to like. It's not even a mobile enabled website, like the type is super small. I got to zoom in.

353

0:48:31

Emily

Yeah, yeah, okay, got it. That makes sense.

354

0:48:35

Emily

Any any other thoughts regarding anything we we've seen here that you haven't mentioned in regards to finances. Here.

355

0:48:46

P11

Where it says, Pay online before I get deep into the weeds of pay.gov. I think it would be useful to say

356

0:48:53

P11

on this page what your payment options are like on pay.gov, you can use a credit card you can use. Ach! You can use what right like I think it should tell you right here so that you're not.

357

0:49:07

P11

You don't go through some laborious process and then find out that whatever method you thought you were going to use for payment isn't even accepted, because within pay.gov, depending on the agency and the type of payment you're making, there's different options like, sometimes you can pay with a credit card, sometimes you can't, sometimes you can use Paypal, sometimes you can't. So I think it should be obvious here. So you're not wasting time or so that you can get your information ready before you go down another rabbit hole.

358

0:49:37

Emily

Okay, so prepare you more for what exactly is gonna happen next, and what you need to need to have.

359

0:49:43

P11

Yeah, like what your financial options are. Because, say, for example, you plan to pay by credit card, and it says on this page, credit cards not accepted. Well, then, you probably have to go like you're not even ready to make that payment. It might be a few days, because maybe you have to move money between accounts, or maybe you decide you're just going to write a check, or maybe right like, if you're one. If you were planning to pay by one method, and that method's not available. You're probably not ready to pay.

360

0:50:12

Emily

Yep. Makes sense.

361

0:50:13

Emily

Okay. Any any other thoughts here?

362

0:50:20

P11

I think that's good.

363

0:50:22

P11

Okay, I do.

364

0:50:23

P11

I would. I don't know. It, says person entitled, maybe that's the exact language used on the Va website.

365

0:50:33

P11

That to me that's confusing, I would say, like beneficiary. Maybe.

366

0:50:37

Emily

Okay. Yeah.

367

0:50:41

Emily

Okay.

368

0:50:42

P11

Person who received, or the person who owes the money, or the person who's account, or like account holder. Maybe.

369

0:50:50

P11

Yeah.

370

0:50:52

Emily

Okay. So you want that spelled out a little more clearly.

371

0:50:55

P11

Unless that's specifically the title of the box. Then I'm gonna fill in over@pay.gov got it?

372

0:51:02

P11

Yeah.

373

0:51:03

Emily

Okay.

374

0:51:05

Emily

I'm going to check in with my colleagues if they have any other questions. If anybody does, you're welcome to unmute and ask. Now.

375

0:51:21

Emily

okay, I'll take that as a no, that those are all my questions. I really appreciate your time. This is, it's always super important to talk directly with veterans and understand their experiences, and got lots of very thorough information from you. So thank you for being so detailed and all of your feedback. It is going to be very helpful. And I

376

0:51:42

Emily

thank you for your time. I know I know Paragene is going to be reaching out to you soon, regarding next steps on their end, but otherwise I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

377

0:51:54

P11

Alright. Thank you so much. I'm really. I know there were some contract disruptions. I'm glad those got ironed out, and you guys are still out there doing this stuff and.

378

0:52:01

Emily

Nice.

379

0:52:02

P11

It's reassuring to know there's still people like software engineers on the staff. So thank you very much. I mean, it's very. It may seem like somebody's, you know, pork project. But these sorts of things really do make it life a lot easier for veterans.

380

0:52:19

Emily

Well, I appreciate you telling us that.

381

0:52:20

P11

Thank you so much. Have a good day.

382

0:52:23

Emily

Bye-bye.

## P12 Transcript

1

0:00:00

Emily

So it

2

0:00:02

Emily

3

0:00:10

P12

Yes.

4

0:00:11

Emily

Okay? And are you okay? If I potentially share any clips from our discussion today.

5

0:00:17

P12

Yes.

6

0:00:18

Emily

Okay, if if you want, I know the your video is having trouble. If you want to just turn off your video, that's totally fine.

7

0:00:24

Emily

I know I thought it was kind of

8

0:00:26

Emily

turning off and on, so just have it off. It'll be even easier if you want.

9

0:00:31

P12

Okay, I know I was I was downloading the figma app at the same time.

10

0:00:36

Emily

Oh, oh, that's probably why, okay, cool. That's fine. So 1st in love to know just a little bit about yourself as a veteran in whatever level of detail, is comfortable for you. What branch you served in when you retired or separated.

11

0:00:50

P12

I was in the [redacted] for 9 years. I was a [redacted] and I got out in 2022.

12

0:00:59

Emily

Okay, got it.

13

0:01:01

Emily

And what sort of experience have you had with Va. Since then?

14

0:01:07

P12

I have gotten

15

0:01:10

P12

100% of my care there, especially the [redacted] So yeah, I get all my cover, even cover coverage with the Va. [redacted]

17

0:01:41

Emily

Okay. Cool.

18

0:01:41

P12

Pardon.

19

0:01:42

Emily

Got it? Great? And then what sort of experience have you had using the Va website and or the mobile app.

20

0:01:51

P12

I usually use the website more. But I still use the app if I'm needing to know information. But

21

0:02:01

P12

I can probably tell you how to do everything on the app and the website.

22

0:02:07

Emily

Hmm, okay. And in what instances are you choosing to use the app as opposed to the website?

23

0:02:14

P12

Like if I need. If I'm on the go, and I need to cancel an appointment, or I need to message my provider or reschedule it. Let them know that I can't. I'm running late. I can message my provider, cancel my appointment. I could look at my upcoming appointments to put on my calendar, or to let [redacted] know if I'm on the go, and I don't have my laptop with me.

24

0:02:37

P12

And for my medication. I usually use that to refill my medication.

25

0:02:43

Emily

No go ahead!

26

0:02:44

P12

And to see when how many refills I have until my prescription expires.

27

0:02:50

Emily

Okay, so is it more. So you're using it when you're on the go.

28

0:02:55

P12

One word.

29

0:02:55

Emily

Y'all getting more so when you're on the go.

30

0:02:58

Emily

Okay. Great.

31

0:02:59

P12

Yeah, like, sometimes questions come up and [redacted] like, Hey, do you have any appointments? I'm like, I'm usually really good at keeping them on my calendar, but I always like to double check.

32

0:03:08

P12

Especially if I get an email saying, Hey, you have a video call 14 days. I'm like what I do. How come? That's not my calendar. And then I look. And I'm like, Oh, yeah. And so yeah, it's just a quick look. But most of the time I use my laptop if I'm home.

33

0:03:23

Emily

Got it. Okay? Great. Okay. So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion now. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you're willing. I have 0 information about you or your finances with the Va. So 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money specifically in regard to any benefit, overpayments.

34

0:03:44

P12

Yes.

35

0:03:45

Emily

Okay, and whatever level is any details you'd like to share, you don't have to.

36

0:03:51

P12

Oh, yeah, so I had registered for class when I was [redacted], because I mentally thought I was prepared for class again.

37

0:04:00

P12

I was wrong, like I had the 1st day of orientation, and I was like, I don't have the capacity to do this like [redacted], and the Va. Had already paid my tuition and had already paid me my Mha. Benefits for housing allowance, and I had to

38

0:04:23

P12

let them know that I dropped the class within the grace period. And so by that time they already paid me my book stipend and my

39

0:04:34

P12

housing allowance. And then they had paid my tuition. So I had to send emails out. And then I had a bill for everything, the book stipend and the housing allowance that I had to pay back.

40

0:04:48

Emily

Oh, God, okay. And do you recall how you were notified? Of everything that you had to pay back.

41

0:04:55

P12

I received a letter.

42

0:04:58

P12

I received a letter.

43

0:05:01

P12

I think I think it was, an I'm pretty sure it was a letter.

44

0:05:04

Emily

Okay.

45

0:05:05

P12

It could have been also an email. But I know for a fact it was a letter, for sure.

46

0:05:11

Emily

Okay, great and then how? As a while, while you were paying this, off, do you recall what had had had prompted you every time you did make a payment. If there was

47

0:05:24

Emily

yeah, like, how how you knew when you had to make one.

48

0:05:28

P12

I think the the paper gave me instructions. Go to the website.

49

0:05:33

P12

And then I went to the website. And then I was looking at.

50

0:05:36

P12

What was it that I owed for, and what they were accounting for? And then I don't know if that was a

51

0:05:43

P12

time restriction. I just usually.

52

0:05:46

P12

if something's on my radar, then I keep it on my calendar, and I know when to make a payment towards that

53

0:05:54

P12

bill, so I don't really, if you're asking about a reminder, I don't really remember. I can't say yes or no.

54

0:06:02

Emily

Sure that's fine. Alright. So so you said you you put things on your calendar like when you have to. Okay, got it.

55

0:06:08

Emily

Okay? And then how what methods had were were you using to pay off the debt?

56

0:06:17

P12

You mean like, if I use like a credit card or my bank account.

57

0:06:20

Emily

Yeah, or I, I, if you like, called someone or went in somewhere like, Yeah, what.

58

0:06:25

P12

So I went on the website, paid it with my credit card, and then they actually gave me a confirmation that I saved on my computer, and then they also sent me, which was nice. They sent me a physical copy to my address. With your my debts have already been paid. It says you've paid your Va. Debts. And then here's like the paper confirmation. So that was really nice to get other than having like what they gave me online, just to have a physical copy from the Va.

59

0:06:55

Emily

Okay? And was there also any sort of confirmation online in addition to that letter? Once you had paid it off, there was okay.

60

0:07:01

Emily

Got it. Thoughts on how any of the if if there is anything that could have made that whole process any easier for you.

61

0:07:18

P12

no, I think it was pretty straightforward on the blanks that you were supposed to fill out.

62

0:07:24

Emily

Okay.

63

0:07:26

P12

If I remember correctly.

64

0:07:28

P12

They were specific instructions on how to what to put in the blanks to fulfill that bill for cause. It was for education benefits. And I guess there's there's bills for other things. And so you have to be very specific whenever you're making those payments.

65

0:07:45

Emily

Oh, yeah, okay, yep, I know what you mean.

66

0:07:47

Emily

Okay.

67

0:07:49

Emily

And then have you? I know. So I know you said you do your healthcare through. Va, do you? Do you have experience with medical co-pays

68

0:07:59

Emily

through that? No, okay. Got it all right.

69

0:08:04

Emily

Alright. So let me have you

70

0:08:08

Emily

Share your screen. Let me know if you need help doing that.

71

0:08:24

P12

On my phone before.

72

0:08:27

Emily

Yeah, if you tap it once at the bottom, there should be an option that says, Share.

73

0:08:31

P12

Oh, yeah, I see it.

74

0:08:32

Emily

Thank you.

75

0:08:33

P12

Okay, share, screen.

76

0:08:35

Emily

Green yep.

77

0:08:37

P12

Strip broadcast.

78

0:08:39

P12

Okay, I think it's.

79

0:08:42

Emily

There we go. Yep, okay. And then you can perfect. You've read my mind all right. And now now I'm going to have you open up the figma app. Yep, all right, perfect, and let me have so go to. Oh, if you want to swipe my video just off to the right. Just so you have or left. Yeah, either way. Okay. So go to log into figma.

80

0:09:05

Emily

Yep, continue there.

81

0:09:08

Emily

Okay. And the email that I'll have you enter in is VA test 0 0 0.

82

0:09:19

P12

Cool.

83

0:09:19

Emily

At gmail.com

84

0:09:26

Emily

and password is VAVA. VAVA.

85

0:09:34

Emily

Okay. And that's I need to get you an authentication code. Give me just a moment. Okay, so the now the number you'll type into the authentication code 2, 6, 5,

86

0:09:47

Emily

0 8, 2, 9 perfect. Alright log in

87

0:09:53

Emily

and then continue with mobile app.

88

0:09:59

Emily

Okay? And then I'm gonna send you a link in zoom. So let me have you switch back to zoom and get a link that

89

0:10:10

Emily

I had sent you.

90

0:10:12

Emily

Yeah, just tap once in the middle you'll have the there we go. Yep, and then hit the chat with the little red button.

91

0:10:19

Emily

a red circle.

92

0:10:20

P12

Sure.

93

0:10:21

Emily

Yep. Tap the very long. URL.

94

0:10:28

Emily

Okay, hopefully, that'll come up soon.

95

0:10:33

Emily

All right, perfect. If you want to swipe my my video out of the way again. Just so you have more screen space. Okay? So we have. Your pretend va mobile app here, you can tap just outside of that blue area like, yeah, perfect.

96

0:10:48

Emily

Okay? So so first, st without tapping, I think you can scroll. But don't yet tap on anything. Where

97

0:10:56

Emily

from here would you expect to find specifically for overpayment benefits, information on money that you owe like for for a particular debt.

98

0:11:08

P12

That's a good question, and let's see payments.

99

0:11:14

Emily

Yeah.

100

0:11:15

P12

Oh, right here, I guess. Overpayments, co-pays.

101

0:11:18

Emily

Okay, great.

102

0:11:20

Emily

Okay, let me have you go back to once. Yeah. Tap on it. Perfect. Exactly. Okay. So thoughts on how easy or difficult it was to to find that, or I guess how how logical or illogical.

103

0:11:33

P12

I think it was logical. Because it's under payments. Which that could go along with copayments, payments, direct deposit stuff. So I think it's in a good category.

104

0:11:45

P12

to access quickly.

105

0:11:47

Emily

Okay, would there be any other title that might make sense outside of payments, that, would still be useful or clear rather.

106

0:12:00

P12

Just no, I think without making it complicated. I think payments should have the all the

107

0:12:09

P12

payment related stuff.

108

0:12:13

P12

And it has overpayment titled. So I feel like it's pretty easy in that sense. But at 1st I was kind of like caught off guard and like. I don't know how to do this. I've never done this, but I was like, Well, I guess we can go under payments to see what

109

0:12:25

P12

my payment history is, because the history does show your overpayment, or what they've paid you. So that was my logic of checking payments, because I'm like, well, if I got overpaid, or if I have a debt, then it would show my Va payment history. And that's where I went, and then it showed overpayment.

110

0:12:43

Emily

Okay, got it great. So on on this page. The the information. That's right below the word overpayment debts, the 2760 due for 4 debts, thoughts on on that information. If there's anything else you would want to know specifically from this page before you dove into the details.

111

0:13:06

P12

No, I think it's pretty self explanatory.

112

0:13:09

Emily

Okay, got it? So yeah. Now, if you wanna tap into the overpayments.

113

0:13:15

Emily

talk to me about how clear it is, just from the information here on what you would currently owe in this pretend scenario.

114

0:13:37

P12

It looks like I owe

115

0:13:42

P12

It looks like there's 3 things I owe. I owe a debt for housing, compensation pension, and then looks like the gi debt for tuition.

116

0:13:51

Emily

Okay.

117

0:13:55

Emily

any thoughts on clarity here. Anything else you might want to know from from this level here.

118

0:14:22

P12

no cause. I think if people have questions on like.

119

0:14:26

P12

if I had a debt for housing, what does this mean?

120

0:14:30

P12

This is really helpful to know

121

0:14:34

P12

And hopefully they got a letter being more specific with why they have that debt. He dropped out of so and so university, or whatever

122

0:14:44

P12

during this time period, whatever the case may be. But I feel like that's really helpful if you go review details, and it says where I might have this debt if people had questions on why they had this. But that's what I was looking for. I was like. Well, if I wanted to know more information about why I have this debt, I would like to know where it's

123

0:15:02

P12

why. But this is perfect.

124

0:15:04

Emily

Okay, good. And would there be? Yeah. Thoughts on on specifically finding out like, why, you would have that debt, what? What might be your next step to to discovering that.

125

0:15:22

P12

Are you mean? Do you mean like? If I still had questions about why I still had a balance.

126

0:15:28

Emily

Yeah, yeah.

127

0:15:30

P12

I think that if I hadn't gotten a letter, and or if I don't know my situation, and I was completely caught off guard, I would call the number. There's a 1 800 Gi. Bill number. I'm not sure where it's at, but

128

0:15:45

P12

it's usually on our on our letters that we get. If we have any questions, let me see.

129

0:15:53

Emily

What would you? So what? What would you specifically be looking for here if you, if you knew you wanted to find out more information.

130

0:16:01

P12

I'd be looking for the 1 800 number like to call for my debt like if I had more questions. Aside from this maybe have the number down here.

131

0:16:14

P12

So that they have a resource to contact someone and talk to them directly instead of trying to look for it, or trying to look for their award letter. I would have like the number to the 1 800 Gi. Bill. Whatever the number is

132

0:16:30

P12

to talk someone to someone specifically about the issue.

133

0:16:33

Emily

Okay, got it? How about the the rest of the of the information that is here, what how useful is it, what what else might you expect to have outside of that phone number that you've mentioned.

134

0:16:58

P12

I think that's it.

135

0:17:04

P12

Cause it has everything here.

136

0:17:06

Emily

-

137

0:17:07

P12

That I would I would be looking for it has the letters that I'm guessing you can download if you need, or just to see

138

0:17:17

P12

Let's see.

139

0:17:21

Emily

Regarding those those debt letters so so you said you would you would expect to be able to download those.

140

0:17:30

P12

Yes.

141

0:17:30

Emily

Okay.

142

0:17:31

P12

I don't know if it's because, like, I'm on this the one that just doesn't

143

0:17:36

P12

that's just like a

144

0:17:39

P12

a trial one, but if this had the letters, I would expect to like click on it and view the letters.

145

0:17:47

Emily

Hmm, okay. Got it.

146

0:17:49

Emily

if if it were built exactly as you're as you're seeing here, whereas you notice you're not able to download – thoughts on how useful that might be?

147

0:18:03

P12

Hmm!

148

0:18:05

P12

I think would be useful if somebody was completely caught off guard, and they didn't understand why they were in debt. But I feel like, for example, my situation. I knew that I had dropped out of class, so I was expecting to pay some debt, so I knew ahead of time to be expecting a letter from the Va. And that should be

149

0:18:25

P12

majority of people's issues if they are in school, and they, specifically for school if they know that they dropped out of school during the semester, or whatever like. I feel like that's an expected that you should be expected to pay that, and I feel like that should be an expectation. So

150

0:18:41

P12

the letters it would be helpful. But also

151

0:18:47

P12

there's a lot of things that you have access to on the website that

152

0:18:51

P12

the mobile app is good just to kind of view real quick. And then, if they really need to see something I feel like a laptop or like getting on the desktop would be helpful. But

153

0:19:02

P12

then again, that's just me, because I like using my desktop more than my phone. My phone's just for quick references not to actually dig into a situation where I might already know the answer I just need to look like, hey? Did my payment go through? Did? Where's this late fee coming from? Like just real quick glances of my payment? Did it go through? How much do I have left? Not really like looking for my letters, but I can see the how that can be helpful. If someone was caught off guard and they didn't know why they had debt.

154

0:19:32

Emily

Okay, got it. So if we're

155

0:19:35

Emily

So if if the if just the the listing of the fact that there was a letter here, but you're not actually able to see it here. Thoughts on that, or just like what a next step might be if you see that there was a letter sent.

156

0:19:50

P12

I feel like it shouldn't show the letter there if you can't click on it and view on it, because I know some people might

157

0:19:59

P12

be like. Hey? They sent. They said they sent me a letter on June 16, th but I never received it.

158

0:20:06

P12

So then that would kind of be triggering to say that there is a letter that was sent by the Va. But they can't click and view it, and they haven't received it so that might be an issue.

159

0:20:17

Emily

Okay.

160

0:20:18

P12

People can run into if they haven't received it.

161

0:20:22

Emily

Okay, got it? Makes sense.

162

0:20:25

Emily

Okay, let me have you. Scroll back up and just any other

163

0:20:31

Emily

thing, you you might expect to to do here from this page.

164

0:21:03

P12

how do I request? Financial?

165

0:21:06

P12

Okay. Says, to avoid late fees or collection action, you must pay your full balance or request financial help. How do you request, financial help.

166

0:21:16

Emily

Okay as well. I'll turn that around. How? How would you? What? What would you be looking for if you did want to request help.

167

0:21:24

P12

I think that it would have a contact information or an email. Who would we be contacting? Maybe office hours.

168

0:21:34

Emily

Okay.

169

0:21:35

P12

Office hours, email, just just contact information.

170

0:21:42

Emily

Okay, so you want contact information there, got it?

171

0:21:47

Emily

And alright, we'll, go, we'll, we'll get back to that in a moment, but

172

0:21:52

Emily

if this, if the app were to be built as you're seeing now,

173

0:21:58

Emily

thoughts on how likely it would be that you would you? You would you would use it the way it's built here.

174

0:22:07

P12

Right now.

175

0:22:08

Emily

Yep.

176

0:22:10

P12

I would use it.

177

0:22:11

Emily

Okay.

178

0:22:12

P12

I would use it like, I said, as a quick glance to see my payments, my history, how much I have left and that's about it, and anything else like, if I need to grab letters or need to do something, I would use my desktop.

179

0:22:25

Emily

Got it. Okay, you'd go to the desktop. Then. All right.

180

0:22:28

Emily

Let me have you tap on the payment section again on the lower. Right?

181

0:22:33

Emily

Okay, and scroll all the way down to the bottom.

182

0:22:36

Emily

and then the blank gray area toward the bottom tap. Once on that

183

0:22:42

Emily

great and then tap into overpayment debts.

184

0:22:46

Emily

And again, we're going to look into so slightly different here again into that post. 9 11 Gi. Bill for housing thoughts on the information and and options. Here.

185

0:23:16

P12

Oh, I think this is really helpful.

186

0:23:18

Emily

Okay, can you say more about that.

187

0:23:30

P12

I think this is really helpful because it gives you a way to resolve an issue or get in contact with someone or steps to

188

0:23:41

P12

what to do if you wanted to start like

189

0:23:44

P12

a payment or a financial status report.

190

0:23:47

Emily

Okay. Great.

191

0:23:50

P12

Let's see.

192

0:24:13

P12

Oh, okay. Okay.

193

0:24:14

Emily

And if you actually stay, stay on that on that page just for a second, yeah, go back to yeah. There you go. I'm not gonna have you read all this, of course, but tap on the the pay online on the upper left the teal button. Oh, either one! Yep, and I'm not gonna have you enter anything in, I promise? But scroll down. And I'm gonna have you look at the yeah. So right in there, the section where you'd have to fill information out.

194

0:24:39

Emily

Love to get your thoughts on where, like, how? How you would get that information that you would need.

195

0:24:52

P12

from here.

196

0:24:55

P12

Cause. Yeah, this is what I was talking about earlier. Yeah, there's like a code. It shows it tells you exactly what codes to put in for your specific

197

0:25:04

P12

payment.

198

0:25:06

Emily

Yeah.

199

0:25:06

P12

Person titled. Yeah, it has all that information. But initially.

200

0:25:12

P12

the 1st statement says, you'll need to provide the following details to pay this debt online. And then it shows pay online. I hope that people don't just kind of go over that and just see that just information and just try to click on things that I feel like people should be very thorough on reading.

201

0:25:32

P12

But I feel like it's very easy to fill in that information if you read the 1st sentence.

203

0:25:39

Emily

Okay.

204

0:25:40

P12

If you read the 1st sentence, if you don't read the 1st sentence, you're probably gonna be like, what do I do here?

205

0:25:46

Emily

Thoughts on since you mentioned people could get confused thoughts on making that even more clear.

206

0:26:03

P12

I don't know. Maybe highlighted or put it in a different color. Maybe that would make it stand out more so people just don't look cause if me, I didn't even read the 1st sentence, but because I I knew like the I've done this before. But.

207

0:26:19

Emily

Okay.

208

0:26:20

P12

If I was a 1st time user, I would just be like, Oh, the 1st thing will catch my eye, was the current balance.

209

0:26:25

Emily

Okay.

210

0:26:26

P12

And the file number, and then all this information, and then

211

0:26:31

P12

maybe that sentence should be after.

212

0:26:35

Emily

Oh, okay.

213

0:26:36

P12

After instead of before. So that way, they are like, Okay, what I do with all this information.

214

0:26:43

P12

But yeah, that would be helpful to do it after, or maybe highlight. It.

215

0:26:48

Emily

Okay, got it. And then so provided someone know, like, you know, that you would need that information, thoughts on actually filling out that payment site. Knowing that the information you need is here.

216

0:27:05

P12

You mean how my thoughts on filling this stuff out right here.

217

0:27:10

Emily

Yeah. And again, I'm not gonna no, don't don't type anything. I'm not gonna.

218

0:27:12

P12

Model, yeah.

219

0:27:13

Emily

Anything. I don't want you to pretend to pay anything here.

220

0:27:18

P12

I think it's pretty straightforward.

221

0:27:21

Emily

Okay.

222

0:27:23

P12

Let me see.

223

0:27:29

P12

72 education.

224

0:27:32

Emily

What would be your process for specifically getting, let's say, the all all that piece of information into this site, like from the app into this payment site.

225

0:27:57

P12

I don't know. I feel like that wouldn't be safe.

226

0:27:59

P12

I mean, if somebody wants to pay someone else's debt. But I feel that if they, another thing that you could do is if they click on it, it could generate. But then it wouldn't go to this page. It would just go to the 1st page, and people would have to actually click on pay online to get to this part right here.

227

0:28:18

P12

And so the initial page might.

228

0:28:26

P12

yeah, I feel like you could just pay online and then read this stuff.

229

0:28:32

P12

Good job.

230

0:28:34

Emily

So if if you if you did did want to pay online, yeah, how? How exactly would you get? I think if there's like an account number or something. Knowing it's in the app, how? How would you then get that into the pay site here.

231

0:28:52

P12

Oh, just copy and paste it.

232

0:28:55

Emily

Okay, you copy and paste.

233

0:28:57

Emily

Okay, got it?

234

0:29:02

P12

Available.

235

0:29:03

Emily

Okay? So then,

236

0:29:05

Emily

if this, if if what we're viewing now is is built in real life, the the app. If you want actually switch back to figma. Just so we're looking at just the app perfect. Yes, if if it were built as is here with that link to the payment site and the information here. Thoughts on the likelihood of using it as is.

237

0:29:30

P12

As this part.

238

0:29:32

Emily

Yeah, that's the whole thing. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

239

0:29:35

P12

I would definitely

240

0:29:37

P12

use it if it had all this information, because there would no need to go to my laptop, because everything would be here.

241

0:29:45

Emily

Okay?

242

0:29:49

Emily

And then they can know the answer just to confirm so comparing the version this version here, where the there's the payment option versus the original version that didn't have any payment option. Thoughts on

243

0:30:06

Emily

which one you'd be more likely to use.

244

0:30:09

P12

Oh, I would for sure be likely to use this one because it's like a 1 stop shop.

245

0:30:15

Emily

Hmm, okay, okay.

246

0:30:20

Emily

And alright, and then any other thoughts on from this page any other information that would be useful for you.

247

0:30:34

P12

Nope.

248

0:30:36

Emily

Okay, great. Let me have you tap on payments in the lower right.

249

0:30:42

Emily

and then let's go to Copays

250

0:30:46

Emily

again. We're going to pretend that you have medical copays in this pretend scenario here.

251

0:30:53

Emily

Thoughts on oh, you know I'm sorry I totally skipped something. Let me have you.

252

0:31:01

Emily

go back to payments. I just forgot one thing and go back to overpayment debts.

253

0:31:07

Emily

So yeah, any just wanna make sure any other

254

0:31:11

Emily

thing to add, if you let's say we're

255

0:31:15

Emily

not sure you would be able to pay. I think we went through some of this before. But yeah, thoughts on where you'd be. Find that information just anything else to add, for how useful that would be.

256

0:31:28

P12

I think it's if I had questions, I would say resolved it, and then I would request help.

257

0:31:35

P12

And then it would give me

258

0:31:38

P12

a lot of questions or a lot of options to

259

0:31:43

P12

do whatever I need to do with whatever I felt like was I need to do for the debt. So I think this is really useful. That it's

260

0:31:53

P12

there.

261

0:31:56

P12

And that all the options are under there.

262

0:31:58

Emily

Got it. Okay, got it? And were you aware of any options like this of like disputing or or getting help financially?

263

0:32:14

P12

If I read my paperwork. Yes.

264

0:32:17

Emily

I know.

265

0:32:17

P12

I I cause I already knew I owed debt, and so I didn't need to dispute it. But I think on the paperwork there is a number on the letter that I can call to ask questions, and I'm not really sure if I'm sure that there was like

266

0:32:32

P12

a number to call for help to, or it was all the same, if I had questions regarding anything

267

0:32:39

P12

with the debt. So yes.

268

0:32:45

Emily

Okay, got it.

269

0:32:47

Emily

Okay? And

270

0:32:51

Emily

okay. Now, let me have you go tap on payments. We're gonna get back to the co-pays where I'd start to have you go. There we go.

271

0:33:00

Emily

So thoughts here again, pretending that you had some medical Copays thoughts on the information presented here, and just what you would find useful

272

0:33:28

Emily

for the statements. Do you? Are there any scenarios now where you are looking at statements? It could be with with anything financial in your life.

273

0:33:38

P12

Well, I look at the whenever I get community care through the Va. They send me the statements. I mean. Not that I have to pay. They're not bills. They're just like letting me know that

274

0:33:49

P12

I don't have to pay anything. So I still have to look at those statements.

275

0:33:52

Emily

Hmm! But.

276

0:33:53

P12

So I get those pretty often.

277

0:33:55

Emily

Okay.

278

0:33:57

P12

But

279

0:34:03

Emily

And thoughts on viewing a statement here within within the app.

280

0:34:08

P12

I think that's perfect. That it's here.

281

0:34:14

P12

As long as that. The date for the description is the date that they visited, or they received the medication, because I know sometimes those dates can be

282

0:34:25

P12

off, sometimes. And that confuses people, or I know that's confused me before, where the dates don't match up. So I'm like, Hey, I never went to this appointment on this date. But that's what the like

283

0:34:40

P12

community care paperwork says. So I just wanna make sure.

284

0:34:45

P12

Yeah, cause here it says the outpatient care was on June 20 second. And so it matches here. So they should know that that's the date that they had their appointment.

285

0:34:57

Emily

And then for the statements. I know you said so. You would look at them, view them. Would you be doing anything else with these statements?

286

0:35:06

P12

if I need to share some information with

287

0:35:12

P12

A doctor show proof that I did pay it. If they said I didn't pay it. I'll just keep it for my records.

288

0:35:18

Emily

Okay?

289

0:35:19

Emily

And what would be your process for keeping it.

290

0:35:24

P12

I would probably save it on my drive. But not download on my phone, probably on my computer.

291

0:35:30

Emily

Hmm.

292

0:35:30

P12

Or I probably print it, but if I don't.

293

0:35:39

P12

there's just so many letters I get from the Va. So I feel like they do. The Va. Does a really good job at making sure that there's paper copies of everything that you have.

294

0:35:52

P12

So as long as that the paper copies are sent out automatically, like they are, it wouldn't be nice to have it online for people that are more tech savvy? But I honestly just like the paper, because it's less memory on my phone or my computer. And I just have, I just have a file that I put on my Va stuff on there and just file it away and call it a day.

295

0:36:13

P12

Okay, good.

296

0:36:14

Emily

Okay.

297

0:36:15

P12

But I mean I can see how it could be useful just to kind of get an overview of all these individual

298

0:36:21

P12

charges.

299

0:36:25

P12

Yeah.

300

0:36:26

Emily

And then how about if you were looking for any pre like older statements.

301

0:36:33

P12

I think I'd go to Pdf statement.

302

0:36:35

Emily

Okay.

303

0:36:37

P12

Oh, yeah, it doesn't click. Yeah, go to Pdf statements. And hopefully, they have like, it's by date or time or appointment time or whatever.

304

0:36:47

Emily

Okay, thoughts on the ease or difficulty in in finding some of those older statements.

305

0:37:02

P12

Well, this person doesn't seem to have like a lot of stuff, but if I wonder what it would look like if there's like a max that's on this page before it gets to the bottom. Because if somebody did get seen pretty often, did they have to scroll like a long way before they get to the bottom, and would they know it's down there? So I wonder if there's like a limit on what they can see like 4 or 5 appointments until they get to the bottom. Cause I know that I get seen weekly.

306

0:37:28

Emily

Hmm.

307

0:37:28

P12

So if I were trying to look, I wouldn't want to scroll all the way down, because I'm like, oh, they're just appointments on appointments and appointments and appointments. So I think there should be a Max of how many they can see and then go to a different page, and then they can see the Pdf. Statements at the, so they know that there's things at the bottom.

308

0:37:45

Emily

Okay, got it? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay?

309

0:37:50

Emily

And then, so it's a similar question with the overpayments. Let's say, here, you noticed what you believe is an error could be like you didn't actually attend this, the particular appointment for the outpatient care. What would be your next step if you notice that that error there.

310

0:38:22

P12

I think I would click on the appointment, and then I would click on help.

311

0:38:31

Emily

okay.

312

0:38:32

P12

And then I would look at which one I if you can't pay future if you disagree with commate.

313

0:38:51

P12

Yeah, I think this is good information to have.

314

0:38:57

P12

Should it be a help at the top? I'm not really sure it should be

315

0:39:06

P12

What if somebody doesn't know that that's a option to click. I think it should be stated at the bottom. Like a link at the bottom. $20

316

0:39:18

P12

especially if somebody's not tech savvy, and doesn't know much about how to work apps. I feel like if there was a link at the bottom that took you to this page, or took you to something around this.

317

0:39:32

P12

where they can actually see the options. I think that would be more helpful to have at the bottom versus at the help button at the top, right.

318

0:39:39

Emily

Okay, so more more clear somewhere else. Okay, got it makes sense.

319

0:39:45

Emily

And then so let me have you walk through any, any other information that you would find useful here for this particular bill.

320

0:40:05

P12

I mean other than having the information like for pay your $50 bill to have it at the bottom of July 30, th like the the school that was at the bottom. They had the information rather than having the help button.

321

0:40:20

Emily

Oh, got it? Yeah, okay.

322

0:40:24

P12

I think that's more visible for people to see instead of trying to search for it.

323

0:40:30

P12

So I think that's another thing that

324

0:40:33

P12

would be useful if I said, Oh, wait! What do I do here? Okay, let me. Okay. How do I request financial help.

325

0:40:41

Emily

Okay, so is it right there? It's not clear how to request financial help.

326

0:40:46

Emily

Got it. Okay? Makes sense.

327

0:40:49

Emily

Okay? And let me have you. We're gonna walk me through what you do. If you are ready to pay this

328

0:40:57

Emily

again, not going to have you enter any real information.

329

0:41:01

P12

I'll click on pay and then pick either of these options. Is there a specific option you'd like me to pick for this.

330

0:41:10

Emily

Yeah, if you if you want to pay online

331

0:41:19

Emily

and I'll have you just scroll down. We're gonna not. Gonna have you read anything here. Go to continue to the form.

332

0:41:26

Emily

and from here scroll down just to get to the part where you need to enter information and and similar question as before with the overpayment of yeah, like locating that account number you need. How would you go about doing that?

333

0:41:44

P12

Oh, that's pretty useful.

334

0:41:48

P12

Cause I I know that the account number is here. Nice to copy.

335

0:41:55

Emily

Okay.

336

0:41:55

P12

And then paste it.

337

0:41:59

Emily

It won't actually pay something. But okay.

338

0:42:01

P12

Yeah, so it would be nice to paste it in. I like that. There's like this prompt up here. Where do I find my Va. Account number. I like that. It opens up, and it actually shows the statement.

339

0:42:10

Emily

Who.

340

0:42:14

P12

It actually shows the statement.

341

0:42:18

P12

but maybe a screenshot from would be helpful is here too.

342

0:42:25

Emily

You say more about that? About a screenshot.

343

0:42:27

P12

A screenshot of this area here and then highlighting the account number here, too, where they can copy it, maybe reminding them in that

344

0:42:36

P12

part where it says where to find it, and I click on that.

345

0:42:39

Emily

Where is he?

346

0:42:40

P12

This is very useful, too. But then, knowing maybe them knowing it's on their app, and they can copy and paste it, maybe showing them like the same screenshot of

347

0:42:50

P12

that homepage and showing them how to copy it. If that wasn't.

348

0:42:54

Emily

Okay.

349

0:42:54

P12

Option 2. But

350

0:42:57

P12

this is a good this is good to have, too, because I know that if you get a paper copy and you have it in hand, you can write it down, or you can pull it out and

351

0:43:06

P12

know where to exactly where to find it. So this is good. I just think that having the screenshot of this and knowing like, if they're using their phone specifically, and they don't have access to their document or going back and forth, flipping between pages, I think. Just having a screenshot of Hey, just a reminder. This is at the front of your page.

352

0:43:25

Emily

Okay, got it. Could there? Thoughts on anything be made more clear here on this page in terms of having to copy that account number.

353

0:43:37

P12

I feel like it's pretty straightforward.

354

0:43:41

Emily

Okay.

355

0:43:45

P12

Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

356

0:43:48

Emily

Okay, got it?

357

0:43:51

Emily

Any other? Excuse me, any other thoughts on

358

0:43:55

Emily

how things are labeled or structured could be either through the Copay information, or through the overpayment that you think would make things any easier, more useful.

359

0:44:08

P12

I think other the things I mentioned. I think those are it.

360

0:44:14

P12

But anything outside of that.

361

0:44:16

P12

I don't think that there's anything else I can add.

362

0:44:20

Emily

Okay, got it.

363

0:44:22

Emily

I'm going to check with my colleagues, see if they have any questions. So Charlotte and Tasha, if you have anything you would like to ask, go ahead and unmute and ask, now.

364

0:44:42

Emily

okay, I'm guessing. Not.

365

0:44:44

Emily

So that is all that we have here, unless you have anything else to add regarding your

366

0:44:51

Emily

You know any anything that could that could be made easier with finances here in the app here.

367

0:44:57

P12

No, I feel like that's really helpful under payments. And then having everything broken down here, and then

368

0:45:05

P12

every and then when you click on it. It goes to exactly the details. I think that's

369

0:45:10

P12

that's a really good idea.

370

0:45:12

Emily

Okay, great.

371

0:45:13

Emily

alright. Well, thank you so much for your time. It's always super helpful to to walk through things with veterans. Understand exactly how you might use things, what you would like, so we can continue to make things so. Thank you so much for taking the time. I know Para Jean will be reaching out for next steps on their end. There.

372

0:45:37

P12

Okay.

373

0:45:37

Emily

And otherwise. I hope you have a great rest of your day.

374

0:45:41

Emily

Okay, thank you. Bye.

375

0:45:42

Emily

Take care.

## P13 Transcript

1

0:00:00

Emily

On the record.

2

0:00:02

Emily

Ask again, so now that the recording is going, are you okay? If I record the audio and visual today.

3

0:00:09

P13

Sure.

4

0:00:10

Emily

Okay, great. And are you okay? If I potentially share any clips to our Va partners from this today.

5

0:00:16

P13

That's fine!

6

0:00:17

Emily

Okay, great, thank you.

7

0:00:18

Emily

Okay. So now we'll get started. So I'd like to know, just in whatever you're comfortable sharing anything about yourself as a veteran could be the branch you served when you retired or separated, etc.

8

0:00:33

P13

Yeah, I was in [redacted] from 73 to 77.

9

0:00:38

Emily

Okay, great. And what sort of experience have you had with the Va. Since then?

10

0:00:46

P13

I think it started. Probably

11

0:00:50

P13

yeah, 96 or so I had [redacted - health issue

13

0:01:03

Emily

Oh, goodness!

14

0:01:04

P13

Been using them ever since.

15

0:01:06

Emily

Wow, all right. And what? Hopefully, that healed okay for you.

16

0:01:13

P13

[redacted] are still in there.

17

0:01:16

Emily

Well, that's yeah. They've lasted a good while. So it's great.

18

0:01:21

Emily

And then what sort of experience have you had? If any, with the Va website, and or mobile app.

19

0:01:28

P13

The the website. I use quite a bit check or order medications. Check on appointments. Things of that nature.

20

0:01:36

Emily

Okay, great. And have you used the mobile app at all?

21

0:01:40

P13

No, very rarely.

22

0:01:42

Emily

Okay? When when you say rarely, what? What have you used it for?

23

0:01:47

P13

I think this is actually the 1st time I'm normally on my laptop.

24

0:01:53

Emily

Okay.

25

0:01:53

P13

So the the mobile app I downloaded it, and I think I I checked it, maybe once, just to make sure it worked, and other than that really haven't used it.

26

0:02:05

Emily

Okay, got it? Got it? Any any thoughts on if you might ever or like what's what might be preventing you from from using the app.

27

0:02:15

P13

It's just more convenient plus the the screen is a lot larger and easier to manage on the laptop than mobile.

28

0:02:23

Emily

Okay, got it. Larger screen. Okay? So now we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you're willing. I have 0 information about any finance, anything related or anything related to you and the Va. So first, st have you had any experience with owing the Va. Money for any overpayment debts.

29

0:02:48

P13

Yeah, I think this was about 2 years ago I had been getting a a va pension.

30

0:02:58

P13

What they didn't tell me at the time I had been approved for social security, disability

31

0:03:07

P13

and a va pension within months of each other. I don't remember which came 1st and which followed, but

32

0:03:15

P13

at the time I think it was about 58 when I started getting social security disability.

33

0:03:22

P13

Well, nobody ever told me that at 65. The disability payments change to retirement payments which makes the VA Pension income.

34

0:03:34

Emily

Hmm, okay.

35

0:03:35

P13

So at that point there was about 2 years worth of income from the Va. That they wanted to collect that was considered overpayments.

36

0:03:48

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay.

37

0:03:49

P13

Yeah, I think it was somewhere around [redacted - large amount]

38

0:03:53

Emily

Oh, my goodness! Got it!

39

0:03:56

Emily

And.

40

0:03:56

P13

Well, yeah, I had.

41

0:04:00

P13

I think this whole process was online, or pretty much all of it. I submitted a waiver, and I told them. You know what the the situation and circumstances were, and they ended up waiving the entire amount.

42

0:04:16

Emily

Oh, wow!

43

0:04:17

P13

So yeah, I mean, blew me away. But yeah, thank you.

44

0:04:21

P13

You god

45

0:04:22

Emily

Yeah, wow, do you recall how you initially learned about this? About the the dev.

46

0:04:29

P13

A letter in the mail.

47

0:04:30

Emily

Got it? Got it?

48

0:04:33

Emily

And then how

49

0:04:36

Emily

So you said any had. Could could there have been any way that things could have been made easier. From from the Va. Side with that whole.

50

0:04:44

P13

Yeah. If either the Va. Or social security had let me know at 65 that my status was changing, there would have been some time to make arrangements, but you know, just not knowing that having it happen. And then, 2 years later, coming back to collect over payments, it's, you know that's a hard thing to deal with.

51

0:05:08

Emily

Yeah, that I would agree. Yeah. And so when you when you had 1st called them

52

0:05:14

Emily

were had you? What was what was your thought? On what? What might be able to happen when you were 1st reaching out to them?

53

0:05:22

P13

Well, I did use the Va. And Google quite a bit to find out what my options were. I think they had mentioned something in in the letter that I could apply for a waiver of overpayment. So yeah, I followed up with that. And after I think maybe 6 months, 8 months somewhere around there. I got the letter back from saying that they had waived.

54

0:05:51

Emily

Got it okay? And before. And I. So you said in the letter, it said there was a possibility that you could apply for a waiver. Had you known prior to that that there was any sort of option like that? No, you didn't. Okay.

55

0:06:03

P13

Let me go!

56

0:06:04

Emily

Got it.

57

0:06:05

Emily

Well, I'm glad for you that it was. That's great news. And then on a different financial aspect. Do you have experience with medical Copays through the BA.

58

0:06:19

P13

Yeah. Once the they. They withdrew the payments for a pension. I had been in, I think they call it Group 3,

59

0:06:31

P13

where there were no medical copayments charged. And once I didn't have the pension anymore that took me out of that group, and then they started charging me co-payments which eventually

60

0:06:44

P13

you know, I asked them to waive those, and eventually, I got

61

0:06:50

P13

applied for when I got an aid and assistance pension which took away the medical copay

62

0:06:58

Emily

Oh, okay, got it. So you were so for a little bit you were had to pay. But but then.

63

0:07:02

P13

Yeah, I think for about a year.

64

0:07:05

Emily

Okay, got it? Got it? And do you recall like, while you were receiving these bills? How like how you were getting these bills.

65

0:07:15

P13

It. Yeah.

66

0:07:20

P13

they would send me

67

0:07:24

P13

I think they sent me something through the mail and through

68

0:07:29

P13

Internet. I believe it was called. It's been a while I believe. They would tell me I owed a certain amount and give me a itemized list of the medications and what the co-pays were, and and then there's they let me know about pay.gov.

69

0:07:50

P13

Which was how I could pay the co-payments. So I did that for a while, and

70

0:07:56

P13

eventually, when they did give me the new pension. There were no more co-payments to pay.

71

0:08:03

Emily

Okay, got it. So so you were. You were always paying them when you were you were you were paying them through pay.gov.

72

0:08:09

P13

Yes, sir.

73

0:08:10

Emily

Okay, got it. And do you recall like,

74

0:08:15

Emily

What prompted you to make the payment each time? If it was only yeah, if there was, if you were waiting for something particular of your.

75

0:08:22

P13

Yeah, it's just some at the end of the month. It was just one of the things that I added to you know to. It's gotta be taken care of. So.

76

0:08:31

Emily

Okay, and and we're.

77

0:08:33

P13

I just went down the list pretty much of creditors or bills. I had and they were in the list, so I just added them on.

78

0:08:45

Emily

Okay? And were you did you get a bill each month?

79

0:08:49

P13

Yes, ma'am.

80

0:08:50

Emily

Good. Okay, got it. And was that you said that was a physical letter, or I forget if you also said if there was something online.

81

0:08:56

P13

It was physically.

82

0:08:58

Emily

Great, all right. And then considering so so since you, you have had experience both with the medical Copays and with the overpayment benefits.

83

0:09:12

Emily

Thought, were you

84

0:09:14

Emily

thinking of those in in a similar way? Or do those seem like like very, very different categories to you like, what's your.

85

0:09:23

P13

So yeah, they were different categories, but they they both came about from a

86

0:09:31

P13

the same source, which was the the pension overpayments and the removal of the pension.

87

0:09:37

Emily

Oh, got it.

88

0:09:39

Emily

Okay? Makes sense.

89

0:09:41

Emily

Okay, so let me have you go ahead and share your screen and let me know if you need help doing that.

90

0:09:47

P13

Yeah. I don't know how to do that.

91

0:09:49

Emily

So do so. Tap once in, like in the general middle of your screen, and toward the bottom there should be a little button that says, Share.

92

0:10:01

P13

Okay.

93

0:10:03

P13

Who am I sharing? Let me.

94

0:10:06

Emily

So share screen. That should be an option.

95

0:10:18

Emily

Okay, it's starting. There we go, and we are there all right. And and let me have you say, are you? Are you able to to rotate the phone so that it's it's vertical. I think it might be a little easier to

96

0:10:32

Emily

look at things that way. Let's see, like it's there we go. It's catching up perfect. Thank you. And now I'm going to have you open up the app figma and let me know if you need help to open up a different app.

97

0:10:47

Emily

Okay, you're getting it.

98

0:10:57

Emily

And I'm gonna give. Okay. So go to login to figma.

99

0:11:01

Emily

I'm going to give you some credentials here.

100

0:11:06

Emily

Okay, the email will be VA test

101

0:11:15

Emily

0 0 0@gmail.com.

102

0:11:29

Emily

Okay? And then the password is VAVA. VAVA.

103

0:11:44

Emily

Okay. And right? So we don't. No, no need to save that.

104

0:11:49

P13

Alright, and then I gotta give you the code. So now, in the where it says authentication code 9, 8 0.

105

0:11:59

Emily

5, 9, 3, 3.

106

0:12:05

Emily

Okay, yeah. Log in great, make sure that. Okay? And then continue with mobile app.

107

0:12:14

Emily

Okay, wait for them to make sure that opens

108

0:12:20

Emily

alright. That's good. And then I'm gonna send you a link. So that should so a link should be. If you if you can open up zoom in the chat of zoom. There is a link that I just sent you.

109

0:12:40

Emily

I think, to the right. Oh, no, I'm sorry to the left. Sorry I just saw it.

110

0:12:46

Emily

and I think it was one to the right was zoom? Oh, sorry sorry to the the zoom application. So go back and and tap the little 3 bars at the bottom. Left again.

111

0:13:00

Emily

Yeah, and then let's see swipe one to the No. Go the other way. I just saw it keep going.

112

0:13:08

Emily

Keep going there. Oh, right. We just want one past it. So go back the other way.

113

0:13:13

Emily

Right there. Okay, tap on that.

114

0:13:16

Emily

Wait for that to load up alright and then tap once in the middle

115

0:13:23

Emily

alright, and then the where the little red circle is at the bottom. That's the chat. Let me have you tap on that.

116

0:13:36

Emily

That will. Okay, and then tap this very long URL here.

117

0:13:42

Emily

and that should okay, that will open up. Figma. Great! I know it's a bunch of steps here. All right. It's working good.

118

0:13:50

Emily

Just let it load here sometimes. Takes a moment.

119

0:14:08

Emily

Yeah, see, it's working

120

0:14:27

Emily

all right. Great. So you can tap just anywhere outside of the where it says tap and hold, there we go, great, all right. So here we have the your pretend mobile app here. So we're going to pretend in this situation that you do, in fact, have both medical copays and the overpayment debt. Don't yet tap on anything, but if you want to scroll around, that's fine. What would be your assumption on where you would find that information about the overpayment debts and the Copays.

121

0:14:58

P13

I believe it's called my va.gov.

122

0:15:02

P13

or V va.gov? And then my Va.

123

0:15:07

P13

I believe it's how I usually get to it.

124

0:15:10

Emily

Okay? So if you're so we're on, we're we're gonna pretend we're actually on the the mobile app and from from here, where? Where would you assume to find it, or expect to find.

125

0:15:27

P13

I guess, under where it says latest payment.

126

0:15:31

Emily

Okay, got it?

127

0:15:33

Emily

Any, any other sections you might. You might expect to find that information.

128

0:15:38

P13

Possibly claims.

129

0:15:43

P13

And maybe even message it.

130

0:15:45

Emily

Okay, message. Got it? Okay? So I'm gonna send you where? We're actually looking to putting it at the at the very bottom. The lower right, where it says payments at the there's there's there's 4 marks or sorry 4 tabs at the very bottom.

131

0:16:02

P13

I'm doing.

132

0:16:02

Emily

Yeah. Yeah. So tap on into where it says, payments.

133

0:16:07

Emily

Yep, there we go. Thoughts on that section where I just sent you. I know it wasn't something that you that you thought of going. But yeah, any any thoughts on placing things here.

134

0:16:19

P13

Yeah, it's a it's shows overpayment debts and co-pays.

135

0:16:24

Emily

Okay.

136

0:16:26

Emily

thoughts on does this make sense that you that you might find things under this payment section.

137

0:16:34

P13

Yeah, sure. Absolutely.

138

0:16:35

Emily

Okay, got it.

139

0:16:38

Emily

And then, looking at this page overall, thought, I know you. You, of course, found the overpayments and copays, but thoughts on the information presented here on on what make, on the clarity of things.

140

0:16:55

P13

Yeah, this is you pretty much told me everything I need to know about my payments when the payments are where they're being deposited, and you know what I owe.

141

0:17:06

Emily

Okay, okay, got it. And thoughts on the on combining both. In this situation, payments that would be coming to you, and payments that need to be made on one page. Thoughts on.

142

0:17:20

P13

Yeah, that that well, I could see how that might be a little confusing at times.

143

0:17:28

P13

especially if you're not really, you know, thinking too clearly.

144

0:17:35

P13

But yeah, from what I can see, it's it's separated pretty well.

145

0:17:41

Emily

Okay, would. Can you think of anything that might make it? Even more? Clear since you said it, it it could be confusing.

146

0:17:49

P13

I would say. Maybe my color coded the payments to me as far as payment history and direct deposit that might be colored green, and maybe the overpayment debts and copays might be color red.

147

0:18:04

Emily

Oh, got it. Okay?

148

0:18:06

Emily

Makes sense. Okay, and then the the section, the wording. Let's look at where it says Copays, the 250 due for 2 bills under there. Thoughts on what? What sort of information you might want to know from this page, just about any money that you owe.

149

0:18:25

P13

Yeah, I would want to have something like the Va. Letters that they sent me for copayments due, which itemized the medications. How much? Copay, for each one was.

150

0:18:42

Emily

okay, got it? Would from from this page. So before you dive into that would there be anything else you would want to know beyond the amount that is due, and how many bills you currently have.

151

0:18:57

P13

Well, yeah, I'd like to know how to how to do the

152

0:19:02

P13

payments, how to how to make the payments. If you know if I had to do it online do it. Have to mail them in you know. Does this mention anything about the

153

0:19:14

P13

pay.gov, or anything like that?

154

0:19:17

Emily

Hmm, okay, got it? So let me have you. If you wanna explore into this.

155

0:19:23

Emily

let me have you explore and just see for the Copays how clear it is to see how much you currently owe in this pretend scenario.

156

0:19:32

P13

Yeah,

157

0:19:37

P13

it looks like it's showing 3 pill. 3 bills with 2 of them having a balance.

158

0:19:45

Emily

Okay, got it.

159

0:19:47

Emily

And

160

0:19:49

Emily

for this this top on the James A, Haley hospital in tampa, what sort of information would you want to know regarding this particular bill.

161

0:20:02

P13

Obviously the amount when the payment is due, and how to make that payment.

162

0:20:08

Emily

Hmm, okay?

163

0:20:09

Emily

And if you if you wanna explore into this and just see, are are you able to find all the information that you just stated that you'd want to know.

164

0:20:19

P13

Yeah. Review details pay by bills. Chose me to pay.gov pay by phone mail or in person.

165

0:20:27

Emily

Okay.

166

0:20:30

Emily

under, since you mentioned the review details, let me have you tap into that and just see is the information under the details is that

167

0:20:40

Emily

is there? Is there more you might need to know for this particular bill.

168

0:20:48

P13

No, it looks looks pretty comprehensive. It shows the the pay bill shows

169

0:20:55

P13

a Pdf statement which I'm guessing is what would be the itemized charges.

170

0:21:03

P13

So.

171

0:21:04

P13

Oh, this one looks pretty comprehensive.

172

0:21:07

Emily

Okay.

173

0:21:09

Emily

got it? For the the Pdf statements. What would you? Can you talk to me about how you might use that.

174

0:21:21

P13

If for example, maybe I I didn't receive a medication or

175

0:21:31

P13

the the medication. Maybe the the amount of the copay change from one month to the next. Yeah, that would be something I would like to know.

176

0:21:43

Emily

Okay, got it.

177

0:21:45

Emily

And would that be something you would? You you might look at on the on, on the phone here.

178

0:21:54

P13

I don't know if I would continue using the phone. To be honest with you, I'd much rather use the laptop to go through this, because it's easier to see to take in all the information from the web page. At one time.

179

0:22:13

P13

This kind of a small screen to do that.

180

0:22:16

Emily

Yeah, no, that certainly makes sense. So acknowledging it is. It is a small screen. Let me have you open up the current statement and let me know if

181

0:22:28

Emily

yeah, thoughts on on that on.

182

0:22:30

Emily

And oh, it might be useful on the phone.

183

0:22:32

P13

Yeah, even with my reading glasses on. That's really small.

184

0:22:37

Emily

Okay, got it? Would you do you think you would? You might do anything else, with this.

185

0:22:42

P13

No! At this point, no.

186

0:22:44

Emily

Okay, okay, got it. Let me have you go ahead and tap done there in the upper left.

187

0:22:50

Emily

Okay, thoughts of let's let's pretend that you saw something on this bill that you're quite sure you did not. Let's say, take, or maybe an appointment. What would be. What would be your next step if you saw something that you believe was an error.

188

0:23:09

P13

I contacted the BA I thought I noticed the number for the the business office, for questions about the bill.

189

0:23:19

P13

So that's where I would go first.st

190

0:23:21

Emily

Okay, where and where? Where would you expect to find that number.

191

0:23:26

P13

I believe, where it should pay. Bill. Nope,

192

0:23:36

P13

hmm!

193

0:23:39

P13

I know I read something about.

194

0:23:44

P13

I don't pay, maybe back to payments.

195

0:23:47

Emily

Okay?

196

0:23:49

Emily

Because where? Yeah, where where would you expect to see it? If if clearly you're, you're, you're not finding something, here, so I'm curious where you would. You would expect to find that number.

197

0:24:05

P13

There we go.

198

0:24:08

P13

Us. Department of Treasury's debt management services at 888-26-3127 to pay this debt. That's the number. I'd go.

199

0:24:17

Emily

Okay, got it? Okay, got it? Would there be any other place? You might look for or look for information for taking a next step. If you saw the error.

200

0:24:28

P13

It. I would hope it would be on the 1st page as soon as I'm

201

0:24:33

P13

you know, check in and finding my build.

202

0:24:40

P13

I'm looking at my bill. I would hope that that number would be available. There.

203

0:24:46

Emily

Okay, you don't want it right here.

204

0:24:48

Emily

It. Okay, let me have you go back into payments and then back to Copays.

205

0:24:59

Emily

Great and let me have you tap on the help section, button on the upper right

206

0:25:10

Emily

and let me know thoughts on information found there.

207

0:25:17

P13

Okay.

208

0:25:22

P13

Yes, this was something that did. You might make that a little bit bigger – it's kind of small.

209

0:25:30

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay.

210

0:25:32

Emily

any anything else that might make it more clear that that would be where you might find information.

211

0:25:45

P13

I I don't know that that you could put anything on on that other page. Aside from actually having the phone number for that management service right there.

212

0:25:55

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay?

213

0:25:57

Emily

Alright and then

214

0:26:00

Emily

Let me have you

215

0:26:02

Emily

open up the if you disagree with Copay debt right here just to see what

216

0:26:08

Emily

if if the information here would be useful for what you might need.

217

0:26:15

P13

Learn how to dispute Va. Copay charges. Sure.

218

0:26:18

Emily

Okay.

219

0:26:20

Emily

Alright great maybe you close this section here on the upper right

220

0:26:26

Emily

great. And then so let's pretend that you are ready to to make a payment here, walk me through what your next steps would be.

221

0:26:40

P13

Well, the 1st thing I do is go to pay Bill.

222

0:26:43

Emily

Okay.

223

0:26:44

P13

And the way I did it was on pay.gov, so I'd go to that.

224

0:26:49

Emily

Okay.

225

0:26:50

Emily

yeah, yeah, you can go ahead and do this. I promise I won't have you add any actual information. There will be no payment taken today.

226

0:26:56

P13

Okay.

227

0:27:03

Emily

And scroll down just a little bit. I'm going to get you to the next section. There's no need to read all this where it says, continue to the form the blue button there.

228

0:27:14

Emily

yep, and then scroll down a little more.

229

0:27:18

Emily

Okay, yeah, a little more. So thoughts on. Yeah. So let's say you are ready to make a payment. And you get to this page while you're on the phone. What would be your next step in terms of finding in terms of of completing the steps.

230

0:27:35

P13

Okay. Well, the way I did it was after I filled it out the 1st time there was a link on the pay.gov web page where

231

0:27:47

P13

It said. If I had filled out the form before, did I want to use that form again? And they filled in all my information for me.

232

0:27:54

Emily

Oh, got it? Got it? Okay? How about if you are doing it for the 1st time.

233

0:28:01

P13

Well, I would need the account number, and that would be on the letter that they send the bill that they send.

234

0:28:09

Emily

Okay, got it?

235

0:28:10

P13

So, yeah, that's 4 part. And I would enter the account number in all 4 parts or 5 parts, I guess.

236

0:28:17

Emily

Yeah, okay, got it. Let me have you switch back to the figma app.

237

0:28:32

Emily

So oh, yeah, try. Yeah. Open up figma again. I can see it on the screen. And the yeah, there we go. Wait for that to load.

238

0:28:42

Emily

Sometimes it likes to close out on. Let's see?

239

0:28:47

Emily

actually, can you switch back to the hold on a second? This happens sometimes. I'm gonna have you switch back to zoom to get a a link. So go to the left. One more that one right there. Yep.

240

0:29:04

Emily

tap on that, and then scroll down. It's I just sent a second link.

241

0:29:09

Emily

So scroll down to the bottom.

242

0:29:15

Emily

Oh, yeah, okay, it's working.

243

0:29:17

Emily

Wait that. Wait for that to open up.

244

0:29:24

Emily

It'll get there.

245

0:29:27

P13

This is the Va. Hurry up and wait.

246

0:29:31

Emily

Well, this isn't a va thing. This is. This is figma. So we can't blame the Va. For this, I promise.

247

0:29:37

Emily

Okay, it's almost there

248

0:29:44

Emily

and then tap just outside of the where it says, tap and hold and then tap on payments again. I'm just going to get you back to exactly where we were. I'll walk you through. Oh, sorry. The the payments on the very lower right?

249

0:29:57

Emily

Yep, and then scroll. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Tap into where it says, co-pays

250

0:30:04

Emily

beautiful and then

251

0:30:08

Emily

tap into the review details. And this is about where we were, I believe, before

252

0:30:14

Emily

for that top one. So yeah, perfect. Okay, okay, so this, we're going to pretend that you just went back to figma thoughts on if you were actually paying your balance

253

0:30:25

Emily

at va sorry not via@uhpay.gov and you wanted to grab your account number. Would there be any use anything useful on on the app here that would help.

254

0:30:36

P13

The copy button. The account number.

255

0:30:39

Emily

Okay. And is that something that easy to find, difficult to find thoughts on, seeing that there.

256

0:30:48

P13

It's it's probably fairly easy to find, but I tend to just stick with what I know works.

257

0:30:56

Emily

Cruise.

258

0:30:56

P13

So yeah, I probably would have had my my bill. Pay my paper bill with me with the account number, but once I got used to this I wouldn't need the paper bill anymore.

259

0:31:08

Emily

Sure. Okay, okay. So you would look at the paper Bill got it all right. So if this were built in real life. And as is what what you just saw in terms of opening up pay.gov how likely do you believe? Do you believe it would be that you might use this.

260

0:31:28

P13

Yep, extremely obviously like, I said, it's it's got the limitations of the small screen.

261

0:31:37

P13

but certainly, if I was let's say I was at the Va. Trying to take care of something. This would be information I would want available.

262

0:31:47

Emily

Okay, got it.

263

0:31:48

Emily

And would there be anything else that might be missing here of what you would need.

264

0:32:02

P13

Yeah,

265

0:32:12

P13

It doesn't say

266

0:32:15

P13

If you're on a payment plan or not. That's 1 of the things I did was was applied to the the

267

0:32:25

P13

the financial office for payments to make payments.

268

0:32:29

Emily

Okay.

269

0:32:30

P13

Because I was getting bills every month, or over a hundred dollars.

270

0:32:34

Emily

Hmm, okay.

271

0:32:35

P13

And for somebody who's on social security. That's that's quite a bit.

272

0:32:40

Emily

Hmm, okay.

273

0:32:41

P13

So yeah, if there was I don't know where.

274

0:32:48

P13

I don't see anything on this page.

275

0:32:53

P13

Okay, wait, says request help. By Nope.

276

0:33:00

P13

yeah, there's nothing on this page, really. That shows me how to.

277

0:33:09

P13

unless I, we have maybe a Pdf statement.

278

0:33:16

P13

Okay.

279

0:33:17

Emily

What, what, specifically, would you would you be looking for here.

280

0:33:23

P13

How do I, or am I eligible to apply for payments.

281

0:33:28

Emily

Okay.

282

0:33:29

P13

A payment, an installment payment plan.

283

0:33:31

Emily

Okay, all right. So so do you. You'd want to see some sort of indication of that here.

284

0:33:36

P13

Yeah. Something to at least let me know that that option is available.

285

0:33:42

P13

And how I would go about applying for it.

286

0:33:45

Emily

Okay. So you don't want to know right here that you might be able to apply for a payment plan.

287

0:33:51

P13

Right.

288

0:33:51

Emily

Okay, got it.

289

0:33:53

Emily

And then jumping briefly to another topic. If you were looking for older statements, where would you would you assume you might find them here.

290

0:34:08

Emily

or where. Where would you seem to find them? I should say.

291

0:34:10

P13

Hmm!

292

0:34:23

P13

No, I don't see where I could go find a previous statement. It shows a previous unpaid balance.

293

0:34:31

Emily

Okay.

294

0:34:31

P13

But I don't see any place where it'll take me to previous statements.

295

0:34:35

Emily

Okay. Good. What what might you be looking for if you were looking for those.

296

0:34:41

P13

Well, for example, I had mentioned before, about if a copayment had changed from one month to the next, the amount though I would have to have that previous.

297

0:34:53

P13

Well, certainly the Va. Knowing the Va. They love their paperwork, so I would have to have some hard copy hard letter paperwork showing

298

0:35:05

P13

what it was one month, and what it was the next month, and you know, I would have that in case I need to submit it to the Va.

299

0:35:13

Emily

Got it. Got it? Okay? Have you? And since you mentioned the hard copies, have you printed out any like like, let's say, statements or letters. Either from the website or your phone.

300

0:35:30

P13

I think I think I had. No, I don't believe I ever printed out the statement. I think all of mine came in the mail.

301

0:35:37

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay?

302

0:35:40

Emily

And is that something you have ever done before, really, really could be printing anything from your phone specifically.

303

0:35:51

P13

I I can't say that I have used everything from my phone, as I said I I'm more

304

0:35:59

P13

more drawn to using the laptop. And it's it's a lot easier to print from my laptop. I I don't really think I've ever done it from my phone.

305

0:36:08

Emily

Okay, got it? Got it? Alright. Let me have you tap on payments again on the lower right? I'm gonna get you to a different version, and then scroll down toward the bottom of this, and then in that blank gray area toward the bottom tap that once

306

0:36:24

Emily

there we go and then tap into copays again.

307

0:36:29

Emily

Beautiful. So this is a slightly different version. I want to get your thoughts again. Looking at this top on the James a Haley Veterans Hospital. If you were to see. Well, you can scroll around and just see the information here. But yeah, let me have you tap into the details for that. The Haley Veterans Hospital

308

0:36:53

Emily

Bill. There we go.

309

0:36:57

Emily

and then thoughts on on this. So this this version does not have the payment option that you had seen before opening up pay.gov.

310

0:37:09

Emily

Thoughts on having a version like that that did not have that direct link to pay.gov.

311

0:37:17

P13

Yeah, it's it's something that would discourage me from using it.

312

0:37:21

Emily

Oh, got it. Okay, so would you? Would you think you might use it at all if there is no payment? Or you might.

313

0:37:30

P13

like, I said, for if I was at the Va. Or somewhere away from home, where I didn't have my laptop.

314

0:37:38

P13

excuse me.

315

0:37:40

P13

it might have some information that I could use but but as far as you know how to pay and what options I had. No, I would go back to my laptop.

316

0:37:53

Emily

Okay, got it, got it.

317

0:37:54

P13

And start looking from there.

318

0:37:55

Emily

Okay, got it. And so when you said this might have information that you would need even if it didn't have the payment, what sort of information would would it have? That would be useful.

319

0:38:06

P13

It would, it would be, you know, like to itemize charges. How much would it be in charge? Per Copay per medication?

320

0:38:15

P13

And just to make sure like, said that that none of those have changed or increased from month to month.

321

0:38:24

Emily

Got it all right. Makes sense.

322

0:38:29

Emily

and then thoughts. Since I know you said you have gone on the website, a bunch thoughts on

323

0:38:37

Emily

how? What you're looking at here compares to what you've seen on the website. Obviously, it's a larger screen on the website. But and any other thoughts.

324

0:38:47

P13

It's a lot of it has to do just familiarity. I've been using the Va website for

325

0:38:55

P13

20 years, 15 years somewhere in there, so I'm fairly familiar with how to navigate around it.

326

0:39:03

Emily

Okay.

327

0:39:03

P13

This. This would be a learning experience.

328

0:39:09

Emily

Okay.

329

0:39:11

Emily

and let me have you? Oh, sorry. One question, any other. Thoughts, on how? Any of the sections are labeled, so that it would be clear to you where to go.

330

0:39:36

P13

yeah, maybe down at the bottom where it shows home health benefits payments there might be

331

0:39:45

P13

another button you could use down there.

332

0:39:51

P13

that could show Pdf statements, or whatever.

333

0:39:56

Emily

Oh, okay, you'd want you'd want separate out.

334

0:39:58

P13

Yeah. Instead of having to go through one or 2 or 3 screens to get to the Pdf, just tap on, tap on it right at the bottom, and it takes you right to it.

335

0:40:09

Emily

Oh, got it! And so

336

0:40:11

P13

those Pdf statements could be could then be, you know, set in chronological order, from the most recent to the oldest.

337

0:40:21

Emily

Okay.

338

0:40:22

Emily

and do you think? So I, I know when when we looked at the the sample statement, it was, it was too small to see thoughts on how you might use

339

0:40:33

Emily

all of these statements on the phone if if they were directly linked on the bottom.

340

0:40:38

P13

Well the the statement. When I opened it up. I I tried to enlarge it.

341

0:40:44

P13

you know, you know 2 finger enlarge in.

342

0:40:48

Emily

Life. Yeah, it's it's a.

343

0:40:50

P13

It wasn't working so hopefully that would work on the the actual screen.

344

0:40:55

Emily

Oh, okay, got it. So if if you were able to get it to actually let me have you scroll back up, and I'll show you that it does actually zoom. But with this a different way to do it, just because it's a prototype. So go ahead and tap on the go to current statement

345

0:41:09

Emily

and then tap once in the middle of that, and it'll enlarge. But yeah, so.

346

0:41:13

P13

Oh, yeah.

347

0:41:14

Emily

That that's only a prototype thing.

348

0:41:18

P13

All right.

349

0:41:26

Emily

So then, knowing that you could you? You could, in fact, zoom in like you were attempting to do before.

350

0:41:33

Emily

Do you think you still might use these Pdf statements from the phone.

351

0:41:38

P13

Yeah. Yeah. Now that I could read.

352

0:41:40

Emily

Yeah, alright got it. And and again, so this you're using statements? Purely to to check check things to make sure that the pricing didn't change things like that. Is that right?

353

0:41:54

P13

Make some depressing and change. Make sure my previous payments had had been

354

0:42:02

P13

accounted for

355

0:42:04

P13

And whatever Copays make sure that I actually did receive those medications, things of that.

356

0:42:11

Emily

Okay, got it here. Double checking. Everything sounds good and do you ever save any digital statements like these? It doesn't have to be with Va. It could be any anything else you have.

357

0:42:20

P13

No man.

358

0:42:22

Emily

Okay. Got it all right. Tap on. Done there in the upper left.

359

0:42:27

Emily

Okay, and I'm gonna we only have a few minutes left, but I might quickly have you go to again payments on the lower right

360

0:42:37

Emily

and then tap on overpayment debts

361

0:42:42

Emily

all right. And so again, we're going to in this pretend scenario. There are a few debts, thoughts on the information presented here, how useful or not useful it might be in regards to overpayment debts that you have in this pretend scenario.

362

0:43:02

P13

Like, see the disability, compensation and pension debt.

363

0:43:08

P13

And so

364

0:43:13

P13

I would hit review details. But that doesn't seem to be doing anything.

365

0:43:17

Emily

If you scroll to the top. Yeah, only one of these are active. Only if you scroll to the top and that top one, the post 9, 11 Gi. Bill for housing that one. The details will work.

366

0:43:30

Emily

There we go. Yeah. So thoughts on the details that are shared here in terms of what would be important.

367

0:43:34

P13

Yeah, alright. Well, it is showing that the payment was received and applied.

368

0:43:46

P13

Debt letter history. That's something I haven't seen before.

369

0:43:50

Emily

Oh, okay.

370

0:43:53

P13

Yeah, yeah, this looks good.

371

0:43:55

Emily

Okay, you said the the debt letter. History is not something you've seen before. Looking at it. Now, how thoughts on what you're looking at.

372

0:44:07

P13

Well, it's just it's showing the chronological timeline of, you know. I guess you could say 1st contact 1st demand

373

0:44:19

P13

So I imagine that the VA has all these timelines or time deadlines

374

0:44:28

P13

so I would want to know: was I approaching any kind of a time deadline.

375

0:44:34

Emily

Got it. Okay?

376

0:44:37

Emily

Alright. And would you?

377

0:44:39

Emily

So you'd be looking for just just the the dates? Or would there be other information you'd want to know. Under this debt letter, history.

378

0:44:47

P13

Yeah, I'd like to make sure.

379

0:44:52

P13

you know what these letters were actually saying.

380

0:44:55

Emily

Oh, okay.

381

0:44:56

P13

But but I'm guessing if if it's on here

382

0:45:00

P13

that, I have probably received a hard copy of it in the mail.

383

0:45:04

Emily

Okay, and would you?

384

0:45:10

Emily

what what would be your next steps? It says they said you you assume you would probably have already received a hard copy.

385

0:45:20

P13

I wouldn't pay much attention to it unless there was something in the hard copy that said, You know, you need to pay attention to this, and take care of

386

0:45:29

P13

whatever.

387

0:45:31

Emily

Okay, got it? Got it? Alright. Let me excuse me. Let me scroll to the top of this one again. And then excuse me? Any other information up here? Like. What? What would you be looking for? What details would you want to know?

388

0:45:55

P13

Well, probably where it says, why might I have this debt? You know I would want to know when the debt was incurred.

389

0:46:03

Emily

Okay.

390

0:46:05

P13

It shows me a payment due date, but it doesn't

391

0:46:08

P13

tell me anything about. When the debt was incurred.

392

0:46:10

Emily

Okay? And so, yeah, you can go ahead and tap on that since you mentioned that. And.

393

0:46:23

P13

Okay.

394

0:46:25

Emily

Thoughts on that information.

395

0:46:29

P13

Yeah, that didn't really tell me

396

0:46:34

P13

as far as when the debt was incurred. It just says some reasons why I might be charged for the debt.

397

0:46:41

Emily

Okay.

398

0:46:42

P13

So that yeah, that's lacking information. I would like to have.

399

0:46:46

Emily

Got it. Okay? And where else might you look for that information such like like, when you incurred the debt.

400

0:47:04

P13

I I don't know. I couldn't tell you that, looking at this page.

401

0:47:08

Emily

Okay.

402

0:47:10

Emily

got it. Okay? So you'd want to know more information on when you incurred the debt anything else that you will be looking for here.

403

0:47:20

P13

Maybe the that copy button. Next to the account number.

404

0:47:25

Emily

Oh, okay, yep.

405

0:47:30

Emily

Got it. Let me have you? Since you brought that, let me get you to a different section again. Tap the the payments button at the bottom

406

0:47:39

Emily

alright, and then again scroll to the bottom and

407

0:47:43

Emily

yeah, tap in the the blank gray area.

408

0:47:47

Emily

There we go. Thank you. Tap into overpayment debts

409

0:47:51

Emily

and then under review details again.

410

0:47:59

Emily

Okay, so let's say, since you mentioned the copying of the account number if you did. If you were were ready to make a payment here, what would be the steps you would take.

411

0:48:11

P13

I think I go to resolve debt first.st

412

0:48:13

Emily

Okay.

413

0:48:16

P13

And then it says, Pay online other ways to pay. So I probably says, Pay online. But it doesn't really say, Go to pay.gov. So that's a little confusing.

414

0:48:28

P13

Oh, okay. So if that, if hitting that button takes you to pay.gov or not.

415

0:48:34

Emily

Oh, got it. Okay. So is that something you would want to know from here.

416

0:48:37

P13

Yes, absolutely.

417

0:48:38

Emily

Okay. Good.

418

0:48:38

P13

Because otherwise I don't know whether to hit pay online or other ways to pay.

419

0:48:43

Emily

Okay. So it's it's not clear just where it might be sending you.

420

0:48:47

P13

Correct.

421

0:48:48

Emily

Okay, got it? Alright. Let me have you close that one other question.

422

0:48:52

Emily

Okay, and then a similar question is, when we're talking to Copays. If let's say you were looking to see if you could do a payment plan. What? What would be your next steps to exploring that option.

423

0:49:10

P13

I'd probably go to request help.

424

0:49:12

Emily

Okay.

425

0:49:16

P13

There we go!

426

0:49:17

Emily

Okay.

427

0:49:19

P13

Request Payment Plan.

428

0:49:21

Emily

Alright and thoughts on how easy or difficult that that would be to find if you were looking for that information.

429

0:49:30

P13

That one. This one's easier than than the previous one.

430

0:49:34

Emily

Got it. Okay.

431

0:49:38

P13

Okay.

432

0:49:40

P13

And it also shows debt relief.

433

0:49:44

P13

if you wanted to request a waiver or compromise offer. So yeah, I don't. I don't think I saw that earlier.

434

0:49:51

Emily

Got it. Okay? So it's it's a little more clear in this this version. Here.

435

0:49:56

P13

Yes, ma'am.

436

0:49:57

Emily

Okay, great. I'll have you close that

437

0:50:01

Emily

and let me have you tap on the. So go sorry. Go back to resolve that and do pay online. We're just gonna look at

438

0:50:10

Emily

One thing.

439

0:50:13

P13

Okay. Now it shows me the pay on pay.gov.

440

0:50:21

P13

Yeah, but I would rather have that on the previous screen.

441

0:50:25

Emily

Okay, you want to know exactly where you are. You are going there and then.

442

0:50:32

Emily

yeah. Thoughts on on the information that's that is presented here. First.st

443

0:50:40

P13

yeah. Well, there's something in there. I'm not sure. Why, I would need to like for deduction code.

444

0:50:48

P13

it's sounds like something that Va needs intern internally, not something I would need to know.

445

0:50:54

Emily

Okay, what would make it more clear? As to why this information is here.

446

0:51:01

P13

Well, yeah, I can understand the current balance file number pay number and person entitled those kind of are self explanatory to me the deduction code. Why, that's on there, or why, that's important. I that's confusing.

447

0:51:18

Emily

Okay, got it? Let me have you tap on the pay on pay.gov.

448

0:51:25

Emily

and then go to leave.

449

0:51:36

Emily

Okay. So I know it's really tiny. I'm not. Gonna have you read this, but there's a very where it says, Pay online toward the top. It's underlined. Go ahead and tap that.

450

0:51:47

Emily

Yeah, and then scroll down a bit.

451

0:51:53

Emily

Keep going. It's like, it's like, halfway down the page or so. Okay, so right here, yeah, right there actually scroll up just a little bit.

452

0:52:02

Emily

Thought so. If you were ready to make a payment and had to enter in thoughts on what you might do from here. And again. I'm not going to have you type in anything.

453

0:52:25

P13

I don't know.

454

0:52:28

P13

This is like information overload at this point.

455

0:52:31

Emily

Go. Okay, got information overload. Okay? Not a problem. Alright. Well, we are right at time. We got through exactly what I wanted to get through. So thank you. I'm just gonna check in with my colleagues if they have anything to ask. Michelle and Natasha, if you have any questions, feel free to unmute and ask them.

456

0:52:53

Michelle

I have one question. I'm curious you mentioned use the web a lot for managing healthcare right? Like prescriptions and things like that. I'm curious about your the time that you spent with Emily

457

0:53:06

Michelle

app using a prototype of the app. Does that make you interested in using your app at all for healthcare?

458

0:53:13

P13

It, it.

459

0:53:13

Michelle

The interest in doing that.

460

0:53:14

P13

Oh, again, it would be only in certain situations if the laptop wasn't available.

461

0:53:24

Michelle

Okay.

462

0:53:25

P13

It's easier for me because I I do have reading glasses. It's hard for me to read

463

0:53:34

P13

my phone without my glasses, and even with the glasses. Some of these pages have extremely small

464

0:53:42

P13

printing on them, so my 1st choice would always be the laptop if it was available.

465

0:53:49

P13

but I would like to have this as a backup.

466

0:53:53

Michelle

Okay, fair enough. Yeah, thank you so much for all your input. Thank you.

467

0:53:57

P13

Nice, alright!

468

0:54:00

Emily

Alright. Well, that is

469

0:54:02

Emily

all we have really appreciate your time. It's always super helpful for us to speak directly with veterans about your experiences, and to see thoughts on what we are considering building. So I know Paragene is going to be reaching out to you for next steps, as a thank you for participating, and that is all for us, and I really hope you have a great rest of your day.

470

0:54:26

P13

Alright. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

471

0:54:28

Emily

Thanks! Take care!

472

0:54:30

P13

But.

Emily

We so just to confirm, are you okay? If I record the audio and visual as we talk today.

2

0:00:09

Yes.

3

0:00:10

Emily

All right.

14

0:00:59

Emily

And what sort of experiences and interactions have you had with Va. Since then?

15

0:01:08

P14

With a Va! What.

16

0:01:13

Emily

If you if you have.

17

0:01:14

P14

I don't get a VA pension.

18

0:01:16

P14

I was only in for 6 years, so I'm not eligible for any kind of a pension.

19

0:01:21

Emily

Okay, got it?

20

0:01:24

Emily

And have you have you ever attended any of the or I've ever, ever gone to any of their locations or have any experience with their healthcare.

21

0:01:35

P14

Yes.

22

0:01:37

P14

I live in a small city, [redacted]

23

0:01:40

P14

and we have a clinic here in [redacted]

24

0:01:43

Emily

Okay.

25

0:01:43

P14

And I go there.

26

0:01:46

P14

If I need to go into the hospital.

27

0:01:49

P14

We're midway between [redacted]

28

0:01:53

Emily

Oh, got it!

29

0:01:55

P14

And I prefer the [redacted]. It's more user accessible. [redacted] is an old building. You know.

30

0:02:06

P14

any clinics are on various floors.

31

0:02:09

P14

If you're if you're not very mobile, it's hard to get to them.

32

0:02:14

Emily

Got it.

33

0:02:16

P14

But it seems like the the one in [redacted]

34

0:02:20

P14

I think there's only a 2 floor building, and it's very easy to get around.

35

0:02:25

P14

and the parking is much closer.

36

0:02:27

Emily

Well, all those sound like better things in that case

37

0:02:31

Emily

got it. And what sort of experience if any, have you had with the Va website, and or the mobile app.

38

0:02:42

P14

No problems. Really, it's it's fairly easy to sign in. And I go to my healthy vet and do what I need to do

39

0:02:53

P14

as far as ordering scripts and seeing what's happening.

40

0:03:00

Emily

And is that all? So is that is that my health event? Is that an app, or are you on the website?

41

0:03:08

P14

It's it's it's a government website by healthy vet through the Va.

42

0:03:12

Emily

Okay, got it? And are you? Oh, yeah. And are are you ever using the Va's mobile app.

43

0:03:20

P14

No, not really I I you know I'd rather do that on my laptop.

44

0:03:26

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay.

45

0:03:27

P14

It's it's just easier for me to do on my laptop this year is a little bit more difficult.

46

0:03:35

Emily

Okay, what? What is more difficult? If you're on the phone.

47

0:03:39

P14

You, you for me, using the phone rather than my laptop.

48

0:03:44

P14

You know. It's just, you know, just an old guy thing.

49

0:03:52

Emily

All right, got it? Got it? So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion, and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you're willing. I have absolutely no information about you or your finances. So I have no yeah, no information. There. Have you had any experience with owing the Va. Money, such as for a benefit, overpayment.

50

0:04:17

P14

About 2 or 3 years ago I got a call from the Va.

51

0:04:22

P14

Saying that I owed a copayment from like 2 years previous.

52

0:04:28

Emily

Oh, wow! Okay.

53

0:04:29

P14

And I had no, I had no way of proving it.

54

0:04:33

Emily

And the guy says, Well.

55

0:04:35

P14

He says the Va. Can go back 5 years

56

0:04:38

P14

on copayments if you don't pay them, and if you don't pay them you don't get your benefits

57

0:04:43

P14

so naturally I had no, I had no way to prove it, so I paid the copay.

58

0:04:49

P14

even though I you know I keep pretty well track, but you know I didn't. I didn't. Who? Who think you would have to go back 5 years.

59

0:04:59

Emily

Wow! Alright!

60

0:05:00

P14

That to me. That's a long time. So now

61

0:05:03

P14

I do go back. I can go back 5 years now.

62

0:05:08

Emily

Got it alright. And so, as you said, this was, this was a phone call. This was how you had learned about this one.

63

0:05:15

P14

Yes, yes, they called me, which was kind of

64

0:05:19

P14

kind of surprising, you know. You think they would have sent me a letter.

65

0:05:24

Emily

Got it. Okay.

66

0:05:25

P14

You know what I mean?

67

0:05:27

Emily

And do you recall? Well, actually, since then, have you had additional co-pays that you've had to pay since that one phone call.

68

0:05:37

P14

Oh, yeah, I get. I'm [redacted - diagnosis]

69

0:05:42

P14

So I get my [redacted] to the Va. And I have. I do have to pay a modest copay, usually [redacted]

70

0:05:51

P14

per script, which isn't, which isn't unreasonable.

71

0:05:56

P14

Oh, and that being because I was in the Guards rather than a full time [redacted], or

72

0:06:06

P14

any other branch of service.

73

0:06:09

P14

So I happily pay the copay.

74

0:06:12

Emily

Okay, got it?

75

0:06:13

Emily

And do you how are you receiving these bills, or or how do you know when you need to pay.

76

0:06:21

P14

Well, when they send. When they send the meds or the scripts, there's paperwork inside.

77

0:06:28

P14

and it will tell me if there's a copay or not.

78

0:06:31

Emily

Okay.

79

0:06:32

P14

If if it says Copay and I take that, I put it in my files, I wait for them to send me a bill.

80

0:06:40

P14

and then I pay it.

81

0:06:41

Emily

Okay, got it. And and how is this bill coming to you?

82

0:06:46

P14

Through the mail.

83

0:06:47

Emily

Okay, got.

84

0:06:50

Emily

And what's been your method for making the payments?

85

0:06:55

P14

Usually, I go online. And I pay through.

86

0:06:59

P14

The online site.

87

0:07:02

P14

It's you know. I go on my laptop

88

0:07:05

P14

and I and I pay it that way.

89

0:07:07

Emily

Okay.

90

0:07:09

Emily

got it? And do you do you know about how often you are receiving the bills?

91

0:07:18

P14

Well, it's they usually send the the scripts. And for 90 days, okay, so probably every 3 months.

92

0:07:32

Emily

And so is that so? So you're you're usually paying about every 3 months for the co-pays?

93

0:07:37

P14

Yes, yeah.

94

0:07:38

Emily

Okay. Got it.

95

0:07:41

Emily

And could there be anything that might be made easier on your end in regards to the co-pays, when, how you're notified, how you're paying things like that.

96

0:07:55

P14

No, really, it's kind of straight. It's kind of straightforward, because I know when I get my my [redacted] there's a copay on my [redacted].

97

0:08:04

P14

And that's [redacted] a month. And it clearly states on on the paperwork, there's a copay due.

98

0:08:12

P14

Okay. But if it's like for the [redacted]. There's no copay.

99

0:08:18

Emily

Oh, okay.

100

0:08:19

P14

And it will say No, Co. It'll say no Copay, so I know there's a bill

101

0:08:25

P14

coming. Once I get my [redacted], I know there's a bill coming.

102

0:08:29

Emily

Hmm! But.

103

0:08:29

P14

Which is, which is like, I say, [redacted] a month for me which is very reasonable.

104

0:08:36

Emily

Okay, got it? And are you? Is the bills that you're getting in the mail? Is that the only way that you are notified? Are you seeing anything online for these bills.

105

0:08:49

P14

No just just paper, bill.

106

0:08:51

Emily

Okay, got it great?

107

0:08:54

Emily

Alright, so now I'm gonna have you. We're gonna get to the prototype section. So let me have you go ahead and share your screen on the phone. Let me know if you need help walking you through that.

108

0:09:09

P14

I do? I do?

109

0:09:10

Emily

Okay, so tap once in the middle of the screen.

110

0:09:14

Emily

and then there should be some options coming up on the bottom.

111

0:09:19

Emily

One of them should say, share.

112

0:09:23

P14

Well, it was there, and then it went away.

113

0:09:26

Emily

Oh, yeah, let's try. Yeah. It does that try tapping again?

114

0:09:31

Emily

And then once it's there, tap right where it says, share.

115

0:09:37

P14

Okay, how's that.

116

0:09:42

Emily

Not quite yet. There might be a couple of other options. Does it ask you to share.

117

0:09:46

P14

Panicry, photo, image, from file, document, web, URL, or what screen.

118

0:09:55

Emily

I was.

119

0:09:55

P14

Camera, share whiteboard.

120

0:09:57

Emily

Yeah, so share share the screen.

121

0:10:00

P14

Okay.

122

0:10:02

P14

Now, what?

123

0:10:04

Emily

What do you see? I'm not seeing anything yet, so what are you seeing on your screen now?

124

0:10:08

P14

127

0:10:19

Emily

128

0:10:26

Emily

And we're just gonna try this again. It looks like.

129

0:10:28

P14

So once I turn it on, then what appear on top.

133

0:10:44

P14

P14

Oh, okay.

135

0:10:47

Emily

Oh, there we go. Okay, it's it's there we go. And you gotta hurry. Right? Okay,

136

0:10:51

P14

We got it.

137

0:10:52

Emily

Yep, yep, you. It's perfect right now. Okay. So next we got a couple more steps. And next I'm gonna have you open the app figma that you had downloaded.

138

0:11:04

Emily

So if you need to I

139

0:11:09

Emily

go back to the phone so to are you? Are you on an iphone or an android.

140

0:11:15

P14

142

0:11:28

Emily

See if that.

143

0:11:29

P14

Okay.

144

0:11:30

Emily

Actually, actually, the the kind of circle square at the very, very bottom tap that once

145

0:11:39

Emily

think that should get us to

146

0:11:43

Emily

at even even below that at the very, very bottom of your screen there is a an empty rectangle.

147

0:11:58

Emily

Okay, and now, if you wanted in the search bar. You can

148

0:12:04

Emily

actually tap into that. It looks like you're muted now. So

149

0:12:10

Emily

tap into the zoom right in front there.

150

0:12:15

Emily

Okay, and then tap to speak right in the middle.

151

0:12:19

P14

Okay.

152

0:12:21

Emily

Okay

153

0:12:23

Emily

Oh, you know. Okay? Oh, it's in safe driving mode. Interesting. Okay? At the very top. There's a leave button. We're gonna leave safe driving mode because you're not driving right now. So the the red button, the very top right

154

0:12:38

P14

Look.

155

0:12:38

Emily

Nope, sorry.

156

0:12:39

P14

No, it's not.

157

0:12:40

Emily

That was my fault. Go to go to go to cancel at the very, very top.

158

0:12:46

P14

Okay.

159

0:12:47

Emily

Okay, all right. The microphones unmuted. Okay, I think I think we're okay. All right. So go back to that open square at the very bottom. Tap on that.

160

0:13:08

P14

You know I don't know. I think I lost.

161

0:13:10

Emily

No, no, that's right, that's right. And so where it says, Search, let me have you type.

162

0:13:16

0:13:35

Emily

Look up alright. Yeah. Well, Video, stop. But that that's perfectly fine. How do

170

0:13:40

Emily

I'm looking up because I this is something I actually don't know safe driving mode.

171

0:13:46

Emily

I'm just gonna let you. I'm guessing the the safe driving mode is blocking some things.

172

0:13:52

P14

I'm gonna try to leave that again.

173

0:13:56

Emily

no, because I think that's what what I want you to do is we're gonna search for the mobile app figma

174

0:14:06

Yeah, yeah, just yeah. Thoughts on on what you're seeing here in terms of the information that is

232

0:20:43

Emily

presented to you.

233

0:20:52

P14

Well, I'm tapping on almost everything. You're there.

234

0:20:57

P14

There we go! How's that?

235

0:20:59

Emily

Okay, let me actually have you go back. So tap on payments at the upper left.

236

0:21:07

P14

Okay.

237

0:21:08

Emily

Okay, yeah. There you go, and scroll down to the bottom of this one.

238

0:21:15

Emily

All right. Great! And the the blank gray area at the bottom. Tap once into that.

239

0:21:30

P14

Not doing nothing.

240

0:21:32

Emily

Try so

241

0:21:34

Emily

below where it says Co, like below that that blue button where it's just the the light gray area. Can you try tapping into there?

242

0:21:44

Emily

No, below, like in the place where there are no words at the at the bottom there's a light gray.

243

0:21:52

P14

Yeah, not what's happening.

244

0:21:55

Emily

Okay, yeah, alright, that's perfect. Alright. So now you can tap into co-pays.

245

0:22:04

Emily

Okay.

246

0:22:05

Emily

okay, great. So yeah. So we're pretending that you that, you have some copayments here. I'd love to get your thoughts on what sort of information you would be looking for in regards to any co-payments you may have.

247

0:22:22

P14

Well, excuse me, I would look to see what the payments are for

248

0:22:34

P14

you know. Give me a balance. I want to see why I have a balance, so I would review the details.

249

0:22:44

Emily

okay? And yeah, and you can, you can go ahead. We'll we'll, just use that top one, the James A, Haley hospital, if you want to review those details.

250

0:22:54

P14

Okay.

251

0:22:54

Emily

Yeah.

252

0:22:58

P14

The balance the due date account number, and

253

0:23:06

P14

there's a copay for doctors or medicine.

254

0:23:10

Emily

Okay.

255

0:23:11

P14

But yeah, different stuff.

256

0:23:15

Emily

Okay.

257

0:23:18

P14

I don't see one for $50, though.

258

0:23:21

Emily

Okay. So can you say more about like what? Exactly you are looking for?

259

0:23:30

P14

Well, no, because I want the one for $50.

260

0:23:34

Emily

Okay.

261

0:23:35

P14

With the payment of by the 30th and it's not on there.

262

0:23:38

Emily

Okay. So it's not. It's not lining up.

263

0:23:44

P14

Yeah.

264

0:23:47

Emily

Okay. Got it when you when you get your bills in the mail for the co-payment. Do you know,

265

0:23:56

Emily

are you only getting one charge. Are you getting multiple charges? Do you remember.

266

0:24:02

P14

Well, it depends. It depends on what they send me.

267

0:24:06

Emily

Okay.

268

0:24:08

P14

As I say, for for

269

0:24:10

P14

for my scripts, let's say pills and stuff that's still [redacted] a month, no matter what I order.

270

0:24:18

P14

It's $8 a month.

271

0:24:20

Emily

Okay.

272

0:24:21

P14

Except except for my [redacted]. There's no copay.

273

0:24:30

Emily

Okay.

274

0:24:33

Emily

got it? Alright. So then, then, so with yours, with your [redacted], is that so is is that showing up that [redacted]. Is that showing up 3 times? If you're getting the bill about once every 3 months.

275

0:24:47

P14

Well, well, no. What they do is

276

0:24:52

P14

How can I explain this?

277

0:24:55

P14

On on the line where it's showing what's charged? It says [redacted], and then another line over it will say [redacted - 3 times the previous number.

278

0:25:04

Emily

Oh, okay.

279

0:25:04

P14

Because it's for 90.

280

0:25:06

Emily

Got it. Okay? So it's saying, exactly there. Okay, so yeah, so it looks like this. What you're looking here is is confusing because the $50 is not represented in the charges.

281

0:25:18

P14

Right.

282

0:25:19

Emily

Got it. Okay?

283

0:25:21

Emily

Great so if you so let's let's use what you just said. If you thought that there might be something wrong here, and what? What would be your next step?

284

0:25:34

Emily

If if you wanted to see about about something potentially being incorrect.

285

0:25:39

P14

I probably look for a phone number on the bill and call them, just, you know, to see what's happening.

286

0:25:48

Emily

And got it.

287

0:25:49

Emily

And if you were let's pretend that you're on the app here, where? Where would you think to look for that phone number.

288

0:25:58

P14

Probably towards the top, someplace.

289

0:26:00

Emily

Okay.

290

0:26:10

Emily

alright. So so some somewhere up here, you you'd be looking for a phone number to call.

291

0:26:16

P14

Yeah, it would be. I would look on the top.

292

0:26:19

P14

In fact, if I get a bill out.

293

0:26:28

Emily

Okay, got it.

294

0:26:31

Emily

And then would you? Oh, let me have you tap back into back into payments on the lower right.

295

0:26:37

P14

Yeah. Okay, yeah. The phone number to call is in the upper right hand corner of the bill.

296

0:26:43

Emily

Oh, on the bill is where the phone number. Okay, got it.

297

0:26:47

Emily

Let me have you tap back into payments on the lower right.

298

0:26:54

P14

Okay.

299

0:26:55

Emily

Yeah, and then

300

0:26:57

Emily

excuse me, oh, excuse me, and then the the co-pays on the bottom there.

301

0:27:08

Emily

Yeah, perfect.

302

0:27:08

P14

Okay.

303

0:27:09

Emily

And then back to those review details. We're just gonna get back to where we were.

304

0:27:16

P14

Right.

305

0:27:20

Emily

So you you tap into the the details for that top one for the Haley Veterans Hospital.

306

0:27:28

P14

All right. Okay.

307

0:27:29

Emily

Okay, so sorry. So you said here you would be looking for for a phone number which you're not seeing here. And and any other place on this screen that you

308

0:27:39

Emily

might be looking for a of a phone.

309

0:27:43

P14

Well, I tried go to the current statement, the Pdf. And it might be on.

310

0:27:49

Emily

Okay. If you wanna go ahead and tap that and see if that would be useful for you.

311

0:28:12

P14

yeah, there's a phone number.

312

0:28:13

Emily

Okay, got it.

313

0:28:15

Emily

Okay? And so this Pdf statement? I know. Of course, you would use it to look for the phone number. Would there be anything else you might use this Pdf statement for.

314

0:28:27

P14

It would take me to the to www.pay.gov. And to pay the bill.

315

0:28:33

Emily

Hmm, okay.

316

0:28:37

Emily

Got it, and then would do you. Do you keep your statements? What do you? What are you doing? With them when you actually get them at home.

317

0:28:47

P14

I file them in my filing cabinet. I do not throw them away.

318

0:28:51

Emily

Got it? Okay, how about with any digital statements like this? Have you? Have you used digital statements at all?

319

0:28:59

P14

Any what.

320

0:29:00

Emily

Any, and like any statements like this that you're just seeing on screen.

321

0:29:06

P14

Yeah, anything I get from the Va, I save.

322

0:29:09

Emily

Okay.

323

0:29:10

P14

No matter what kind of court

324

0:29:12

P14

it is. I I keep it, and then I file it. I file it in my filing cabinet. I save it.

325

0:29:18

Emily

Oh, okay, yeah. Have you? Have you ever printed anything from the phone like like this? For example, view it. If you might print something like this.

326

0:29:30

P14

Through the Va.

327

0:29:33

Emily

So if like, if you are using this on your phone, might you print this particular statement.

328

0:29:42

P14

if I knew how. Yeah, but I usually don't print off my phone. Don't know how to do that.

329

0:29:48

Emily

Okay, yeah, no problem. Alright. Let me have you tap done right? There.

330

0:29:55

Emily

Is that correct?

331

0:29:55

P14

Okay.

332

0:29:56

Emily

Yeah. So tap done on the toward the upper left.

333

0:30:00

Emily

Yep, perfect. Okay. Great.

334

0:30:01

P14

Okay.

335

0:30:01

Emily

Okay? Anything else that you might be looking for?

336

0:30:08

Emily

here on the on this page, in terms of information on this particular Copay bill.

337

0:30:14

P14

No, not really as long as they what it was for, and I recognize it then I like I pay it, you know.

338

0:30:22

P14

if I don't

339

0:30:25

P14

Then I would get a hold of

340

0:30:28

P14

my clinic first.st Actually, what happened was I was on [redacted].

341

0:30:34

P14

and I was on one unit a week.

342

0:30:39

P14

And actor decided to up it to 2 units a week.

343

0:30:44

P14

and when I started taking it I [redacted]

344

0:30:48

Emily

Oh!

345

0:30:49

P14

In the meantime I called them and told them I wanted to go back to one.

346

0:30:54

P14

and the doctor ended up ordering another. Another script

347

0:31:01

P14

of the 2. So now Va. Shows up at my door with more more [redacted] at 2.

348

0:31:10

Emily

Oh, wow!

349

0:31:11

P14

So then I told him I called the the clinic back up, and I said, This is wrong, I said, I want that Copay taken away, and it took me almost a

350

0:31:20

P14

with the Va.

351

0:31:22

P14

To get them admit that the doctor was wrong in ordering that.

352

0:31:26

P14

and to get the the copay off, but they finally did take it off.

353

0:31:32

P14

So I do watch pretty carefully what I'm you know, receiving from the Va.

354

0:31:39

Emily

Sure. Sure. Yeah, that certainly makes sense. Okay.

355

0:31:43

Emily

From you know, pretending you're you're looking at at the phone for for your actual Copay. What else might you want to do from here?

356

0:31:55

P14

Really nothing. I mean, you know, I mean, like, I say, as long as what I'm seeing is what happened.

357

0:32:03

P14

yeah, I'm happy, you know, if I'm seeing something I'm not happy about, then I

358

0:32:09

P14

I will call the Va. About it.

359

0:32:11

Emily

Okay, got it?

360

0:32:12

P14

Either the clinic I go to, or the number on the bill.

361

0:32:20

Emily

Got it?

362

0:32:22

Emily

And if you were Hello.

363

0:32:26

Emily

want wanted to make a payment from here, what would be your next steps look looking at at what you have here on screen.

364

0:32:38

P14

I go to the Pdf.

365

0:32:41

P14

And probably the payments, and and then pay it out of my banking account.

366

0:32:47

Emily

Okay. So you pay with from the statement, got it?

367

0:32:51

Emily

And then can you? So can can you walk me through exactly how you would do that.

368

0:32:58

P14

No, because I don't do it that way. I do it on my laptop.

369

0:33:02

Emily

Okay. Oh, yeah.

370

0:33:03

P14

I don't pay any of my bills through my phone.

371

0:33:07

Emily

Got it. Okay, you're not paying the phone. Okay?

372

0:33:11

P14

My phone is my phone for what it is.

373

0:33:14

P14

Any bills I pay I pay through the bank on my laptop.

374

0:33:18

Emily

Got it. Okay? Only paying there. Okay, great so if this if if something like this existed where you could, you could see all the information from from a bill and look at the details.

375

0:33:34

Emily

But you, of course you're still using your laptop to pay, so you're not paying on your phone. How likely do you think it would be that you might use something like this that we're looking at here?

376

0:33:45

P14

Well, I probably wouldn't, because again.

377

0:33:49

P14

my phone is not hooked up to my printer.

378

0:33:52

P14

So I can't.

379

0:33:53

P14

I can't print anything out, you know. I could save it in the phone.

380

0:33:58

P14

but I can't print it out, and I like hard copy.

381

0:34:03

Emily

Got it. Okay, you like hard copy, though.

382

0:34:07

Emily

Would there? Would there be any instance where? You would find it useful just to to view the information E, even if you're not able to print it out or pay from here.

383

0:34:18

P14

Yes.

384

0:34:20

Emily

Okay, in what? In in what instances, do you think you would use it for that.

385

0:34:27

P14

Well.

386

0:34:31

P14

you know, if if I get something in my email from the Va. I would open it up, read it.

387

0:34:37

P14

and then then I save it to my documents.

388

0:34:42

Emily

Oh, okay.

389

0:34:44

Emily

is that so? So the saving to documents is that something you've ever done from your phone? Or is that only on your laptop?

390

0:34:53

P14

And both.

391

0:34:54

Emily

On both. Okay, got it.

392

0:34:56

Emily

Would that be something you might do? Would would you ever save Pdf statements to your documents?

393

0:35:05

P14

On my laptop. Yes.

394

0:35:07

Emily

But not but not.

395

0:35:10

P14

But not with my phone, not my phone is not what my phone is used for.

396

0:35:15

Emily

Got it. So what? What? Generally? What? What are you using your phone for?

397

0:35:21

P14

I use my phone well on Facebook.

398

0:35:25

P14

I use my phone for myself.

399

0:35:28

P14

Are you iphone, you know, to call people

400

0:35:33

P14

and have people call me. I'm 82 years old.

401

0:35:37

P14

that's all. I really need. My phone for.

402

0:35:41

Emily

Got it makes sense alright. The siren in my back.

403

0:35:45

P14

I forgot her.

404

0:35:47

P14

Yeah, my, my laptop is my link with the world, you know.

405

0:35:51

P14

Oh, okay, yeah.

406

0:35:51

P14

My phone, not so much

408

0:35:54

Emily

Okay, no, that make that makes sense. Alright.

409

0:35:58

Emily

Let me have you

410

0:36:01

Emily

go back to where it says, payments on the lower, right?

411

0:36:10

Emily

So at the at the body. Yeah, perfect. And then scroll again to the bottom. Gonna get you to one other section to get your thoughts on it. And again, the the blank, light gray area at the bottom. Let me have you tap. Yeah, perfect. You got it. Yeah, perfect. You're reading my mind perfect.

412

0:36:30

Emily

Okay? So again, looking at this, the Haley Veterans Hospital, let me have you tap into that. This is a slightly different version that I'd want to get your

413

0:36:42

Emily

thoughts on.

414

0:36:45

P14

And review details, or pay bill.

415

0:36:48

Emily

Well, yeah, let's go into review details. Here.

416

0:36:52

P14

Okay.

417

0:36:53

Emily

Yeah, great so so acknowledging that you wouldn't actually pay here, I I understand that I still would. I'm curious to get your thoughts on

418

0:37:06

Emily

How like what information you would need in, or if if you were going to pay, I know you said you. You have paid on pay.gov before.

419

0:37:15

P14

Well, I'd I'd go to the current statement.

420

0:37:20

P14

And then go from there and then probably you know them.

421

0:37:24

P14

If if that was the way I did it, then I would pay it online or on the phone through the phone.

422

0:37:31

Emily

Oh, okay, you've you've you would. You would call instead of using paid.

423

0:37:35

P14

5 bucks, yeah.

424

0:37:39

Emily

Got it. Okay?

425

0:37:41

Emily

Let me actually have you tap on pay Bill.

426

0:37:46

P14

Okay.

427

0:37:49

P14

And it says, and it shows you different ways to pay.

428

0:37:53

P14

And I usually pay on pay.gov.

429

0:37:56

Emily

Okay.

430

0:37:59

Emily

so let me have you. So so you said that you may. You may also pay by phone as one option.

431

0:38:08

P14

I may, but probably not.

432

0:38:11

Emily

You.

433

0:38:12

P14

Give me my phone, and I'm not gonna do it.

434

0:38:16

Emily

I promise it won't actually make you pay anything. I promise you that this is just getting getting feedback here. So have you. Have you paid by by actually calling anybody or or all of your payments have been on pay.gov.

435

0:38:31

P14

Oh, it's pay.gov.

436

0:38:37

Emily

Okay. Got it? Got it? Let me have you? see? Actually, let me have you go and close this

437

0:38:41

Emily

one other question that I forgot to ask earlier.

438

0:38:44

Emily

Yeah, so so tap on the the close, on the very bottom.

439

0:38:54

P14

The one close.

440

0:38:57

Emily

Try tapping. Let's see maybe above the the dark gray squares.

441

0:39:10

P14

Real.

442

0:39:11

Emily

No? What happens when? Where, where? It says, close at the bottom. What happens when you tap into that.

443

0:39:20

P14

Nothing's happening.

444

0:39:21

Emily

Nothing's happening. Oh, technology.

445

0:39:25

Emily

Let me have you? Let's see.

446

0:39:29

Emily

can you tap anywhere on the phone? Is I wonder if something is frozen here?

447

0:39:35

P14

Hmm! My system not in froze. Yeah, I think I'm froze, but.

448

0:39:38

Emily

It is frozen all right. So let me have you

449

0:39:43

Emily

see, I forget. Can you try

450

0:39:46

Emily

swiping? Can you try swiping up from the bottom of the phone. See if that does anything.

451

0:39:58

P14

Hang on!

452

0:39:59

Emily

Now, how about try swiping from?

453

0:40:03

Emily

Are you doing.

454

0:40:05

P14

I almost had it.

455

0:40:07

Emily

Okay, okay, doing. Let's see.

456

0:40:11

Emily

Alright, alright. I think it just got restarted. That's fine. Okay, so that that top section there where it says, Mfs, tap into that.

457

0:40:21

Emily

We'll just get it to where it was. It just may take a moment.

458

0:40:26

Emily

Sometimes technology just wants to kick us off for some reason.

459

0:40:48

Emily

Okay. Great.

460

Okay, and.

464

0:41:08

Emily

And then again scroll down to the bottom.

465

0:41:16

Emily

Yeah. And then that blank gray area there. Tap one. Yeah, perfect. You got it? Yep, exactly. And again into this top. James A. Haley Veterans hospital tap into that.

466

0:41:35

Emily

Yeah, alright perfect and so we're gonna pretend that so you have you have this bill? You see that it's for $50. We're gonna pretend that you're not sure that you actually have the money at the moment, and you want to see what sort of options there are. What might be a next step for you in that scenario.

467

0:42:02

P14

Let's see.

468

0:42:14

P14

I might have to go to the statement to see who I have to call.

469

0:42:18

Emily

Hmm, okay. So you got a statement for a phone number.

470

0:42:22

P14

0:42:37

Emily

Okay, got it?

0:43:12

Emily

yeah, perfect.

482

0:43:13

P14

Okay.

483

0:43:13

Emily

Thoughts on, if you might use any of these options here that would be under help

484

0:43:21

Emily

for it. For in this sorry in this scenario. If you're worried that you're not, you wouldn't be able to make the payment to see what sort of other options there are.

485

0:43:29

P14

How to request debt relief.

486

0:43:33

Emily

Okay, great, you can. You can tap into that.

487

0:43:36

Emily

See what is under there.

488

0:43:41

P14

Well, I got to submit a form.

489

0:43:46

Emily

Okay.

490

0:43:47

P14

Surprise, right.

491

0:43:49

Emily

I'm guessing. This wouldn't be the 1st form you've ever submitted with the Va.

492

0:43:55

P14

Right.

493

0:43:57

Emily

Got it?

494

0:43:59

Emily

And have you always filled out forms on your laptop, or I'm assuming you haven't done any on your phone before.

495

0:44:06

P14

I would do it on my laptop.

496

0:44:07

Emily

Got it. Okay? Great. Alright.

497

0:44:10

P14

Absolutely.

498

0:44:11

Emily

Okay, yeah. Got it. And you can close you can. If you want to tap that one again just to close that thoughts on the information that was found under help. If that would be ever something that would be useful. You think.

499

0:44:31

P14

Yeah, I mean, you know that.

500

0:44:33

P14

Did they give you different options?

501

0:44:36

P14

So yeah, I would try the easiest 1 1st and go from there.

502

0:44:40

Emily

Got it. Okay?

503

0:44:42

Emily

And how easy or difficult do you think it would be to to find those help options.

504

0:44:53

P14

I don't know not not for not, you know, not not

505

0:44:58

P14

not easy and not hard, you know. I mean it. It might take some getting to to get to the right number.

506

0:45:07

Emily

Okay. Well, if could, you, would there be any way that it could be made easier to to show you what sort of help. Options there are.

507

0:45:18

P14

Well, they could look the phone number

508

0:45:21

P14

on on that last page we were on instead of submitting a form.

509

0:45:27

P14

Maybe they, if they had a phone number, you could call, call and talk to a live person.

510

0:45:33

Emily

Got it. Okay? So you don't want a phone number there?

511

0:45:37

Emily

And and and how about

512

0:45:40

Emily

knowing to to tap the help button at all. Was that something you would you had noticed as we're going through this these.

513

0:45:49

P14

That's something I wouldn't have noticed before you told me.

514

0:45:53

Emily

Oh, good. Okay. Any thoughts on how to make it more noticeable.

515

0:45:59

P14

Yeah. Make the button bigger.

516

0:46:00

Emily

Bigger button. Got it all right.

517

0:46:04

Emily

Any anything else that might make it more clear.

518

0:46:08

P14

No, no.

519

0:46:09

Emily

Okay, I mean, it says, help. So, yeah.

520

0:46:13

Emily

okay, so make it make it bigger there, all right. And I don't remember if I asked you, but if you were looking for any older statements, where would you expect to find those.

521

0:46:31

P14

Well, let's see if we go to help.

522

0:46:36

P14

and there would be if you have questions about Copay bills.

523

0:46:46

Emily

Okay, questions there. All right. You you would look for older statements here.

524

0:46:51

P14

Yeah.

525

0:46:51

Emily

Okay. Got it? Alright. Let me have you.

526

0:46:54

P14

A tool.

527

0:46:58

Emily

Okay, let me have you close that.

528

0:47:03

P14

Nice.

529

0:47:04

Emily

Yeah, great, great. All right, I'm going to have you scroll to the very bottom of this screen here.

530

0:47:16

P14

Okay.

531

0:47:17

Emily

Okay. So the the where, where it's where it says, Pdf, statements here. At the bottom.

532

0:47:26

Emily

Thoughts on how easy or difficult it might be to to come across that.

533

0:47:36

P14

Well.

534

0:47:42

P14

I tap on it. It's not doing nothing.

535

0:47:45

Emily

Okay.

536

0:47:45

P14

Or go to payment. It goes to payments.

537

0:47:49

P14

The last week about payments.

538

0:47:53

Emily

Alright. Yeah, no, that that's fine. Yeah. I I think that was one that just wasn't wasn't connected. That's not a problem. May have you tap back into co-pays on the bottom here.

539

0:48:05

P14

Oh, okay.

540

0:48:08

Emily

Yeah, perfect, great. All right.

541

0:48:12

Emily

And again, go into review details for that. That 1st one, the Haley Veterans Hospital.

542

0:48:22

Emily

Okay? Great.

543

0:48:24

Emily

yeah. So I know that the the Pdf statements that you tried clicking it. It was not there. Thoughts on how easy or difficult it might be to actually find those statements, now that I've shown you where they are.

544

0:48:43

P14

Oh, we're talking about this one, bill. Right? I would copy. I try, copy and see what what

545

0:48:54

Emily

It's just happy.

546

0:48:56

Emily

Yeah, okay.

547

0:49:00

Emily

And what? What would you then want to do after you've you've copied that.

548

0:49:07

P14

I would look for what I'm looking for.

549

0:49:10

Emily

Okay.

550

0:49:10

P14

What's ship?

551

0:49:14

Emily

Alright got it.

552

0:49:17

Emily

And just an overall question. Thoughts on how the different sections are labeled here in terms of how clear or not clear things might be. Could anything be more clear.

553

0:49:33

P14

No, I mean, they've got it in bold type where the bills are originating are originating out, and what they're for. Got it, you know.

554

0:49:45

Emily

All right. Good, all right. I believe those are all my questions. I'm just gonna check in with my colleagues here. If anybody observing has any questions you'd like to ask, feel free to unmute now and ask them.

555

0:50:07

P14

How do I get back there?

556

0:50:09

Emily

No, you're you're you're fine, just as you are one. Once we log off it should, I can make sure that we we quit out of figma first.st So but those are all the questions I have anything else you'd like to add regarding.

557

0:50:27

P14

No, that very interesting topic here.

558

0:50:32

Emily

Yeah, it is. Yeah, well, we're we're seeing what we can do to hopefully, make things make things easier at all. Yeah, is, is there anything else you can think of that might make things easier in terms of.

559

0:50:44

Emily

Knowing about these Copay bills and and paying them and making sure you're all up to date.

560

0:50:51

P14

I'm fine the way they are really.

561

0:50:53

Emily

They are, okay. Great, thanks.

562

0:50:56

Emily

Yeah. Okay, sounds good. So yeah, we can.

563

0:51:01

Emily

that should be. Do you? Do you want to go. We we can go ahead and close out, figma, if you'd like up up to you. But where? I'm just about to to end the call first, st though.

564

0:51:13

P14

Okay.

565

0:51:15

Emily

So if you actually, I think if you scroll up from the very, very bottom of your phone.

566

0:51:22

Emily

see if I can get to.

567

0:51:24

Emily

So even below like from the the actual bottom of the physical phone, not just the screen.

568

0:51:35

Emily

See if you can scroll up. I was seeing if we could potentially quick.

569

0:51:43

Emily

See our try if you can you scroll or swipe rather than scroll swipe? Sorry. From the very top of the phone. Can you swipe down from the very top from the phone.

570

0:51:58

P14

Okay.

571

0:51:59

Emily

Okay? Yeah. So yeah, if you tap on the the 3 little lines at the very bottom.

572

0:52:07

P14

I don't have 3 lines at the very.

573

0:52:09

Emily

Actually super super light. It's hard. It's a little hard to see. But at the very

574

0:52:14

Emily

bottom of the phone below, where there's a scrolling.

575

0:52:20

P14

That wouldn't do anything.

576

0:52:21

Emily

Yeah, okay, that's okay. Well, I believe those are. Those are, are all my questions. So, yeah, thank you so much for your time. This has been super helpful, just seeing what you're looking for and what would make sense? As we are looking to build this in regards to the copays, and any any money that veterans may owe. So I appreciate your time

577

0:52:45

Emily

very much.

578

0:52:46

Emily

Okay, you're welcome, and.

579

0:52:50

P14

And thank you.

580

0:52:51

Emily

Alright. Thank you.

581

0:52:52

P14

Great one. Okay.

582

0:52:52

Emily

Great rest of your day.

583

0:52:53

P14

Bye-bye.

584

0:52:54

Emily

## P16 Transcript

1

0:00:00

Emily

Ask you the same.

2

0:00:02

Emily

Okay? So now that we are recording, confirm once again, are you okay? If I record the video and audio today.

3

0:00:10

P16

That's fine. Do you need to turn on the my video?

4

0:00:12

Emily

No, no, totally fine. You're fine as is and then as and also, are you okay? If I potentially share any clips with our Va partners.

5

0:00:21

P16

That's fine!

6

0:00:22

Emily

Okay, great. So first, st I'd love to know, and whatever level you are comfortable sharing a little bit about yourself as a veteran could be. What branch you served in when you were tired or separated?

7

0:00:35

P16

I was in the [redacted] from 2011 to oh, oh, gosh! 2020.

8

0:00:46

P16

But I joined in the reserves. So I'm I'm a i'm a reservist now.

9

0:00:52

Emily

Got it? Got it? Okay? And then how about any experience you have had with the Va. Over the years.

10

0:01:02

P16

Like in terms of what?

11

0:01:04

Emily

In terms of let's say, have you visited any of their sites or like? What sort of epic and whatever level. You're comfortable. If you utilize any of their benefits. If you have healthcare things like that.

12

0:01:17

P16

I do have healthcare with them. I do use them. I don't currently have medical insurance with my company since I have Va.

13

0:01:28

P16

I've been to one in [redacted]

14

0:01:35

Emily

Got it. Okay?

15

0:01:37

Emily

And then what sort of experience have you had with the Va website and or their mobile app.

16

0:01:45

P16

I think it's it's kinda hard to navigate it sometimes, especially if I'm looking for things.

17

0:01:54

Emily

Okay.

18

0:01:55

P16

And a lot of times in terms of payment.

19

0:02:00

P16

Either I would have to call

20

0:02:04

P16

to make a payment, or I would have to submit a form instead of just paying online.

21

0:02:10

Emily

Hmm.

22

0:02:12

P16

Like it's not very modern.

23

0:02:15

Emily

Hmm, okay, and is this is this the website? Or is this the mobile app the website?

24

0:02:22

P16

Okay, yeah. Do you? Have you used the mobile app at all?

25

0:02:27

P16

No.

26

0:02:27

Emily

You have not okay. Got it? Have you? Have I downloaded it? Or just not? Not even downloaded.

27

0:02:32

P16

Like the figma, or the.

28

0:02:34

Emily

Oh, no! Sorry! The the Va mobile app.

29

0:02:38

P16

I wasn't aware that there's a a mobile app.

30

0:02:41

Emily

Oh, okay, there we go.

31

0:02:43

Emily

Okay. So next, we're going to move to the financial portion of the discussion. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are comfortable. I have absolutely no information about you or finances with with Va. So.

32

0:02:57

Emily

And can you tell me if you have had any experience with owing the Va. Money from such things as overpayment from benefits.

33

0:03:08

P16

Yes, I have since I'm in the reserves, I sometimes go on active duty orders and

34

0:03:20

P16

it. Basically they don't. They won't know until the reserves send that information to them, so I'd have to

35

0:03:28

P16

pay them back what they have paid me since I was in orders.

36

0:03:34

Emily

Oh, interesting. Okay.

37

0:03:37

Emily

got it, got it. And do you recall? So when these these have happened, how exactly you were notified of the debt that you then had.

38

0:03:47

P16

It's usually by mail.

39

0:03:49

Emily

Okay, got it?

40

0:03:52

Emily

And what sort of

41

0:03:55

Emily

thoughts on the the communication that you were given you said it was. It was sent by mail. Yeah. Thoughts on on what you what you were told exactly from from these letters.

42

0:04:07

P16

It. It states that I was in orders in

43

0:04:11

P16

such and such dates, and that it tells me, since I'm in orders, I'm not entitled to that benefits during that

44

0:04:20

P16

time period, so I would have to pay them back what they have paid me for those benefits.

45

0:04:26

Emily

Hmm, okay. Got it. And was it did did it do these letters share like options for for how exactly you you could pay these back.

46

0:04:38

P16

Either I pay via phone call or through online.

47

0:04:45

Emily

Okay? And have you, have you done both of those online and phone calls?

48

0:04:48

Emily

Yes, yes, thoughts on the experience of both of those both paying online and phone call.

49

0:04:56

P16

The phone call.

50

0:04:59

P16

It usually takes a while because I'm on waiting.

51

0:05:04

Emily

Hmm.

52

0:05:04

P16

Sometimes it could go up to an hour, just.

53

0:05:07

Emily

No worries.

54

0:05:08

P16

Person.

55

0:05:09

P16

Online.

56

0:05:12

P16

it's it's kind of like a Pdf form. It's not really an actual payment. They I would have to submit the form, and then

57

0:05:23

P16

they will use that to pay. It's not like a direct deposit.

58

0:05:29

Emily

Got it. Okay? So so yours, like, you're submitting this form back to Va, then.

59

0:05:33

P16

Yes.

60

0:05:34

Emily

Got it. Okay? Understandable and how? What? What prompts you? For whenever you do make payments.

61

0:05:46

P16

What do you mean? Prompts.

62

0:05:48

Emily

Like. How, I guess. How do you? How do you know when you need to make payments? Is this something you're you're waiting on. Do you set yourself a schedule? What like? I'm wondering what what's your process.

63

0:05:59

P16

So when I get a letter they usually give me a due date.

64

0:06:03

Emily

Okay.

65

0:06:04

P16

To pay to pay them back.

66

0:06:06

Emily

Got it and then thoughts on how this whole process might be made easier.

67

0:06:14

P16

I think they could. Redesigned the website.

68

0:06:24

P16

Or I could be informed via email instead of mail.

69

0:06:32

P16

And sometimes I get this mail like months later.

70

0:06:37

Emily

Oh, got it. Okay?

71

0:06:39

Emily

Okay, so you're you're you're only getting the mail. You're not being notified any other way. At this point.

72

0:06:45

P16

No, not unless I check my Va. There's usually like a message portion in there. But I rarely go on that website.

73

0:06:52

Emily

Okay. So okay. So if you logged in, you would see it, but otherwise no

74

0:06:57

Emily

got it. Alright, and then so a different topic. Do you also, or do you have any experience with medical copays through Va.

75

0:07:06

P16

Yes, it they have the same process. And I both used I bought.

76

0:07:13

P16

I have both paid via phone call or via online.

77

0:07:17

Emily

Okay? And is it? The same process for paying online as with the overpayment debts.

78

0:07:22

P16

Yes, it's also the the form.

79

0:07:24

Emily

Got it. Okay? And then same thing where you're you're receiving a letter, but nothing no email or anything.

80

0:07:31

P16

Correct.

81

0:07:31

Emily

Got it. Okay?

82

0:07:33

Emily

And it is all the same thing that you know, to pay when you get a letter.

83

0:07:38

P16

Yes.

84

0:07:38

Emily

Okay, okay?

85

0:07:41

Emily

And then comparing those 2, both the overpayment debt and the medical copays in your mind, do they feel like different kind of financial issues? Or do you think they would belong in the same category in your mind like, how are you thinking about them?

86

0:07:59

P16

I think it would be the same.

87

0:08:01

Emily

Same. Okay.

88

0:08:03

Emily

can you? Can you say a little more about that? Why, you why, you why, it feels the same to you.

89

0:08:08

P16

Cause.

90

0:08:11

P16

Well, actually, no.

91

0:08:13

P16

because when I have to pay my benefits, I usually just tell them to deduct it to my future

92

0:08:21

P16

benefits. Months.

93

0:08:24

Emily

Okay.

94

0:08:25

P16

And then, whereas for the copay, that's actually where I have to make a payment.

95

0:08:30

Emily

I see. Okay. So with the benefit overpayments, it sounds so it's not. Just make sure I got it. You're you're given a choice as to whether or not you can outright pay or have it deducted. Is that right?

96

0:08:41

P16

Yes, for for my benefits. I just tell them to not pay me the next month, or however how much I I owe.

97

0:08:50

P16

But I'm also given the choice to just pay right away. But it wouldn't really make sense, since I'll get benefits the next month. So I just tell them to take it off.

98

0:08:58

Emily

Oh, got it? Okay, and how are you communicating with them to tell them to to just reduce your benefit payments?

99

0:09:05

P16

There's an option on there, or usually I think it's easier when I just call them.

100

0:09:13

P16

And let them know, and then they do it for me for the form. I don't believe that there's an option for that, so usually for the benefits I would call them.

101

0:09:23

Emily

Okay, so there, there's there's no other option right now, outside of calling to do that.

102

0:09:30

P16

For that option. I I don't believe so. I don't remember but the copay I can easily pay online with that PDF form

105

0:09:38

Emily

Got it. Got it? Okay, great let me go. Have you go ahead and share your screen and let me know if you need any help doing that.

106

0:09:58

Emily

Alright perfect, and let me have you open up the figma app. Also.

107

0:10:06

Emily

I'm gonna give you a login.

108

0:10:08

P16

Is it this one.

109

0:10:09

Emily

Yep.

110

0:10:22

Emily

okay, perfect and if you wanna swipe my video off to the right, just so it's you get a little more screen test. There you go. Okay, so the email you're gonna be putting in is Va test

111

0:10:36

Emily

0 0 0@gmail.com.

112

0:10:47

Emily

And then password is VAVA, VAVA,

113

0:10:54

Emily

okay. And I just need to get you a code. Give me just a moment, takes a moment to come through sometimes. There we go. The code is gonna be 2, 3, 7,

114

0:11:09

Emily

3, 3, 5, 8.

115

0:11:16

Emily

Alright. Continue with mobile app. And then I am going to. All right. Great. Now, I'm gonna put a link into the Zoom chat. So if you can go back to zoom for a moment to

116

0:11:29

Emily

grab the chat link at the bottom.

117

0:11:35

Emily

Yeah, the extra long URL you should be able to tap on it. It should open up. Figma.

118

0:11:42

Emily

Yeah, perfect.

119

0:11:44

Emily

Wait for that to load a bit.

120

0:11:52

Emily

All right, perfect.

121

0:11:54

Emily

Okay. And you can just tap just above where it says, tap and hold, we don't need that message there.

122

0:12:01

Emily

Yeah, perfect. Okay, so so this is what the mobile app looks like, roughly. So pretending you have, you have opened up the mobile app. I'm not gonna have you tap on anything quite yet. So without tapping, where would you expect to go if you needed to find out information on? Let's say, the overpayments and the copays. Where would you expect to find that.

123

0:12:27

P16

The claims.

124

0:12:28

Emily

And the claims. Okay, got it

125

0:12:30

Emily

any any other spot you might think to look.

126

0:12:34

P16

Probably the messages.

127

0:12:36

Emily

Got it. Okay, claims and messages. Okay?

128

0:12:41

Emily

So where it actually is, is gonna be in the payments section on the very bottom. I know you didn't open that. So yeah. Thoughts on how that that might be more clear. How like what? What might change? Excuse me for you to think to to look there.

129

0:13:00

P16

Since it's in the middle

130

0:13:03

P16

and if I think if I am due to pay something.

131

0:13:07

P16

maybe there should be like on the top like says, like on red, or something that I'm due. I'm due.

132

0:13:15

Emily

For payment.

133

0:13:18

Emily

Got it? Okay? So some sort of notification front got it makes sense, right?

134

0:13:21

Emily

Any thoughts on the word payments that's that's used for that section. Would there be anything else that might make it more clear for you.

135

0:13:31

P16

Payments for me is, I think, when I have to pay something.

136

0:13:36

Emily

Okay.

137

0:13:38

P16

So maybe if I'm due for something, it would have that red bubble kind of like when I get messages.

138

0:13:44

P16

If there's no notification on the very top screen, that's probably my prompt to go into that icon.

139

0:13:52

Emily

Okay, got it makes sense.

140

0:13:54

Emily

Okay, let me have you go ahead and tap that payment section on the bottom right?

141

0:14:01

Emily

Great. So to have you look at this at this page for a moment. Here thoughts on the information that is presented here. If you 1st came to this and opened up this payments, tab this payment section? What would be your thought on just how how things are structured.

142

0:14:22

P16

I actually do like this.

143

0:14:24

Emily

Okay.

144

0:14:25

P16

Cause. It shows me the history, and also if I have anything to.

145

0:14:31

P16

In one screen.

146

0:14:34

Emily

Hmm, okay?

147

0:14:35

Emily

And then. So now that you're seeing the the screen would thoughts on the term payment that is used for this? Does that? Does that still make sense? Is there another title that you think would make more sense to you?

148

0:14:51

P16

Maybe. Hmm!

149

0:14:55

P16

I think payments is fine. I was just more so looking for like debt or bills.

150

0:15:01

Emily

Oh, okay, got it.

151

0:15:05

Emily

So so you'd want. So instead of it saying payments at the very bottom, it would make more sense to you to say either debts or bills.

152

0:15:13

P16

Yeah, our payments and other payments or debts, or something like that.

153

0:15:18

Emily

Hmm, okay, got it?

154

0:15:20

Emily

Okay? And then the little bit of information that is below both overpayment debts and copays where it says the amount thoughts on just from this screen, any different or other information that you might. That might be useful for you, just looking at things high, level.

155

0:15:40

P16

What I would look for usually is

156

0:15:44

P16

in what section I owe them something like medical, is it for school, or is it home loan, or something like that?

157

0:15:51

Emily

Okay.

159

0:15:55

Emily

Something.

160

0:15:56

P16

Yeah.

161

0:15:56

Emily

Okay. So under overpayment debts, you, you'd you'd want to know the detail of exactly what the debt is.

162

0:16:01

P16

Yeah.

163

0:16:01

Emily

Got it. Okay?

164

0:16:04

Emily

So we're going to look first.st Look at the overpayments, and you can see you can tap into this section. Have a look around, and just let me know how like what you believe from this in this scenario you currently owe, and just how clear or not clear things are.

165

0:16:50

P16

if I click on this, does, it tells me the due date I'm supposed to pay it.

166

0:16:56

Emily

So we can look at. So not all of them are connected, but just that top one where it says for housing that one is so if you want to tap into that. And just see, is this sharing? Is this showing everything that you would want to know for this debt?

167

0:17:17

P16

Okay.

168

0:17:22

Emily

What sorts of information would you be looking for.

169

0:17:26

P16

When I'm supposed to pay it, and

170

0:17:30

P16

and how will I pay it?

171

0:17:34

Emily

Okay.

172

0:17:37

P16

Second.

173

0:17:38

P16

Okay.

174

0:17:40

P16

yeah, I like that it also tells when the 1st and second letter was sent, I think they they usually do this already.

175

0:17:54

Emily

And and how so, since you mentioned the the letters being sent, how would that be useful for you?

176

0:18:00

P16

Because sometimes I miss a letter.

177

0:18:03

Emily

Okay.

178

0:18:04

P16

But it tells me. Oh, we submitted like months ago.

179

0:18:09

Emily

Hmm.

180

0:18:09

P16

And I or I probably just ignore it too.

181

0:18:15

P16

But it doesn't. I'm not sure where I'm supposed to pay it from this page.

182

0:18:22

Emily

Okay. So it's not clear about payment.

183

0:18:26

P16

Oh, good, or where, where? I'm supposed to pay it is it, just informational.

184

0:18:36

Emily

So that I'll I'll I'll turn that around to you. Yeah. What where? Where would you expect to find any sort of information on paying.

185

0:18:45

P16

On the same page.

186

0:18:47

Emily

Okay.

187

0:18:48

P16

Or probably also on this screen.

188

0:18:54

P16

But if I click on this, I would like an option of

189

0:18:59

P16

a link where I'm supposed to pay, or a phone number or something.

190

0:19:04

Emily

Oh, okay, either phone number or link to pay, got it? If if something were built like this that as as you say, you say, does not currently have anything about paying. How likely do you think it would be that you would use something like this where it would be just informational.

191

0:19:23

P16

Since I have my phone all the time. It's good to have it.

192

0:19:28

P16

But then it would also be a hassle, since I would have to actually go to the Va website.

193

0:19:33

Emily

Hmm, okay.

194

0:19:34

P16

And their website right now, I don't think it's really phone friendly their interface. So I would have to actually use a PC.

195

0:19:45

Emily

Got it. Okay, you'd have to be on a on a larger computer.

196

0:19:49

Emily

Okay? And then going back to the to the letters that you mentioned like you said like, if by chance you had missed a letter, hadn't opened it, hadn't seen it, for whatever reason, what would you want to do here, let's say you saw one letter was sent. I don't remember the dates on June 16, th but hadn't actually seen it in your home. What would be your next step.

197

0:20:14

P16

There, there's usually majority of the time. There's not really a fee that I have to pay.

198

0:20:21

P16

They just kept sending me letters.

199

0:20:23

Emily

Hmm, okay.

200

0:20:24

P16

So it wasn't really an issue for me. I would say but I I would say that

201

0:20:32

P16

did mention here that I can request for help.

202

0:20:35

P16

But there's also not an info regarding that on how I can request help to.

203

0:20:41

Emily

Then.

204

0:20:41

P16

Balance.

205

0:20:43

Emily

Okay, where? Where? Where would you want to see that that info, on how to request help.

206

0:20:49

P16

Probably the same page, or if there's a help, icon.

207

0:20:54

P16

Like at the the very. Oh, there's 1 right here.

208

0:20:56

P16

Okay, I guess.

209

0:20:57

P16

Sort of.

210

0:21:01

P16

Oh, okay.

211

0:21:02

Emily

Yeah. Go ahead.

212

0:21:04

P16

Sorry. Bye, yeah, I just didn't notice that.

213

0:21:11

Emily

Would there be something that could make it more clear, since, as you said, you didn't notice it@firstst

214

0:21:16

P16

Yeah.

215

0:21:20

Emily

Would that would there be something that that might make that even more clear.

216

0:21:25

P16

Probably on just on here.

217

0:21:27

Emily

Okay.

218

0:21:28

P16

Like a help link.

219

0:21:30

Emily

Hmm, okay, so just right below.

220

0:21:32

P16

Yeah.

221

0:21:33

Emily

Information you're already reading.

222

0:21:36

Emily

Okay? Got it? For the the debt letters at the bottom. Would you expect to be able to read the the letters here.

223

0:21:47

P16

Yes, normally I can go to the letters if I'm on the site.

224

0:21:51

Emily

Oh, okay, all right. So you've you've you've been able to read those letters when you're logged into va.gov.

225

0:21:56

P16

Correct.

226

0:21:57

Emily

Got it. Okay.

227

0:22:02

Emily

would there be anything else here on this page that you would want or expect to be able to do.

228

0:22:13

P16

Nothing that I can think of.

229

0:22:15

Emily

Okay, and since we were talking about requesting help.

230

0:22:20

Emily

Were you aware, that that was an option that that there that there that you could request help for debts like this.

231

0:22:28

P16

Yes.

232

0:22:29

Emily

You are okay. And do you do you recall how you originally learned about that.

233

0:22:35

P16

I've never used it, but I know it's it's available.

234

0:22:39

Emily

Okay.

235

0:22:42

Emily

would you do you recall if that's listed in the letters that you received or you might have learned about it elsewhere.

236

0:22:49

P16

I saw it online like it was an option when I'm paying.

237

0:22:55

Emily

Oh, okay. So when you're logged into va.gov.

238

0:22:58

P16

Yes.

239

0:22:58

Emily

Okay, got it. Okay.

240

0:23:01

Emily

Let me have you go back to the payments button on the lower. Right?

241

0:23:07

Emily

Okay. Oh, sorry one tap once more. Okay, perfect. Yes, and then scroll all the way to the bottom of this screen.

242

0:23:16

Emily

and then the the blank, light gray area at the bottom tap once into that

243

0:23:22

Emily

perfect and then go back to overpayment debts.

244

0:23:27

Emily

So we have a slightly different design. And again, we're going to be just focusing on this top. Actually, one question I forgot to ask. So I know we've been looking at just this top one, the debt for housing thoughts on the information that you have here on the other debts just at this high level? Would there be other things that you would want to know from this page regarding the other debts, like the books and supplies, etc.

245

0:23:57

P16

Let's see.

246

0:24:11

P16

I'm not sure why the

247

0:24:14

P16

the books and supplies are here, since it's supposed to be an overpayment.

248

0:24:22

P16

Or Oh, I paid it!

249

0:24:27

P16

Oh, okay, because it cause it was an overpayment, for on my end or on them.

250

0:24:36

Emily

Right? Yeah, yeah, that's that's in this scenario.

251

0:24:39

Emily

Could could could something be be more clear about that?

252

0:24:45

P16

I think it's fine, but maybe after a month it will go away.

253

0:24:51

Emily

Okay, would you? Would there be any place on like on the phone that you would want to see any previous debts that had already been resolved.

254

0:25:00

P16

I think the maybe the payment history.

255

0:25:03

Emily

Hmm, okay, under history. Okay.

256

0:25:05

P16

Because if it's on here it I would feel like I still owe them something.

257

0:25:10

Emily

Okay, so all right. So these would be more active.

258

0:25:14

Emily

Okay, makes sense.

259

0:25:15

P16

But I think for a recent like July, I think it's fine, but for another, for August I think it should be automatically moved.

260

0:25:25

Emily

Hmm, okay, makes sense.

261

0:25:28

Emily

Okay.

262

0:25:29

Emily

so again, we're going to go back to this, the housing debt, the top one. So we'll pretend that you're you're concerned. You might not have the money to pay this when you next need to what? From here, what might be your next steps in that scenario.

263

0:25:52

P16

I would click on the resolve that probably.

264

0:25:56

Emily

Yeah, you can. You can go go ahead and do that. And just yep.

265

0:25:59

P16

Okay? And then I would choose request help.

266

0:26:03

Emily

Okay, you can go ahead and tap on request help.

267

0:26:12

P16

Go to Sba, and then either a call here or request that relief.

268

0:26:23

Emily

Okay

269

0:26:25

Emily

with with, when when would be instances where you would choose to call as opposed to you know following any directions under request Debt relief.

270

0:26:39

P16

Let's see, I think it for me. It's easier if I just fill out something via form, so I would more likely to choose that that relief.

271

0:26:49

Emily

Okay, got it

272

0:26:50

Emily

and have you? I know you said you filled out forms for payment for do you fill those those out on your phone? Do you fill them out on a laptop or a desktop?

273

0:27:00

P16

Laptop.

274

0:27:01

P16

Okay? Got it? Yeah.

275

0:27:02

P16

Stuff.

276

0:27:03

Emily

Got it? Any any reason you choose that over? Filling it out on on your phone?

277

0:27:08

P16

Usually the the phone

278

0:27:12

P16

for me to talk to a person. It takes a while, and I think it's more convenient to just

279

0:27:18

P16

and faster for me to just fill up the form.

280

0:27:20

Emily

Okay. So for for filling out forms, and and would, would there be any reasons where you might fill out the form specifically on on your phone?

281

0:27:33

P16

If the interface is probably easy, I could.

282

0:27:37

Emily

Okay.

283

0:27:38

P16

Yeah.

284

0:27:40

Emily

And what? And you said, some forms have not been what would make them easier to fill out on the form

285

0:27:46

Emily

phone.

286

0:27:47

P16

Just a better layout.

287

0:27:49

Emily

Okay, yeah, okay, and then, okay, so you've done that.

288

0:27:59

Emily

let me have you. You can close this. Let me have you walk through. We're gonna pretend that you are ready to make a payment, and I promise I'm not going to have you enter in any actual information, no matter what page we get to walk me through, how you would want to do that, how? How, if you, if you're ready to make a payment now.

289

0:28:20

P16

I'll go on the review details and resolve and then pay online.

290

0:28:27

Emily

Okay.

291

0:28:29

P16

And then click, probably click, the link.

292

0:28:39

Emily

okay, you can, you can you can go ahead and do that. Again, i'm, not gonna have you enter in this just to to look at. Look at a couple of pages.

293

0:28:49

P16

Okay.

294

0:28:53

Emily

And have you? Yeah. Oh, you can. Yeah, you can go to. Oh, switch back to chrome.

295

0:29:03

Emily

Yep, yeah. So this would be the page that you come to. I'm not. Gonna have you read through all this, have you? Is is this a site that you've been to before?

296

0:29:13

P16

Yes!

297

0:29:14

Emily

Yeah, okay, got it? So let me have you tap the the pay online. There's a button on the upper. Let? Yep. There we go perfect.

298

0:29:23

Emily

and then scroll down about halfway

299

0:29:26

Emily

and let me get to the section where there are the the blank fields to fill out again. Not going to have you actually type in anything but thoughts on

300

0:29:37

Emily

finding that information that you would need to enter in

301

0:29:41

Emily

what would be your steps for doing that.

302

0:29:45

P16

So usually I have troubles finding pay number.

303

0:29:50

Emily

Hmm.

304

0:29:50

P16

Sometimes it's not on the letter. I would have to actually go to my Va

305

0:29:56

P16

account to look for that.

306

0:29:58

Emily

Okay, got it. So so you're right. So right now, you're both using the letters that you get and logging into your account.

307

0:30:04

P16

Correct.

308

0:30:05

Emily

Got it. Okay, let me have you switch back to Figma?

309

0:30:15

Emily

Perfect.

310

0:30:16

Emily

So thoughts on. So this was the last screen that you were on in our pretend mobile app thoughts on the information here.

311

0:30:27

P16

I do like it. However, I think it would be easier if I can actually just use this app to pay.

312

0:30:36

Emily

Okay, got it?

313

0:30:37

P16

Actionable.

314

0:30:39

Emily

if it were not possible. How like, what? What do you think would be your your process

315

0:30:46

Emily

for filling out for for filling out the fields.

316

0:30:49

P16

I would just go to the to the link.

317

0:30:54

P16

and I guess you have this open and also the the link.

318

0:31:00

Emily

Okay.

319

0:31:01

P16

So I can copy like the file number and pay a number stuff like that.

320

0:31:05

Emily

Oh, okay, okay. So so copy from here, and then bring them over to the paying site.

321

0:31:09

P16

Yeah.

322

0:31:10

Emily

Got it. Okay? Thoughts on that experience of of how you think it might. It might go to to copy from here and then bring it over into the payment site.

323

0:31:22

P16

If it could automatically generate, that would probably easier.

324

0:31:27

P16

Like for the fields.

325

0:31:29

Emily

Yeah. Once you click on the link.

326

0:31:32

P16

Cause. It's not. It's not asking me to sign in. It's just

327

0:31:36

P16

like it's kind of like a public form that I just submitted.

328

0:31:42

P16

Yeah.

329

0:31:42

Emily

Okay, alright, alright! So so you would. You would like it to? To to fill in this information.

330

0:31:48

P16

Yeah.

331

0:31:49

Emily

Okay? So if

332

0:31:51

Emily

if things were built, as is the what you're seeing right now, where it's, it's not currently possible to automatically enter in. You would like you mentioned, you would have to copy from one from the app and bring it over to the payment site. How likely. Do you think it might be for you to use for use it as is.

333

0:32:13

P16

I think it's more so just informational.

334

0:32:16

Emily

Okay.

335

0:32:19

P16

And it's easier access. But I would still probably use my desktop to make it easier.

336

0:32:25

Emily

Hmm, okay, got it. Sorry. So you would. Would probably not use the payment section.

337

0:32:30

Emily

Yeah.

338

0:32:31

Emily

Okay, got it.

339

0:32:31

P16

Just like to see.

340

0:32:33

P16

Yeah.

341

0:32:34

Emily

Okay? So then, the 1st version that we looked at that did not have a link to the payment site, thoughts on which of those 2 versions would be more useful for you.

342

0:32:48

P16

I prefer the second one.

343

0:32:50

Emily

Okay, the one, the one with the with the payment site.

344

0:32:53

P16

Yeah.

345

0:32:54

Emily

Okay, got it, can you? Can you say, why?

346

0:32:57

P16

It still gives me the option to pay on my phone.

347

0:33:01

P16

Even though I'm more likely to not use it.

348

0:33:04

Emily

Okay, got it. So so you, you just want to have that option.

349

0:33:09

P16

Yeah.

350

0:33:10

Emily

Alright. Got it?

351

0:33:12

Emily

Okay? Any other thoughts regarding

352

0:33:18

Emily

regarding the information presented here? If you want to go back one screen the back on the upper left.

353

0:33:24

Emily

Any other thoughts on how things are presented, if there's anything else you feel might be missing.

354

0:34:01

P16

Maybe like the original debt

355

0:34:08

Emily

Oh the the original amount?

356

0:34:10

P16

Yeah, cause I see that there's a partial on here.

357

0:34:14

Emily

Okay, you don't even want to know originally how much was Owed here.

358

0:34:18

P16

Yeah.

359

0:34:18

Emily

Okay. Where? Where? Might you expect to see that.

360

0:34:26

P16

No, it could be at the on this stop.

361

0:34:33

P16

On this main icon, but at the bottom.

362

0:34:38

Emily

Sorry. Which which section.

363

0:34:40

P16

Like the the current, square.

364

0:34:46

Emily

Oh, the one that.

365

0:34:47

P16

For housing.

366

0:34:48

Emily

Alright. So so right right there, you'd want to see the total amount. Yeah.

367

0:34:52

P16

At the bottom.

368

0:34:54

Emily

Oh, okay, toward toward the bottom of that square.

369

0:34:56

P16

Yeah.

370

0:34:57

Emily

Got it. Okay? Understandable.

371

0:35:00

Emily

Okay. Any. Anything else that might be might be helpful for you from here.

372

0:35:05

P16

I think that's it.

373

0:35:06

Emily

Okay and thought, since I know you've you've gone to va.gov quite a bit for finances. Thoughts on how what we've been experiencing here compares to va.gov.

374

0:35:23

P16

I do like that. There's a mobile option.

375

0:35:27

Emily

Okay?

376

0:35:29

Emily

What? What? Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

377

0:35:31

P16

I just have my phone all the time. So.

378

0:35:34

Emily

Okay.

379

0:35:34

P16

And if it, if once I have

380

0:35:38

P16

like a debt, it will give me like maybe that red bubble on that

381

0:35:45

P16

on the icon of the app, so I know that I'm supposed to look in the app.

382

0:35:50

Emily

Hmm, okay.

383

0:35:51

P16

Like a notification or something. Instead of waiting for the mail.

384

0:35:55

Emily

Okay. So so you'd want some sort of notification on your phone instead.

385

0:35:59

P16

Yeah.

386

0:36:00

Emily

Okay. Makes sense. Alright. Any other differences you're noticing either you like or don't like between this and what you've experienced on the website.

387

0:36:15

P16

Hmm!

388

0:36:18

P16

Can I go back? Hold on.

389

0:36:39

P16

Nothing that I can think of.

390

0:36:41

Emily

Okay, got it. Let me have you tap again into payments on the lower right.

391

0:36:47

Emily

all right. And now we're going to look at the co-pays side toward the bottom there.

392

0:36:53

Emily

and so similar question as before, with the overpayments. Looking at this, what sort of information

393

0:37:01

Emily

might you be looking for and like. How, what, what are your thoughts on how things are presented here.

394

0:37:11

P16

Trying to pass next month?

395

0:37:16

P16

It just gives me the past 6 months. Does it give me like the whole history, or do I have to go back to the payment history?

396

0:37:24

Emily

Oh, as well. I'll turn that around. Is that where? Where might you expect to see that.

397

0:37:30

P16

The history.

398

0:37:31

Emily

History. Okay, you wanna go in history. Okay.

399

0:37:34

P16

If it's if it's already paid.

400

0:37:38

Emily

Oh, oh, to see so to see bills that you have already paid! You'd you'd want to find them.

401

0:37:46

P16

On the history, not not on here.

402

0:37:48

Emily

Got it. Okay? So you would you? So similar as the overpayments? You would not want to see bills that you've already paid here.

403

0:37:54

P16

Yeah, yeah.

404

0:37:55

Emily

Okay, yeah. Got it. Okay? And for that, we're just gonna look at the top on the James A. Haley hospital. What sort of information would be important to you for this particular bill.

405

0:38:10

P16

From just looking at the screen.

406

0:38:13

Emily

Yeah, yeah. You can scroll down.

407

0:38:17

Emily

Oh, sorry if yeah. Yeah. I was. Gonna say, yes, you can tap into it. Yes.

408

0:38:23

P16

Is the account number mine? Or the Va's.

409

0:38:32

Emily

What would make it more clear what that is.

410

0:38:38

P16

I mean, if I have to pay it, I think it should be a way to pay them.

411

0:38:44

P16

Not sure what the account, or unless it's like an id for me.

412

0:38:48

Emily

Okay, yeah. Wha what would make it more clear? So you knew what? That is exactly.

413

0:38:54

P16

Like Va number, or like a member number.

414

0:39:03

Emily

Okay.

415

0:39:04

Emily

so so you'd want it. So in instead of saying account number you'd you'd want it labeled differently.

416

0:39:12

P16

Yeah, cause it sounds like a bank.

417

0:39:16

Emily

Got it.

418

0:39:27

P16

Be Miss Balance. Okay.

419

0:39:38

Emily

What other information might you be looking for.

420

0:39:42

P16

How to pay the bill.

421

0:39:43

Emily

Okay.

422

0:39:46

P16

And and what what it, what it is for for lack of medication. And

423

0:39:55

P16

okay, like, yeah, what care it was from.

424

0:40:02

Emily

Okay any with what is here? Would there be anything different that you might want to know?

425

0:40:15

P16

June

426

0:40:19

P16

we see.

427

0:40:32

P16

There are some, for like different dates on here.

428

0:40:49

Emily

And is that not what you're expecting to? Is it? Say more about the different dates that you just referenced.

429

0:40:56

P16

Usually cause they go by dates.

430

0:41:00

P16

Instead of the clinic like this.

431

0:41:03

Emily

Hmm. Oh, okay.

432

0:41:04

P16

Then each.

433

0:41:06

P16

It's like individualized. It's not

434

0:41:12

P16

gathered in for for each clinic.

435

0:41:16

Emily

Okay. So that so the way that you're you're currently receiving copays, it's it's not. It's not like this.

436

0:41:23

P16

I I don't think so. It was just by date. And what copay that is.

437

0:41:28

Emily

Oh, okay, okay.

438

0:41:38

Emily

Would there be anything that could make it more clear, since since you referenced the grouping it by location.

439

0:41:56

P16

I think this is okay, actually.

440

0:41:58

Emily

Okay.

441

0:41:59

P16

It's cause it looks cleaner. And then when I go here, it actually tells me the dates.

442

0:42:08

Emily

Okay.

443

0:42:12

Emily

anything else you might want to know in regards to the dates yeah, for this for this particular one.

444

0:42:19

P16

If it's already paid.

445

0:42:20

Emily

Hmm, okay.

446

0:42:24

P16

Let's see. Okay.

447

0:42:29

Emily

How would you want to see it notified forever.

448

0:42:32

P16

5

449

0:42:34

Emily

Go ahead. Sorry.

450

0:42:38

P16

I'm sorry. Hold on!

451

0:42:40

P16

Say that one more time.

452

0:42:45

Emily

Yeah, thoughts, on.

453

0:42:46

P16

Time.

454

0:42:47

Emily

Oh, there we go! Yeah. Thoughts on how it could be more clear because you mentioned you. You would want to see if something has not been paid. What are your thoughts on? How to make that more clear?

455

0:42:59

P16

Probably, if it's highlighted, or like the the icon, the the warning icon. Next to this.

456

0:43:08

P16

the ones that have not been paid compared?

457

0:43:11

P16

No, this one payment received has that check icon from here.

458

0:43:18

Emily

Okay, got it.

459

0:43:20

Emily

Okay? So for for each each of those the the those listings you you want to know if it has been paid, or if it has not yet been paid.

460

0:43:29

P16

Yeah.

461

0:43:29

Emily

Okay. Got it alright. Type on pay. Oh, there we go now it's come back.

462

0:43:37

Emily

Tap into yeah. Let's say, go back into here.

463

0:43:41

Emily

Thoughts on yeah. Other other information you would. You would want to know here.

464

0:43:49

P16

And

465

0:44:08

P16

I guess so, since they're different dates.

466

0:44:12

P16

I was wondering if the due dates would be different as well.

467

0:44:17

Emily

Oh, okay. So for each of the each, each of the charges.

468

0:44:21

P16

Yeah, cause there's 20 second, and then there's the 4.th But there's only one due date.

469

0:44:26

Emily

Hmm, okay.

470

0:44:26

P16

So I don't know if they compiled they just made one due date for both.

471

0:44:32

Emily

Hmm, is there, what could make that more clear as to when exactly things are due.

472

0:44:39

P16

Probably next to the actual copay

473

0:44:44

P16

do like, for like June 4, th due on something something.

474

0:44:48

Emily

Got it. Okay? So for each one broken up like this, all right.

475

0:44:56

Emily

And do you ever look at it could be in really any other financial aspect of your life. Do you ever look at statements that you receive.

476

0:45:07

P16

No.

477

0:45:08

Emily

Yeah, okay. Got it.

478

0:45:10

Emily

Thoughts on if you might look at the statements here on this page.

479

0:45:19

Emily

Or I guess, would you?

480

0:45:24

Emily

would would you? Would you know how how those might be useful?

481

0:45:29

P16

Yes, if I want to see like the overall

482

0:45:36

P16

balance or account.

483

0:45:44

Emily

Okay, do you think you might? I know you said, now, you're, not, you don't look at statements in other areas, would that be something you might look at here in this section.

484

0:45:56

P16

Probably still not.

485

0:45:57

Emily

No. Okay.

486

0:45:58

P16

I. I may look at it from time to time, but I usually don't check my statements.

487

0:46:03

Emily

Hmm, okay, got it.

488

0:46:05

Emily

Okay. Let me have you scroll up toward the top. And even though I know you just said you probably wouldn't look at it. Let me have you tap on the go to current statement

489

0:46:17

Emily

and let me know your thoughts on. If this is something you might you might find useful at all from within an app.

490

0:46:27

P16

Yeah, it's just it's the same. It looks like the same letter I get when I owe them something.

491

0:46:32

Emily

Okay.

492

0:46:37

Emily

so know, knowing what it looks like. Do you think this might be something that that you would ever look at? If if it were in

493

0:46:45

Emily

a section like this.

494

0:46:48

P16

Yeah, I if I lost the letter or something like for this. Yeah.

495

0:46:53

Emily

Okay, and then what what might you do with it? If you did? Let's say, lose lose a letter.

496

0:47:01

P16

Just to verify that the info is correct.

497

0:47:08

Emily

Okay? And might, there be anything else that that you would do outside of verification.

498

0:47:18

P16

If I have to pay, I usually go here to look at the my number.

499

0:47:25

Emily

Okay, the the number you would need to pay.

500

0:47:28

P16

Yeah.

501

0:47:29

Emily

Got it. Okay, so let me have you tap done there?

502

0:47:37

Emily

Oh, sorry. At the the upper left. You can tap done.

503

0:47:42

Emily

Yep, perfect. So we're gonna pretend that you see an error. Let's say one of the doctor appointments. You're sure you didn't actually attend what would be your next step, knowing that you have seen an error here.

504

0:48:01

P16

I would go to the help button, and probably call them.

505

0:48:05

Emily

Okay, looking to call

506

0:48:08

Emily

and then walk me through. If you were ready to pay from this walk me through how you think you might do, or how how you would, you would potentially do that.

507

0:48:20

P16

Like I would click on the pay, and then more. If there's no error, I would go to the to pay that golf.

508

0:48:29

Emily

Okay, yeah, you can go ahead and do that. And again, I'm not. Gonna have you actually enter any real information.

509

0:48:34

Emily

So scroll down, we're going to skip most of this, as I know. There's lots of reading, and then go to continue to the form. Oh, we just passed it just like, yep, right there in the middle. There we go.

510

0:48:43

Emily

and again scroll down. Yeah. So thoughts on you've tapped on that, and you've opened up pay.gov. What would be your next step to actually fill this out and make the payment.

511

0:48:57

P16

Just before. I also have the other

512

P16

I have the letter with me to fill out, like the account number.

513

0:49:07

P16

And like how much I owe.

514

0:49:11

Emily

Okay. So so you you would do this when you're when you're holding the physical letter that they had mailed.

515

0:49:16

P16

Yeah.

516

0:49:17

Emily

Got it. Okay, let me have you switch back to the figma app.

517

0:49:23

Emily

Okay? And you can click, go back and close. So we're just gonna pretend you've this is where you left off from. Yeah. Thoughts on on on using this at all. The information you would need to actually pay.

518

0:49:38

P16

Yeah, I I do like this.

519

0:49:45

P16

If they can also automate it. If not, I think the just. The link is fine.

520

0:49:50

Emily

Okay.

521

0:49:50

P16

Okay.

522

0:49:51

Emily

What would be your step to getting the information.

523

0:49:55

P16

And you know.

524

0:49:55

Emily

The into pay.gov.

525

0:49:59

P16

If I'm using the phone, I just copy paste it.

526

0:50:02

Emily

Okay, got it.

527

0:50:04

Emily

And then anything else I know you said outside of it being automatically entered. Your information. Anything else that might make it easier to to make a payment.

528

0:50:17

P16

No, it gives me all the options I would probably need, like the call, or by person.

529

0:50:25

Emily

Okay, got it.

530

0:50:27

Emily

And then anything else on this screen that you haven't already mentioned that you think could be useful, or that you might be looking for.

531

0:50:38

P16

In terms of payment. No.

532

0:50:40

Emily

No, okay, got it. And then a similar question as I asked with the the overpayments

533

0:50:47

Emily

thoughts on. If you might use a section like this that had the payment as opposed to a section like this, that maybe only had the information

534

0:50:58

Emily

which one would be would would do you? Do you think you would use more.

535

0:51:03

P16

The one where I can pay.

536

0:51:04

Emily

Gigabyte. Okay, got it

537

0:51:07

Emily

538

0:51:23

Emily

Okay.

Janelle

540

0:51:28

Emily

541

0:51:30

Emily

Alright, I believe that is it so? Unless you yeah. Anything else that you haven't yet shared regarding managing finances with the Va.

542

0:51:41

P16

No! That's it.

543

0:51:42

Emily

Okay, great. Well, I really appreciate your help. This is super helpful to speak directly with veterans about experiences and about what is useful, not useful, as we work on making things better for everyone using them. So thank you so much for taking the time, and I know Paragene will be reaching out as a thank you for the next steps.
