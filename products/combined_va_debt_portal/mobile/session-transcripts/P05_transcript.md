<v Moderator - Emily>VA partners?

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.680
<v P 05>Yes.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. Thank you so much. So great.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.840
<v Moderator - Emily>So let's, I'd love to hear just a little

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Moderator - Emily>bit about yourself, specifically as a veteran.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Moderator - Emily>What branch of the military do you serve

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Moderator - Emily>when you retired or separated?

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.760
<v P 05>[redacted] separated, 2013.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And what sort of experience

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Moderator - Emily>have you had with Veteran affairs since then?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.280
<v P 05>I'm disabled veteran.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.520
<v P 05>I use the health care use, educational benefits,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.640
<v P 05>travel claims, those kind of things.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good. And have you or how much experience

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Moderator - Emily>have you had using the VA website and, or

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Moderator - Emily>the VA app?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.000
<v P 05>Both. I think I'm pretty close to expert.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.440
<v P 05>Okay, look, the logins, you know, messaging,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.080
<v P 05>the clinics and yeah, I feel very well acclimated

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.160
<v P 05>for somebody who doesn't work.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.360
<v Moderator - Emily>For the va. Oh, got it. And what, in what

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Moderator - Emily>cases do you choose to use the app over the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Moderator - Emily>website?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.320
<v P 05>As much as I can. And a lot of it's just

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.600
<v P 05>because, it's just, it's. The app's great

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.600
<v P 05>for anything. You look up what you got paid.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.520
<v P 05>If basically anything, with the exception

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.960
<v P 05>of like educational, it's just easier to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.040
<v P 05>use the website for some reason.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.760
<v P 05>Like it's not web. Like post 911 GI benefits,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.800
<v P 05>for instance, are well queued, but anything

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.620
<v P 05>healthcare related or to check a claim or

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.420
<v P 05>benefits, disability, like letter, like it's

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.620
<v P 05>everything you need or to generate letters

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.340
<v P 05>that you might need, you know, so it's. Yeah,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.820
<v P 05>basically anything minus like educational.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. So you're using it for most

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Moderator - Emily>things it sounds like.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, now we're just going to move into the,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Moderator - Emily>the financial portion of the discussion.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Moderator - Emily>So I want to make sure you're only sharing

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.300
<v Moderator - Emily>what you're willing. I have no additional

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Moderator - Emily>information about finance. I'm sorry, go

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.200
<v Moderator - Emily>ahead.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.200
<v P 05>I'm an open book.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.800
<v P 05>That's fine.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.560
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, got it. Okay, sorry. All right, so first

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Moderator - Emily>we're going to be discussing debt. So have

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Moderator - Emily>you had experience with owing the VA money

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Moderator - Emily>for any sort of like benefit overpayment

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Moderator - Emily>debt?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.200
<v P 05>Yes, yes, I have.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.560
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And at whatever level you're comfortable,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.320
<v Moderator - Emily>could you tell me just a little bit about

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Moderator - Emily>that experience?

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.970
<v P 05>I have. Most recently I, I have a book stipend,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.810
<v P 05>post 911 GI bill overpayment from the spring

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.090
<v P 05>or late winter for like [redacted]. I, I actually

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.490
<v P 05>have not received a letter for it. I just

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.330
<v P 05>view it as kind of small potatoes and they're

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.090
<v P 05>Very sting. I. I just figure it.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.060
<v P 05>It was in an oversight on the VA and I got

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.380
<v P 05>overpaid and. And they tracked that stuff

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.780
<v P 05>very well. So I figured it is a legit debt.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.940
<v P 05>I just don't know how they're gonna. I think

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.300
<v P 05>it.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.300
<v P 05>I glanced at it on that's how I learned because

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.420
<v P 05>I was looking up my post 911 GI benefits

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.940
<v P 05>and then somehow I scrolled over and there

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.540
<v P 05>was this thing like you have one debt. And

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.780
<v P 05>I'm like, what is that? So I've never received

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.740
<v P 05>a letter. And when I receive the letter,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.020
<v P 05>it's going to be very confusing. And I just

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.930
<v P 05>take it as they're very fair, firm and consistent.

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.610
<v P 05>So I believe it's right. And then I had a

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.770
<v P 05>overpayment of like 12 or 1400 bucks a couple

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.450
<v P 05>years ago was before COVID It had been 2017

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.330
<v P 05>or 2018. And then I disputed it and I just

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.090
<v P 05>don't remember the details. It was so long

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.530
<v P 05>ago. And they end up squashing it.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.020
<v P 05>I never. They got squared away or just something

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.060
<v P 05>and. Yeah, just one. Yeah, I remember. Yeah.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.580
<v P 05>Used to get the letters. It was from either

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.140
<v P 05>Wisconsin. I want to say it was from New

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.140
<v P 05>York. Buffalo. Yeah.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.580
<v P 05>I just. I just don't remember. It was so

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.140
<v P 05>long ago. And I. Yeah, I just. It's not a

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.900
<v P 05>sight out of mind.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And for that one. Were you

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.620
<v Moderator - Emily>sent a letter for that one, do you recall?

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Moderator - Emily>You were. Okay, got.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.420
<v P 05>Yeah, because I. I used to get the letter

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.340
<v P 05>and I would call and somehow it had to do

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.060
<v P 05>with the school. I was going to Notre Dame

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.220
<v P 05>at the time and they weren't doing something

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.660
<v P 05>right. And when they did ended up washing

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.700
<v P 05>it clean. So.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.100
<v Moderator - Emily>So it was taken care of. Got it.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.580
<v P 05>Yeah.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And then for the current one where

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Moderator - Emily>you said you owe the.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.300
<v Moderator - Emily>The $83 but haven't received any letter when

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.780
<v Moderator - Emily>you were you able to find any information

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.790
<v Moderator - Emily>when you did happen upon it, like when it

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Moderator - Emily>might be due or like any other information?

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.430
<v P 05>There wasn't much information. It was something

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.590
<v P 05>book and supply stipend and would notice.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.350
<v P 05>I would get that $83. And you know what?

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.510
<v P 05>It was probably. I think it was from May

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.030
<v P 05>and the school when I graduated the last

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.510
<v P 05>day was like April something. And I think

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.270
<v P 05>they re. They did it for May and error. So

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.910
<v P 05>I just don't have much issue with the debt.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.620
<v P 05>Um.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:32.180
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.780
<v P 05>I don't. I'm not going to dispute it. I don't

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.060
<v P 05>think.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.060
<v P 05>But I don't. Yeah. Know the details out.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.860
<v P 05>Yeah.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Moderator - Emily>All right.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.220
<v Moderator - Emily>And then how. How about For. Have you had

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.700
<v Moderator - Emily>any experience with medical co pays through

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.220
<v Moderator - Emily>va?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.060
<v P 05>No, no, nothing. No issues.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:52.740
<v P 05>Anything? Healthcare.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:59.140
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And any in regards to the.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.060
<v Moderator - Emily>The overpayment debt that you.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.380
<v Moderator - Emily>That you stumb. I know said you haven't received

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.500
<v Moderator - Emily>a letter. It may be confusing when you do.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.780
<v Moderator - Emily>Any thoughts on what could be made easier

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Moderator - Emily>in terms of the communication from va?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.540
<v P 05>No in here.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.020
<v P 05>I don't know too. It could have got lost

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.500
<v P 05>in the mail. The VA is really good about

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.500
<v P 05>sending letters. I don't have mail issues

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.900
<v P 05>where I'm at. Again, this was a couple of

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.220
<v P 05>weeks ago.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.460
<v P 05>I learned about it. Now I'm curious to log

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.160
<v P 05>in and pique my curiosity about it even though

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.560
<v P 05>I'm not that worried about it. Just again,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.560
<v P 05>because they're very diligent like these

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.320
<v P 05>things. It just. It probably is an overpayment

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.280
<v P 05>of $83.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.520
<v P 05>Yeah, I just. I just really haven't put much

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.560
<v P 05>food to thought on it.

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.240
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. All right, so now I'm going

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.000
<v Moderator - Emily>to have you share your screen and then we're

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Moderator - Emily>going to go through downloading Figma and

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.200
<v Moderator - Emily>get things going there. Let me know if you

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.360
<v Moderator - Emily>need help to share your screen.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.570
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, it is starting.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Moderator - Emily>I think you just have to tap anywhere outside

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.580
<v Moderator - Emily>of that. Stop. Perfect. Okay, so now let

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Moderator - Emily>me see if you're able to download the Figma

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.860
<v Moderator - Emily>app. We'll just do it right here.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.140
<v Moderator - Emily>If you're able to get to your app store,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.820
<v Moderator - Emily>let me know if you need help with that.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.750
<v P 05>I just spelled it again. F I G M A. F I.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.830
<v Moderator - Emily>G M A. Yep. So the top one where it just

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Moderator - Emily>says figma and Yep. The one halfway down,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.910
<v Moderator - Emily>that will be.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:01.830
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep, that one.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.710
<v Moderator - Emily>We're not paying for anything, I promise.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Moderator - Emily>I may have to open up the app store again.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, just make sure it's. Where did it go?

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Oh, there we go. Must have gotten paused

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.200
<v Moderator - Emily>for some reason. Oh, done. All right.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.280
<v Moderator - Emily>And wait for that to show up. Okay. Installing.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.240
<v Moderator - Emily>Almost there. All right.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so go to login to Figma.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:48.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, continue there. Okay, so for email,

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Moderator - Emily>it's going to be vatest000mail.com. Oh, one

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Moderator - Emily>more zero. It's three zeros. Yep.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:11.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And the password is V A V A V A V A.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.810
<v Moderator - Emily>They need eight characters. I tried to make

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:17.170
<v Moderator - Emily>it easy. Okay.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.570
<v Moderator - Emily>And then I just need to send you a confirmation.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Give me just a moment. Opening up the email

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.290
<v Moderator - Emily>over here. Okay, I can see it. And.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. The authentication code is 425-7394.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:38.140
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, get that going. Continue with

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.100
<v Moderator - Emily>mobile app. Give It Just a moment.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:45.380
<v P 05>Okay.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.220
<v Moderator - Emily>Try. Okay. All right, now give it just a

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.140
<v Moderator - Emily>moment. Don't click on that just yet. I am

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.060
<v Moderator - Emily>just getting you.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Moderator - Emily>There we go. Within the Zoom app. I'm going

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Moderator - Emily>to send you a link. So yeah, go back to Zoom

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Moderator - Emily>and that should be. You may have to tap somewhere

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.050
<v Moderator - Emily>in the top to get back to.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.410
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, there

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:14.570
<v Moderator - Emily>we go. All right. If you tap in them.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.450
<v Moderator - Emily>There we go. Chat at the bottom.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:27.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, the chat notification on the bottom

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.750
<v Moderator - Emily>left. Yep, there we go. All right, so tap

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Moderator - Emily>that extra long link. All right, we're doing

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.430
<v Moderator - Emily>well. So technology wants to cooperate.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.270
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, it worked. I love how technology

00:10:44.349 --> 00:10:49.590
<v Moderator - Emily>works. Okay, so now here is our pretend mobile

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.750
<v Moderator - Emily>app. So right now don't click on anything

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:58.670
<v Moderator - Emily>quite yet. But as of course you've said you

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Moderator - Emily>use the app on a regular basis.

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.610
<v Moderator - Emily>This should look mostly familiar. Without

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:06.570
<v Moderator - Emily>tapping anything, where would you expect

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.010
<v Moderator - Emily>to find any. Any indication of money that

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.370
<v Moderator - Emily>you owe to VA.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.050
<v P 05>Messages? I would say.

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:15.770
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.050
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Any other thoughts? So all right. So

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.050
<v Moderator - Emily>you'd most likely go into messages. Other

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.370
<v Moderator - Emily>thoughts of other places you might go?

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.900
<v P 05>Benefits the lower. Which is where we are.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.500
<v P 05>No, that would be it.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:37.300
<v P 05>Yeah.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.380
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. So it's actually where we are

00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:42.820
<v Moderator - Emily>thinking about putting. This is actually

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.820
<v Moderator - Emily>under the payments on the. The lower. Right.

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.420
<v Moderator - Emily>So any thoughts since that wasn't one that

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.790
<v Moderator - Emily>you mentioned, any thoughts on how that might

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Moderator - Emily>be more clear if there might be a different

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Moderator - Emily>title that would be more appropriate? You

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.110
<v Moderator - Emily>think?

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:02.710
<v P 05>Good question. See, I'm so mindful of payments.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.750
<v P 05>Is this your. Your payment history and if

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.070
<v P 05>you have to change direct deposit, which

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.950
<v P 05>now everything's streamlined to one. You

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.430
<v P 05>only do one direct deposit.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:17.150
<v P 05>And you know, I like this overpayment debt

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.110
<v P 05>thing. And then co pays.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.000
<v P 05>Yeah. I don't think you. So you got home

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.680
<v P 05>health benefits payments. I wouldn't want

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.440
<v P 05>to add another toggle on the bottom. I think

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.840
<v P 05>this is very well thought out in my opinion.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.520
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Any other thoughts regarding

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.320
<v Moderator - Emily>this particular page? I know you said you

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.320
<v Moderator - Emily>like the clarity of breaking out the overpayment

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.720
<v Moderator - Emily>and debt. How about. Oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.010
<v P 05>No, I don't. I just think this looks really

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:47.290
<v P 05>good.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:52.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And how about the. The information

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:56.010
<v Moderator - Emily>that is below the word overpayment debts.

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.690
<v Moderator - Emily>Any thoughts on. From just from a high level.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.130
<v Moderator - Emily>Other types of information you might want

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:02.810
<v Moderator - Emily>to see there?

00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.610
<v P 05>No, because it has to do for debts. I don't

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.090
<v P 05>know what you could put without taking up

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.210
<v P 05>more space and making it more, you know,

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.330
<v P 05>something convoluted.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then actually, let me have

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Moderator - Emily>you go back just to that payments page just

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Moderator - Emily>for a moment. I had one more question on

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:25.540
<v Moderator - Emily>that. If. Yeah, yeah, there.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.340
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Thoughts on. Since I know you said

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.460
<v Moderator - Emily>that payments, you always think of payments

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.340
<v Moderator - Emily>that are. That are sent to you. Any thoughts

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.340
<v Moderator - Emily>on the organization of this now that this

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.150
<v Moderator - Emily>will be including both money comes to you

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.590
<v Moderator - Emily>and money going out?

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:45.630
<v P 05>No, because I can see the whole page. Payments,

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:49.630
<v P 05>you, that and bills like this is very well

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.670
<v P 05>thought out in my opinion.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, all right, great.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.190
<v P 05>Very user.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:56.069
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good to know.

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:57.870
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so yeah, it's now if you want

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Moderator - Emily>to tap into the overpayment debts. So I know

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:02.630
<v Moderator - Emily>you were, you were going a moment ago and

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.750
<v Moderator - Emily>actually, I'm sorry, go back, go back to

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.550
<v Moderator - Emily>payments.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.750
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, there we go. Scroll to the bottom.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:14.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Just going to send you to kind of a little

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:18.030
<v Moderator - Emily>hidden link. If you can tap in the, the empty

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.310
<v Moderator - Emily>gray section below copays. Tap that once.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm gonna get. Yeah, okay. Perfect. All right.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:24.830
<v Moderator - Emily>Yes.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Now we're good. All right. And. Oh, go back.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.990
<v Moderator - Emily>We're under Wanderer Copay.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:33.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Sometimes the. This thing is a little, a

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.150
<v Moderator - Emily>little bit finicky. Yes, Perfect. Thank you.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.950
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, if you want to tap into overpayment

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:42.630
<v Moderator - Emily>debts, we're under co Pays.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. So tap overpayment debts. Let me see.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:45.710
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay, now we're there.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:51.070
<v Moderator - Emily>Perfect. So thoughts on the information presented

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:54.670
<v Moderator - Emily>here? How clear would it be to you to see

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.830
<v Moderator - Emily>just how much you currently owe?

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.420
<v P 05>No, I, I think this is really good. I mean

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.500
<v P 05>you got the green showing arrow like on the

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.300
<v P 05>post 911 GI debt bill for books and supplies.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.060
<v P 05>You got the question mark.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.740
<v P 05>You know, so obviously this tuition contact

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.140
<v P 05>US Department, treasury sounds like it's

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.150
<v P 05>very convoluted, very complicated. You know,

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:28.390
<v P 05>the disability compensation one, we're reducing

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.670
<v P 05>your benefit and as long as I get details,

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.310
<v P 05>that's good.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.110
<v P 05>This. Yeah, this is pretty good.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.910
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so we're going to look at. Oh, actually

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Moderator - Emily>one question. If you have a new debt that

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Moderator - Emily>comes, how would you expect to be notified

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.750
<v Moderator - Emily>and to know that there is a new debt?

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.850
<v P 05>Well, I think it'll be good if there's. And

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.570
<v P 05>I don't know, maybe I'm not set up for it

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:01.290
<v P 05>on the VA app about notifications, like if

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.210
<v P 05>you had say your monthly disability thing

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:07.290
<v P 05>hit and it had a notification. Now I don't

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.010
<v P 05>need that. I don't track it that closely,

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.370
<v P 05>but I could see for most people it would

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.450
<v P 05>be important. But if you could sign up for

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:16.450
<v P 05>notifications and get that, like I get notifications.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.930
<v P 05>I Believe if I. No, I don't.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.700
<v P 05>Like if I get an email. I think I do. From

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:28.220
<v P 05>a healthcare person like a nurse or nurse

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.660
<v P 05>practitioner maybe. But it's been so long,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:35.380
<v P 05>I just don't recall. But you know, I forget

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.660
<v P 05>how I know that I'm getting.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.980
<v P 05>Yeah, if there's a way to get a notification.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.780
<v P 05>That's probably the only thing would be kind

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:41.220
<v P 05>of cool.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.580
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, got it. So we're gonna just focus

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.540
<v Moderator - Emily>on that top one, the post 911 for housing.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Moderator - Emily>What would you need to know for this particular

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.360
<v Moderator - Emily>debt?

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.720
<v Moderator - Emily>What's important to you?

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.760
<v P 05>Kind of like an access to the letter. So

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.760
<v P 05>like if you go into VA disability, like you

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.680
<v P 05>can basically get all your letters on your

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.040
<v P 05>iPhone. Generate letters. Obviously you don't

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.720
<v P 05>need to generate a letter here, but like

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.560
<v P 05>to be able to quickly access the VA letter

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.370
<v P 05>would be very helpful, I would think. I would

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:20.890
<v P 05>like to be able to do that.

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.050
<v P 05>And then payment due dates. Yeah. Kind of

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.490
<v P 05>the transaction history which you have. Oh,

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.690
<v P 05>I see it now. You got this.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:31.250
<v P 05>These letters - first demand letter, second.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.810
<v P 05>Yeah. I really wouldn’t add anything because

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.970
<v P 05>it's. You want to keep it simple and to the

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:39.570
<v P 05>point, so. Looks really good actually.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:43.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. So since you specifically mentioned

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.450
<v Moderator - Emily>the. The letters, can you. Can you tap into

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.250
<v Moderator - Emily>that the. The details again?

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:52.990
<v Moderator - Emily>One. Yeah, there we go. Yeah. Thoughts on

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:55.270
<v Moderator - Emily>the information presented here regarding

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.310
<v Moderator - Emily>the letters on the bottom?

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.510
<v P 05>No, as long as you click it. I mean you got

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.190
<v P 05>the date, you got the first letter, second

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.870
<v P 05>letter, chronological order. I don't think

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.150
<v P 05>anything better you can do.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So would you.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.030
<v Moderator - Emily>Would. Would you expect to be able to view

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.790
<v Moderator - Emily>the letters here?

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.340
<v P 05>I would. I'm just from personal history.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.980
<v P 05>I just know there's no way to do that in

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:21.340
<v P 05>the app.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.420
<v P 05>But it would be very easy instead of having

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.460
<v P 05>to go to the VA website on a desktop. Like

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.980
<v P 05>the VA app is really good. The only thing

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.820
<v P 05>is not easy with is it doesn't touch anything

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.740
<v P 05>post 911 GI bill and anything deaths. So

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.740
<v P 05>if those two are incorporated, I mean the

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:40.700
<v P 05>app would be perfect.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.560
<v P 05>You would never have to use the site. You

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.160
<v P 05>have the face ID because that DHS login stuff.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.680
<v P 05>Like it can be like complicated. And then

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.080
<v P 05>I do ID. me but I think for some reason I

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.720
<v P 05>have one from like a work old work email

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.920
<v P 05>so that even gets convoluted. But like the

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.280
<v P 05>VA app is so - it's everything it needs to

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.760
<v P 05>be and it's nothing that it's not and it

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.250
<v P 05>works perfect. So I think this looks really

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.650
<v P 05>good actually. I want to critique it. I'm

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:15.530
<v P 05>also not Very critical of apps, but I'm easy

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.970
<v P 05>to please. But this, yeah, just I'm trying

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:21.450
<v P 05>to think of it from someone else's, you know,

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:22.650
<v P 05>have a different perspective.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.810
<v P 05>You know what the perspective is? I think

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:25.530
<v P 05>this is perfect.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.850
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. So. Yes.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Any other information that you would feel

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Moderator - Emily>necessary from this particular debt?

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:38.970
<v P 05>No, but especially like with the debts because

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.130
<v P 05>I mean you can kind of snowball things get

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.090
<v P 05>worse. There's a way to get notifications

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.770
<v P 05>on your phone would be super easy.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, notifications about like what, what

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.730
<v Moderator - Emily>specification would you want?

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:52.490
<v P 05>You have a new letter or you have a, you

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:57.010
<v P 05>know, a new amount owed or payment received,

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:58.450
<v P 05>like those kind of things.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:05.960
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then if you have paid off

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:09.880
<v Moderator - Emily>a debt, what would you expect to see in the

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.720
<v Moderator - Emily>app once that has been paid off?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.560
<v P 05>Just a transaction history. So you have like

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.159
<v P 05>late fee, partial payment, just like debt

00:20:17.159 --> 00:20:20.600
<v P 05>close or closure of debt would be bolded.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.720
<v P 05>So July, whatever, 25th, 2005, closure of

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.870
<v P 05>debt received via achievement minus whatever.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.990
<v P 05>And then like an asterisk, your debt is resolved.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:36.190
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great, Sounds good. And then would

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:38.470
<v Moderator - Emily>there be other things that you would expect

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:42.070
<v Moderator - Emily>to be able to do from, from, from this screen

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.030
<v Moderator - Emily>regarding this debt?

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.710
<v P 05>No. I understand how the VA doesn't take

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:50.350
<v P 05>credit cards, but it'd be kind of cool if

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:53.630
<v P 05>you could pay with a credit card to resolve

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:54.150
<v P 05>the debt.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.410
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:58.130
<v P 05>Like there's a payment thing.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:20:59.650
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:03.530
<v Moderator - Emily>So yeah, so since, so you would like some

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:06.130
<v Moderator - Emily>sort of payment ability for a credit card.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:11.930
<v Moderator - Emily>So if this were built in real life, especially

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.130
<v Moderator - Emily>since you specifically mentioned that you

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.210
<v Moderator - Emily>would like some sort of way to pay by credit

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:19.850
<v Moderator - Emily>card, how likely would you, how likely would

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.770
<v Moderator - Emily>you use it? You believe?

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.810
<v P 05>Like if I had a debt of something significant,

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.890
<v P 05>like I mean Again, this $83 just skips my

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.690
<v P 05>mind with the busyness of life. But if it

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:35.370
<v P 05>was $830, you know, I'm tracking it every

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:36.090
<v P 05>couple days.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.930
<v P 05>So yeah, at least a couple times a week.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:41.930
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.090
<v P 05>Under 100 bucks is insignificant.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.330
<v P 05>And again, I know like with the 911 bill

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:49.770
<v P 05>like they count it down to the days of payments

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:51.930
<v P 05>so it's not really a dispute.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.770
<v P 05>Like it's not an insurance issue of. Yeah,

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.930
<v P 05>this, this care in the community provider

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.410
<v P 05>didn't bill right like that I would be hawking.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:02.290
<v P 05>But I know like they, they calculate the

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:04.970
<v P 05>benefits of the post 911 GI bill to the actual

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.770
<v P 05>day. So I take them as very accurate. So.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:16.850
<v Moderator - Emily>So if again if this is built in real life,

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:22.170
<v Moderator - Emily>what would be your. Oh yeah, head back to

00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:22.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Figma.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.690
<v P 05>Go ahead.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. So if this were built in life, how

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.770
<v Moderator - Emily>would you expect to make a payment or I guess

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:35.610
<v Moderator - Emily>what, what would you do in, in order to make

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:36.810
<v Moderator - Emily>a payment from this debt?

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.050
<v P 05>Well, I think it'd be cool if you have like

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.650
<v P 05>a little bar like why might I have this debt,

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.290
<v P 05>Resolve this debt or pay this debt and then

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.320
<v P 05>you can click and then if you have VA disability

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.520
<v P 05>of significance, you know, maybe they give

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.400
<v P 05>an option of they can pay it out over six

00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.120
<v P 05>months or you know, pay now with a credit

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:58.080
<v P 05>card. Those kind of things would make it

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.640
<v P 05>easier.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:03.280
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, how about if there were not those options

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.440
<v Moderator - Emily>that you just suggested, what, what do you

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.120
<v Moderator - Emily>think your next step would be in order to,

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Moderator - Emily>to pay it?

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.600
<v P 05>I mean the letter. I would assume, you know,

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.920
<v P 05>there'd be a little blurb on the letter about

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.920
<v P 05>how to resolve or where you can mail the

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.920
<v P 05>check and you know, be nice in the letter

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.640
<v P 05>they sent a self addressed stamped envelope

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.480
<v P 05>or you know like the business reply mail

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.520
<v P 05>thing. Yeah, that's all.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.680
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. All right, let me have you

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.200
<v Moderator - Emily>tap on the, the payments button at the bottom

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:34.840
<v Moderator - Emily>right again.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.880
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep, there we go. And then scroll down to

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.760
<v Moderator - Emily>the bottom and I'm gonna you tap into that

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.420
<v Moderator - Emily>blank again for. Yeah, perfect. All right.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.340
<v Moderator - Emily>And then go back to overpayment debts.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:55.660
<v Moderator - Emily>Perfect. Okay, so now we're going to get

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.420
<v Moderator - Emily>to the payments in just a moment. But first

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:03.580
<v Moderator - Emily>we're going to pretend that you don't believe

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.340
<v Moderator - Emily>you are going to have the, the, the finances

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.140
<v Moderator - Emily>to make a payment soon. We'll go with this

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.580
<v Moderator - Emily>top the. That same, that same debt.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.690
<v Moderator - Emily>Talk to me about what you would do in that

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.330
<v Moderator - Emily>situation if you're, if you're pretty sure

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.290
<v Moderator - Emily>you're not going to have the money soon to

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:21.330
<v Moderator - Emily>make a payment.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.690
<v P 05>Well, I would just look at the letter and

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.530
<v P 05>get the phone number.

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.130
<v P 05>But they should maybe have a little tab kind

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:31.490
<v P 05>of like resolve the debt like a resources

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:35.890
<v P 05>tab. You know, that would be kind of cool.

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:40.370
<v P 05>Where then it has a number or you know, I

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:40.810
<v P 05>don't know.

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:43.250

<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:07.940
<v P 05>Scoot this requests. Yeah.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then thoughts on, on, on those

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.900
<v Moderator - Emily>options that came up when you tapped the

<v Moderator - Emily>request help out go.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.020
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, which would go back.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.540
<v P 05>Yeah, I think it looks really good. I Mean,

<v P 05>it's simple. You have pay online other ways.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.940
<v P 05>What's the other ways?

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:27.260
<v P 05>Pay by phone, pay by mail. Okay. Request

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.580
<v P 05>help. Maybe there would be a fourth button

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.270
<v P 05>and then put dispute debt on the bottom because

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:35.110
<v P 05>not everyone would  realize request help

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.070
<v P 05>is dispute the debt.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.910
<v Moderator - Emily>Right, I got it.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:37.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.510
<v P 05>Yeah. Start your. Yeah, so just move that

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.270
<v P 05>out and then you have a fourth little blurb

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:45.830
<v P 05>above, close between request help and close

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.390
<v P 05>of dispute debt. Make that.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:52.190
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so let's, let's pretend that specifically

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.350
<v Moderator - Emily>you are, you are looking to, to get help

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:55.750
<v Moderator - Emily>because you're not, you're not sure you're

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.070
<v Moderator - Emily>going to have the money. Yeah. Walk me through

00:25:58.070 --> 00:26:00.310
<v Moderator - Emily>what exactly you would do after you. You

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:01.510
<v Moderator - Emily>tapped that. Request help.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.290
<v P 05>Request a payment plan.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:07.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:10.450
<v P 05>And that's call us. I mean that's all you

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.730
<v P 05>can do, right? Mail call request.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.770
<v P 05>Yeah. So just to have something with a payment

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:21.170
<v P 05>plan. Maybe have a link for financial counseling.

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Financial counseling, huh?

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:26.130
<v P 05>Yeah.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:29.410
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then, and then the second question,

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:32.370
<v Moderator - Emily>I know you, you touched upon it, but if you

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.070
<v Moderator - Emily>are quite that wanted that, let's say this

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.910
<v Moderator - Emily>particular debt, you don't know it is an

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:40.270
<v Moderator - Emily>error. What would you do in that case?

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:46.070
<v P 05>Request help. So I would just expect to have

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.070
<v P 05>like a phone number or somewhere you can.

00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:49.390
<v P 05>Mail correspondence.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.750
<v P 05>Yeah. I mean basically it's walking you through

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.190
<v P 05>how to dispute it. I mean.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:27:02.780
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Any other basic info?

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.020
<v Moderator - Emily>Obviously there's a lot of information here,

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:05.820
<v Moderator - Emily>but any other information you think you would

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.420
<v Moderator - Emily>want to have, particularly if you are looking

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.580
<v Moderator - Emily>to, let's say, dispute a debt or looking

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:11.300
<v Moderator - Emily>for other help?

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.380
<v P 05>No, this is very, you know, here's what you

00:27:15.459 --> 00:27:16.980
<v P 05>need. That's smart.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.820
<v P 05>Talks about the process time burden. So you

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.100
<v P 05>kind of know it's going to take an hour.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.420
<v P 05>Yeah, I like this a lot.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. And were you.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.620
<v Moderator - Emily>I. I think you were, but I want to confirm.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Have you always been aware of these options

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.100
<v Moderator - Emily>like to request help or extended payment

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.780
<v Moderator - Emily>or debt? Oh, you have not been.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.060
<v P 05>No, no.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.900
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Any other ways that you think that

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.780
<v Moderator - Emily>could be any, any, any more clear so that

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.100
<v Moderator - Emily>people know that those are options?

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.520
<v P 05>No, I can't think of anything.

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:03.760
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. And then walk me through how

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:04.400
<v Moderator - Emily>you would.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.320
<v Moderator - Emily>So this is a different version here, but

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.200
<v Moderator - Emily>yeah, walk me through steps you would take

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.840
<v Moderator - Emily>for paying and I promise I won't have you

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.280
<v Moderator - Emily>enter any actual information.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:19.760
<v P 05>Yeah, yeah, I would just have like again,

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.610
<v P 05>a paid resolve debt. So pay online.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:30.610
<v P 05>That takes me to the website. I mean it'd

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.210
<v P 05>be kind of cool if I didn't have to go to

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:34.170
<v P 05>pay dot. Like that was incorporated here.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:36.210
<v P 05>And I could just. There was like a little

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.690
<v P 05>kind of enter your credit card number kind

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:40.450
<v P 05>of thing or.

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.770
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so pay directly here. Got it.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:43.050
<v P 05>Yeah.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:46.290
<v Moderator - Emily>So knowing that there. There's not.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.350
<v Moderator - Emily>If. If you can continue that. That pay. Yeah,

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.110
<v Moderator - Emily>yeah, yeah, continue that. And we're just

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.390
<v Moderator - Emily>gonna look at the.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:57.350
<v Moderator - Emily>At this one again. I won't have you enter

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.110
<v Moderator - Emily>anything in.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.870
<v Moderator - Emily>So. Yeah, so this is what the information

00:29:03.069 --> 00:29:06.590
<v Moderator - Emily>comes to. Yeah, there we go. The next one.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.550
<v Moderator - Emily>So let me have you look at the.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.670
<v Moderator - Emily>The bottom section there, kind of below the.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Moderator - Emily>The blue bars. Yeah. As to what information

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:19.860
<v Moderator - Emily>and let me know your thoughts on where. Yeah,

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.060
<v Moderator - Emily>go ahead.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.020
<v P 05>I would just have something like. If you

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:24.740
<v P 05>can do like.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.940
<v P 05>Yeah. Maybe set a file number. Like, you

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.300
<v P 05>can put your social in. Or put file number,

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.370
<v P 05>slash Social Security number. So you can

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.730
<v P 05>pick payee number.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:46.170
<v P 05>That's confusing. Person entitled. I guess

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:50.010
<v P 05>that's your name. Deduction code. Okay, that's

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:50.450
<v P 05>easy.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.410
<v P 05>But here the problem is you got all these

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:56.970
<v P 05>dang codes too. Like, I use chapter 31, and

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.730
<v P 05>it's hard. I always mix it up with chapter

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.930
<v P 05>35, and then there's chapter 33, so maybe

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:04.730
<v P 05>there's less options. So it's kind of like

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:06.810
<v P 05>if you go into the VA app and you want to

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:10.300
<v P 05>message your doctor, they have so. So much

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.740
<v P 05>like you can.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:17.740
<v P 05>A chaplain, you know, you know, lgbt, you

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:22.180
<v P 05>know, caseworkers. You have all these doctors.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.820
<v P 05>Then you have somebody like in my region

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:26.580
<v P 05>that's like Fort. You know, the Marion, Indiana

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.100
<v P 05>va, The Fort Wayne. Like, it's kind of confusing.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:32.300
<v P 05>So, like here how you have like 30 or 40

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.060
<v P 05>things, like, it's almost too much like a

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.900
<v P 05>deduction code. Maybe just give me the codes

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.940
<v P 05>of things that are applicable. The debts

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:39.420
<v P 05>I have.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:40.780
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:42.060
<v P 05>Yeah.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.260
<v Moderator - Emily>And. And where. So knowing that this is confusing

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.460
<v Moderator - Emily>and thoughts on how you would actually find

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.780
<v Moderator - Emily>all the information that you do have to enter

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:53.620
<v Moderator - Emily>if you were actually making a payment in

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.380
<v Moderator - Emily>real life here.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:58.580
<v P 05>I just. I mean, yeah. Deduction. There's

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.540
<v P 05>too many deduction codes.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:30:59.670
<v Moderator - Emily>It's.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.660
<v P 05>Keep it simple. And then person entitled.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.060
<v P 05>I would get rid of that because you're only.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.020
<v Moderator - Emily>So this. This page is actually not.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.100
<v Moderator - Emily>We're not changing this. So knowing that

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.860
<v Moderator - Emily>this won't change thoughts on where you would

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:16.780
<v Moderator - Emily>actually find the information that is required.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.780
<v P 05>Well, it just be. Hopefully back at the letter

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:23.660
<v P 05>that you can download and it'll have the

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.180
<v P 05>file, you know, all that information.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.360
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so if you.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Moderator - Emily>If you had gotten to this page, what. What

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.920
<v Moderator - Emily>would you be doing if you were actually trying

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.840
<v Moderator - Emily>to make a payment?

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.240
<v P 05>Putting in the payment amount My name, daytime

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:45.720
<v P 05>phone. I have to find a deduction code, obviously.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.760
<v Moderator - Emily>And then where. Yeah, where. Where would

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.960
<v Moderator - Emily>you be going to to find that information

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.800
<v Moderator - Emily>that, that. That you have to enter?

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.160
<v P 05>I guess the letter is where I would try to

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.680
<v P 05>find it.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.640
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. So you would, you would open

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.320
<v Moderator - Emily>up that letter.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.280
<v P 05>Yep.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:06.400
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then let me have you switch back

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.880
<v Moderator - Emily>to the Figma app.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.640
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep. And then tap on. Go back. So, thoughts

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.400
<v Moderator - Emily>on. Oh, sorry.

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Moderator - Emily>Go. So tap on overpayment debts again and

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.720
<v Moderator - Emily>then go to. Yeah, do the, the resolve debt

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.960
<v Moderator - Emily>again. We're just going to go back to the

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.680
<v Moderator - Emily>other page we were just at.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.280
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, sorry. So tap on overpayments right here.

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:35.760
<v Moderator - Emily>And then tap on. Yeah, there we go. And then

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:36.840
<v Moderator - Emily>tap on pay online.

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:38.440
<v Moderator - Emily>We're just going to go back to where we were.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.840
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. So thoughts on the information here?

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Knowing that you were needing to enter stuff

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.200
<v Moderator - Emily>on the pay site?

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.780
<v P 05>No, I guess I could jot this stuff down.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.660
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.820
<v P 05>But it'd be kind of cool if you can do like

00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:00.020
<v P 05>a copy and paste. But I get it, you know.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:01.580
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so you’d want to copy and paste from

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:01.780
<v Moderator - Emily>here.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:07.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And thoughts on the clarity of providing

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:11.260
<v Moderator - Emily>this information now. Now that we see that

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:14.020
<v Moderator - Emily>it, it does have to be entered into the other

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.170
<v Moderator - Emily>application or, sorry, the other site.

00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:21.330
<v P 05>It's very clear. Again, I understand it now.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, are there. Since you said you, you

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:26.490
<v Moderator - Emily>understand it now, are there other ways that

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.210
<v Moderator - Emily>could make it more clear?

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.530
<v P 05>Not really. Without getting into like click

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:34.450
<v P 05>on this video and then it just takes longer.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.250
<v P 05>So I'm one of those.

00:33:36.250 --> 00:33:40.580
<v P 05>Less is more. But this is, you know, pretty

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:43.820
<v P 05>simple now that I digested it.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. How about thoughts on having

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.700
<v Moderator - Emily>to switch applications, like in this case

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.380
<v Moderator - Emily>from Figma to a browser to get the information?

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.700
<v P 05>Yeah, it would be easier just to stay in

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.740
<v P 05>the app, but if you can't do it, you can't

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:00.060
<v P 05>do it.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.540
<v P 05>Right. But yeah, I think anything. The va,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.820
<v P 05>again, the VA app is perfect. The website

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:06.960
<v P 05>is as. It's as convoluted.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.960
<v P 05>It's not as easy to digest. Like, like you

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.000
<v P 05>can go to a lot of websites. Like, I'm not

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.680
<v P 05>saying like ESPN is an example. Like their

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.720
<v P 05>desktop site is the same as their app site.

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.920
<v P 05>It's like all it is is a shortcut.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.320
<v P 05>But the va, I use the. It's almost like the

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.440
<v P 05>Cliff Notes is the app. And that's all I

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.440
<v P 05>want is the Cliff Notes. It's. The website's

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.360
<v P 05>usually too convoluted compared to the app.

00:34:32.309 --> 00:34:33.189
<v P 05>That's how I do it.

00:34:33.509 --> 00:34:37.629
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, got it. Okay. And then, so if this

00:34:37.629 --> 00:34:40.029
<v Moderator - Emily>experience that we've just gone through was

00:34:40.029 --> 00:34:43.989
<v Moderator - Emily>built in real life, how likely would it.

00:34:43.989 --> 00:34:44.389
<v Moderator - Emily>Would.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:45.869
<v Moderator - Emily>Would you use it?

00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:49.029
<v P 05>Do you believe the app? I. All day long.

00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:52.109
<v Moderator - Emily>Well, well, specifically for, like, this.

00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:56.389
<v Moderator - Emily>This debt in. In regards to. There is the.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:57.589
<v Moderator - Emily>The link to pay.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.280
<v P 05>I would definitely use it because this is

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:05.000
<v P 05>easier than, you know, mailing it in. Like,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.360
<v P 05>here's the address. Mail it in. Yeah.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:08.840
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.759
<v Moderator - Emily>Sorry I missed that.

00:35:13.759 --> 00:35:15.800
<v P 05>Yeah. Like, here, like, we. My wife and I,

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.480
<v P 05>we rarely write checks, so I would have to

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.000
<v P 05>find the checkbook. You know, you got to

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:20.680
<v P 05>pay for checks.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.800
<v P 05>Like, it's just easier. Keep it simple.

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:25.690
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then how about comparing

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:30.170
<v Moderator - Emily>this experience here? When I say that, I

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:33.290
<v Moderator - Emily>mean specifically, like paying on a different

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:36.970
<v Moderator - Emily>website, coming back to the app versus the

00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.850
<v Moderator - Emily>other version with the app where there was

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:40.890
<v Moderator - Emily>no link to pay.

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:44.170
<v Moderator - Emily>Thoughts on which is. Which you would prefer?

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:48.370
<v P 05>Oh, definitely with the link. I want to take

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.490
<v P 05>it from A to Z, like, I know about my debt,

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:53.190
<v P 05>understand why it's there. How do we resolve

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.470
<v P 05>it?

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.990
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. And then after you have made

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:00.750
<v Moderator - Emily>a payment, what do you expect to see? And

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.670
<v Moderator - Emily>how quickly do you expect to see whatever's

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:05.150
<v Moderator - Emily>going next?

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.270
<v P 05>Just, you know, maybe there's a note.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.270
<v P 05>Like it takes 24 hours to reflect or 72 hours,

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:12.590
<v P 05>that's fine. If it takes up to a week, I

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.670
<v P 05>wouldn't want it to be longer, but. And then

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.860
<v P 05>again to get a notification or not. Yeah,

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:21.900
<v P 05>a notification that says, hey, the debt is

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.460
<v P 05>resolved.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.660
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:26.660
<v P 05>But have some kind of receipts emailed to

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.340
<v P 05>you and then mailed to you as well that they

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:28.620
<v P 05>received.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. So some sort of notification

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.860
<v Moderator - Emily>of how long it'll be until you get that,

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Moderator - Emily>and then also the emails and notifications.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.340
<v P 05>Yes, ma'.

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:38.540
<v Moderator - Emily>Am.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:43.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. All right. Any other thoughts

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:47.140
<v Moderator - Emily>on how any of these sections have been labeled?

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:51.000
<v Moderator - Emily>If you want to go back to the payments page,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.120
<v Moderator - Emily>looking around, anything else that could

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:53.800
<v Moderator - Emily>be more clear?

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:58.280
<v P 05>No, I like the little hazard triangle.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.080
<v P 05>Green chat, but this is pretty good.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.400
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And I'm gonna have you look

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.960
<v Moderator - Emily>at the CO pays. Now, I. I know you said you

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.560
<v Moderator - Emily>haven't had any CO pays, so we're just going

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.440
<v Moderator - Emily>to pretend, but. Yeah.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:17.920
<v Moderator - Emily>So looking at this copay page, how clear

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:19.880
<v Moderator - Emily>is it how much you owe.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:22.850
<v P 05>Overall from looking at this very easy current

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.930
<v P 05>balance? You know, kind of gives me the triangle.

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:29.410
<v P 05>So I got something coming up. This next one,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:29.970
<v P 05>200.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.450
<v P 05>Sounds like it's kind of complicated, which

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:35.810
<v P 05>is why Contact. And then it shows one that's

00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:38.210
<v P 05>kind of paid off. And it'll be nice that,

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.170
<v P 05>you know, this, this South Hillsboro one

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.090
<v P 05>gets removed. We have current balance of

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:46.700
<v P 05>zero. Like, I don't know, but maybe, maybe

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:48.220
<v P 05>they keep it there for a couple of weeks

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.740
<v P 05>to make it so people know.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:50.860
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.340
<v P 05>Phone calls of, hey, do I owe anything on

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.180
<v P 05>this? So maybe it pays for 30 days and then

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:57.980
<v P 05>gets removed.

00:37:58.300 --> 00:37:58.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, God.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.820
<v Moderator - Emily>And would there be a place. Okay, so you'd

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.500
<v Moderator - Emily>want to leave it on there for maybe 30 days

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.380
<v Moderator - Emily>or so. There be any place that you would

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.580
<v Moderator - Emily>want to see any co pays that have already

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.300
<v Moderator - Emily>been paid off?

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.540
<v P 05>No, I don't. Because then you're just adding

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.580
<v P 05>more to it. It takes up more speed and time.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.140
<v P 05>So. No.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:21.140
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Okay. And then thoughts on

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:24.900
<v Moderator - Emily>how if in case it is different, like how

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.740
<v Moderator - Emily>quickly you would want to see something here

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.540
<v Moderator - Emily>when you do have a new pay. Let's say you

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.780
<v Moderator - Emily>just had an appointment and you then go to

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:33.660
<v Moderator - Emily>the app, how quickly would you expect to

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.780
<v Moderator - Emily>see information here about what you owe for

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:36.500
<v Moderator - Emily>that copay?

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:38.910
<v P 05>Like 72 hours would be nice.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:44.070
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. All right. And then we'll just

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:45.950
<v Moderator - Emily>look at this top one, the James A. Haley

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:49.110
<v Moderator - Emily>Veterans Hospital. What information would

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.989
<v Moderator - Emily>be helpful for you? Yeah, what would you

00:38:52.989 --> 00:38:53.630
<v Moderator - Emily>be looking for?

00:38:54.750 --> 00:39:00.150
<v P 05>Current statement provider, medic? No, this

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:04.800
<v P 05>is pretty. Pretty good. So it's just like

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.200
<v P 05>a checking ledger. Yeah.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.000
<v P 05>Chronological. Yeah.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:14.280
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then. And then tell me

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.640
<v Moderator - Emily>again with that top one, how clear is it

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.400
<v Moderator - Emily>about when.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.000
<v Moderator - Emily>When the payment is due for it?

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.360
<v P 05>Very clear. Payment or request help by July

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.680
<v P 05>30th. Very simple.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.600
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.720
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And then if you are again a similar

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:37.640
<v Moderator - Emily>scenario that we are making up with the other

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.360
<v Moderator - Emily>one of you don't believe you're going to

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.680
<v Moderator - Emily>have the money to. To pay this. Where would

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.480
<v Moderator - Emily>you expect to find or what. What.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.840
<v Moderator - Emily>What would be your. Your next step?

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.120
<v P 05>If you kind of to click the pay bill and

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.520
<v P 05>to have something kind of request help or

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.000
<v P 05>payment assistance or something underpay

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.480
<v P 05>in person.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Yeah. Any. Any other place

00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.220
<v Moderator - Emily>you might look for. For.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Moderator - Emily>For. For guidance on what to do next?

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:06.980
<v P 05>No.

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:16.100
<v Moderator - Emily>And. And let me have you. So since we looked

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:19.340
<v Moderator - Emily>at. At payment with the other one, let me

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Moderator - Emily>have you walk me through how you would pay

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:22.980
<v Moderator - Emily>the same bill here.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.060
<v P 05>Click pay bill.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:29.380
<v P 05>Pay by phone, silly. Pay by mail. Pay in

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.300
<v P 05>person. Be nice to have a pay online. You

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.140
<v P 05>know, click pay online and then have a place

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.140
<v P 05>where I put my social in my name.

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.860
<v P 05>Select credit card and then put like, like

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:46.900
<v P 05>normal pay with credit card online stuff.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:49.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. With. With the options that were there.

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:49.820
<v Moderator - Emily>What.

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.540
<v Moderator - Emily>What do you think you would. You would do.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:58.670
<v P 05>Definitely not paying person. I would try

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.190
<v P 05>to do the pay by phone. Knowing I can call

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.710
<v P 05>and give them a credit card number would

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:06.710
<v P 05>be kind of easier. Pay by mail. Okay.

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:08.670
<v P 05>Then I got to get into a stamp situation

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.910
<v P 05>or. Or payonpay.gov. that's what I would

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:12.190
<v P 05>do.

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:13.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Got it.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:14.190
<v P 05>Yeah.

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:17.230
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. So you can. You can go and. Okay.

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:19.070
<v Moderator - Emily>What do you think would make it more. More

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:19.790
<v Moderator - Emily>clear since. Since.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.640
<v P 05>Since you said that you say pay online.

<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

<v P 05>Or pay by credit card. How cool would that

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.160
<v P 05>be?

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.800
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And actually, I forgot. Let me have

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.480

<v Moderator - Emily>Attempt to pay it and just see what.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.160
<v P 05>Hey.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Bill experiences.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:50.970

<v Moderator - Emily>we go.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:11.410
<v P 05>Put all my information like this is confusing.

00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:12.730
<v P 05>Part. 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:13.850
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.520
<v P 05>Payor's full name, email address, payment

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:16.960
<v P 05>amount.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.800
<v P 05>It’d just be nice to have it all right here

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:23.360
<v P 05>where you can just... Veterans name... I

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.160
<v P 05>don't... Something... I don't need five parts.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:30.400
<v P 05>Just give me one. Or get rid of that.

00:42:32.239 --> 00:42:34.680
<v Moderator - Emily>Where would you expect to find, as you said,

00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.600
<v Moderator - Emily>the five parts of of that account number

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.080
<v Moderator - Emily>up there?

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.400
<v P 05>Well, on the letter. Yeah.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:41.600
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:43.690
<v P 05>But yeah, to go back to it, they have something

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.690
<v P 05>where I can just put. It's kind of like if

00:42:45.690 --> 00:42:47.770
<v P 05>I'm buying something online, I can literally

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.290
<v P 05>to have it all on one page is great. So if

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.490
<v P 05>I have a thing on the bottom. Credit card

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:57.210
<v P 05>information or debit. Credit debit card information.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.210
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. What would make it as though you said

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Moderator - Emily>you would. You would look to the letter for

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:07.610
<v Moderator - Emily>that information? How about anything within

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:09.690
<v Moderator - Emily>the app, that might make it easier?

00:43:11.290 --> 00:43:13.010
<v P 05>No, if I can get off the letter, that'd be

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.370
<v P 05>fine.

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:15.730
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Let me have you switch back

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:17.610
<v Moderator - Emily>to Figma. We'll pretend you're.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.170
<v Moderator - Emily>We're going back to the VA app.

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.690
<v P 05>Okay.

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:33.770
<v P 05>All right. I'm in Sigma.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.220
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, this is Zoom. Yeah, there we go. Okay,

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.860
<v Moderator - Emily>let me say that.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Wait for that to see where this ends up.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Tap on payments. We're just going to

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.220
<v Moderator - Emily>get you back to where we were. So tap on

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.780
<v Moderator - Emily>payments on the lower right.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:01.380
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then scroll to the bottom and tap

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.700
<v Moderator - Emily>in the blank gray area. Great. And then tap

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:06.700
<v Moderator - Emily>on co pays.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.980
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And go back into review details

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.020
<v Moderator - Emily>of that top copay.

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:25.500
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So yeah. Thoughts on pretending that

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:30.380
<v Moderator - Emily>we've switched back and forth from the browser

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:33.780
<v Moderator - Emily>of the payment and then coming here. What

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.660
<v Moderator - Emily>information would you be looking for here?

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:36.920
<v Moderator - Emily>Might you be looking for.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.360
<v P 05>It's got everything I need. The ledger, pay

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:43.160
<v P 05>bill option, current statement.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.680
<v P 05>Be cool if there's a go to current statement,

00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.440
<v P 05>but there's a tab for Click here for previous

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.400
<v P 05>statements. So above statement charges, but

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:59.560
<v P 05>below the PDF go to current statement, something

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.210
<v P 05>previous statement. So if you are confused

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.890
<v P 05>and that would be helpful, but.

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.690
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, okay. So you'd want, you'd want to see

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:08.850
<v Moderator - Emily>previous statements up here.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:10.450
<v P 05>Yeah, that'd be nice.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And how about specifically

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.730
<v Moderator - Emily>for paying, since we are looking@pay.gov

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:16.050
<v Moderator - Emily>earlier.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.290
<v P 05>You know, above PDF statements but below

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:28.010
<v P 05>the June 1 ledger. Pay bill online. Be nice.

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:31.970
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Different from where you'd found it

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:32.250
<v Moderator - Emily>before.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:34.330
<v P 05>Correct.

00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:38.730
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Do you know why you would, you would

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.090
<v Moderator - Emily>prefer to have it next to PDF statements

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:43.130
<v Moderator - Emily>as, as opposed to up top?

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.570
<v P 05>Oh, it's right here. Pay bill. I, for some

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.170
<v P 05>reason I forgot that. No, I, I, I believe

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.890
<v P 05>my last. Let's take that out.

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:54.890
<v P 05>Pay bill is perfect.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:57.870
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Pay bill. Got it. And how about to

00:45:58.510 --> 00:46:01.110
<v Moderator - Emily>the information that you were having to fill

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:05.540
<v Moderator - Emily>in on the pay.gov?

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.190
<v P 05>Yeah. Just outside of having like the 5 account

00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.030
<v P 05>number thing or ledger, everything else is

00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:13.830
<v P 05>perfect. Just a simple page where I can put

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:17.350
<v P 05>my name, my address, maybe my social and

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:18.590
<v P 05>then the amount I want to pay.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:24.270
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. T houghts on the copying this account

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:24.910
<v Moderator - Emily>number here?

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:29.480
<v P 05>Copy. That'd be perfect. What I would do

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:31.720
<v P 05>is just jot it down on a sticky pad, but.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:35.320
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Would you use the, the, the copy action

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.680
<v Moderator - Emily>that's here toward the top?

00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.200
<v P 05>I didn't know there was. Oh, I see it. Oh,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:41.080
<v P 05>absolutely. I would.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:41.880
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:44.040
<v Moderator - Emily>Thoughts on how to make that more clear?

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:48.600
<v P 05>Maybe instead of blue, make it green.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:49.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.210
<v P 05>Or put copy and paste or something. Because

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:56.490
<v P 05>most people, I don't know, you might mix

00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:59.170
<v P 05>copay with copy and your eyes just play that

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:02.690
<v P 05>trick on you. Oh, it's missing copay. Okay.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:04.690
<v Moderator - Emily>So copy could be misread as copay.

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:06.690
<v Moderator - Emily>I hadn't thought about that. Right. Okay.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.930
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And go ahead and just tap that.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:11.610
<v Moderator - Emily>I just want to forget. There we go. Okay.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.250
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. So copy there.

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:17.210
<v Moderator - Emily>If that, if, had you seen that would, do

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:19.210
<v Moderator - Emily>you think that would be helpful in order

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:19.570
<v Moderator - Emily>to.

00:47:19.650 --> 00:47:20.940
<v P 05>Very. Yeah.

00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:22.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Okay, great.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.700
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And since you had mentioned the

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.140
<v Moderator - Emily>statements, how are you, are you currently

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Moderator - Emily>using any, any statements for really any

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.540
<v Moderator - Emily>other, any, anything else in your life?

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:39.740
<v P 05>No.

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:41.100
<v Moderator - Emily>You're not. Okay, got it.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.060
<v Moderator - Emily>And let me have you tap on the, the, the

00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.700
<v Moderator - Emily>current statement here. Since you mentioned

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:46.940
<v Moderator - Emily>that.

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:52.130
<v P 05>Perfect.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:53.490
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:05.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Thoughts on using this. This statement within

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:05.490
<v Moderator - Emily>the app?

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:08.250
<v P 05>I would use it because I wouldn't want to

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:09.610
<v P 05>check out especially when you start getting

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.690
<v P 05>into hundreds of dollars like. Yeah, definitely

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:14.970
<v P 05>need the easy access the statements.

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:16.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.890
<v Moderator - Emily>And thoughts on. Would there be anything

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.650
<v Moderator - Emily>else you would. You would do with them outside

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:23.610
<v Moderator - Emily>of. Of looking just to. To.

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:25.290
<v Moderator - Emily>To. To double check all the charges?

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.530
<v P 05>No, I would just. I would want to just cross

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:30.010
<v P 05>reference.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:33.130
<v Moderator - Emily>Usually looking at there. Okay. And then

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.370
<v Moderator - Emily>for older ones since you mentioned that.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:38.610
<v Moderator - Emily>What instances would you be looking for older

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:39.210
<v Moderator - Emily>statements?

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:42.180
<v P 05>Well, just to double check my math or to

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.260
<v P 05>you know figure out why that was created.

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.660
<v P 05>So if you have loaded previous statements,

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.940
<v P 05>parentheses PDF would be nice underneath.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:52.900
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. I see. I see. Okay.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:57.380
<v Moderator - Emily>And I believe those are all my questions.

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:00.060
<v Moderator - Emily>Natasha, if you have anything. I'm just speaking

00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:01.940
<v Moderator - Emily>to my other colleague here. If you have anything

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.180
<v Moderator - Emily>you wanted to ask, feel free to unmute and

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:05.940
<v Moderator - Emily>ask here.

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.800
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Anything else you would like to share

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.480
<v Moderator - Emily>regarding managing finances with VA or specifically

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:20.160
<v Moderator - Emily>with the app?

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.240
<v P 05>No, I mean just some more stuff you can put

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:25.120
<v P 05>in the app without leaving the site is easy

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.560
<v P 05>because a lot of times you leave the site

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:29.760
<v P 05>you got to re log in credentials and like

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.170
<v P 05>just to have a face ID is unbelievable. You

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:35.290
<v P 05>know when I go to my bank account like my

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.770
<v P 05>Chase app, like it. My members, my face ID

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:39.970
<v P 05>I don't ever have to use a password like.

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:41.410
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh yeah. Okay.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:44.210
<v P 05>Like simplicity. So that's it for me.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:46.650
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:49.930
<v Moderator - Emily>Great. All right. Well those are. Those are

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.130
<v Moderator - Emily>all my questions. So happy that you were

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:53.650
<v Moderator - Emily>able to.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.290
<v Moderator - Emily>To share things with us. Always, always helpful

00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:59.090
<v Moderator - Emily>to speak directly with veterans of it helping

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:02.410

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:07.390
<v Moderator - Emily>have some soon and yeah, I hope you have

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:09.390
<v Moderator - Emily>a wonderful rest of your day.

00:50:10.750 --> 00:50:12.190
<v P 05>I hope you have a great weekend.

00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:15.710
<v P 05>Is it. Do you send a. Is it like a.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.270
<v P 05>Like a gift card link or is.

00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:22.830
<v Moderator - Emily>It via checking is going to be reaching out

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:24.950
<v Moderator - Emily>directly to you? I actually don't know the

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:28.270
<v Moderator - Emily>details but they will be be in touch soon

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:28.830
<v Moderator - Emily>about that.

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:31.600
<v P 05>No, I was just curious but no anything. Yeah,

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.840
<v P 05>just as simple as possible is what people

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.640
<v P 05>want and at least me.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:38.800
<v P 05>And then anything that keeps you from having

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.440
<v P 05>to log into a government website. But using

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:44.840
<v P 05>a government app with a face ID is a million

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:45.880
<v P 05>bucks in my opinion.

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.560
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. All right, well thank you so much.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.680
<v Moderator - Emily>Hope you have a great weekend.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.680
<v P 05>You as well. Thank you ladies.
