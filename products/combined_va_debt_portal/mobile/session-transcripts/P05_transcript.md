Emily

3  
0:00:09  
P5  
Yes.

4  
0:00:10  
Emily  
Okay, great. And would you? Okay, if I potentially show some clips of this conversation to our Va partners?

5  
0:00:17  
P5  
Yes.

6  
0:00:18  
Emily  
Okay, great. Thank you so much, so great. So let's I'd love to hear just a little bit about yourself specifically as a veteran what branch of the military do you serve when you retired or separated.

7  
0:00:34  
P5  
[redacted] separated 2013.

8  
0:00:38  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

9  
0:00:40  
Emily  
And what sort of experience have you had with veteran affairs since then?

10  
0:00:46  
P5  
I'm disabled veteran. I use the healthcare, use educational benefits.

11  
0:00:51  
P5  
travel claims, those those kind of things.

12  
0:00:54  
Emily  
Okay, good and have you? Or how much experience have you had using the Va website? And or the Va app.

13  
0:01:03  
P5  
Both. I think I'm pretty close to expert.

14  
0:01:07  
Emily  
Okay.

15  
0:01:08  
P5  
Look at the logins, you know.

16  
0:01:10  
P5  
messaging the clinics. And yeah, I feel very well acclimated for somebody who doesn't work for the Va.

17  
0:01:18  
Emily  
Oh, got it? And in what? In what cases do you choose to use the app over the website?

18  
0:01:27  
P5  
As much as I can and and a lot of it's just because it's just. It's the apps great for anything. You look up what you got paid if

19  
0:01:38  
P5  
basically anything. With the exception of like educational, it's just easier to use the website

20  
0:01:45  
P5  
for some reason like. It's that web like post 9 11 gi. Benefits, for instance, are well queued. But anything healthcare related.

21  
0:01:53  
P5  
or to check the claim or benefits disability like letter, like, it's everything you need or to generate letters that you might need.

22  
0:02:06  
P5  
you know. So it's yeah, made basically anything minus like educational.

23  
0:02:11  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So you're using it for most things sounds like.

24  
0:02:14  
Emily  
okay, and now we're just going to move into the the financial portion of the discussion. So I want to make sure you're only sharing what you're willing. I have no additional information about your finance. Oh, sorry! Go ahead.

25  
0:02:26  
P5  
I'm an open book. That's fine.

26  
0:02:28  
Emily  
Oh, got it. Okay? Sorry. All right. So first, st we're going to be discussing debt. So have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for any sort of like benefit, overpayment, debt.

27  
0:02:41  
P5  
Ye? Yes, yes, I have.

28  
0:02:43  
Emily  
Okay, and it, whatever level you're comfortable. Could you tell me just a little bit about that experience?

29  
0:02:50  
P5  
I have. Most recently I I have a book stipend post 9 11 Gi. Bill overpayment from the spring or late winter, for like $[redacted].

30  
0:03:02  
P5  
I have. I actually have not received the letter for it. I just view it as kind of small potatoes, and they're very. I just figure it. It was in an over site on the Va. And I got overpaid and and.

31  
0:03:19  
P5  
They track that stuff very well. So I figured it is a legit debt. I just don't know how they're gonna I think it. I I glanced at it on. That's how I learned. So I was looking up my post 9, 11 gi benefits. And then somehow, I scroll over, and there was this thing like, you have one debt, and I'm like, What is that?

32  
0:03:37  
P5  
So I I've never received a letter. And when I received the letter. It's going to be very confusing, and I just take it as they're very fair, firm, and consistent, so I I believe it's right. And then I had a

33  
0:03:51  
P5  
overpayment of like [redacted] bucks

34  
0:03:55  
P5  
a couple of years ago is before Covid had been 2,017 or 2018, and then I disputed it, and I just don't remember the details of so long ago and

35  
0:04:06  
P5  
end up squashing it. I never. It got squared away or something. And yeah

36  
0:04:14  
P5  
was from either [redacted]. I want to say it was from [redacted].

37  
0:04:23  
P5  
yeah, I just. I just don't remember. It was so long ago. And

38  
0:04:27  
P5  
I yeah, I just. It's out of sight, out of mind.

39  
0:04:30  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And for that one were you sent a letter for that one? Do you recall you were okay, got it.

40  
0:04:36  
P5  
Yeah, it's cause I I used to get the letter and

41  
0:04:39  
P5  
I would call, and somehow it it had to do with the school. I was going to [redacted] at the time, and they weren't doing something right. And when they did ended up washing it clean. So

42  
0:04:51  
P5  
okay. So it was taken care of. Got it.

43  
0:04:54  
Emily  
And then for the current one, where you said you owe the the $83, but haven't received any letter. When you were you able to find any information when you did happened upon it? Like, when it might be due, or like any other information.

44  
0:05:08  
P5  
Yeah, there wasn't much information. It was something book and supply stipend, and would notice I would get that $[redacted], and you know what it was. Probably I think it was from May and

45  
0:05:19  
P5  
the school when I graduated the last day was like April something, and I think they Re. They did it for May and error. So I just don't have much issue with the debt. I don't. I'm not gonna dispute it. I don't think, but I don't. Yeah.

46  
0:05:38  
P5  
Know the details out? Yeah.

47  
0:05:41  
Emily  
All right. And then how about for have you had any experience with medical co-pays through? Va.

48  
0:05:48  
P5  
No, no, nothing, no worries, issues anything, healthcare.

49  
0:05:53  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

50  
0:05:56  
Emily  
And any in regards to the the overpayment debt that you that you stumbled upon. I know, I said, you haven't received a letter. It may be confusing when you do any thoughts on what could be made easier in terms of the communication from Va.

51  
0:06:14  
P5  
No, I in here I don't know, too. It could have got lost in the mail. The Va. Is really good about sending letters. I don't have mail issues where I'm at. I again. This was a couple of weeks ago. I learned about it. Now. I'm curious to log in and just kind of peak my curiosity about it, even though I'm not that worried about it. Just be again, because they're very diligent like these things.

52  
0:06:36  
P5  
It just it. It probably is an overpayment of $[redacted].

53  
0:06:43  
P5  
yeah, I just, I just really haven't put much food to thought on it.

54  
0:06:46  
Emily  
Okay, great, all right. So now I'm going to have you share your screen. And then we're going to go through downloading figma and get things going there. Let me know if you need help to share your screen.

55  
0:07:22  
Emily  
Alright! It is starting.

56  
0:07:25  
P5  
No.

57  
0:07:26  
Emily  
I think you just have to tap anywhere outside of that stuff. Perfect. Okay, so now let me see if you, if you're able to download the figma app. We'll just do it right here. If you're able to get to your app store.

58  
0:07:42  
Emily  
Let me know if you need help. With that

59  
0:07:50  
Emily  
I just.

60  
0:07:51  
P5  
Spell that again. FIGM. A.

61  
0:07:52  
Emily  
FIGM. A. Yeah. So the top one where it just says Figma.

62  
0:07:56  
Emily  
and yep, the one halfway down that will be.

63  
0:08:00  
P5  
That's.

64  
0:08:01  
Emily  
Yep, that one.

65  
0:08:06  
P5  
Nope.

66  
0:08:07  
Emily  
We're not paying for anything, I promise

67  
0:08:16  
Emily  
you may have to open up the app store again. Yeah, just make sure it's where did it go?

68  
0:08:23  
Emily  
Okay? Oh, there we are. Must have gotten paused for some reason.

69  
0:08:27  
P5  
And.

70  
0:08:28  
Emily  
Oh, done alright and wait for that to show up.

71  
0:08:34  
Emily  
Okay? Installing almost there. All right.

72  
0:08:39  
Emily  
Alright. So we go to login to figma.

73  
0:08:44  
Emily  
Yeah, continue there.

74  
0:08:46  
Emily  
Okay, so for email, it's gonna be [redacted]

75  
0:08:56  
Emily  
Oh, one more 0. It's 3 zeros.

76  
0:09:00  
Emily  
Yep.

77  
0:09:06  
Emily  
okay. And the password is [redacted]

78  
0:09:13  
Emily  
They need 8 characters. And I try to make it easy.

79  
0:09:17  
Emily  
Okay? And then I just need to send you a confirmation. Give me just a moment opening up the email over here. Okay, I can see it. And all right, the authentication code is 4, 2, 5,

80  
0:09:30  
Emily  
7, 3, 9, 4.

81  
0:09:35  
P5  
Okay.

82  
0:09:37  
Emily  
Get that going and continue with mobile app.

83  
0:09:41  
Emily  
Give it just a moment.

84  
0:09:45  
P5  
Okay.

85  
0:09:47  
Emily  
Try. Okay. Alright. Now. Give it just a moment. I don't click on that just yet. I am just getting you. There. We go

86  
0:09:57  
Emily  
within the zoom app. I'm gonna send you a link.

87  
0:10:03  
Emily  
So yeah, go back to Zoom. And that should be, think you may have to

88  
0:10:08  
Emily  
tap somewhere in the top to get back to. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, there we go, alright. If you tap, and then there we go chat at the bottom.

89  
0:10:23  
Emily  
Yeah, the the the chat notification. On the bottom left.

90  
0:10:28  
Emily  
Yep, there you go alright. So tap that extra long link.

91  
0:10:32  
Emily  
All right, we're doing well. So technology wants to cooperate.

92  
0:10:42  
Emily  
All right. It worked. I love technology works. Okay, so now, here is our pretend mobile app. So right now don't click on anything quite yet. But as as of course you've you've said you've you use the app on a regular basis, so this should look mostly familiar without without having anything. Where would you expect to find any any indication of money that you owe to Va.

93  
0:11:13  
P5  
Messages, I would say.

94  
0:11:18  
Emily  
Okay? Any other thoughts. So is that right? So you'd mostly go into messages. Other thoughts of other places. You might go.

95  
0:11:30  
P5  
Benefits the lower, which is where we are?

96  
0:11:33  
P5  
No, that would be it. Yeah.

97  
0:11:38  
Emily  
Okay, got it? So it's actually where we are thinking about putting. This is actually under the payments. On the the lower, right? So any thoughts is that that wasn't 1 that you mentioned.

98  
0:11:50  
P5  
Oh!

99  
0:11:50  
Emily  
Any thoughts on how that might be more clear if there might be a different title that would be more appropriate. You think.

100  
0:12:00  
P5  
Good question. See, I'm so mindful of payments. Is this your P, your your payment history? And if you have to change direct deposit which now everything streamlined to one. You only do one direct deposit and

101  
0:12:14  
P5  
you know, I like this overpayment debt thing, and then copays.

102  
0:12:22  
P5  
yeah, I don't think you so. You got home health benefits, payments. I wouldn't want to add another toggle on the bottom.

103  
0:12:30  
P5  
Very well thought out, in my opinion.

104  
0:12:32  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Any other thoughts regarding this particular page? I know you said you. You like the the clarity of breaking up the overpayment and debt.

105  
0:12:42  
Emily  
How about sorry. Go ahead.

106  
0:12:45  
P5  
No, I don't. I think this looks really good.

107  
0:12:48  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And

108  
0:12:51  
Emily  
how about the the information that is below the word overpayment debts? Any thoughts on from just from a high level. Other types of information you might want to see. There.

109  
0:13:04  
P5  
No, because it has due for 4 deaths.

110  
0:13:08  
P5  
I don't know what you would, could put without taking up more space and making it more. You know something convoluted.

111  
0:13:15  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

112  
0:13:18  
Emily  
And then actually, let me have you go back? Just to that payments, page just for a moment and one more question on that. If. Yeah, yeah. There, yeah.

113  
0:13:27  
Emily  
thoughts on. Since I know you said that payments you always think of

114  
0:13:32  
Emily  
that are that are sent to you any thoughts on the organization of this. Now that this will be including both money comes to you, and money going out.

115  
0:13:44  
P5  
No, because I can see the whole page payments you that, and bills like this is very well thought out, in my opinion.

116  
0:13:51  
Emily  
Okay.

117  
0:13:53  
Emily  
Alright, great.

118  
0:13:53  
P5  
Sharing user.

119  
0:13:55  
Emily  
Okay, good to know. All right. So yeah. So now, if you want to tap into the overpayment debts where I know you were you were going a moment ago? And actually, I'm sorry. Go back. Go back to payments.

120  
0:14:10  
Emily  
Yeah, there we go. Scroll to the bottom. Just gonna send you to kind of a little hidden link. If you can tap in the the empty gray section below Copays tap that once I'm gonna get. Yeah, okay, perfect.

121  
0:14:24  
Emily  
All right. Yes. Now we're good, all right. And oh, go back. We're under Wonder Copay. Sometimes the

122  
0:14:32  
Emily  
this thing is a little little a little bit finicky.

123  
0:14:35  
Emily  
Yes, perfect. Thank you. All right. If you want to tap into overpayment debts.

124  
0:14:41  
Emily  
we're under co-pays. Yeah. So tap overpayment debts. Let me see? Yeah, okay, now we are perfect.

125  
0:14:47  
Emily  
So thoughts on the information presented here, how clear would it be to you to see just how much you currently owe.

126  
0:15:01  
P5  
Hmm, no, I I think this is really good.

127  
0:15:05  
P5  
I mean, you got the green

128  
0:15:07  
P5  
showing Arrow like on the post 9 11 Gi. Debt bill for books and supplies. You got the question mark.

129  
0:15:17  
P5  
You know.

130  
0:15:19  
P5  
So obviously, this tuition contact us department treasury sounds like it's very convoluted, very complicated. You know the disability compensation one. We're reducing your benefit. And as long as I get details that's good.

131  
0:15:32  
P5  
Oh, this. Yeah, this is pretty good.

132  
0:15:37  
Emily  
Okay?

133  
0:15:38  
Emily  
So we're going to look at. Oh, actually, one question. If you have a a new debt that comes how would you expect to to be notified, and to and to know that there is a new debt.

134  
0:15:54  
P5  
Well, I think it'll be good if there's and I don't know. Maybe I'm not set up for it. On the Va. App about notifications like if you had say your monthly disability thing hit, and it had a notification. Now, I don't need that. I don't track it that closely, but I could see for most people it would be important. But if you could sign up for notifications and get that like, I get notifications, I believe if I no, I don't

135  
0:16:22  
P5  
like if I get an email, I think I do from a healthcare

136  
0:16:26  
P5  
person like a nurse nurse practitioner, maybe. But it's been so long. I just don't recall.

137  
0:16:32  
Emily  
Hmm.

138  
0:16:33  
P5  
You know, I forget how I know that I'm getting.

139  
0:16:37  
P5  
Yeah, there's a way to get a notification. That's probably the only thing would be kind of cool.

140  
0:16:42  
Emily  
All right, got it. So we're going to just focus on that top one, the post 9, 11 for housing. What would you need to know for for this particular debt? What's what's important to you?

141  
0:16:58  
P5  
Kind of like a

142  
0:16:59  
P5  
like an access to the letter. So like, if you go into Va disability like, you can basically get all your letters on your iphone.

143  
0:17:06  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

144  
0:17:07  
P5  
Generate letters. Obviously, you don't need to generate a letter here, but like to be able to quickly access the VA Letter would be very helpful, I would think. I would like to be able to do that. And then

145  
0:17:22  
P5  
payment due dates.

146  
0:17:24  
P5  
Yeah, kind of the transaction history which you have. Oh, I see it. Now you got this these letters. 1st command letter second, yeah, I really wouldn't add anything, because it's

147  
0:17:35  
P5  
you want to keep it simple and to the point. So looks really good, actually.

148  
0:17:40  
Emily  
Okay, got it? So since you specifically mentioned the the letters, can you? Can you tap into that the details again of that top one.

149  
0:17:50  
Emily  
Yeah, there we go. Yeah. Thoughts on the information presented here regarding the letters on the bottom.

150  
0:18:04  
P5  
No, as long as you click it. I mean, you got the date. You got the 1st letter, second letter, chronological order. I don't think anything better you can do.

151  
0:18:11  
Emily  
Okay, so would you. Would. Would you expect to be able to? To to view the letters here?

152  
0:18:17  
P5  
I would. I'm just, from personal history I just know there's no way to do that in the app. But it it would be very easy instead of having to go to the VA website on a desktop. Like the VA app is really good. The only thing it's not easy with is it doesn't touch anything post 9/11 Gi. Bill. And anything that's

153  
0:18:37  
P5  
so. Those 2 are incorporated. I mean, the app would be perfect. You would never have to use the site you you have the face id cause that dhs login stuff like it can be like complicated. And then I do like did me. But I think for some reason I have one from like a work old work email, so that even gets convoluted. But like the Va app is. So it it's everything it needs to be. And it's nothing that it's not. And it works perfect. So

154  
0:19:07  
P5  
I think this looks really good. Actually, I wanna

155  
0:19:11  
P5  
critique it. I'm also not very critical of apps. But I'm I'm easy to please. But this, yeah, just I'm trying to think of it from someone else's.

156  
0:19:20  
P5  
You know, have a different perspective. You know what the perspective is. I think this is perfect.

157  
0:19:26  
Emily  
Okay, got it? So yes. Any other information that you would feel necessary?

158  
0:19:33  
Emily  
From for the for the for this particular debt.

159  
0:19:37  
P5  
No, but especially like with the debts, because I mean, you can kind of snowball things get worse. There's a way to get notifications on your phone. It'd be super easy.

160  
0:19:45  
Emily  
Oh, okay, notifications about like, what? What specific notifications would you want?

161  
0:19:50  
P5  
You have a new letter, or you have a, you know, a new amount owed, or hmm

162  
0:19:56  
P5  
payment received like those kind of things.

163  
0:19:59  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

164  
0:20:01  
Emily  
And then,

165  
0:20:03  
Emily  
if you have paid off a debt, what would you expect to see in the app once that has been paid off.

166  
0:20:12  
P5  
Just a transaction history. So you have, like late fee, partial payment, just like debt, close or closure of that would be bolded so July whatever. 25, th to about 5 closure of debt received via Ach! Minus whatever, and then, like an asterisk, your debt is resolved.

167  
0:20:32  
Emily  
Okay, great

168  
0:20:33  
Emily  
sounds good. And then would there be other things that you would expect to be able to do from from from this screen regarding this debt.

169  
0:20:46  
P5  
no, I understand how the Va. Doesn't take credit cards, but it'd be kind of cool if you could

170  
0:20:51  
P5  
pay with a credit card to resolve the debt.

171  
0:20:54  
Emily  
Okay. Good.

172  
0:20:55  
P5  
Like there's a payment thing.

173  
0:20:58  
Emily  
Okay.

174  
0:21:00  
Emily  
so yeah, so since you you would like some sort of payment ability, for a credit card, so, if this were built in real life? Especially since you specifically mentioned that you would like some sort of way to pay by credit card. How likely would you? How likely would you? Use it? Do you believe.

175  
0:21:23  
P5  
Like, if I had a debt of something significant like, I mean again, this $[redacted] just skips my mind with the busyness of life, but it was $830. You know, I'm tracking it every couple of days. So yeah.

176  
0:21:38  
P5  
at least a couple of times a week.

177  
0:21:41  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

178  
0:21:42  
P5  
Getting under 100 bucks is insignificant.

179  
0:21:44  
P5  
Okay?

180  
0:21:45  
P5  
Again, I I know, like with the 9 11 bill, like they count it down to the days of payments. So it's not really a dispute like it's not an insurance issue of yeah, this this Karen community provider didn't bill right like that. I would be hawking, but I know, like they they calculate the benefits. Post 9 11 Gi. Bill to the actual day, so I take them as very accurate, so.

181  
0:22:10  
Emily  
Okay, got it

182  
0:22:12  
Emily  
if you're so if if again, if this is is built in real life, what would be your

183  
0:22:20  
Emily  
but yeah, let's head back to figma.

184  
0:22:25  
P5  
Go ahead!

185  
0:22:26  
Emily  
Yeah, if you so if this were built in life, how would you expect to make a payment? Or I guess, what? What would you do in in order to make a payment from this debt?

186  
0:22:39  
P5  
Well, I think it'd be cool if you have like a little bar like, why might I have this debt, resolve this debt, or pay this debt, and then you can click. And then, if you have Va disability of significance, you know, maybe they give an option of they can pay it out over 6 months or you know. Pay now with a credit card. Those kind of things would make it easier.

187  
0:22:59  
Emily  
Okay, how about if if there there were not those options? That that you just suggested what what do you think your next step would be in order to to pay it.

188  
0:23:10  
P5  
I mean the letter I would assume. You know there'd be a little blurb on the letter about how to resolve, or where you can mail the check, and

189  
0:23:18  
P5  
you know, be nice in the letter they sent a self addressed, stamped envelope, or, you know, like the business reply, Mail thing.

190  
0:23:27  
P5  
yeah, that's all.

191  
0:23:29  
Emily  
Okay. Got it. Alright. Let me have you tap on the the payments button at the bottom right again.

192  
0:23:38  
P5  
Okay.

193  
0:23:39  
Emily  
Yeah, there we go, and then scroll down to the bottom and you tap into that blank gray area again for yeah, perfect, all right and then go back to overpayment debts.

194  
0:23:52  
Emily  
Okay, so now we're going to get to the payments in just a moment. But 1st we're going to pretend that you don't believe you are going to have the finances to make a payment soon. We'll go with this top that same debt. Talk to me about what you would do in that situation. If you're if you're pretty sure you're not going to have the money soon to to make a payment.

195  
0:24:22  
P5  
Well, I would just look at the letter and get the phone number.

196  
0:24:25  
Emily  
Okay.

197  
0:24:26  
P5  
But they should maybe have a little tab kind of like resolve the debt

198  
0:24:30  
P5  
like a resources tab.

199  
0:24:33  
P5  
You know that would be kind of cool. Where then? It has a number, or you know.

200  
0:24:40  
P5  
I don't know.

201  
0:24:41  
Emily  
Okay? Well, you can. You can start start to to tap through here and just walk me through what what you think you would do in this situation.

202  
0:24:48  
P5  
Well, resolve the debt. Maybe for other users. They could be available resources. But yeah, click, resolve the debt, pay online other ways to pay. Well, yeah, just request help. That'll work.

203  
0:25:01  
Emily  
Okay. Great.

204  
0:25:02  
P5  
Keep this up requests, yeah.

205  
0:25:08  
Emily  
Okay? And then thoughts on on on those options that came up when you tapped the request, help outgo. Yeah, which should go back.

206  
0:25:17  
P5  
Yeah, I think it looks really good. I mean.

207  
0:25:20  
P5  
it's simple. You have pay online other ways.

208  
0:25:23  
P5  
What's the other ways pay by phone pay by mail. Okay?

209  
0:25:27  
P5  
Request how maybe there will be a 4th button and then put dispute that on the bottom.

210  
0:25:33  
P5  
because someone might not realize request, help is dispute the debt right.

211  
0:25:37  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.

212  
0:25:38  
P5  
Yeah, start your yeah. So just move that out. And then we have a 4th little blurb above, close between, request, help, and close of dispute that make sense.

213  
0:25:49  
Emily  
Okay? So let's let's pretend that. Specifically, you are. You are looking to to get help because you're not. You're not sure you're gonna have the money. Yeah, walk me through what? Exactly you would do after you. You tapped that request. Help.

214  
0:26:05  
P5  
Request a payment plan.

215  
0:26:07  
Emily  
Okay.

216  
0:26:08  
P5  
And that's call us. I mean, that's all you could do. Right. Mail call request. Yeah. So just to have something with the payment plan.

217  
0:26:18  
P5  
Maybe have a link for financial counseling

218  
0:26:22  
Emily  
Okay. Spanish counseling.

219  
0:26:26  
Emily  
yeah. And then and then the second question, I know you. You touched upon it. But if you are quite sure that one of that. Let's say this particular debt. You don't know it is an error. What would you do in that case?

220  
0:26:43  
P5  
Request help. So

221  
0:26:45  
P5  
I would just expect to have like a phone number or somewhere, you can mail correspondence.

222  
0:26:53  
P5  
Yeah, I mean, basically, it's walking you through how to dispute it. I mean.

223  
0:26:57  
Emily  
Okay.

224  
0:26:59  
Emily  
got it? Any other? basic info. Obviously, there's a lot of information here. But any other information you think you would want to have particularly if you are looking to, let's say, dispute a debt or looking for other help.

225  
0:27:12  
P5  
No, this is very, you know. Here's what you need. That's smart.

226  
0:27:24  
P5  
talks about the process time burden. So you kind of know it's gonna take an hour.

227  
0:27:30  
P5  
Oh, yeah, I like this a lot.

228  
0:27:32  
Emily  
Okay, great. And were you I think you are. But I want to confirm have you always been aware of these options like to request, help, or extend the payment or debt. You or you have not been.

229  
0:27:45  
P5  
No, no.

230  
0:27:48  
Emily  
Got it? Any other ways that you think that could be any any any more clear, so that people know that those are options.

231  
0:27:56  
P5  
No, I can't think of anything.

232  
0:27:58  
Emily  
Okay, great, and then walk me through how you would. So this is a different version here. But yeah, walk me through steps you would take for paying, and I promise it won't have you enter any actual information.

233  
0:28:14  
P5  
Yeah. Yeah.

234  
0:28:18  
P5  
I would just have, like a again, a paid resolve debt.

235  
0:28:22  
P5  
So pay online.

236  
0:28:28  
P5  
that takes me to the website. I mean, it'd be kind of cool if I didn't have to go to paid up like if that was incorporated here, and I could just

237  
0:28:35  
P5  
there was like a little kind of

238  
0:28:38  
P5  
enter your credit card number kind of thing, or.

239  
0:28:41  
Emily  
Okay, so pay directly here. Got it. So knowing that there there is not if yeah, if you can continue that that pay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, continue that. And we're just gonna

240  
0:28:54  
Emily  
look at the at this one again. I won't have you enter anything in

241  
0:29:00  
Emily  
So yeah, so this is what the information comes to. Yeah, there we go, the next one. So let me have you look at the the bottom section there kind of below the the blue bars. Yeah. As to what information, and let me know your thoughts on where you.

242  
0:29:20  
P5  
Yeah.

243  
0:29:20  
Emily  
Information, okay, go ahead.

244  
0:29:22  
P5  
I would just have something like, if you can do like, yeah, maybe

245  
0:29:32  
P5  
set a file number like you put your social in

246  
0:29:36  
P5  
or put file number slash social security number. So you can pick payee number. That's confusing

247  
0:29:44  
P5  
person entitled May. I guess that's your name?

248  
0:29:47  
P5  
Deduction code.

249  
0:29:49  
P5  
Okay, that's easy. But here the problem is, you got all these dang codes too.

250  
0:29:55  
P5  
Like, I use chapter 31, and it's hard. I always mix it up with chapter 35. And there's chapter 33.

251  
0:30:01  
P5  
So maybe there's less options.

252  
0:30:04  
P5  
So it's kind of like if you go into the Va app and you want to message your doctor. They have so so much like you can. A chaplain, you know.

253  
0:30:15  
P5  
You know. LGBT, you know.

254  
0:30:19  
P5  
caseworkers, you have all these doctors, and you have somebody like in my region that's like [redacted], like it's kind of confusing. So I hear how you have like

255  
0:30:31  
P5  
30 or 40 things like it's almost too much like a deduction code. Maybe. Just give me the codes of things that are applicable. The the debts I have.

256  
0:30:40  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

257  
0:30:42  
P5  
Yeah.

258  
0:30:42  
Emily  
And and where? So, knowing that this is confusing and thoughts on how you would actually find all the information that you do have to enter. If you were actually making a payment in real life here.

259  
0:30:57  
P5  
I just I mean, yeah, deduction. There's too many deduction codes. Just keep it simple. And then

260  
0:31:02  
P5  
person entitled, I would get rid of that because you don't.

261  
0:31:06  
Emily  
So knowing. So this, this page is actually not, we're not changing this. So knowing that this won't change thoughts on where you would actually find the information that is required.

262  
0:31:18  
P5  
Well, it just be hopefully back at the letter that you can download, and

263  
0:31:23  
P5  
it'll have the file. You know all that information.

264  
0:31:26  
Emily  
Okay. So if you if you had gotten to this page, what what would you be doing if you were actually trying to make a payment.

265  
0:31:37  
P5  
Putting in the payment amount my name, daytime phone.

266  
0:31:43  
P5  
I have to find a deduction code. Obviously.

267  
0:31:48  
Emily  
And then where? Yeah, where? Where would you be going to? To find that information that that that you have to enter.

268  
0:31:56  
P5  
I guess the letter is is where I would try to find it.

269  
0:31:59  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So you would, you would open up that letter.

270  
0:32:02  
P5  
Yep.

271  
0:32:02  
Emily  
Okay, and then let me have you switch back to the figma app.

272  
0:32:11  
P5  
Yeah.

273  
0:32:12  
Emily  
Yep, and then tap on. Go back

274  
0:32:16  
Emily  
so thoughts on. Oh, sorry. Go so tap on overpayment debts again.

275  
0:32:22  
P5  
And then go to yeah, do the the resolve debt again. We're just gonna go back to the other page. We were just at.

276  
0:32:31  
Emily  
Oh, sorry. Yeah. So so tap on overpayments right here and then tap on. Yeah, there we go, and then tap on pay online, we're just gonna go back to where we were. Yeah, so thoughts on, the information here, knowing that you were needing to enter stuff on the pay site.

277  
0:32:52  
P5  
No, I guess I could jot this stuff down.

278  
0:32:54  
Emily  
Okay.

279  
0:32:56  
P5  
But that'd be kind of cool if you can do like a copy and paste. But I get it, you know.

280  
0:33:00  
Emily  
Okay, so you'd want to copy paste from here. Okay, and thoughts on the clarity of providing this information. Now, now that we see that it, it does have to be entered into the other application, or sorry the other site.

281  
0:33:18  
P5  
It's very clear I get. I understand it now.

282  
0:33:22  
Emily  
Okay, are there since you said you, you understand it now, are there other ways that could make it more clear.

283  
0:33:29  
P5  
Not really without getting into like click on this video. And then, you know.

284  
0:33:33  
Emily  
Just take.

285  
0:33:34  
P5  
Longer, so I'm 1 of those less is more. But this is, you know, pretty simple. And

286  
0:33:42  
P5  
now that I digested it.

287  
0:33:44  
Emily  
Okay, got it? How about thoughts? On having to switch applications like in this case from figma to a browser. To get the information.

288  
0:33:56  
P5  
Yeah, it would be easier just to stay in the app. But if you can't do it, you can't do it right. But.

289  
0:34:01  
Emily  
Yeah.

290  
0:34:01  
P5  
I think anything. The Va. Again, the Va app is perfect. The website is this, it's this convoluted. It's not as easy to digest like

291  
0:34:10  
P5  
like you can go to a lot of websites like, I'm not saying like Espn. As an example, like their desktop site is the same as their app site. It's like all it is is a shortcut. But the Va. I use the it's almost like the cliff notes, is the app, and that's all I want cliff notes. It's the websites, usually too convoluted compared

292  
0:34:31  
P5  
to that.

293  
0:34:31  
P5  
Yeah, that's how I do it.

294  
0:34:34  
Emily  
Yeah, got it. Okay? And then, so if this experience that we've just gone through was built in real life, how likely would it would. Would you use it? Do you believe.

295  
0:34:47  
P5  
The app, I all day long.

296  
0:34:49  
Emily  
Well, well, specifically, for like this, this debt in in regards to there is the the link to pay.

297  
0:34:59  
P5  
I would definitely use it, because this is easier than you know

298  
0:35:04  
P5  
mailing it in like. Here's the address.

299  
0:35:07  
P5  
Mail it in. Yeah.

300  
0:35:08  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And then how about.

301  
0:35:11  
P5  
Awesome.

302  
0:35:12  
Emily  
I missed that.

303  
0:35:14  
P5  
Yeah, like here, like we, we, my wife and I, we rarely write checks. So I would have to find the checkbook.

304  
0:35:19  
P5  
You know, you gotta pay for checks like it's just easier. Keep it simple.

305  
0:35:23  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And then how about comparing this experience here? When I say that, I mean specifically, like paying on a different website coming and coming back to the app versus the other version with the app, where there was no link to pay thoughts on, which is which you would prefer.

306  
0:35:45  
P5  
Oh, definitely with the link.

307  
0:35:47  
Emily  
Okay?

308  
0:35:48  
P5  
I want to take it from A to Z, like I know about my debt. Understand why it's there. How do we resolve it?

309  
0:35:54  
Emily  
Got it? Okay? And then, after you have made a payment, what do you expect to see? And how quickly do you expect to see

310  
0:36:04  
Emily  
Whatever's going next.

311  
0:36:06  
P5  
Just, you know. Maybe there's a note like it takes 24 h to reflect, or 72 h. That's fine. If it takes up to a week. I want to want it to be longer.

312  
0:36:14  
P5  
But and then again to get a notification or not. Yeah, a notification that says, Hey, the debt is resolved.

313  
0:36:24  
Emily  
Okay.

314  
0:36:25  
P5  
Have some kind of receipt emailed to you, and then mailed to you as well that they.

315  
0:36:28  
Emily  
Okay, okay, got it.

316  
0:36:31  
Emily  
So so so some sort of notification of how long it'll be until you get that. And then also the emails and notifications.

317  
0:36:38  
P5  
Yes, ma'am.

318  
0:36:39  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Alright. Any other thoughts on how any of these sections have been labeled? If you want to go back to the the the payments. Page, looking around.

319  
0:36:52  
P5  
I know.

320  
0:36:52  
Emily  
Anything else that could be more clear.

321  
0:36:55  
P5  
No, I like the little hazard triangle green chart, but this is pretty good.

322  
0:37:02  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And I'm gonna have you look at the co-pays now, I I know you said you haven't had any copays. So we're just gonna pretend. But yeah, so looking at this copay page, how clear is it? How much you owe overall from looking at this.

323  
0:37:22  
P5  
Very easy current balance, you know. Kind of gives me the triangle. So I got something coming up.

324  
0:37:28  
P5  
This next 1, 200 sounds like it's kind of complicated, which is why contact

325  
0:37:34  
P5  
and then it shows one that's kind of paid off. And it'll be nice that you know this, this South Hillsboro one gets removed. We have current back 0, like I don't.

326  
0:37:46  
P5  
But maybe maybe they keep it there for a couple of weeks to make it so. People know.

327  
0:37:50  
Emily  
Oh, okay, and.

328  
0:37:51  
P5  
Do I owe anything on this? So maybe it pays for 30 days and then gets removed.

329  
0:37:58  
Emily  
Oh, God! And would there be a place? Okay? So you'd want to leave it on there for maybe 30 days or so. There be any place that you would want to see, any copays that have already been paid off.

330  
0:38:10  
P5  
No, I don't cause. Then you're just adding more to it. It takes up more speed and time, so no.

331  
0:38:16  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

332  
0:38:19  
Emily  
Okay? And then thoughts on how? If, in case it is different, like how quickly you would want to see something here when you do have a new pay, let's say you just had an appointment, and you then go to the app. How quickly would you expect to see information here about what you owe for that Copay.

333  
0:38:37  
P5  
Like 72 h would be nice.

334  
0:38:39  
Emily  
Okay, got it alright.

335  
0:38:42  
Emily  
And then we'll just look at this top one, the James A. Haley Veterans hospital. What information would be helpful for you.

336  
0:38:52  
Emily  
Yeah, what would you be looking for.

337  
0:38:55  
P5  
Current statement, Provider medic. No, this is pretty pretty good.

338  
0:39:04  
P5  
So it's just like a checking ledger. It has chronological.

339  
0:39:09  
P5  
Yeah.

340  
0:39:10  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

341  
0:39:11  
Emily  
and then and then tell me again, with that top one how clear is it about when when the payment is due for it.

342  
0:39:23  
P5  
Very clear payment or request help by July 30.th Very simple.

343  
0:39:28  
Emily  
Okay, good.

344  
0:39:30  
Emily  
Alright. And then if you are again, a similar scenario that, we are making up with the other one of you don't believe you're gonna have the money to to pay this?

345  
0:39:42  
Emily  
Where would you expect to find, or what? What would be your your next step if you.

346  
0:39:48  
P5  
Kinda to click the pay bill and to have something kind of request, help, or

347  
0:39:54  
P5  
payment, assistance, or something under pay in person.

348  
0:39:58  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

349  
0:40:00  
Emily  
Yeah. Any any other place you might look for? For for guidance on what to do next.

350  
0:40:07  
P5  
No.

351  
0:40:08  
Emily  
Okay, got it and

352  
0:40:13  
Emily  
and let me have you? So since we looked at at payment with the other one, let me have you walk me through, how you would pay this bill here.

353  
0:40:24  
P5  
Click, pay bill.

354  
0:40:26  
P5  
pay by phone, silly pay by mail pay in person. Be nice to have a pay online, you know.

355  
0:40:35  
P5  
Click, pay online and then have a place where I put my social in my name.

356  
0:40:41  
P5  
select credit card and then put like like, normal pay with credit card online stuff.

357  
0:40:48  
Emily  
Okay with with the options that were there, what? What do you think you would? You would do.

358  
0:40:55  
P5  
Definitely not paying person.

359  
0:40:58  
P5  
I would try to do the pay by phone doing. I could call and give them a credit card number would be kind of easier

360  
0:41:05  
P5  
pay by mail. Okay? Then I gotta get into a stamp situation or or pay on pay.gov. That's what I would do.

361  
0:41:13  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

362  
0:41:14  
P5  
Yeah.

363  
0:41:14  
Emily  
Yeah, so you can, you can go ahead.

364  
0:41:16  
Emily  
And okay, what? What do you think would make it more more clear, since since since you said that, you.

365  
0:41:21  
P5  
Say, pay, just say, pay online.

366  
0:41:23  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

367  
0:41:25  
P5  
Or pay by credit, card.

368  
0:41:27  
P5  
Cool. That'd be.

369  
0:41:30  
Emily  
Okay, and actually, I forgot. Let me have you close this. I'm gonna have you go into the review details first? st

370  
0:41:38  
Emily  
Oh, sorry of that of that top, go pay.

371  
0:41:41  
Emily  
yep, and then again, I'm, gonna have you attempt attempt to pay it and just see what

372  
0:41:49  
Emily  
experiences

373  
0:41:51  
P5  
They,

374  
0:42:00  
P5  
okay.

375  
0:42:01  
Emily  
To continue to the form, yeah.

376  
0:42:03  
Emily  
just wanna get to this one.

377  
0:42:07  
Emily  
Okay, there we go.

378  
0:42:08  
P5  
All my information like this is confusing. Part 1, 2, 3, 4.

379  
0:42:13  
Emily  
Okay.

380  
0:42:14  
P5  
Payers full name, email, address, payment amount.

381  
0:42:18  
P5  
It'd be nice to have it all right here where you can just veteran's name.

382  
0:42:23  
P5  
I don't.

383  
0:42:25  
P5  
Something. I don't need 5 parts. Just give me one.

384  
0:42:29  
Emily  
Okay.

385  
0:42:29  
P5  
So get rid of that.

386  
0:42:31  
Emily  
Okay, where? Where would you expect to find as you said, the the 5 parts of that of that account number up there.

387  
0:42:39  
P5  
Well on the letter. Yeah.

388  
0:42:41  
Emily  
Okay.

389  
0:42:42  
P5  
But yeah, to go back to it. They have something where I just put it's kind of like, if if I'm buying something online, I can literally to have it all on one page is great. If I have a thing on the bottom credit card information

390  
0:42:55  
P5  
for debit, credit, debit, card information.

391  
0:43:00  
Emily  
Okay, what would make it? As I said you would, you would look to the letter for that information. How about anything within within the app that might make it easier.

392  
0:43:11  
P5  
No, if I can get off the letter, that'd be fine.

393  
0:43:14  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Let me have you switch back to figma. We'll pretend you're we're going back to the Va. App.

394  
0:43:27  
P5  
Okay.

395  
0:43:32  
P5  
I'm in Figma.

396  
0:43:34  
Emily  
Oh, where this is? Zoom. Yeah, there we go. Okay.

397  
0:43:39  
Emily  
Let me say that. Wait for that to see where this ends up 2, 2.

398  
0:43:49  
Emily  
Okay, tap on payments. We're just gonna get you back to where we were.

399  
0:43:54  
Emily  
So tap on payments on the the lower right?

400  
0:43:58  
Emily  
Okay, and then scroll to the bottom and tap in the the blank gray area

401  
0:44:04  
Emily  
great, and then tap on Copays

402  
0:44:10  
Emily  
alright and go back into review details of that top copay.

403  
0:44:20  
Emily  
Okay? So yeah. Thoughts on pretending that that we've we've switched back and forth from the the browser of the payment. And then coming here? What? What information would you be looking for here, or might you be looking for.

404  
0:44:38  
P5  
It's got everything I need. The ledger pay bill option current statement.

405  
0:44:47  
P5  
Be cool. There's a go to current statement. But there's a tab for click here for previous statements.

406  
0:44:54  
P5  
So above statement charges, but below the Pdf

407  
0:44:58  
P5  
go to current statement something previous statement. So if you are confused and that would be helpful, but.

408  
0:45:06  
Emily  
Oh, okay, so you'd want you'd want to see previous statements up here.

409  
0:45:09  
P5  
Yeah, that'd be nice.

410  
0:45:11  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And how about specifically for paying? Since we are looking@pay.gov earlier.

411  
0:45:21  
P5  
You know, above Pdf statements, but below the June 1st Ledger

412  
0:45:26  
P5  
pay bill online would be nice.

413  
0:45:29  
Emily  
Okay, different from where you'd found it before.

414  
0:45:34  
P5  
Correct.

415  
0:45:35  
Emily  
Okay.

416  
0:45:37  
Emily  
Do you know why you would? You would prefer to have it next to Pdf. Statements as as opposed to up top.

417  
0:45:48  
P5  
oh, it's right here. Pay Bill. I some reason I forgot that. No, that I I believe my last. Just take that out pay bills perfect.

418  
0:45:55  
Emily  
Okay, pay Bill got it? And how about to the the information that that you were having to fill in

419  
0:46:02  
Emily  
on the pay.gov.

420  
0:46:07  
P5  
Yeah, just outside of having, like the 5 account number thing or ledger. Everything else is perfect. Just a simple page where I can put my name, my address, maybe my social, and then the amount I want to pay.

421  
0:46:19  
Emily  
Okay. Do you think thoughts on the copying? This account number here.

422  
0:46:27  
P5  
Copy that'd be perfect. I what I would do is just jot it down on a sticky pad, but.

423  
0:46:32  
Emily  
Okay, would you use the the copy action that's here toward the top.

424  
0:46:38  
P5  
I didn't know there wasn't. Oh, I see it! Oh, absolutely! I would.

425  
0:46:41  
Emily  
Okay, thoughts on how to make that more clear.

426  
0:46:47  
P5  
Maybe instead of blue. Make it green.

427  
0:46:49  
Emily  
Okay.

428  
0:46:52  
P5  
Or put copy and paste, or something, because most people

429  
0:46:55  
P5  
I don't know you might mix copay with copy, and your eyes just play that trick on you. Oh, it's missing! Copay.

430  
0:47:02  
Emily  
Okay, so copy could be misread as Cope. I haven't thought about that. Right? Okay.

431  
0:47:07  
Emily  
all right, and go ahead and just tap that I forget. There we go. Okay, yeah. So copy there.

432  
0:47:14  
Emily  
If that if had, had you seen that would, do you think that would be helpful in order to.

433  
0:47:20  
P5  
Barry.

434  
0:47:20  
Emily  
And pay. Yeah, okay, okay, great.

435  
0:47:25  
Emily  
All right. And since you had mentioned the statements, how are are you? Are you currently using any any statements for really any other any anything else in your life?

436  
0:47:39  
P5  
No.

437  
0:47:40  
Emily  
You're not okay, got it.

438  
0:47:42  
Emily  
and let me have you tap on the the current statement here. Since you mentioned that.

439  
0:47:52  
P5  
Perfect.

440  
0:47:53  
Emily  
Okay.

441  
0:47:59  
Emily  
thoughts on, using this this statement within the app.

442  
0:48:07  
P5  
I would use it because I wouldn't want to check out, especially when you start getting into hundreds of dollars. Like.

443  
0:48:12  
P5  
yeah, definitely need the easy access to statements.

444  
0:48:15  
Emily  
Okay, got it

445  
0:48:17  
Emily  
and thoughts on. Would there be anything else you would you would do with them outside of of looking just to to double check all the charges.

446  
0:48:27  
P5  
No, I would just. I would want to just cross reference.

447  
0:48:30  
Emily  
Okay, so he's looking at there. Okay? And then for older ones. Since you mentioned that. What instances would you be looking for older statements?

448  
0:48:40  
P5  
Well, just to double check my math, or to, you know, figure out why that was created. So if you have go to previous statements.

449  
0:48:47  
P5  
Parentheses, Pdf. Would be nice underneath.

450  
0:48:50  
Emily  
Okay, got it. I see. I see. Okay.

451  
0:48:54  
Emily  
And I believe those are all my questions. Natasha, if you have anything just speaking to my other colleague here. If you have anything you wanted to ask, feel free to unmute and ask here.

452  
0:49:11  
Emily  
okay, anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances with Va, or specifically with the app.

453  
0:49:21  
P5  
No, I mean just some more stuff you can put in the app without leaving. The site is easy a lot of times to leave the site. You gotta re log in credentials, and like just to have a face. Id is unbelievable, you know, when I go to my bank account like my chase, app like it, my members, my face id. I don't ever have to use a password like.

454  
0:49:41  
Emily  
Oh, yeah. Okay.

455  
0:49:41  
P5  
For like simplicity. So that's it for me.

456  
0:49:46  
Emily  
Got it great, all right. Well, those are those are all my questions so happy that you were able to to share things with us, always always helpful to speak with veterans of it, helping to to improve things. So hopefully, we'll have some some new improvements soon. And yeah, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

457  
0:50:11  
P5  
I hope you have a great weekend, is it? Do you send a is it like a

458  
0:50:18  
P5  
like a gift card link? Or is it via check? I was.

459  
0:50:21  
Emily  
Paragene is going to be reaching out directly to you. I actually don't know the details, but they will be be in touch soon about that.

460  
0:50:29  
P5  
No, I was just curious, but no anything. Yeah, just as simple as possible is what people want, and at least me and then the anything that keeps you from having to log into a government website. But using a government app with the face Id is is a million bucks. In my opinion.

461  
0:50:46  
Emily  
Got it makes sense alright. Well, thank you so much. Hope you have a great weekend.

462  
0:50:51  
P5  
You as well. Thank you, ladies.

463  
0:50:53  
Emily  
Bye.
