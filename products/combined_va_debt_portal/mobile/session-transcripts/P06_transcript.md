5  
0:00:25  
P6  
Yes!

6  
0:00:28  
Emily  
Great. Thank you. So first, st I'd love diving into the conversation. I'd love to know a bit about you as a veteran, at whatever level. You are comfortable. Sharing, of course, could be a branch you served in when you retired or separated.

7  
0:00:47  
P6  
I am a [redacted]. I served 10 years. I left the [redacted] as a [redacted]

8  
0:01:01  
P6  
I separated in 2011 October of 2011

9  
0:01:12  
P6  
And I settled here in [redacted]. I was actually a recruiter here [redacted] for 4 years.

10  
0:01:20  
P6  
And then I separate it from

11  
0:01:22  
P6  
[redacted] as a recruiter. And just stay here in [redacted].

12  
0:01:28  
Emily  
Alright got it? And how about any experience you've had with the Va. What sort of experiences? And have you had.

13  
0:01:38  
P6  
I've had pretty decent experience with the Va.

14  
0:01:45  
P6  
I go to the Va for my my healthcare more recently.

15  
0:01:54  
P6  
Also, I've used I've actually coming out of homelessness myself.

16  
0:02:01  
P6  
So I've also used the different programs for like the veterans housing voucher.

17  
0:02:13  
Emily  
Okay.

18  
0:02:13  
P6  
Choice voucher and

19  
0:02:16  
P6  
and like the case managers and different things like that to help me get back.

20  
0:02:22  
Emily  
Oh, great!

21  
0:02:23  
P6  
To where I was before.

22  
0:02:25  
Emily  
Okay, amazing

23  
0:02:28  
Emily  
and can you tell me what sort of experience you've had with the Va website and or their mobile app.

24  
0:02:45  
P6  
I'm sorry over there, and.

25  
0:02:49  
Emily  
I'm curious to know what sort of experience you've had with the Va website or the mobile app.

26  
0:03:02  
P6  
The the mobile apps and website are, pretty good. The website more so is

27  
0:03:12  
P6  
pretty decent. I've used it for

28  
0:03:15  
P6  
use it for various things like using for like.

29  
0:03:21  
P6  
when I was using my GI Bill for school. I've used it for, of course, like my healthcare

30  
0:03:30  
P6  
communicating with like providers and things like that, ordering prescriptions

31  
0:03:37  
P6  
different things like that same thing with the app

32  
0:03:41  
P6  
as far as the app goes, I think it could be

33  
0:03:46  
P6  
it could use a little bit more. I guess it is.

34  
0:03:53  
P6  
It could stand to grow more

35  
0:03:57  
P6  
have more features added, and things like that.

36  
0:04:01  
P6  
But to make it boring usable and

37  
0:04:07  
P6  
be so, I'll be able to do the same thing. You know, on the go, as I would be able to do on. So the website is pretty good. The mobile app. It's decent enough. But pretty better.

38  
0:04:23  
Emily  
Okay, got it? What? What specific actions do you tend to make on the app as opposed to the website?

39  
0:04:32  
Emily  
Yeah.

40  
0:04:35  
P6  
I'm sorry. What was that?

41  
0:04:37  
Emily  
Oh, what what action? Or when would you choose to use the app over using the website?

42  
0:04:45  
P6  
I mostly use the app for when I'm setting trying to set an appointment with the provider, or just like refilling my prescriptions.

43  
0:04:57  
P6  
or seeing any messages messages I may have from one of the the providers.

44  
0:05:07  
P6  
That's about it.

45  
0:05:09  
Emily  
Okay? And for those, can you tell me why you like using the app better as opposed to the website?

46  
0:05:17  
P6  
Just because it's quicker, is it's quicker to and easier to navigate. I can just get in the app, and you know you is, you know, right there quickly available to get to.

47  
0:05:32  
Emily  
Any, and you said that there the the app could could use some improvement. What? What sorts of things are you thinking that you would prefer to have in the app that just aren't there yet.

48  
0:05:47  
P6  
I would I would say things like

49  
0:05:51  
P6  
like, if I like. Add add things such as the

50  
0:05:57  
P6  
You know the education piece like, you know, using your Gi bill, or you know the stuff that you have to go through for using that

51  
0:06:08  
P6  
also.

52  
0:06:12  
P6  
For things like, if you want to. You know, submit

53  
0:06:18  
P6  
your disability, disability claims and things like that, you can

54  
0:06:23  
P6  
be able to use it doing that versus having to go online added benefit.

55  
0:06:32  
P6  
Things like if you wanted to get updates on. You know, the status of your disability claims something like that.

56  
0:06:43  
P6  
I think various things like that just more added to it than just the medical portion.

57  
0:06:48  
Emily  
Okay. So more than just medical. Okay, got it. Excuse me.

58  
0:06:53  
Emily  
Okay. So now we're going to move into talking about the financial portion of the discussion, and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have 0 information about you or your finances. So up until now this is all anonymous here 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for any benefit overpayment?

59  
0:07:24  
Emily  
We just lost him.

60  
0:07:31  
Emily  
Shannon. I'll just wait a moment to see I know the reception seemed to be not the greatest on his end, so

61  
0:07:40  
Emily  
maybe he's having a little trouble.

62  
0:08:13  
Emily  
There we go it coming in now.

63  
0:08:27  
Emily  
No, dropped again just after, I admitted. Let's see if he comes back.

64  
0:08:34  
Emily  
There we go. Okay, here we go.

65  
0:08:48  
Emily  
You able to hear me again.

66  
0:08:50  
Emily  
You're on mute.

67  
0:08:50  
Emily  
Oh, there you go! Yeah.

68  
0:08:54  
P6  
Sorry. I'm not sure what happened.

69  
0:08:56  
Emily  
Okay, I just figured it was some kind of connection drop, you know, that happens with technology. Sometimes like, we'll just wait. And hopefully, you're able to join again. So happy you are back.

70  
0:09:07  
Emily  
So the I'll just repeat the question, because I don't know when exactly you dropped. Yeah, curious to know if you have had experience with owing the Va. Money for any overpay or benefit overpayment.

71  
0:09:23  
P6  
Yes, I do. Did do

72  
0:09:27  
P6  
I had an overpayment with my gi bill

73  
0:09:36  
P6  
for some courses I took. I think I ended up drop dropping my course early.

74  
0:09:45  
P6  
And I ended up owing the Va. For

75  
0:09:50  
P6  
for that that portion that I dropped.

76  
0:09:53  
Emily  
Yeah, got it? Okay?

77  
0:09:54  
Emily  
And do you recall, how you were notified of this originally.

78  
0:10:03  
P6  
I think I may have received a letter in the mail.

79  
0:10:07  
Emily  
Okay.

80  
0:10:10  
P6  
Yeah, I think it was a letter in the mail.

81  
0:10:13  
Emily  
Okay? And eventually oh, lost him. Again.

82  
0:10:33  
Emily  
go is back.

83  
0:10:41  
Emily  
Hello.

85  
0:11:05  
Emily

86  
0:11:11  
Emily  
I'm not able to hear you. It looks like you're not. You are unmuted.

87  
0:11:19  
P6  
Oh yes!

88  
0:11:20  
Emily  
Oh, I can, all right. I can hear you now.

89  
0:11:24  
P6  
Can you? Can you hear me?

90  
0:11:25  
Emily  
Yeah, I can right now. Yes, oh, no! Lost again.

91  
0:11:54  
Emily

92  
0:12:02  
P6  
No, okay. So what? It was right now.

93  
0:12:05  
Emily  
Sounds like you're back.

94  
0:12:09  
P6  
Yeah.

95  
0:12:13  
P6  
Okay.

96  
0:12:15  
P6  
Alright.

97  
0:12:16  
Emily  
You, you're able to hear me. Excuse me, are you able to hear me?

98  
0:12:20  
P6  
Yes.

99  
0:12:20  
Emily  
Okay. Great great

100  
0:12:24  
Emily  
Where did I leave off there? Oh, okay. So you were explaining the overpayment debt, and you had received a letter. Do you recall? What are, how you're notified of exactly how you needed to to pay off or or resolve the debt.

101  
0:12:47  
P6  
It was explained in a letter.

102  
0:12:51  
P6  
How we either I could repay the deck. Let me just flat out, I think also.

103  
0:13:01  
P6  
it may have been like a some type of payment option.

104  
0:13:05  
P6  
Okay.

105  
0:13:07  
P6  
payment plan option. And I think there was an also option to dispute the to dispute the debt.

106  
0:13:15  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

107  
0:13:17  
P6  
Something.

108  
0:13:18  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And oh, excuse me

109  
0:13:23  
Emily  
Do you recall? Were were you? Were you making payments on this, or were you resolving it other ways.

110  
0:13:34  
P6  
Well, at the time I just I didn't have the funds to

111  
0:13:40  
P6  
hated it so kind of just let it

112  
0:13:46  
P6  
be what it was. Just because I I had so much going on at the time. That that was kind of like my concern.

113  
0:13:55  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. Got it?

114  
0:13:58  
Emily  
Okay, was there. Overall. How was the the communication from? Va in terms of

115  
0:14:07  
Emily  
yeah. How? How how? How well did they communicate everything?

116  
0:14:14  
P6  
As far as like

117  
0:14:18  
P6  
the the letter, I mean, and how I resolved it, and everything. That was pretty clear and laid out. I also saw the same thing

118  
0:14:29  
P6  
eventually, later down down the line on on the website.

119  
0:14:35  
P6  
I'm not sure is I kind of ran into it by accident when I was just kind of like going through the website. And it explains it the same, pretty much the same type of way.

120  
0:14:46  
P6  
So I mean, it's pretty clear to explain the debt, and you know how to resolve it, and things like that.

121  
0:14:55  
Emily  
Okay. Great and was there anything that could have been made easier with the whole? With with everything, with with the communication, any sort of options.

122  
0:15:10  
P6  
I would say.

123  
0:15:15  
P6  
I don't know, I guess. Probably like before you know.

124  
0:15:19  
P6  
a debt like that happens, you know.

125  
0:15:22  
P6  
there being like some form of

126  
0:15:25  
P6  
explanation or some type of you know something that would tell me like, you know, if you drop a class at this point in time. Then this is what you may owe something something like that.

127  
0:15:38  
Emily  
Yeah.

128  
0:15:40  
Emily  
okay. And then thoughts on how you want to, how you might want to receive, like a communication like that of of letting you know that if you do this step it may lead to deaths.

129  
0:15:56  
P6  
Preferably electronic, like, I think

130  
0:16:00  
P6  
most communication nowadays is electronic versus paper. A lot of times I get paper mail, and it just ends up being junk mail or something like that. So

131  
0:16:14  
P6  
I'll usually.

132  
0:16:16  
P6  
I usually check my emails and things like that before I would, you know, go through paper mail, because usually paper mail ends up just being

133  
0:16:24  
P6  
junk mail and I try to, you know. Make sure. I select

134  
0:16:30  
P6  
electronic options on everything I do, so I can keep up with things. But

135  
0:16:38  
P6  
Sometimes that's not always an option.

136  
0:16:40  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. Got it.

137  
0:16:42  
Emily  
And have you also had any experience with medical copayment through? Va.

138  
0:16:51  
P6  
Yes, that. More recently.

139  
0:16:56  
P6  
Because before I wasn't using the Va because I wasn't aware that, you know, I was able to use the Va

140  
0:17:06  
P6  
so I was. I had my own insurance prior to that through my employer.

141  
0:17:15  
P6  
And I'm so I'm sorry I lost track of what I was saying.

142  
0:17:20  
Emily  
Oh, I I there's just a general what experience you've had with medical co-payments, which sounds like you. Just you just answered, so yeah. And so,

143  
0:17:31  
Emily  
oh, yeah, go ahead.

144  
0:17:33  
P6  
Oh, yeah. So now then, I real. And then I started receiving mail paper mail saying that I had to pay a co-pay. And I'm like, Okay, well, I wasn't aware of that. And you know, at the time I didn't have

145  
0:17:51  
P6  
income at the time. And So

146  
0:17:58  
P6  
then, when they said I had, I had co-pays to pay, then I had to go back. And they said, There's ways you can, basically

147  
0:18:07  
P6  
You.

148  
0:18:14  
Emily  
Stopped again.

149  
0:19:10  
Emily  
Great coming in now.

150  
0:19:39  
Emily  
Hello!

151  
0:19:47  
P6  
Busy. Busy.

152  
0:19:49  
P6  
Hello!

153  
0:19:50  
Emily  
Hello! Alright. Can you hear me? Okay?

154  
0:19:52  
P6  
Yes.

155  
0:19:53  
Emily  
All right. Got it all right. Okay, so you were, you were talking about medical copays. You 1st weren't aware that you could do healthcare through Va. And then you were, and then you received Copay bills. And was that how? How were you receiving? Oh, dropped again.

156  
0:20:37  
Emily  
Hello.

157  
0:20:39  
P6  
Oh, sorry.

158  
0:20:44  
P6  
My Internet connection was fine all morning until it got to around this time.

159  
0:20:49  
Emily  
So sorry. What was that?

160  
0:20:51  
P6  
I say, my Internet connection was fine all morning until it this time.

161  
0:20:56  
Emily  
And so when? Yeah, yeah, that. Well, you know, technology likes to likes to mess with us sometimes. I've certainly certainly had that. Oh, there we go again.

162  
0:21:43  
Emily  
You hear me? Okay.

163  
0:21:45  
P6  
Oh yes!

164  
0:21:46  
Emily  
Alright.

165  
0:21:48  
Emily  
Okay. So with okay, with copays and so how have you been notified? When when you had gotten copays?

166  
0:21:57  
Emily  
Oh, no!

167  
0:22:38  
Emily  
Are you able to hear me? I see a frozen screen on your end.

168  
0:22:43  
P6  
Hello!

169  
0:22:46  
Emily  
I heard a little bit, but not much just now.

170  
0:23:53  
Emily  
Shannon, any thoughts on your end. I'm wondering if it might be better to

171  
0:23:59  
Emily  
cancel just we haven't been able to talk more than like a minute at a time.

172  
0:24:04  
Notetaker  
Unfortunately, at this time, because of the length that they've already been on the call. They're already considered complete.

173  
0:24:11  
Notetaker  
So if you wanna stay on and still get little pieces of information, we can.

174  
0:24:17  
Emily  
Sure. Yeah.

175  
0:24:18  
Notetaker  
So it's really up to you. If we want to just keep letting him get on and then get one question at a time.

176  
0:24:26  
Emily  
Yeah.

177  
0:24:26  
Notetaker  
That'd be good to have him not turn on his camera, because when he hasn't turned on his camera he's been on longer.

178  
0:24:33  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah, I I think you're right there. Yeah, I I'm gonna

179  
0:24:39  
Emily  
share my screen to have him so that he's not also sharing his screen, and hopefully, that will help things.

180  
0:24:47  
Notetaker  
I was gonna suggest that as well.

181  
0:24:50  
Emily  
Yes, yes, you've read my mind. If he's a okay, he's admitting, admit him back again.

182  
0:24:57  
Emily  
Just need to log on to zoom on my phone.

183  
0:25:42  
Emily  
Are you able to hear me yet?

184  
0:25:56  
Emily  
If you're able to turn off your camera? That might

185  
0:26:01  
Emily  
might help a little bit if you're able to do that.

186  
0:26:06  
P6  
Oh, I'm sorry I missed that.

187  
0:26:08  
Emily  
Oh, say, well, it it looks like your camera's off. But just in case it's not off. Yeah, why don't you go ahead and turn off your camera, and hopefully, that will make things a little better.

188  
0:26:19  
P6  
I hope so.

189  
0:26:20  
Emily  
Yeah, I know.

190  
0:26:26  
Emily  
If you keep on a little longer I'll wait till that is off.

191  
0:27:10  
Emily  
It looks like you're back on. I'm not seeing is your? Is your camera off now? Just wanna make sure.

192  
0:27:18  
P6  
Yes.

193  
0:27:18  
Emily  
Okay, great. Alright. So we'll keep that off.

194  
0:27:22  
Emily  
And hopefully, it'll work to keep that a little longer. Hopefully, technology will will work in our favor a little bit.

195  
0:27:31  
Emily  
so the I do want to. I don't think I heard an answer, or maybe it was when you would logged off but for the co-pay bills. How had you know, or how? How were you

196  
0:27:46  
Emily  
told that you that you had these to pay.

197  
0:27:50  
P6  
I received a letter in the mail.

198  
0:27:55  
Emily  
Okay.

199  
0:27:57  
P6  
And once I saw the letter. It kind of explained the same way

200  
0:28:04  
P6  
as the the other deck did as far as how to go about.

201  
0:28:11  
P6  
You know, taking care of that debt.

202  
0:28:16  
P6  
And it also had, like an option that that if I had like financial difficulty, or something that like that

203  
0:28:24  
P6  
that I could use that as well.

204  
0:28:27  
P6  
Okay.

205  
0:28:29  
P6  
In addition to that, they were going by my, like, my previous year's income, or something like that.

206  
0:28:39  
P6  
So they didn't have like an updated like financial.

207  
0:28:44  
P6  
I guess updated financial information.

208  
0:28:48  
Emily  
Okay.

209  
0:29:14  
Emily  
Alright. Looks like you're back. Let me know if you can hear me.

210  
0:29:17  
P6  
Oh yes!

211  
0:29:18  
Emily  
Okay? Great. Yeah. So last year that it turned out they didn't have your updated income information. And that. And that's that's when I lost you.

212  
0:29:29  
P6  
Right? So I could submit like a new financial, new financial information or updated financial information.

213  
0:29:39  
P6  
And then that way.

214  
0:29:43  
P6  
I could clear the debt that way as well, because they would have updated information. So I wouldn't be

215  
0:29:49  
P6  
required to pay the co-pay based off of my new financial information.

216  
0:29:54  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay, got it? And then any thoughts on how that whole process, specifically regarding the co-pays, might have been made any easier for you.

217  
0:30:12  
P6  
I guess.

218  
0:30:14  
P6  
I mean it was pretty laid out, and everything. Again. It's 1 of those things you don't know until you know the situation happens that

219  
0:30:24  
P6  
you're gonna I will copay. So I mean, if there was something ahead of time like saying.

220  
0:30:31  
P6  
You know, when you visit. Va

221  
0:30:36  
P6  
kind of like knowing ahead of time what to expect.

222  
0:30:43  
P6  
actually visiting a gang hadn't been before, so there was like something

223  
0:30:49  
P6  
some type of. I don't know

224  
0:30:54  
P6  
something ahead of time that can to explain to you how the the process works. Once you start using the Va hospital system.

225  
0:31:03  
P6  
That would have been helpful.

226  
0:31:06  
Emily  
Okay, makes sense.

227  
0:31:09  
Emily  
Okay? So I'm I'm gonna switch things around. I, originally was, gonna have you share your screen. But looking at what technology is doing? I'm actually gonna share my screen. So it's gonna be a little bit different. I'm gonna have you look at a prototype from my phone. So give me just a moment. I've been setting things up screen

228  
0:31:34  
Emily  
oops.

229  
0:31:46  
Emily  
Alright. So here is my screen here, and give me just a moment.

230  
0:31:53  
Emily  
Alright! Are you able to see a pretend app on your phone? Now?

231  
0:32:09  
Emily  
I want I wasn't able to hear. And are you? Are you? Are you able to see the the pretend app on your phone now.

232  
0:32:16  
P6  
Yes!

233  
0:32:17  
Emily  
Okay. Great. Okay, so I'm not. This is only gonna be you looking and and talking out loud. Since this won't be anything that you're actually using. So this is the your pretend va app here? So if you may look familiar, since I know you said you you did have the Va app

234  
0:32:40  
Emily  
But if you were going here first, st where be? Where would you expect to find

235  
0:32:50  
Emily  
Oh, we just lost him again

236  
0:32:55  
Emily  
back.

237  
0:33:05  
Emily  
Okay, are you able to hear me now?

238  
0:33:07  
P6  
Yes.

239  
0:33:08  
Emily  
Great. Okay? So, looking at this this pretend app, where would you expect to find information on like medical copays and overpayments if you were looking here.

240  
0:33:22  
P6  
I would say the bottom right where it says payments.

241  
0:33:27  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

242  
0:33:29  
Emily  
And is there any way that that could? Obviously you went straight there? But thoughts on the title of that, it being named payment would be there be anything else that might be more clear.

243  
0:33:50  
P6  
I mean payment works, but

244  
0:33:58  
P6  
maybe something different if it because it's

245  
0:34:02  
P6  
more so geared towards, you know. The I'm guessing overpayments, or something like that.

246  
0:34:13  
P6  
So maybe I'm not sure.

247  
0:34:17  
Emily  
Okay? Good. Alright. So since, yeah, that's fine. So I'm gonna tap into payments there since you mentioned that and so this is actually the I'll just scroll down. But this is this is the whole, the whole thing right here. And then thoughts on what you are looking at in terms of clarity on what you're seeing.

248  
0:34:46  
P6  
Think I'm waiting for the next you.

249  
0:35:17  
Emily  
Okay? So yeah, so thoughts on on what you're seeing. So this is me tapping into payments. Just like you expected thoughts thoughts on what you're seeing here, knowing that you've got

250  
0:35:31  
Emily  
both copays and overpayments.

251  
0:35:36  
P6  
Okay? Yeah. Now I see it this way. It makes

252  
0:35:41  
P6  
more. Says that. Why, it says payments. Because it's you know payment

253  
0:35:50  
P6  
to a person, and also anything that they may always will be payments that back to the Va or due to the Va.

254  
0:36:01  
P6  
okay, yeah.

255  
0:36:02  
P6  
It makes more sense. Now.

256  
0:36:04  
Emily  
Oh, okay, got it since you said it makes more sense now. What could have made it even easier before?

257  
0:37:33  
Emily  
Okay, you able to hear me now.

258  
0:37:37  
P6  
Yes.

259  
0:37:38  
Emily  
So yeah, if if there, let's know any any thoughts since you said it, it makes sense. Now that you're here, that that label of payments. If there's anything that could have made it even more clear.

260  
0:37:56  
P6  
I don't know. Maybe a a

261  
0:38:00  
P6  
instead of the title being payment, something like.

262  
0:39:38  
Emily  
You. You're kind of just you're about to tell me any ideas you had for a different name for this section that is, payments.

263  
0:39:49  
P6  
I would say. Probably I would use maybe financials or something like that. Purchase payments.

264  
0:40:01  
Emily  
Okay.

265  
0:40:05  
P6  
Yeah.

266  
0:40:06  
Emily  
Yeah, no, that's great. Thank you. Okay. So now, I'm gonna

267  
0:40:11  
Emily  
Go into the overpayments here. So I'm going to tap into overpayment debts. Here, we're gonna get to this section. So thoughts on the clarity of what you're seeing here.

268  
0:40:28  
Emily  
Scroll down just a little bit

269  
0:40:32  
Emily  
really on on like what information you would want to know for each of these debts, that in this pretend situation you owe.

270  
0:40:51  
P6  
Don't see that screen yet.

271  
0:40:53  
Emily  
Oh, okay, and I will wait.

272  
0:40:58  
Emily  
What what are you seeing now? Is it blank or something?

273  
0:41:02  
P6  
No, it's just. It's still in the payments screen.

274  
0:41:07  
P6  
with payments to you and your Va. Debt and bills.

275  
0:41:11  
Emily  
Oh, interesting! It's a little little slow to catch up, all right.

276  
0:41:17  
Emily  
See? I'm actually gonna jump ahead.

277  
0:41:20  
Emily  
Let me know when you so I've just switched it to a screen that says, dropped again.

278  
0:41:37  
Notetaker  
You might want to switch back to the other screen. So when he jumps on he sees that previous screen first.st

279  
0:41:43  
Emily  
Yeah, it's a good one.

280  
0:41:45  
Emily  
Thank you.

281  
0:42:01  
Emily  
Be coming back in

282  
0:43:06  
Emily  
bidding again.

283  
0:43:15  
Emily  
Keeps dropping after I hit, admit. Unfortunately.

284  
0:43:35  
Emily  
Okay, let me know what are you seeing on screen right now? What page.

285  
0:43:45  
P6  
Still loading right now.

286  
0:43:47  
Emily  
Loading all right.

287  
0:44:01  
P6  
No.

288  
0:44:02  
Emily  
Is it like a little the little spinning wheel sort of thing.

289  
0:44:06  
P6  
Yeah.

290  
0:44:08  
Emily  
Okay, gotta love that one. I've experienced that plenty. Of course

291  
0:44:14  
Emily  
I'll I'll just wait till it it. It show the the screen itself shows up on your end. Then I just had

292  
0:44:21  
Emily  
couple other questions.

293  
0:44:50  
P6  
Now, I'm sure, for the rest of the day I won't have any other problems.

294  
0:44:53  
Emily  
I know right.

295  
0:44:55  
P6  
Smooth.

296  
0:44:56  
Emily  
After that, just not the 1 h really trying to right.

297  
0:45:01  
Emily  
That's always the way I know.

298  
0:45:06  
Emily  
So is it? Is it? Still thinking about showing you an image.

299  
0:45:11  
P6  
Yeah.

300  
0:45:12  
Emily  
Okay. Well, let me. I'll just ask a couple of questions while that is going. If we get to it cool. If not, that is totally fine. When so I know you said when you had received the letter for the overpayment, the benefit overpayment lost again.

301  
0:46:00  
Emily  
Not if it'll help, but I'm gonna attempt to

302  
0:46:04  
Emily  
stop sharing on my end. I wonder

303  
0:46:11  
Emily  
if he gets back on? I'll try sharing again

304  
0:46:15  
Emily  
when in doubt restart things. That's how I the only way I know how to fix things

305  
0:46:27  
Emily  
coming in again.

306  
0:46:57  
Emily  
All right. I stopped my screen. Share my my hope is that

307  
0:47:02  
Emily  
maybe I'll try again. See if it works. Are you able to hear me and see my video first? st

308  
0:47:08  
P6  
I can hear you.

309  
0:47:10  
Emily  
Okay, but it's not showing any any video at all.

310  
0:47:16  
P6  
No.

311  
0:47:17  
Emily  
Okay, all right, then we'll just. We'll just skip that. I'll ask. Ask a couple more questions. So I know you said when you received the letter for the benefit overpayment? And it there were options listed.

312  
0:47:32  
Emily  
I think you said like for general help. If you need help, repay payment plan things like that. Do you recall when you 1st started getting the bills for Copays? Was there something similar for options in case you're not able to pay, and things like that.

313  
0:47:50  
P6  
Yes, there was

314  
0:47:52  
P6  
It had like

315  
0:47:54  
P6  
similar options. As far as you know, ways. I could resolve the debt. I could just pay pay the bill or make payments, or I could dispute it

316  
0:48:06  
P6  
and then the other thing about the financial my own financial

317  
0:48:14  
P6  
situation as far as what they were going off versus what my actual current

318  
0:48:21  
P6  
financial situation was at the time.

319  
0:48:26  
Emily  
And was that so? I know you said you learned that they had outdated information. Did you know that from those 1st letters about the Copay bills? Or did that come later? That discovery.

320  
0:48:39  
P6  
Oh!

321  
0:49:11  
Emily  
Yeah, they add, I'm not sure if when you cut out but at least I the last question I'd asked was

322  
0:49:18  
Emily  
when when it when you discovered that they had outdated information for your income was that at this did you learn that at the same time that you were 1st receiving these Copay bills? Or did that come later?

323  
0:49:32  
P6  
I believe that came later with me kind of like putting

324  
0:49:36  
P6  
putting different pieces together. And then I kinda like.

325  
0:49:42  
P6  
realize that later. That they were going by like you know what I was

326  
0:49:49  
P6  
previously making like the previous year, or whatever

327  
0:49:53  
P6  
so kind of like, went back and like, Hey.

328  
0:49:56  
P6  
thinking like, Oh, this isn't right. Financial information.

329  
0:50:03  
P6  
and then I had to go dig a little bit more to find out that you could submit a new financial

330  
0:50:10  
P6  
I guess, like a financial report of what you're making, and then that will better reflect of. You know my current situation.

331  
0:50:18  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. Got it

332  
0:50:20  
Emily  
under the when you discover was that was that over over the phone. I forget how you how you made that discovery.

333  
0:50:29  
P6  
That was through the website, kind of like.

334  
0:50:35  
P6  
just piecing different pieces together from what I got received.

335  
0:50:40  
Emily  
Hmm.

336  
0:51:09  
P6  
Oh!

337  
0:51:12  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah.

338  
0:51:13  
Emily  
I last heard you were, you were piecing together the information with things you found on the website was that I want to make sure I got that right.

339  
0:51:22  
P6  
Yes, so basically, like when I was when it was basically showing, telling me from the letter how I could.

340  
0:51:29  
P6  
you know

341  
0:51:32  
P6  
dispute the debt or something like that. Then I learned that they go off like financial information. And so then from there, I kinda like.

342  
0:51:42  
P6  
learn that you can actually update your financial information

343  
0:51:49  
P6  
through another part of the website.

344  
0:51:52  
P6  
And then by updating that, I kind of figured out like, when I update this, then I can dispute it better because my information will be updated. Financial will be updated.

345  
0:52:05  
Emily  
Okay. So so then you would, you would update it all.

346  
0:52:13  
P6  
Yes.

347  
0:52:14  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And is that something? So I know you said you were on the website. Is that? Oh, lost again.

348  
0:52:28  
Emily  
I go ask the one more question I was about to ask, and then wrap up, because it's only it's about 3 of here it comes

349  
0:52:48  
Emily  
alright.

350  
0:52:50  
Emily  
Okay. So you said you had. You had updated things on the website. And is that so that that financial update since we talked about, you wanted to have more things in the app. Is that something you would have wanted to do in the app.

351  
0:53:09  
P6  
That would definitely be beneficial.

352  
0:53:12  
Emily  
Okay.

353  
0:53:43  
Emily  
okay, so last year, did, it would be beneficial to have that app of updating your financial information. I'd love to know why, why you would you you would have preferred to do it in the app, or you would have liked to do it in the app.

354  
0:53:59  
P6  
Just because, like

355  
0:54:04  
P6  
hopefully, it would be tied into that, you know, payments or whatever section you want to call it that way. You kinda

356  
0:54:13  
P6  
know, ahead of time that you know that

357  
0:54:16  
P6  
all that stuff is kind of like tied together. All that goes together is as one piece how they're determining your copayments based off your you know your whatever, your fine, your own financial information, as far as your income and things like that.

358  
0:54:37  
P6  
That way. I don't have to go

359  
0:54:40  
P6  
kind of like searching around myself and figuring it out by myself is kind of like

360  
0:54:45  
P6  
it will be laid out together.

361  
0:54:47  
Emily  
Okay, so everything together. Okay, got it great. Well, we are at time. And Nope logged out again.

362  
0:54:54  
Emily  
I want to say goodbye, and then we'll wrap up hopefully. He comes back.

363  
0:55:15  
Emily  
You able to hear me yet.

364  
0:55:17  
P6  
Yes.

365  
0:55:18  
Emily  
I was about to wrapping up. But yeah, I really appreciate you taking the time. I'm sorry technology was not was not working in our favor today. But like you said, it'll probably work great for the rest of the day, but we certainly got got some good information. It's always good to talk with our veterans. Just to understand experiences and what works and what does not work. So I appreciate you taking the time. And I hope you have a great rest of your day.

366  
0:55:46  
P6  
Thank you. And I'm so sorry about my my technology. And I hope you all have a great rest of your day as well.

367  
0:55:55  
Emily  
Great. Thank you. Take care!

368  
0:55:57  
P6  
Thank you.
