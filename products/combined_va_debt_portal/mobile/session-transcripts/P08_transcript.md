Emily  
That. So

2  
0:00:02  
Emily  
progress. So again, can, I'd like to confirm, are you okay? If I record the audio and video video as we talk today.

3  
0:00:11  
P8  
Yes.

4  
0:00:12  
Emily  
Okay, great. And are you okay? If we potentially show some clips from this session to our Va partners.

5  
0:00:20  
P8  
Yeah.

6  
0:00:21  
Emily  
Okay, great. Okay. So now we'll get into the conversation. So I'd love to know a little bit about you as a veteran, whatever you're comfortable sharing with, of course, such things as what branch you served in when you retired or separated.

7  
0:00:38  
P8  
Okay. My name is [redacted]. I was in the [redacted] from [redacted] of 2,001 up until 2,013 did [redacted]

8  
0:00:50  
P8  
okay, that's it.

9  
0:00:52  
Emily  
Okay, great

10  
0:00:53  
Emily  
and then let to know any sort of experience you have had with veteran affairs just pretty high level to see how sort of interactions you've had with with the organization.

11  
0:01:06  
P8  
I've used my gi bill with them, and then I've also I have my

12  
0:01:14  
P8  
compensation. But I'm disabled. So I get my service connected disability through the Va.

13  
0:01:20  
P8  
And then also I go to the [redacted] Va. Medical Center for all my calls, everything.

14  
0:01:27  
Emily  
Over healthcare. Okay? Got it?

15  
0:01:29  
Emily  
And then talk to me about how much you are using or not. The Va website and or the mobile app.

16  
0:01:39  
P8  
Never really used the mobile app I've logged in a couple of times, but never really found use for it. I've used the website especially, for, like refill my prescriptions. Then, also, when I need to contact one of my providers, I do this. Your messaging like, I need to refill one of my prescriptions. It's easier than calling and going through

17  
0:01:59  
P8  
the operator and waiting in call center forever. And then also, for, like filling out my gi Bill did that through. Va. Of course, the E-benefits portal that used to be. I think it's all under login.gov. Now.

18  
0:02:15  
Emily  
-

19  
0:02:15  
P8  
Have quite a bit of experience with it. I've probably been there about

20  
0:02:19  
P8  
once or twice a month to refill prescriptions or schedule appointments, and do all that for my medical.

21  
0:02:26  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay? And then you said you had. You had tried to use the mobile app. What what made you stop, or what like. What might you have been looking for that you weren't finding there.

22  
0:02:37  
P8  
I just rarely use my phone for Internet and everything. So it wasn't really if I'm only using going to the website a couple of times a month. There's no real reason to download it now.

23  
0:02:49  
Emily  
Got it.

24  
0:02:50  
P8  
The that on my phone, for never be used really.

25  
0:02:55  
Emily  
Okay, good. Okay. So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion. So I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have no additional information about any sort of financial, really anything in regards to the Va. So this is as anonymous as you would like it, so can I have you tell me

26  
0:03:17  
Emily  
if you have had experience with owing the Va. Any money, and then, if if again, if you're comfortable if you, if you could tell me about any experience you might have had.

27  
0:03:28  
P8  
Yeah, I've had several times. It's happened. There's been

28  
0:03:32  
P8  
overpayments on like for my gi bill, because.

29  
0:03:39  
Emily  
Okay.

30  
0:03:40  
P8  
They send out a check early. So this overpaid. It was like [redacted] bucks that I still owed to the

31  
0:03:47  
P8  
for that overpayment. That's really where I've gotten into trouble before is just with dropping class, and it not catching up in the system quick enough.

32  
0:03:55  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay.

33  
0:03:56  
P8  
You know we're paying for.

34  
0:03:57  
Emily  
Sure.

35  
0:03:58  
Emily  
And do you recall how you've been notified? Of the of these various situations.

36  
0:04:06  
P8  
Let's see, I've always received a letter on the regular mail.

37  
0:04:12  
Emily  
Okay, and then thoughts are sorry. Sorry. Skip ahead there. What's been your method for any sort of payment that that you've made for some of these past debts.

38  
0:04:26  
P8  
I just let it come out of my next. Whatever's coming next month.

39  
0:04:30  
Emily  
Okay, great. And was there anything that you feel could have been made easier from the Va. With that, either with with communication or or anything else in regards to these debts.

40  
0:04:46  
P8  
Not really. I mean, I guess the fact that I was only notified via mail. So.

41  
0:04:53  
P8  
I guess that's 1 thing. Maybe if they send me an email, it'd be a little bit better

42  
0:04:59  
P8  
snail mail works. I mean, I was notified about that.

43  
0:05:02  
P8  
At least I didn't just all of a sudden see a surprise coming in my next call and

44  
0:05:07  
P8  
just disappearing, or something like that. So.

45  
0:05:10  
Emily  
That's a good.

46  
0:05:12  
P8  
Okay, go ahead.

47  
0:05:12  
P8  
Maybe send me an email. I don't know what else I could really do.

48  
0:05:17  
Emily  
Okay, you would. You would prefer an email, or you would also want an email.

49  
0:05:24  
Emily  
And then any I know you mentioned that. You? You have at least some health care. Do you have experience with medical co-payments through Va.

50  
0:05:35  
P8  
No, I've always been service connected, so I've never had to do.

51  
0:05:40  
Emily  
Okay, great

52  
0:05:43  
Emily  
so let me have. I'm gonna we're gonna move into the prototype section. Here, let me have you share your screen and let me know if you need any help walking you through that process.

53  
0:05:55  
P8  
Do I do that?

54  
0:05:59  
P8  
So it should just.

55  
0:06:00  
Emily  
Yep, yeah. You should be able to tap once, and at the bottom there should be a share button. It's usually labeled with the word share, I believe.

56  
0:06:34  
Emily  
all right, and we're working. I love it all right. So now we're gonna leave this as is. Now let me have you open up the figma app that you've had downloaded

57  
0:06:50  
Emily  
all right and tap the log into figma. I'm going to give you some test credentials here.

58  
0:07:00  
Emily  
Okay, so the email is [redacted]

59  
0:07:10  
Emily  
[redacted]

60  
0:07:16  
Emily  
[redacted]

61  
0:07:27  
Emily  
okay? And the password, it's going to be the letters. No, we're not going to create anything, and then the password is going to be [redacted]

62  
0:07:43  
Emily  
Alright. Go ahead and log in. And then that's gonna prompt. A.

63  
0:07:47  
Emily  
yeah. Give me, okay, I'm going to give you the authentication code, which is 5, 9, 9,

64  
0:07:57  
Emily  
8, 6, 6, 8.

65  
0:08:03  
Emily  
Alright. Go ahead and log in and continue with mobile app.

66  
0:08:12  
Emily  
What's that is

67  
0:08:13  
Emily  
up alright? Just you can tap out of that. Okay? So now I'm gonna send you a link. I'm gonna send it within the zoom chat. And okay, if you open up zoom again, you should have a chat or sorry a link there.

68  
0:08:30  
Emily  
Yep, go and tap on that, please.

69  
0:08:40  
Emily  
Alright. This is loading. Give it just a moment to come through.

70  
0:08:47  
Emily  
All right. So here we have your fake app, home screen?

71  
0:08:53  
Emily  
So if you if you could, yeah, there we go. I was. Gonna say, clear that message perfect. So first, st I'm not going to have you tap on anything quite yet, but pretending you are opening the mobile app here. Where would you expect to find any information from money that you owe, for example, from an overpayment.

72  
0:09:16  
P8  
Maybe in Claims

73  
0:09:18  
Emily  
On the claim. Okay? Good. Any claims, any any other questions?

74  
0:09:22  
Emily  
I'm, sorry.

75  
0:09:23  
P8  
In the bottom, under, maybe in the bottom, under benefits or payments.

76  
0:09:28  
Emily  
Okay, okay. Got it?

77  
0:09:31  
Emily  
Any other? Oh, yeah, any any other thoughts you have where you might find it.

78  
0:09:38  
P8  
Maybe it's maybe in the latest payment, but.

79  
0:09:45  
Emily  
In what time.

80  
0:09:49  
P8  
I was thinking, maybe under the see details.

81  
0:09:52  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

82  
0:09:52  
P8  
That's David.

83  
0:09:56  
Emily  
Okay. So since you mentioned both the benefits and payment sections on the bottom, we will find it under payments. And I'm wondering any thoughts you might have for making that even more clear. That that's where you might find that information.

84  
0:10:17  
P8  
No with it, just saying payments alone. It's

85  
0:10:21  
P8  
kind of making me think about what they paid me, and it's only showing like what's been sent to me, but

86  
0:10:28  
P8  
I don't know. It makes sense. I don't. I don't have any suggestions as to making it really much clearer.

87  
0:10:35  
P8  
It's 1 of those things where you just gotta explore around and find your way.

88  
0:10:39  
Emily  
Sure. Sure. Yeah. Okay, so let me have you tap into that payment section

89  
0:10:46  
Emily  
and then over before you can scroll around. But don't yet tap on anything, thoughts on how this is structured, especially knowing the title of payments, and what might make more sense if anything.

90  
0:11:02  
P8  
So this is actually pretty clear, and you got your payments. And then history 1,000 information.

91  
0:11:10  
P8  
This is pretty clear and simple. I like this.

92  
0:11:14  
Emily  
Got it

93  
0:11:15  
Emily  
and talk to me about the. So in this case we're going to pretend that you do have copays in this in this pretend world. But talk to me about the the brief information that is below both the words overpayment debts and copays. What sort of high level information might you want from this page.

94  
0:11:37  
P8  
I think just telling you like, how much is gonna be due, how much you owe.

95  
0:11:42  
P8  
And maybe there's like a deadline on when we need to pay it.

96  
0:11:49  
Emily  
Okay. Deadline. Go.

97  
0:11:49  
P8  
Really does deadlines. I'm not sure about that. So.

98  
0:11:53  
Emily  
Okay.

99  
0:11:55  
Emily  
Alright oh, sorry. Go ahead.

100  
0:11:58  
P8  
Good.

101  
0:11:59  
P8  
This seems pretty good and clear.

102  
0:12:01  
Emily  
Okay, got it. Alright, as as I said, the only other thing you might want to know is, is any deadline right here?

103  
0:12:10  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you so I'm gonna have you tap into the the overpayments to get your thoughts on how clear it is on overall, what you currently owe in this pretend situation.

104  
0:12:26  
Emily  
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. It hit it payments again. I think that was is the

105  
0:12:31  
Emily  
copays. I'm going to get you to the overpayments.

106  
0:12:34  
P8  
Yeah. There, the over tenants.

107  
0:12:37  
Emily  
Yep.

108  
0:12:39  
P8  
Okay.

109  
0:12:41  
Emily  
Yeah, there you go. Perfect. Yeah. So, looking at the information here, how how clear is it for how much you are currently owing in this pretend situation?

110  
0:12:56  
P8  
Yeah, real clear, because it directly says your current balance. So

111  
0:13:05  
P8  
yeah, that's really clear.

112  
0:13:06  
Emily  
Okay. Any other information you would want to have on this page for seeing the overall, what the different debts are.

113  
0:13:17  
P8  
No, I don't know how you make.

114  
0:13:19  
P8  
There'd be more information.

115  
0:13:23  
Emily  
Alright got it so we're just gonna look at the the top one, the post 9 11 Gi. Bill for housing and if you want to tap into that let me know what information would be important to you in regards to for this particular debt, just just for this topic. Yeah, there we go.

116  
0:13:44  
P8  
Okay, here you do have a few days. That's

117  
0:13:48  
P8  
yeah. Your balance in your due date is the most important for you in your transaction history.

118  
0:13:57  
P8  
Oh, and it gives you like. I didn't know you get like keys in the game.

119  
0:14:01  
P8  
It's good information.

120  
0:14:10  
P8  
Oh, okay, yeah, that give you your letter. History.

121  
0:14:13  
Emily  
It's pretty.

122  
0:14:15  
P8  
Pretty, thorough.

123  
0:14:18  
Emily  
Okay? Since you mentioned the the letter history. What? How? How useful is that to you? What what would you be using that for?

124  
0:14:29  
P8  
I'll just remember it just reminded me of how they always notify me through letters, but.

125  
0:14:33  
Emily  
Hmm.

126  
0:14:34  
P8  
I know there's like a timeframe of when somebody get the letter that you have like 90 days, I think it is before where you can appeal it. So, just remembering that you have that timeframe is, or if you were to know that that deadline is there.

127  
0:14:51  
Emily  
Okay.

128  
0:14:52  
P8  
You know which date to go by for that.

129  
0:14:56  
Emily  
Okay, would there be? So as I said, like knowing the date is important. Anything else in regards to the debt letter that you might want to know here.

130  
0:15:04  
P8  
Now the most important thing is the date.

131  
0:15:06  
Emily  
Okay, just the dates. Got it. And then

132  
0:15:12  
Emily  
what? Yeah. And any other information that might be useful for you here for this particular debt.

133  
0:15:20  
P8  
See

134  
0:15:24  
P8  
maybe from when it was you actually like it, says the post. 9 11 Gi. Depth for housing, but it doesn't say for like which month that housing was either an overpayment

135  
0:15:37  
P8  
or like for why it occurred, I mean

136  
0:15:40  
P8  
oh, there's actually right there, I see. Why might I have some more information.

137  
0:15:47  
Emily  
Okay, do you want? You want to tap on that and just see if if that would would be sufficient.

138  
0:15:53  
P8  
Any common reasons to actually have the reason would be helpful to know

139  
0:15:58  
P8  
well, why are you being charged this money for that month? But.

140  
0:16:03  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

141  
0:16:06  
Emily  
So so you, you would want additional information. It sounds like.

142  
0:16:16  
Emily  
would there? Would. Would there be more information? You would want.

143  
0:16:20  
P8  
Yeah, which like for basically, which month I got, I'm being charged for.

144  
0:16:27  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.

145  
0:16:28  
P8  
That payment? Or if it's like, even when you go to like Co payments, what off? What appointment am I being charged that copayment for stuff like that that is usually found in the

146  
0:16:39  
P8  
the letters that they send out to.

147  
0:16:46  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And then so additional information it sounds like. And then what else would you expect or want to be able to do from here in regard to this particular debt.

148  
0:17:02  
P8  
Nothing under here, I think, besides that, it's pretty good.

149  
0:17:05  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And pretending that this is built in real life. And again, we'll kind of suspend relief because I believe belief, because I know you said you don't. You aren't currently using the app. But thoughts on, how likely you would use this

150  
0:17:25  
Emily  
if it were were actually.

151  
0:17:26  
P8  
No problem.

152  
0:17:27  
P8  
Still, probably do it online, just through my computer, because I'm so used to doing it that way. There's

153  
0:17:33  
P8  
no real need to change over, to now.

154  
0:17:38  
P8  
But if I didn't have a computer, of course this would make a lot easier.

155  
0:17:43  
Emily  
Sure. Yeah, sure got it. Okay? And

156  
0:17:48  
Emily  
so I know you said that for the debts you've had, it's it's been. It's been taken out of your your benefits. How about if if let's say you had a debt where you you were actually making financial payments to the Va.

157  
0:18:06  
P8  
I would like to know? Basically, like.

158  
0:18:09  
P8  
when my payments do, what are the charges? I'm late on that payment. What happens if we miss a payment? Is there

159  
0:18:17  
P8  
the Grace period, or anything like that?

160  
0:18:20  
P8  
And then maybe, like, if I'm

161  
0:18:23  
P8  
if I can set up in the automated automatic

162  
0:18:27  
P8  
charge to my card to make those payments stuff like that.

163  
0:18:31  
P8  
Okay? Got it helpful.

164  
0:18:35  
Emily  
And then if you so since you talked, you talked about the being able to set up payments from your card, etc, knowing that you're that you're not seeing that here thoughts on again. How how likely it would be that that you would that you would use it.

165  
0:18:55  
P8  
If it was, depends on if it was something that I can only do on the app, or if it's also available.

166  
0:19:03  
P8  
like, if it's available online. I'm gonna do it, too.

167  
0:19:08  
Emily  
Okay, so just depending, if you can do it on on your computer as well.

168  
0:19:13  
Emily  
Okay. Alright, let me have you tap the the payments button on the lower right again. I'm gonna get you to a different section.

169  
0:19:22  
Emily  
Alright scroll all the way down, and the the blank gray area toward the bottom. Tap that area once

170  
0:19:32  
Emily  
all right perfect, and then go back into overpayment debts.

171  
0:19:39  
Emily  
Okay? So again, we're going to look at this, this top debt from housing. We're going to pretend that

172  
0:19:49  
Emily  
you believe that this debt is in error. You don't actually, either you don't think it should be this amount, or you don't think it should be there at all. What would be your next steps.

173  
0:20:04  
P8  
I'd be probably going under review details.

174  
0:20:08  
Emily  
Okay.

175  
0:20:10  
P8  
Do you want me to click it?

176  
0:20:11  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you can go and tap in just to see what? Yeah, find the information here. And

177  
0:20:16  
Emily  
if this will be sufficient.

178  
0:20:26  
P8  
That's again. It doesn't give you the information. Why.

179  
0:20:31  
P8  
oh, from like what month it was from so.

180  
0:20:34  
Emily  
Okay. Yep.

181  
0:20:35  
P8  
That'd be nice to have to clarify, while why I have to pay.

182  
0:20:41  
Emily  
Sure.

183  
0:20:46  
Emily  
And then thought, thoughts on what you do. If you believed that this was somehow in error, what what? Your next step would be.

184  
0:20:55  
P8  
Ouch!

185  
0:20:56  
P8  
Maybe you resolve that, but it's kind of request

186  
0:21:01  
P8  
Oh, it's really not that clear on what you can do when you're here.

187  
0:21:06  
Emily  
Okay, what do you think would make it more clear?

188  
0:21:12  
P8  
Under the Request Help I see "dispute this debt." Having this on the main portion.

189  
0:21:18  
P8  
The main portion after you click on it.

190  
0:21:22  
Emily  
Oh, you mean like where it says, result.

191  
0:21:26  
P8  
Yeah, under having underneath that, having an option for dispute, that'd be.

192  
0:21:30  
Emily  
Got it. Okay to have it separate. Okay, alright. And then

193  
0:21:37  
Emily  
and and same same question like, if let's say you, you were actually making payments, but didn't believed you didn't have the money

194  
0:21:46  
Emily  
thoughts on on your next steps for that in in terms of

195  
0:21:51  
Emily  
seeing if there could be other other arrangements for payment.

196  
0:21:57  
P8  
Probably would be under resolve other ways to pay.

197  
0:22:01  
Emily  
Okay.

198  
0:22:05  
P8  
Oh, just pay by phone, pay by name, didn't really answer that. So

199  
0:22:12  
P8  
know really what you can do besides calling and contacting them.

200  
0:22:19  
P8  
So maybe if you have, like, an actual options

201  
0:22:25  
P8  
under the resolved debt of John, help pain or request help

202  
0:22:31  
P8  
in paying that, or something like that, I don't know if you don't have the money. What are you supposed to do.

203  
0:22:37  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, yeah. Let me have you actually tap back into that resolved debt section that you were just there? Yeah. And then tap on the request help?

204  
0:22:52  
Emily  
See? You?

205  
0:22:54  
Emily  
Yeah. And and okay, yeah.

206  
0:22:55  
Emily  
any thoughts on on how to make that clear? Since it seems like it was, it was not clear that that's where you might go to get this information.

207  
0:23:07  
P8  
Springing the debt row

208  
0:23:11  
P8  
into here, and it says, request that kind of gives you makes you think that it's like

209  
0:23:17  
P8  
asking for help in using the app itself, requesting help with the payment.

210  
0:23:26  
Emily  
Got it? Okay? Alright. So.

211  
0:23:28  
P8  
Moving it to the front wouldn't help.

212  
0:23:33  
Emily  
Alright, and then once, if you can tap the the request, help once more thoughts on the different sections that that, it's offering, under request, help in in terms of clarity.

213  
0:23:52  
P8  
Dispute is the what we were talking about earlier.

214  
0:23:57  
P8  
Oh, this is clear and simple. I like this.

215  
0:24:03  
Emily  
Okay, got it

216  
0:24:04  
Emily  
and let me have you scroll down. Just tap on. I think it was the second one under the start. Your debt dispute.

217  
0:24:14  
Emily  
Just have a curious to get your thoughts on that.

218  
0:24:20  
Emily  
I'm sorry. Start your request for debt help. Sorry I misspoke.

219  
0:24:25  
Emily  
Yeah. And just I'm not gonna have you read everything, and of course, but have a look through here and give over overall thoughts on the information provided here.

220  
0:24:38  
P8  
That tap. 2 things.

221  
0:24:44  
P8  
What else?

222  
0:24:49  
P8  
We're kind of a starting.

223  
0:24:54  
Emily  
Yeah. Yeah.

224  
0:24:56  
Emily  
Yeah. The the start. Your request for dead help.

225  
0:25:08  
Emily  
Yeah. Tha thoughts on the information.

226  
0:25:11  
Emily  
Please go ahead.

227  
0:25:14  
P8  
Just brings you to the form that you need to fill out.

228  
0:25:18  
P8  
Events.

229  
0:25:20  
P8  
you know, even Pre fills information for you. So that's actually pretty nice and simple, and start your dispute.

230  
0:25:27  
P8  
It's hopeful.

231  
0:25:29  
Emily  
Alright great! Let me have you tap on. Done there, please.

232  
0:25:36  
Emily  
Okay, and then, we're gonna pretend that you are ready to make a payment. Walk me through. How you would do that here.

233  
0:25:54  
P8  
Resolve that.

234  
0:25:56  
Emily  
Okay.

235  
0:25:57  
P8  
Pay online.

236  
0:26:06  
P8  
It looks like this just brings you to Va website, though. So you can't really pay it inside the app. I'm guessing.

237  
0:26:14  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. Yeah. Thoughts. Yeah. Let me let me have you. Again. I will not. I promise I will not have you enter any actual payment information? But go ahead and and tap on the that. That pay button.

238  
0:26:37  
P8  
Okay. So this is basically just bringing back into the Internet site. So

239  
0:26:42  
P8  
it'd be nice to be able to do it through the app itself. Because I guess now, I'm gonna have to log into my

240  
0:26:50  
P8  
log, actually, log into my login.gov account kind of mix to

241  
0:26:57  
P8  
makes it pointless to even use the app. If you have to go online. In the 1st place.

242  
0:27:03  
Emily  
Let me have you tap the the button that says pay online. There's 1 there's there's 1 at the top there, on the upper left.

243  
0:27:13  
Emily  
just to get to the next page.

244  
0:27:17  
Emily  
and then scroll down a little bit again. I know there's a lot to read, so I won't have you read everything, and I'm not going to have you actually enter any information in but scroll down a little bit more.

245  
0:27:29  
Emily  
Yeah. So the so the section where you would have to enter the information here, thoughts on the process here

246  
0:27:39  
Emily  
in terms of if you are actually making a payment.

247  
0:27:45  
P8  
So.

248  
0:27:47  
P8  
It's all of the information that

249  
0:27:49  
P8  
I've never done it before. I didn't know you needed like that

250  
0:27:52  
P8  
payee number and all that. I guess that's on the letter that they send you

251  
0:27:57  
P8  
kind of makes it seem a little bit more complicated than it needs to be.

252  
0:28:01  
Emily  
Oh, got it

253  
0:28:02  
P8  
Just be able to put in your card number on the app and make a payment.

254  
0:28:08  
Emily  
Okay.

255  
0:28:09  
P8  
It's the government. So I guess everything gets complicated.

256  
0:28:15  
Emily  
Got it. Thoughts on. Let's say, if you were to doing this in real life, what would you be doing to find all of the required information that they have here.

257  
0:28:28  
P8  
It's on my letter. That's another good point about what I said in beginning on having an email sent to you.

258  
0:28:35  
P8  
Because what if I had accidentally threw out my letter. I can get that payee number is what they're asking for.

259  
0:28:45  
P8  
The deduction code. I don't even know all that means, but

260  
0:28:50  
P8  
so if I don't have my letter and kind of out of luck.

261  
0:28:53  
Emily  
I see. Okay, yeah. Let me have you switch back to the figma app right now.

262  
0:29:07  
Emily  
See? I mean, oh, okay, let's see if it brings it back to where we were.

263  
0:29:13  
P8  
Probably shouldn't just hit that.

264  
0:29:16  
Emily  
I give it just a moment to load.

265  
0:29:20  
P8  
Okay.

266  
0:29:22  
Emily  
Okay, and then tap on payments to walk you through getting to specifically where we were. Yeah. So go ahead and tap on the payments, button on the lower right.

267  
0:29:33  
Emily  
Yep, and then scroll down and again tap once into that blank gray area at the toward the bottom.

268  
0:29:41  
Emily  
Okay, and then tap on overpayment debts.

269  
0:29:45  
Emily  
It's just getting us back to where you were.

270  
0:29:48  
Emily  
Yep and yeah, again to review details. We're gonna look at that top one again

271  
0:29:58  
Emily  
and resolve debt and go to pay online. This is just getting us back to where you would have been because the prototype kicked us out. Unfortunately, so, thoughts on this information being shared

272  
0:30:15  
Emily  
on the app.

273  
0:30:18  
P8  
Information is.

274  
0:30:20  
P8  
Oh, okay, this is actually helpful. Because on the pay online thing was asking for like that payee number. And then the deduction code

275  
0:30:30  
P8  
that they required a letter having that here makes it

276  
0:30:34  
P8  
see? I don't need to go hunting for my letter to fill it out. So that's nice to have on here.

277  
0:30:40  
Emily  
Okay, great thoughts on how? This could be even more clear in in terms of notifying you that the information is here to pay online.

278  
0:30:55  
P8  
Yeah, I don't know how you make it more clear than listing it out like they do.

279  
0:31:01  
Emily  
okay? And what might if if you were making a payment on the phone what might be your process to getting the information that you that you need into the the government website to pay.

280  
0:31:17  
P8  
Either finding the letter, or if I'm doing on the phone, I can go into this app. And right here, give me all the information I need. It looks like.

281  
0:31:27  
Emily  
Okay? And then thoughts on switching between the apps between. In this case, our fake va app, and then the

282  
0:31:37  
Emily  
payment site.

283  
0:31:40  
P8  
Nice to have it all rather than having to switch between things like that.

284  
0:31:48  
Emily  
If if if it's app, oh, sorry! Go ahead.

285  
0:31:51  
P8  
But I mean, it's

286  
0:31:53  
P8  
it's simple. It's gives you the direct link to click on so can't really make it simpler.

287  
0:32:00  
P8  
more clear than that, I guess. Besides having your own one.

288  
0:32:05  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And if if things were built in real life with like this, this payment process here

289  
0:32:15  
Emily  
again, knowing I know you know you don't actually use the app at least right now. Thoughts on how likely it would be that you might use it for this.

290  
0:32:25  
P8  
And might use it for this. When I, after finding out that you need this information for the payment.

291  
0:32:32  
P8  
I'm not prepared to have to dig around to find the letter I might have throughout the weather efficiently. So

292  
0:32:38  
P8  
having the information right here mixed with that, okay, got it.

293  
0:32:44  
Emily  
Okay? And then, compare for me the likelihood of you of using the app in this scenario, where it does have the payment option versus the other scenario, where there was no payment. Option.

294  
0:33:01  
P8  
This I more likely use it where you can pay.

295  
0:33:04  
Emily  
Rather than not having that option.

296  
0:33:07  
P8  
Having it as well.

297  
0:33:10  
Emily  
Alright got it, and thoughts are how? How would you?

298  
0:33:15  
Emily  
Because it is 2 different applications. How do you believe you would? You would get the information, let's say, like the file number, for example, from the app over to the payment site.

299  
0:33:30  
P8  
Well, I think it opens that up in new window, or right now it doesn't because we got kicked out.

300  
0:33:39  
P8  
So.

301  
0:33:39  
P8  
No, I would need mine. I wouldn't

302  
0:33:43  
P8  
maybe having it to where it pops up in a separate window rather than it. Taking away this screen that I'm looking at right now and then, after I click on the

303  
0:33:55  
P8  
the va.gov site like being able. Seems like you can't switch back after you click.

304  
0:34:02  
Emily  
Hmm.

305  
0:34:04  
P8  
Or she.

306  
0:34:06  
Emily  
Okay. Yeah, I mean, pretend. But there, there, there would be 2 different applications. I mean, I'm just wondering what what you believe your process would be in order to, let's say, put them the file number

307  
0:34:18  
Emily  
over into the the payment site.

308  
0:34:23  
P8  
Does this allow copy? 

309  
0:34:25  
P8  
This won't allow you to copy, it doesn't look like, so I guess I'd have to write it down.

310  
0:34:30  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.

311  
0:34:31  
P8  
Just switch back and forth.

312  
0:34:34  
P8  
That I'd probably write it down.

313  
0:34:36  
Emily  
Oh, oh, oh, you would. You would write it down first.st

314  
0:34:40  
Emily  
Got it? Okay?

315  
0:34:42  
Emily  
And yeah. Any any other thoughts on on that experience. Of like you said you having to write it down and then switching applications to make payments.

316  
0:34:58  
P8  
Maybe if there's under where it says, Pay this debt online, maybe there's a little

317  
0:35:05  
P8  
description saying you're gonna need this information for your payment

318  
0:35:11  
P8  
like just telling you that you should write it down if you don't have the letter with the file number, and just something to remind you that you're gonna need it.

319  
0:35:19  
Emily  
Okay. On this page or on on a previous screen?

320  
0:34:56  
P8  
On this page.

321  
0:35:25  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, what what do you think would be would be useful to have.

322  
0:35:29  
P8  
Let me just saying, like

323  
0:35:32  
P8  
when you make your payment, you're going to need your file number and payee number.

324  
0:35:39  
P8  
Little reminder on this screen that you're gonna need this information before you leave the screen.

325  
0:35:45  
Emily  
Okay, before, yeah. Wh. What do you think would make that more clear than than what is written here?

326  
0:35:51  
P8  
Oh, well, there's nothing here that tells you that you're gonna need this.

327  
0:35:56  
P8  
You all right, you'll need to provide the following details. Okay, I maybe just saying

328  
0:36:06  
P8  
I guess they do explain it.

329  
0:36:09  
P8  
But kind of it doesn't tell you that once you click on the pay on pay.va.gov

330  
0:36:15  
P8  
thing that's gonna take this information away from you.

331  
0:36:19  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

332  
0:36:20  
P8  
Maybe being able to copy it.

333  
0:36:22  
P8  
It doesn't let you trying to do like a copy and paste with my.

334  
0:36:28  
Emily  
Okay, but it won't let me

335  
0:36:31  
Emily  
got it. Okay, and then any other thoughts, I actually wanna hit the the back link at the top left there

336  
0:36:43  
Emily  
any any other thoughts regarding this.

337  
0:36:47  
Emily  
the screens here, the payment score, the payment information screens? That might make things more useful.

338  
0:36:55  
P8  
That's nice and clear and concise.

339  
0:36:58  
Emily  
Okay, great, and let me have you tap on the payment section again on the lower right.

340  
0:37:06  
Emily  
I'm gonna go through there we go. So I know you said in in real life you don't pay. You don't pay any copays in this, but in this pretends situation you will. So I have a couple of questions here, let me have you tap into copays toward the bottom there first, st

341  
0:37:26  
Emily  
and then thoughts here overall on what information would be important to you in regards to any sort of Copay bills.

342  
0:37:40  
P8  
This is pretty clear, and it tells you which clinic it's from, or give you review details, so

343  
0:37:50  
P8  
I don't know how you can make it any better than it is here.

344  
0:37:54  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And let's look at this this, that top one, the James A. Haley hospital.

345  
0:38:01  
Emily  
In terms of any any information you would need in regards to this particular Copay Bill.

346  
0:38:10  
P8  
Okay.

347  
0:38:16  
P8  
due date.

348  
0:38:23  
P8  
Zoom, it looks like I've never done it before, so I'm not sure what else you would.

349  
0:38:30  
Emily  
Okay, got it all right.

350  
0:38:33  
Emily  
And are there? Are there any instances where you receive statements? And that doesn't have to be with with Va. Just with any sort of other other account. You might have that where you receive statements, statements.

351  
0:38:48  
P8  
Oh, yeah, I get all my like, my bank statements, my credit, card statements, everything comes online.

352  
0:38:54  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And what like overall? Are you using those? How are you using those? If so.

353  
0:39:02  
P8  
They just stay in my inbox, something that I need to dispute on. I don't even look at them.

354  
0:39:11  
Emily  
Okay, you're you're only looking. If you if you need to check something.

355  
0:39:15  
P8  
Yeah.

356  
0:39:16  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

357  
0:39:18  
Emily  
So pretending again, jumping, pretending that you do have copays thoughts on potentially using the statements here.

358  
0:39:29  
P8  
I mean, if I had Copays, if I ever needed

359  
0:39:33  
P8  
needed to dispute something that they're trying to charge me for, or anything like that I need to like having the statements here would be very helpful.

360  
0:39:43  
Emily  
Hmm. Okay.

361  
0:39:46  
Emily  
Do you know what you might do with the statement? Exactly. I know you said you. You'd want you'd want to have them if you have to dispute anything. Yeah, what what might you do with them?

362  
0:39:54  
P8  
Just in case, just in case like having

363  
0:39:58  
P8  
having them there. I mean, you don't know if you need to dispute them until you actually see the statement. So.

364  
0:40:04  
Emily  
Okay, and let me have you open up the statement to see what this looks like. Here.

365  
0:40:12  
P8  
The Pdf, so the current statement.

366  
0:40:16  
Emily  
Yep.

367  
0:40:23  
Emily  
yeah. Thoughts on how how useful it would be to have this in the app here.

368  
0:40:31  
P8  
Mean the same thing just

369  
0:40:34  
P8  
nice to actually, it's basically looks like just a scan version of your paper when they send you.

370  
0:40:40  
Emily  
Okay.

371  
0:40:41  
P8  
So it's nicer than having the paper one.

372  
0:40:44  
Emily  
Okay. Yeah.

373  
0:40:45  
P8  
Easier to keep track of.

374  
0:40:46  
Emily  
You're not gonna throw it out. So on accident.

375  
0:40:51  
Emily  
Okay? Well, there, since you said it's easier to keep track of anything anything you'd want to do in regards to keeping track of the statements.

376  
0:41:00  
P8  
Like, I said, in case you have to dispute something, or if there was an overcharge or anything like that.

377  
0:41:09  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you click done there?

378  
0:41:14  
Emily  
So as a sense you brought up. If there's something that you wanted to, that you needed to dispute what would be your process for dispute, for, for starting to dispute.

379  
0:41:29  
P8  
I can't see anything here.

380  
0:41:31  
P8  
Maybe on your paid bill.

381  
0:41:33  
P8  
Okay.

382  
0:41:37  
P8  
we'll just

383  
0:41:42  
P8  
oh, request help!

384  
0:41:52  
P8  
It looks like it's giving me an option.

385  
0:41:57  
Emily  
What what sort of information would you be looking for?

386  
0:42:04  
P8  
like how it kind of was under the overpayments where you can actually go into a section like there was a dispute option under the blue pay bill

387  
0:42:15  
P8  
right here, but it's not giving any options at all for that. So they have something something there.

388  
0:42:26  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you. Yeah, let me close that

389  
0:42:31  
Emily  
and then tap on the the help section on the upper right.

390  
0:42:39  
Emily  
Yeah. Thoughts on the information presented here, and how useful that might be.

391  
0:42:45  
P8  
This helps with that most of the time when you see a hope option in the upper right, you're thinking, like me. Personally, I think that that's more

392  
0:42:55  
P8  
help using the app. Not actually help with your copays.

393  
0:42:59  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

394  
0:43:00  
P8  
So that's where that can get a little bit confusing.

395  
0:43:05  
P8  
Let me talk to her.

396  
0:43:07  
P8  
Do you have like a you see how it says Copay. Help at the top. Do you have that as an actual option to click on rather than just under help.

397  
0:43:16  
Emily  
Okay, so that's under the main screen.

398  
0:43:19  
Emily  
Okay? So so labeled as Copay help instead of just help.

399  
0:43:23  
P8  
Exactly.

400  
0:43:24  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, that makes sense.

401  
0:43:26  
Emily  
And then, we're gonna pretend that you are ready to make a payment here for this one walk me through your process to make a payment, and again, it won't have you enter in any actual information.

402  
0:43:41  
P8  
Pay bill, and then we probably do the thing on, save out there the same way that

403  
0:43:49  
P8  
as we did for the overpayment.

404  
0:43:52  
Emily  
Okay, let me let me have you go ahead and and tap on that.

405  
0:44:00  
Emily  
and scroll down and tap on. Continue to the form in the middle of the page.

406  
0:44:08  
Emily  
Yep, yeah, I can do. There we go

407  
0:44:11  
Emily  
and then scroll down a little bit. Just gonna have you skip most of this? Oh, yeah. So right here. So just a little bit above.

408  
0:44:21  
Emily  
Yeah, right there. So yeah. Thoughts on finding finding the information here, the the account number and how you might go about that.

409  
0:44:32  
P8  
I would probably click on. Where do I find my Va. Account? Number.

410  
0:44:37  
Emily  
Okay, got it. Let me have you switch back to the figma app.

411  
0:44:44  
P8  
How can I switch? If I hit the X will.

412  
0:44:47  
Emily  
Oh, sorry I switch switch applications within the phone. Go back to Figma instead of the browser that you're in right now. Yep, yep, exactly.

413  
0:44:56  
Emily  
Yep, right here

414  
0:44:58  
Emily  
and let's see, yeah. Tap it like likes to just kick us out of things which is annoying.

415  
0:45:06  
Emily  
Alright, let that go.

416  
0:45:09  
Emily  
Let that load up a bit.

417  
0:45:13  
Emily  
Okay scroll and tap payments on the lower right. I'm gonna get you back to exactly where we were.

418  
0:45:20  
Emily  
Tap on. Sorry I'm sorry. Go back one screen, go to the back to the payments, page.

419  
0:45:26  
Emily  
yep, and then scroll down and tap into the blank gray area at the very yep perfect tap on co-pays.

420  
0:45:35  
Emily  
and again go into the review details here.

421  
0:45:43  
Emily  
Alright. And then so yeah, so thought again. So this would be where you would actually get get back. But thoughts on finding the information you would need here for.

422  
0:45:54  
P8  
The copy option here if they didn't have that for the overpayment. But having that here is very helpful where you can click on it and copies your account. Number.

423  
0:46:06  
Emily  
Okay? Great.

424  
0:46:10  
Emily  
Okay?

425  
0:46:11  
Emily  
And let me see.

426  
0:46:16  
Emily  
Hi, other other thoughts to share regarding anything you're seeing here with the co-pays. Any information that might also be useful.

427  
0:46:32  
P8  
Yeah, no units.

428  
0:46:35  
P8  
Nice and simple. I like it.

429  
0:46:37  
Emily  
Alright simple is good.

430  
0:46:39  
Emily  
And then any thoughts specifically how things are labeled. If there's anything else that would make things more clear. I know you, said the help button. It would be more helpful if it said Copay. Help. But yeah, any other sections that might be

431  
0:46:54  
Emily  
rename that make things more clear.

432  
0:46:59  
P8  
I've never really done Copays before, so I don't know how much more you would need. Besides, this

433  
0:47:04  
P8  
so looks looks good.

434  
0:47:07  
Emily  
Alright got it all right, and I believe those are all my questions. I'm gonna check in with my colleagues. If anyone has any additional questions that I have not covered here. I don't see anything in the chat, but if anyone wants to unmute and ask, you may do so now.

435  
0:47:34  
Emily  
all right, I'll take that as a no, but that is all we have. I really appreciate your time, Brandon. It's always so important to have to talk with veterans about going through these experiences to see what is important, and see how we can potentially make things better for everybody. So thank you for taking the time with us.

436  
0:47:57  
P8  
Yeah, of course.

437  
0:47:58  
Emily  
Yeah, and I know will be reaching out to you shortly. I don't know. At some point, at some point they'll be reaching out to you regarding this. And yeah, that is it for us today. And I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.

438  
0:48:15  
P8  
Thank you. Have a good one.

439  
0:48:16  
Emily  
Thanks! Take care!
