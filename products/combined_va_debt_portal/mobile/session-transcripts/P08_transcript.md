<v Moderator - Emily>bit about you as a veteran, whatever you're

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Moderator - Emily>comfortable sharing with of course such things

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Moderator - Emily>what branch you served in when you retired

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Moderator - Emily>or separated.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.700
<v P 08>Okay.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.820
<v P 08>My name is [redacted]. I was in [redacted] from

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.540
<v P 08>December of 2001 up until 2013. [redacted]

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Moderator - Emily>And then let to know any sort of experience

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Moderator - Emily>you have had with Veteran Affairs.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Moderator - Emily>Just pretty high level to see how sort of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.180
<v Moderator - Emily>interactions you've had with with the organization.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.700
<v P 08>I've used my GI Bill with them and then I've

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.180
<v P 08>also I have my. What's it called compensation

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020
<v P 08>but I'm disabled so I get my service connected

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.980
<v P 08>disability through the VA and then also I

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
<v P 08>go to the [redacted] Medical center for all

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.340
<v P 08>my health everything over healthcare.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.780
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then talk to me about how

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Moderator - Emily>much you are using or not the VA website

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Moderator - Emily>and or the mobile app.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.120
<v P 08>I never really used the mobile app. I've

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.160
<v P 08>logged in a couple times but I nver really

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.000
<v P 08>found a use for it. I've used the website

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.480
<v P 08>especially for like refill my prescriptions.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.360
<v P 08>Then also when I need to contact one of my

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.680
<v P 08>providers I do the secure messaging like

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.640
<v P 08>I need a refill of one of my prescriptions.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.480
<v P 08>It's easier than calling and going through

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.680
<v P 08>the operator and waiting and call center

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.160
<v P 08>forever.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.620
<v P 08>And also for like filling out my GI Bill.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.260
<v P 08>Did that through VA of course the E benefits

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.220
<v P 08>portal that it used to be. I think it's all

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.460
<v P 08>under login.gov now. I have quite a bit of

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.380
<v P 08>experience with it. I probably gained about

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.700
<v P 08>once or twice a month to refill prescriptions

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.060
<v P 08>or schedule appointments and do all that

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.780
<v P 08>for my medical.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh God. Okay. And then you said you had tried

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Moderator - Emily>to use the mobile app. What made you stop

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.720
<v Moderator - Emily>or what like what might you been looking

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.120
<v Moderator - Emily>for that you weren't finding there?

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.560
<v P 08>I just rarely use my phone for Internet and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.840
<v P 08>everything.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.520
<v P 08>So it wasn't really. I mean there's. If I'm

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.440
<v P 08>only using going to the website a couple

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.400
<v P 08>times a month, there's no real reason to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.880
<v P 08>download.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.400
<v P 08>That on my phone for never be used really.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good. Okay, so we're going to move

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.120
<v Moderator - Emily>into the financial portion of the discussion.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.160
<v Moderator - Emily>So I want to make sure you're only sharing

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Moderator - Emily>what you are willing. I have no additional

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.940
<v Moderator - Emily>information about any sort of financial really

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.700
<v Moderator - Emily>anything in regards to the va. So this is

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.980
<v Moderator - Emily>as.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.260
<v Moderator - Emily>As anonymous as. As you would like it. So

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.900
<v Moderator - Emily>can I have you tell me if you have had experience

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.500
<v Moderator - Emily>with owing the VA any money and then if.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.060
<v Moderator - Emily>If again if you're comfortable, if you. If

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.380
<v Moderator - Emily>you could tell me about any experience you

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.940
<v Moderator - Emily>might have had.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.060
<v P 08>Yeah, I've had several times it's happened.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.830
<v P 08>It's been overpayments on like for my GI

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:41.550
<v P 08>Bill because okay, they sent out a check

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.830
<v P 08>early, so I was overpaid. It was like [redacted]

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.510
<v P 08>bucks that I still owe to the for that overpayment.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.670
<v P 08>That's really where I've gotten into trouble

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.070
<v P 08>before is just with dropping class and it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.910
<v P 08>not catching up in the system quick enough.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh God.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.770
<v Moderator - Emily>And do you recall how you've been notified

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.170
<v Moderator - Emily>of the. Of these various situations?

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.970
<v P 08>Letters. I've always received a letter.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.170
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then thoughts on. Sorry, let me.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Sorry, skip ahead there. What's been your

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Moderator - Emily>method for any sort of payment that, that

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.530
<v Moderator - Emily>you've.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.320
<v Moderator - Emily>That you've made for some of these past debts?

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.430
<v P 08>I just let it come out of my next. Whatever's

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.350
<v P 08>coming next month.

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.470
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. And is there anything that you

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.070
<v Moderator - Emily>feel could have been made easier from the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.990
<v Moderator - Emily>VA with that either with.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Moderator - Emily>With communication or. Or anything else in

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.190
<v Moderator - Emily>regard to these debts?

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.470
<v P 08>Not really. I mean, I guess the fact that

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.800
<v P 08>I was only notified via ma. I guess that's

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.520
<v P 08>one thing. Maybe if they sent me an email

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.680
<v P 08>it'd be a little bit better. But snail mail

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.080
<v P 08>works.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.360
<v P 08>I mean I was notified about that. Just all

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.360
<v P 08>of a sudden see a surprise coming out of

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.440
<v P 08>my next payment just disappearing or something

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.280
<v P 08>like that. So that's a good.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.200
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.360
<v P 08>Besides maybe sending an email, I don't know

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.560
<v P 08>what else I could really do.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.000
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. You would prefer an email or you would

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.880
<v Moderator - Emily>also want an email.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.610
<v P 08>Yeah.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Moderator - Emily>And then any. I know you mentioned that you.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Moderator - Emily>You have at least some health care. Do you

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Moderator - Emily>have experience with medical co payments

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.930
<v Moderator - Emily>through va?

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.050
<v P 08>No, I've always been service connected so

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.170
<v P 08>I've never had to do co payments.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. So let me have. I'm gonna. We're

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Moderator - Emily>gonna move into the prototype section here.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me have you share your screen and let

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.710

00:08:59.299 --> 00:09:02.699
<v Moderator - Emily>on anything quite yet, but pretending you

00:09:02.859 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Moderator - Emily>are opening the mobile app here. Where would

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.680
<v Moderator - Emily>you expect to find any information from money

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.240
<v Moderator - Emily>that you owe? For example, from an overpayment.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:18.800
<v P 08>Maybe claims on the.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got any claims? Any. Any other places?

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:23.720
<v P 08>Sorry, in the bottom, under.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.240
<v P 08>Maybe in the bottom. Benefits or payments.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, benefits. Okay, got it. Any other.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh yeah, any. Any other thoughts you have

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Moderator - Emily>where you might find it?

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.100
<v P 08>Maybe under the See Details.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.750
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so since you mentioned both the benefits

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.630
<v Moderator - Emily>and payment sections on the bottom, we will

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.830
<v Moderator - Emily>find it under payments. And I'm wondering

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.470
<v Moderator - Emily>any thoughts you might have for making that

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Moderator - Emily>even more clear that that's where you might

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:12.230
<v Moderator - Emily>find that information.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.990
<v P 08>No, with it just saying payments alone, it's

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:23.050
<v P 08>kind of making me think about what they paid

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.810
<v P 08>me only showing like what's been sent to

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.170
<v P 08>me. I don’t know, it makes sense. I don't,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.490
<v P 08>I don't have any suggestions as to making

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.890
<v P 08>it really much clearer. It's one of those

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.410
<v P 08>things where you just got to explore around

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.410
<v P 08>and find your way.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.410
<v Moderator - Emily>Sure, sure. Yeah. Okay, so let me have you

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:46.810
<v Moderator - Emily>tap into that payment section and then over

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.530
<v Moderator - Emily>before you can scroll around. But don't yet

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.850
<v Moderator - Emily>tap on anything. Thoughts on how this is

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.230
<v Moderator - Emily>structured, knowing the title of payments

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.750
<v Moderator - Emily>and what might make more sense, if anything.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.110
<v P 08>This is actually pretty clear. You got your

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.870
<v P 08>payments and then you have your history,

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:11.150
<v P 08>your housing information. This is pretty

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.470
<v P 08>clear and simple. I like this.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.030
<v Moderator - Emily>And talk to me about the. So in this case

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.750
<v Moderator - Emily>we're going to pretend that you do have co

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.430
<v Moderator - Emily>pays in this, in this pretend world. But

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Moderator - Emily>talk to me about the brief information that

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.290
<v Moderator - Emily>is below both the overpay. The words overpayment

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:32.890
<v Moderator - Emily>debts and co pays. What sort of high level

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.010
<v Moderator - Emily>information might you want from this page?

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:40.210
<v P 08>It’s just telling you like how much is going

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.890
<v P 08>to be due, how much you owe and maybe there's

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.970
<v P 08>like a deadline on when you need to pay it.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.090
<v P 08>I don’t know if the VA r eally does deadlines.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.590
<v P 08>I'm not sure about that.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, all right. Oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.180
<v P 08>It seems pretty good and clear.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. All right. As I said, the only

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.740
<v Moderator - Emily>other thing you might want to know is, is

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.020
<v Moderator - Emily>any deadline right here.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.900
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, let me have you. So I'm going to have

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Moderator - Emily>you tap into the, the overpayments to get

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Moderator - Emily>your thoughts on how clear it is on overall

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.900
<v Moderator - Emily>what you currently owe in this pretend situation.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.540
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead, hit payments again.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.620
<v Moderator - Emily>I think that was the copays I'm going to

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.060
<v Moderator - Emily>get due to the overpayments.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:41.060
<v P 08>The overpayments, Yep. Oh yeah, there you

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:41.180
<v P 08>go.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.500
<v Moderator - Emily>Perfect. Yeah. So looking at the information

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:50.940
<v Moderator - Emily>here, how, how clear is it for how much you

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.060
<v Moderator - Emily>are currently owing in this pretend situation?

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.440
<v P 08>Yeah, really clear because it directly says

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:05.280
<v P 08>your current balance. So okay, yeah, that's

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:05.880
<v P 08>really clear.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.960
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Any other information you would want

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:13.520
<v Moderator - Emily>to have on this page for seeing overall what

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.600
<v Moderator - Emily>the different debts are?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.610
<v P 08>No, I don't know how you make. There'd be

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.130
<v P 08>more information.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:23.250
<v P 08>There is.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.810
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, got it. So we're just going to

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.810
<v Moderator - Emily>look at the, the top one, the post 911 GI

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Moderator - Emily>bill for housing. And if you want to tap

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:36.410
<v Moderator - Emily>into that, let me know what information would

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Moderator - Emily>be important to you in regards to. For this

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.170
<v Moderator - Emily>particular debt.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:41.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Just, just for this topic. Yeah, there we

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:41.810
<v Moderator - Emily>go.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:46.290
<v P 08>Okay. Here you do have a few days. That's.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.280
<v P 08>Yeah. Your balance and your due date is the

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.800
<v P 08>most important thing. And your transaction

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.120
<v P 08>history.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.000
<v P 08>Oh, and it gives you like again, no, you

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.880
<v P 08>get late keys from the game. It's good information.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.280
<v P 08>Oh, okay. Yeah, they give you your letter

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:16.290
<v P 08>history. Pretty, pretty thorough.

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Since you mentioned the, the letter

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:21.330
<v Moderator - Emily>history.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.930
<v Moderator - Emily>What, how, how useful is that to you? What,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:26.930
<v Moderator - Emily>what would you be using that for?

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.890
<v P 08>Well, just remember it just reminded me of

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:33.290
<v P 08>how they always notify me through letters.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:37.210
<v P 08>But I know there's like a time frame of when

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.920
<v P 08>some you get letters that you have like 90

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.320
<v P 08>days. I think it is before where you can

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.920
<v P 08>appeal it.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.520
<v P 08>So just remembering that you have that time

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.640
<v P 08>frame is. Or if you were to appeal it to

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.960
<v P 08>know that that deadline is there, you know

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.520
<v P 08>which date to go by for that?

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.360
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Would there be. So as I said like knowing

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.080
<v Moderator - Emily>the date is important.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.680
<v Moderator - Emily>Anything else in regards to the debt letter

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:02.920
<v Moderator - Emily>that you might want to know here?

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.000
<v P 08>No the most important thing is the date.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.270
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Just the dates. Got it.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:14.310
<v Moderator - Emily>And then what? Yeah, and any other information

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.630
<v Moderator - Emily>that might be useful for you here for this

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Moderator - Emily>particular debt.

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:27.230
<v P 08>See maybe from when it was you actually like

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.790
<v P 08>I said it's the post 911 GI bill debt for

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:33.870
<v P 08>housing. But it doesn't say for like which

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.830
<v P 08>month that housing was either an overpayment

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.990
<v P 08>or like for why it occurred. I mean. Oh,

00:15:40.990 --> 00:15:42.750
<v P 08>there's actually right there, I see. Why

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:43.950
<v P 08>might I have this debt?

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.550
<v P 08>That could be some more information.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.950
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Do you want. You want to tap on that

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.710
<v Moderator - Emily>and just see if that would would be sufficient.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.310
<v P 08>Common reasons.. to actually have the reason

00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:00.160
<v P 08>would be helpful to know while why I'm being

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.680
<v P 08>charged this money for that month.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:07.880
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so. So you would want additional information

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:08.840
<v Moderator - Emily>it sounds like.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.760
<v Moderator - Emily>Would there. Would there be more information

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.200
<v Moderator - Emily>you would want? Yeah.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.360
<v P 08>Which like for basically which month I got

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.680
<v P 08>I'm being charged for.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.800
<v P 08>Okay. Or if it's like even when you go to

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.800
<v P 08>like co payments, what off what appointment

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.600
<v P 08>am I being charged that co payment for stuff

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.760
<v P 08>like that that is usually found in the the

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.560
<v P 08>letters that they send out to you.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:49.240
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then so additional information

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.530
<v Moderator - Emily>it sounds like. And then what else would

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:55.530
<v Moderator - Emily>you expect or want to be able to do from

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.490
<v Moderator - Emily>here in regards to this particular debt?

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:04.490
<v P 08>Nothing under here besides that it's pretty

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:04.770
<v P 08>good.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:10.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And pretending that this is

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.130
<v Moderator - Emily>built in real life. And again we'll kind

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:17.650
<v Moderator - Emily>of suspend belief because I know you said

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.450
<v Moderator - Emily>you aren't currently using the app, but thoughts

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:25.549
<v Moderator - Emily>on how likely you would use this if it were

00:17:25.629 --> 00:17:26.029
<v Moderator - Emily>actually.

00:17:27.229 --> 00:17:30.029
<v P 08>Still probably do it online just through

00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:31.829
<v P 08>my computer because I'm so used to doing

00:17:31.829 --> 00:17:32.429
<v P 08>it that way.

00:17:32.429 --> 00:17:35.709
<v P 08>There's no real need to change over to now,

00:17:38.428 --> 00:17:40.869
<v P 08>but if I didn't have a computer, of course

00:17:40.869 --> 00:17:43.309
<v P 08>this would make a lot easier. Okay.

00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:46.109
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, sure. Got it. Okay.

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Moderator - Emily>And so I know you said that for the debts

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.540
<v Moderator - Emily>you've had, it's been taken out of your benefits.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.940
<v Moderator - Emily>How about if let's say you had a debt where

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.740
<v Moderator - Emily>you were actually making financial payments

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:03.620
<v Moderator - Emily>to the va.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:10.660
<v P 08>I'd like to know basically when my payment's

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.340
<v P 08>due, what are the charges I'm late on that

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.880
<v P 08>payment? What is there like a grace period

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.400
<v P 08>or anything like that? And maybe like, if

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:26.280
<v P 08>I'm. If I can set up an automated automatic

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.040
<v P 08>charge to my card to make those payments,

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:30.840
<v P 08>stuff like that.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.120
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.440
<v Moderator - Emily>And then if you. So since you talked, you

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.840
<v Moderator - Emily>talked about the being able to set up payments

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.760
<v Moderator - Emily>from your card, etc. Knowing that you're.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.480
<v Moderator - Emily>That you're not seeing that here. Thoughts

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:52.200
<v Moderator - Emily>on again, how likely it would be that you

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:52.400
<v Moderator - Emily>would.

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.360
<v Moderator - Emily>That you would use it.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.720
<v P 08>If it was. Depends on if it was something

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.720
<v P 08>that I can only do on the app or if it's

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:04.240
<v P 08>also available online. Like, if it's available

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.600
<v P 08>online, I'm going to do it.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:06.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Mm.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.850
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So just depending if you can do it

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.610
<v Moderator - Emily>on. On your computer as well. Okay. All right,

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:16.250
<v Moderator - Emily>let me have you tap the.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.650
<v Moderator - Emily>The payments button on the lower right again.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.210
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm gonna get you to a different section.

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.770
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. Scroll all the way down and the.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.690
<v Moderator - Emily>The blank gray area toward the bottom.

00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:33.580
<v Moderator - Emily>Tap that area once. All right, perfect. And

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.340
<v Moderator - Emily>then go back into overpayment debts.

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So again, we're going to look at this

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.740
<v Moderator - Emily>top debt from housing. We're going to pretend

00:19:47.059 --> 00:19:52.940
<v Moderator - Emily>that you believe that this debt is in error.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.300
<v Moderator - Emily>You don't actually. Either you don't think

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.020
<v Moderator - Emily>it should be this amount or you don't think

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.220
<v Moderator - Emily>it should be there at all.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.460
<v Moderator - Emily>What would be your next steps?

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.060
<v P 08>I'd be probably going under review. Details.

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:07.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:10.700
<v P 08>Do you want me to click it?

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.380
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.900
<v Moderator - Emily>If you can go and tap in just to see what.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Find the information here and if this

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:16.980
<v Moderator - Emily>will be sufficient.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:28.260
<v P 08>Again, it doesn't give you the information

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:28.980
<v P 08>why.

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.800
<v P 08>Oh, from like what month it was from. So.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yep.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.680
<v P 08>That'd be nice to have to clarify while why

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.640
<v P 08>I have to pay it.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:40.920
<v Moderator - Emily>Sure.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Moderator - Emily>And then thoughts on what you do if you believed

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.240
<v Moderator - Emily>that this was somehow in error, what your

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.040
<v Moderator - Emily>next step would be?

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.570
<v P 08>Oh, it's maybe under resolved debt, but it's

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:04.330
<v P 08>kind of request. Oh, it's really not that

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:05.970
<v P 08>clear on what you can do when you're here.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. What do you think would make it more

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.770
<v Moderator - Emily>clear.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.010
<v P 08>Under the request, Help us to dispute this

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:19.730
<v P 08>debt. Having this on the main portion after

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:20.380
<v P 08>you click on it.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.210
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, you mean like where it says resolve debt?

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.730
<v P 08>Yeah, under having. Underneath that.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.890
<v P 08>Having an option for dispute. That'd be.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:31.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. To have it separate.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:38.290
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And then. And then. And same.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.850
<v Moderator - Emily>Same Question like if.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.970
<v Moderator - Emily>Let's say you. You were actually making payments

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.090
<v Moderator - Emily>but didn't believed you didn't have the money.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Thoughts on your next steps for that in terms

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.530
<v Moderator - Emily>of seeing if there could be other arrangements

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:54.250
<v Moderator - Emily>for payment?

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.370
<v P 08>Probably would be under resolved. Again,

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.930
<v P 08>other ways to pay. Okay.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:09.010
<v P 08>Just pay by phone. Pay by manual doesn't

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:13.020
<v P 08>really answer that. So. Well really what

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:17.140
<v P 08>you can do besides calling and contacting

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.740
<v P 08>them. So maybe if you have like an actual

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:29.260
<v P 08>option under the resolved debt of help paying

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.340
<v P 08>or request help in paying debt or something

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:32.780
<v P 08>like that.

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.540
<v P 08>I don't know. If you don't have the money,

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:35.780
<v P 08>what are you supposed to do?

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. Yeah.

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me actually tap back into that resolve

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:44.300
<v Moderator - Emily>debt section that you were just there. Yeah.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.780
<v Moderator - Emily>And then tap on the request help.

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.260
<v P 08>Request debt.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Any thoughts on how to make that clear

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.500
<v Moderator - Emily>since it seems like it was not clear that

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.580
<v Moderator - Emily>that's where you might go to get this information.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:13.710
<v P 08>Springing the debt into here it says request.

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:16.230
<v P 08>That kind of gives you. Makes you think that

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:19.950
<v P 08>it's like asking for help in using the app

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:25.070
<v P 08>itself. Okay. Requesting help with the payment.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:26.510
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.590
<v P 08>All right. To the front when it helps.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.460
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And then once if you can tap the.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.780
<v Moderator - Emily>The request help once more thoughts on the

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.980
<v Moderator - Emily>different sections that. That it's offering

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.660
<v Moderator - Emily>under request help and in terms of clarity.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:55.740
<v P 08>Dispute just what we were talking about earlier.

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:57.730
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.010
<v P 08>Gives you start your debt. Oh, this is clear

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:02.210
<v P 08>and simple. I like this.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.930
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And let me have you scroll

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.050
<v Moderator - Emily>down. Just tap on. I think it was the second

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.010
<v Moderator - Emily>one under the start your debt dispute. Just

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Moderator - Emily>have a.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.930
<v Moderator - Emily>Curious to get your thoughts on that.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.370
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm sorry. Start your request for debt help.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.920
<v Moderator - Emily>Sorry I misspoke. Yep. And just.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.840
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm not going to read everything of course.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.960
<v Moderator - Emily>But have a look through here and give overall

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:33.360
<v Moderator - Emily>thoughts on the information provided here.

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.490
<v P 08>Or we're starting.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:58.130
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, yeah, yeah. The. The Start your request

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.890
<v Moderator - Emily>for debt help.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.770
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Thoughts on the information.

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:11.610
<v P 08>Go ahead.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.530
<v P 08>Just brings you to the form that you need

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.130
<v P 08>to fill out.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.250
<v P 08>Even pre fills information for you. So that's

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:24.810
<v P 08>actually pretty nice and simple. And start

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:28.010
<v P 08>your dispute. It's helpful.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:29.210
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, great.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me have you tap on. Done there please.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.730
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then we're going to pretend that

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:45.770
<v Moderator - Emily>you are ready to make a payment. Walk me

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:48.010
<v Moderator - Emily>through how you would do that here.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:54.860
<v P 08>Resolve debt.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.140
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.820
<v P 08>It looks like this just brings you to the

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.340
<v P 08>VA website though, so you can't really pay

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.340
<v P 08>it inside the app, I'm guessing.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.540
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yeah. Thoughts. Yeah.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.900
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me have you again. I will not. I promise

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.880
<v Moderator - Emily>I will not have you enter any actual payment

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.320
<v Moderator - Emily>information, but go ahead and tap on the.

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.320
<v Moderator - Emily>That pay button.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.320
<v P 08>Okay. So this is basically just bringing

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.440
<v P 08>you back into the Internet site. So it'd

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.840
<v P 08>be nice to be able to do it through the app

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.950
<v P 08>itself. I'm guessing now I'm gonna have to

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:53.630
<v P 08>log into my. Actually log into my login.gov

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.950
<v P 08>account.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:58.270
<v P 08>Kind of makes it. Makes it pointless to even

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:00.790
<v P 08>use the app if you have to go online in the

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:01.310
<v P 08>first place.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.150
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me have you tap the. The button that

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.630
<v Moderator - Emily>says Pay online. There's one.

00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:10.910
<v Moderator - Emily>There's one at the top there on the upper

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:14.780
<v Moderator - Emily>left just to get to the next page.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.060
<v Moderator - Emily>And then scroll down a little bit. I'm. Again,

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.500
<v Moderator - Emily>I know there's a lot to read, so I won't

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:22.060
<v Moderator - Emily>have you read everything and I'm not going

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.980
<v Moderator - Emily>to have you actually enter any information

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.140
<v Moderator - Emily>in, but scroll down a little bit more. Yeah.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:29.420
<v Moderator - Emily>So.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.260
<v Moderator - Emily>So the section where you would have to enter

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:36.300
<v Moderator - Emily>the information here. Thoughts on the process

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:41.050
<v Moderator - Emily>here in terms of if you are actually making

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:41.730
<v Moderator - Emily>a payment.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:50.170
<v P 08>Lot of information. I've never done it before.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.610
<v P 08>I didn't know you needed like AE number and

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.450
<v P 08>all that. I guess that's on the letter that

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:56.130
<v P 08>they send you.

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:56.930
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.450
<v P 08>Kind of makes it seem a little bit more complicated

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.530
<v P 08>than it needs to be.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:01.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:05.040
<v P 08>Just be able to put in your card number on

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.680
<v P 08>the app and make a payment.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.600
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.200
<v P 08>It's the government, so I guess everything

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:11.560
<v P 08>gets complicated.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.600
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Thoughts on. Let's say if you were

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.760
<v Moderator - Emily>doing this in real life, what would you be

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.560
<v Moderator - Emily>doing to find all of the required information

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:28.960
<v Moderator - Emily>that they have here on my letter?

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.330
<v P 08>Another good point about what I said in the

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.650
<v P 08>beginning on having an email sent to you.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:37.170
<v P 08>This would have accidentally threw out my

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:40.770
<v P 08>letter. I can get that. Payee number is what

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:46.650
<v P 08>they're asking for the deduction code. I

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:48.650
<v P 08>don't even know what all that means, but.

00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:52.010
<v P 08>So if I don't have my letter, I'm kind of

00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:52.650
<v P 08>out of luck.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:55.810
<v Moderator - Emily>I see. Okay. Yeah. Let me have you switch

00:28:55.810 --> 00:28:58.010
<v Moderator - Emily>back to the Figma app right now.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Let's see if it brings it back to where

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:10.660
<v Moderator - Emily>we were.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.579
<v P 08>Probably should have just hit back.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:17.460
<v Moderator - Emily>I give it just a moment to load.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.420
<v P 08>Okay.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.700
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then tap on payments. I had to

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.540
<v Moderator - Emily>walk you through getting to specifically

00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:27.220
<v Moderator - Emily>where we were. Yeah.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:29.020
<v Moderator - Emily>So go ahead and tap on the payments button

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:29.860
<v Moderator - Emily>on the lower right.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:36.580
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep. And then scroll down and again tap once

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.380
<v Moderator - Emily>into that blank gray area at the. Toward

00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:42.740
<v Moderator - Emily>the bottom. Okay. And then tap on overpayment

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:43.100
<v Moderator - Emily>debts.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.740
<v Moderator - Emily>This is just getting us back to where you

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:52.740
<v Moderator - Emily>were. Yep. And yeah, again, to review details,

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.620
<v Moderator - Emily>we're going to look at that top one again

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.630
<v Moderator - Emily>and resolve debt and go to Pay Online. This

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.310
<v Moderator - Emily>is just getting us back to where you would

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:06.110
<v Moderator - Emily>have been because the prototype kicked us

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:11.990
<v Moderator - Emily>out, unfortunately. So thoughts on this information

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Moderator - Emily>being shared on the app?

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.630
<v P 08>Information is. Oh, okay. This is actually

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:25.130
<v P 08>helpful because on the Pay Online thing was

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:28.450
<v P 08>asking for like that payee number and then

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.370
<v P 08>deduction code that they required in letter.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:35.730
<v P 08>Having that here makes it seem I don't need

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.330
<v P 08>to go hunting for my letter to fill it out.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.050
<v P 08>So that's nice to have on here.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:45.170
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. Thoughts on how this could be

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:49.210
<v Moderator - Emily>even more clear in terms of notifying you

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.090
<v Moderator - Emily>that the information is here to pay online.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.810
<v P 08>I don't know how you make it more clear than

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.490
<v P 08>listing it out like they do.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:04.730
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And what might if. If you were making

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:08.210
<v Moderator - Emily>a payment on the phone, what might be your

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:11.610
<v Moderator - Emily>process to getting the information that you.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Moderator - Emily>That you need into the.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Moderator - Emily>The government website to pay?

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.340
<v P 08>Either finding the letter or if I'm doing

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.020
<v P 08>it on the phone, I can go into this app right

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.020
<v P 08>here. Give me all the information I need.

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:25.740
<v P 08>It looks like.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:31.020
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then thoughts on switching between

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.620
<v Moderator - Emily>the apps between, in this case, our fake

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:38.060
<v Moderator - Emily>VA app and then the payment site.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:43.460
<v P 08>Nice to have it all. And then having to switch

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.660
<v P 08>between like that.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.180
<v Moderator - Emily>If this app. Oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:55.660
<v P 08>But I mean, it's simple. It gives you the

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:58.499
<v P 08>direct link to click on. So can't really

00:31:58.499 --> 00:32:02.220
<v P 08>make it simpler, more clear than that, I

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.500
<v P 08>guess, besides having it all in one.

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And if things were built in

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.300
<v Moderator - Emily>real life with like this payment process

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.930
<v Moderator - Emily>here, again, knowing, I don't know, you don't

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.930
<v Moderator - Emily>actually use the app, at least right now.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.130
<v Moderator - Emily>Thoughts on how likely it would be that you

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.050
<v Moderator - Emily>might use it for this?

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:28.170
<v P 08>I might use it for this when I. After finding

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:31.450
<v P 08>out that you need this information for the

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.050
<v P 08>painting, I'm not going to have to dig around

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:34.890
<v P 08>to find the letter.

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:37.050
<v P 08>I might have threw out the letter that they

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.450
<v P 08>sent me. So having the information right

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:41.050
<v P 08>here next.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:48.410
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good. Okay. And then compare for me

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.250
<v Moderator - Emily>the likelihood of you of using the app in

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:53.170
<v Moderator - Emily>this scenario where it does have the payment

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.089
<v Moderator - Emily>option, versus the other scenario where there

00:32:56.089 --> 00:32:57.450
<v Moderator - Emily>was no payment option.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.450
<v P 08>I would more likely use it where you can

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.580
<v P 08>pay rather than not having that option .

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.620
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, got it. And thoughts are how.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.220
<v Moderator - Emily>How would you. Because it is two different

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.740
<v Moderator - Emily>applications. How do you believe you would.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:23.260
<v Moderator - Emily>You would get the information, let's say

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.780
<v Moderator - Emily>like the file number, for example, from the

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.020
<v Moderator - Emily>app over to the payment site?

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.860
<v P 08>Well, I think it opens that up in a new window

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.400
<v P 08>or right now it doesn't. Kind of because

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.840
<v P 08>we got kicked out. So now I would need my

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:45.720
<v P 08>letter maybe having it to where it pops up

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.560
<v P 08>in a separate window rather than it taking

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:51.000
<v P 08>away this screen that I'm looking at right

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.880
<v P 08>now and after I click on the panel, the va.gov

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.640
<v P 08>site. So like being able. Seems like you

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.440
<v P 08>can't switch back after you click.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.680
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yeah. I mean pretend. Well, there,

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.520
<v Moderator - Emily>there, there would be two different applications.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.480
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm just wondering what, what you believe

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.480
<v Moderator - Emily>your process would be in order to, let's

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:19.920
<v Moderator - Emily>say put in the file number over into the.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.120
<v Moderator - Emily>The payment site.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.000
<v P 08>Does this allow copying? This won't allow

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:28.000
<v P 08>you to copy it. It doesn't look like. So

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.720
<v P 08>I guess I'd have to write it down.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:34.560
<v P 08>Yeah, just switch back and forth. I'd probably

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:35.240
<v P 08>write it down.

00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:37.480
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, okay. Oh, you would, you would write

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.040
<v Moderator - Emily>it down first?

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.400
<v P 08>Yeah, got it.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.960
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And yeah. Any, any other thoughts on.

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.880
<v Moderator - Emily>On that experience of like I said, you having

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.880
<v Moderator - Emily>to write it down and then switching applications

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.720
<v Moderator - Emily>to make payments.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.130
<v P 08>Just maybe if there's under where it says

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:04.210
<v P 08>pay this debt online, maybe there's a little

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.570
<v P 08>description saying you're gonna need this

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:12.250
<v P 08>information for your payment. Like just telling

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.650
<v P 08>you that you should write it down if you

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.450
<v P 08>don't have the letter with the file number

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.210
<v P 08>and just something to remind you that you're

00:35:18.210 --> 00:35:18.930
<v P 08>gonna need it.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:23.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. On this page or on a previous screen.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.340
<v P 08>On this page.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. What do you think would be

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:27.620
<v Moderator - Emily>useful.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.380
<v P 08>To have maybe just saying like when you make

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.100
<v P 08>your payment, you're going to need your file

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.740
<v P 08>number and your payee number.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.300
<v P 08>A little reminder on the screen that you're

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.940
<v P 08>going to need this information before you

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:44.820
<v P 08>leave the screen.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Before. Yeah. What do you think would

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.180
<v Moderator - Emily>make that more clear than what is written

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:49.460
<v Moderator - Emily>here?

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.240
<v P 08>Oh, well, there's nothing here that tells

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.160
<v P 08>you that you're going to need this. You.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.120
<v P 08>All right. You'll need to provide the following

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.360
<v P 08>details. Okay.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:07.640
<v P 08>I maybe just saying I guess they do explain

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.920
<v P 08>it, but kind of it doesn't tell you that

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.490
<v P 08>once you click on the payonpay va.gov thing,

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:17.890
<v P 08>that's gonna take this information away from

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:18.210
<v P 08>you.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:23.650
<v P 08>Maybe being able to copy doesn't let you

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.690
<v P 08>trying to do like a copy and paste.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:28.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:29.090
<v P 08>But it won't.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:34.690
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. And then any other thoughts

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:38.290
<v Moderator - Emily>if actually you want to hit the. The back

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.450
<v Moderator - Emily>link at the top left there.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:46.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Any. Any other thoughts regarding this. The

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.820
<v Moderator - Emily>screens here, the payments, the payment information

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:52.700
<v Moderator - Emily>screens that might make things more useful.

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.580
<v P 08>It’s nice and clear, concise.

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:03.140
<v Moderator - Emily>Great. And let me have you tap on the payment

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.380
<v Moderator - Emily>section again on the lower right. We're going

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:07.670
<v Moderator - Emily>to go through.

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.870
<v Moderator - Emily>There we go. So I, I know you said in, in

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.710
<v Moderator - Emily>real life you don't pay. You don't pay any

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:16.270
<v Moderator - Emily>co pays in this. But in this pretensive situation

00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:19.870
<v Moderator - Emily>you will. So I have a couple questions here.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.830
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me have you tap into CO pays toward the

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:27.550
<v Moderator - Emily>bottom there first and then thoughts here

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.030
<v Moderator - Emily>overall on what information would be important

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.320
<v Moderator - Emily>to you in regards to any sort of CO pay bills.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:44.480
<v P 08>This is pretty clear. It tells you which

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:49.280
<v P 08>clinic it's from, gives you review details.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.200
<v P 08>So I don't know how you can make it any better

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.080
<v P 08>than it is here.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:56.120
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And let's look at this.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.150
<v Moderator - Emily>That top one, the James A. Haley Hospital.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Hospital.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.060
<v Moderator - Emily>In terms of any, any, any information you

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.660
<v Moderator - Emily>would need in regards to this particular

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.380
<v Moderator - Emily>copay.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.390
<v P 08>I've never done it before, so I'm not sure

00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:29.470
<v P 08>what else you would need.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:35.190
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. All right. And are there, are

00:38:35.190 --> 00:38:39.550
<v Moderator - Emily>there any instances where you receive statements

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:41.630
<v Moderator - Emily>and it doesn't have to be with, with va,

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:44.310
<v Moderator - Emily>just with any sort of other, other account

00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:46.390
<v Moderator - Emily>you might have that where you receive statements?

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.990
<v Moderator - Emily>Statements?

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:50.990
<v P 08>Oh, yeah. I get all my, like my bank statements,

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.750
<v P 08>my credit card statements. Everything comes

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:53.070
<v P 08>online.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:57.870
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And what like, overall, are

00:38:57.870 --> 00:38:58.710
<v Moderator - Emily>you using those?

00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:59.870
<v Moderator - Emily>How are you using those?

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:03.750
<v P 08>If so, I don't use them. They just stay in

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.910
<v P 08>my inbox. Unless there's like something that

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:09.629
<v P 08>I need to dispute on. I don't even look at

00:39:09.629 --> 00:39:09.910
<v P 08>them.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.990
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. You're. You're only looking if you,

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:14.070
<v Moderator - Emily>if you need to check something.

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.190
<v P 08>Yeah, got it.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.710
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.630
<v Moderator - Emily>So pretending again, jumping. Pretending

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Moderator - Emily>that you do have copays. Thoughts. Thoughts

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.100
<v Moderator - Emily>on potentially using the statements here?

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:31.540
<v P 08>Yeah. I mean, if I had co case, if I ever

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.460
<v P 08>needed. Needed to dispute something that

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.300
<v P 08>they're trying to charge me for or anything

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.580
<v P 08>like that, I need to like, having the statements

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:43.140
<v P 08>here would be very helpful.

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.340
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.540
<v Moderator - Emily>Do you know what you might do with the statements?

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Moderator - Emily>Exactly. I know you said you'd want, you'd

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Moderator - Emily>want to have them if you have to dispute

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:53.620
<v Moderator - Emily>anything. Yeah. What, what might you do with

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:53.780
<v Moderator - Emily>them?

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:57.050
<v P 08>Just in case. Just in case, like having,

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.890
<v P 08>having them there. I mean, you don't know

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.650
<v P 08>if you need to dispute them until you actually

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:02.850
<v P 08>see the statement, so.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:04.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Sure. Okay.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:08.090
<v Moderator - Emily>And let me have you open up the statement

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.850
<v Moderator - Emily>to see what this looks like here.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:12.810
<v P 08>The PDF.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:13.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:19.310
<v P 08>Go to current statement. Yes.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.900
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Thoughts on how useful it would be

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.220
<v Moderator - Emily>to have this in the app here.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.340
<v P 08>The same thing. Just nice to. Actually, this

00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:37.660
<v P 08>basically looks like just a scanned Version

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.300
<v P 08>of the paper one that they send you.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.220
<v P 08>So it's nicer than having a paper one.

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:44.660
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yeah.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.370
<v P 08>Keep track of. You're not going to throw

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.650
<v P 08>it out so on accident.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:51.650
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:54.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Well, since you said it's easier to keep

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Moderator - Emily>track of anything. Anything you'd want to

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:59.330
<v Moderator - Emily>do in regards to keeping track of the statements,

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.930
<v Moderator - Emily>just.

00:41:01.089 --> 00:41:03.010
<v P 08>Like I said, in case you have to dispute

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:05.530
<v P 08>something or if there was an overcharge or

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:06.290
<v P 08>anything like that.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay, let me have you click done

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:11.010
<v Moderator - Emily>there.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.990
<v Moderator - Emily>So as since you brought up if there's something

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.910
<v Moderator - Emily>that you wanted to just that you needed to

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:22.550
<v Moderator - Emily>dispute, what would be your process for dispute

00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:24.150
<v Moderator - Emily>for starting to dispute?

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:32.550
<v P 08>Maybe under paid bill.

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:43.270
<v P 08>Oh, request help.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.110
<v Moderator - Emily>What sort of information would you be looking

00:41:59.110 --> 00:41:59.430
<v Moderator - Emily>for?

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.920
<v P 08>They call it kind of what is under the overpayments

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.280
<v P 08>where you can actually go into a section.

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:13.400
<v P 08>Like there was a dispute option under the

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:19.240
<v P 08>blue pay bill right here, but it's not giving

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:21.600
<v P 08>any options at all for that. So they have

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.200
<v P 08>something. Something there.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.960
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, let me have you. Let me have you close

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:34.090
<v Moderator - Emily>that and then tap on the. The help section

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:35.010
<v Moderator - Emily>on the upper right.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:42.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Thoughts on the information presented

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:43.970
<v Moderator - Emily>here and how useful that might be.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.970
<v P 08>This helps with. Most of the time when you

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:51.610
<v P 08>see a help option in the upper right, you're

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.970
<v P 08>thinking like me personally, I think that

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:57.870
<v P 08>that's more help using the not actual help

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.110
<v P 08>with your co pays.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.670
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.070
<v P 08>So that's where that can get a little bit

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:02.790
<v P 08>confusing.

00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:09.230
<v P 08>If you have like it. You see how it says

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.790
<v P 08>copay health at the top? Do you have that

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.590
<v P 08>as an actual option to click on rather than

00:43:14.590 --> 00:43:15.430
<v P 08>just under help.

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.430
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so. Okay, so.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.470
<v Moderator - Emily>So labeled as copay help instead of just

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Moderator - Emily>helping.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:23.420
<v P 08>Exactly.

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.020
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:31.020
<v Moderator - Emily>we're gonna pretend that you are ready to

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.820
<v Moderator - Emily>make a payment here for this one.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.220
<v Moderator - Emily>Walk me through your process to make a payment.

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.860
<v Moderator - Emily>And again it won't have you enter in any

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.580
<v Moderator - Emily>actual information.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.740
<v P 08>We're gonna pay bill and then probably do

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:49.540
<v P 08>the thingontay.gov the same way that as it

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:51.100
<v P 08>gets to the overpayment.

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.500
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, let me. Let me have you go ahead and

00:43:53.500 --> 00:44:03.940
<v Moderator - Emily>tap on that and scroll down and tap on.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:06.340
<v Moderator - Emily>Continue to the form in the middle of the

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:11.420
<v Moderator - Emily>page. Yep. Yeah, there we go. And then scroll

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:12.540
<v Moderator - Emily>down a little bit. I'm just going to have

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:13.500
<v Moderator - Emily>you skip most of this.

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:16.580
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh yeah, so right here. So just a little

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:17.020
<v Moderator - Emily>bit above.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:25.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, right there. So yeah. Thoughts on finding.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Finding the information here. The.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.300
<v Moderator - Emily>The account number and how you might go about

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:30.620
<v Moderator - Emily>that.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.500
<v P 08>I would probably click on where do I find

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.740
<v P 08>my VA account number.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Let me have you switch back

00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.020
<v Moderator - Emily>to the Figma app.

00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.030
<v P 08>How can I switch if I hit the X? Well.

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:50.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, sorry. Switch. Switch applications within

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:51.310
<v Moderator - Emily>the phone.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Go back to Figma instead of the browser that

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.870
<v Moderator - Emily>you're in right now. Yep, yep, exactly. Yep.

00:44:56.870 --> 00:45:00.230
<v Moderator - Emily>Right here. And let's see.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:02.750
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, Tapa. It likes to just kick us out

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:05.910
<v Moderator - Emily>of things, which is annoying. All right,

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:11.000
<v Moderator - Emily>let that go. Let that load up a bit.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, scroll and tap payments on the lower

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.640
<v Moderator - Emily>right. I'm going to get you back to exactly

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.800
<v Moderator - Emily>where we were. Tap on. Sorry, I'm sorry.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Go back one screen.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:26.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Go to the back to the payments page. Yep.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:29.560
<v Moderator - Emily>And then scroll down and tap into the blank

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.240
<v Moderator - Emily>gray area at the very. Yep, perfect. Tap

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:39.410
<v Moderator - Emily>on copays and again go into the review details

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Moderator - Emily>here.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:46.130
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And then. Yeah, so again, so this

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:48.450
<v Moderator - Emily>would be where you would actually get. Get

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.570
<v Moderator - Emily>back. But thoughts on finding the information

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:52.530
<v Moderator - Emily>you.

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:56.410
<v P 08>Would need here for copy option here. If

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:59.210
<v P 08>they didn't have that for the overpayments,

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:01.870
<v P 08>but having that here, very helpful. Where

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:04.190
<v P 08>you can just click on it and copies your

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.270
<v P 08>account number for you.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:06.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great.

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:13.030
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And let me see.

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:22.470
<v Moderator - Emily>Hi. Other. Other thoughts to share regarding

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:25.270
<v Moderator - Emily>anything you're seeing here with the coma.

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:29.140
<v Moderator - Emily>Sorry, copays. Any information that might

00:46:29.140 --> 00:46:30.100
<v Moderator - Emily>also be useful?

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:36.580
<v P 08>No, it's nice and simple. I like it.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:41.460
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, simple is good. And then any thoughts

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:44.260
<v Moderator - Emily>specifically how things are labeled? If there's

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.940
<v Moderator - Emily>anything else that would make things more

00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:46.220
<v Moderator - Emily>clear.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.060
<v Moderator - Emily>I know you said the help button will be more

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:51.020
<v Moderator - Emily>helpful if it said copay help, but any other

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.470
<v Moderator - Emily>sections that might be rename that make things

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.030
<v Moderator - Emily>more clear?

00:46:57.470 --> 00:47:01.110
<v P 08>Nope. I've never really done copays before,

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.870
<v P 08>so I don't know how much more you would need

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.670
<v P 08>besides this. So looks. Looks good.

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:10.590
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, got it. All right. And I believe

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:12.150
<v Moderator - Emily>those are all my questions. I'm going to

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:16.510
<v Moderator - Emily>check in with my colleagues if anyone has

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Moderator - Emily>any additional questions that I have not

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:21.980
<v Moderator - Emily>covered here. I don't see anything in the

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.100
<v Moderator - Emily>chat, but if anyone wants to unmute and ask,

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:27.020
<v Moderator - Emily>you may do so now.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.900
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, I'll take that as a no. But that

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.900
<v Moderator - Emily>is all we have. I really appreciate your

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.860
<v Moderator - Emily>time . It's always so important to have to

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:45.380
<v Moderator - Emily>talk with veterans about going through these

00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:47.710
<v Moderator - Emily>experiences to see what is important to and

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:51.390
<v Moderator - Emily>see how we can potentially make things better

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:54.510
<v Moderator - Emily>for everybody. So thank you for taking the

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:55.270
<v Moderator - Emily>time with us.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.310

<v Moderator - Emily>And I know will be reaching out to you shortly.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:04.790
<v Moderator - Emily>I don't know, at some point, at some point

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:08.070
<v Moderator - Emily>they'll be reaching out to you regarding

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:11.910
<v Moderator - Emily>this and yeah, that is it for us today. And

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:13.830
<v Moderator - Emily>I hope you have a wonderful rest of your

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:14.150
<v Moderator - Emily>day.

<v P 08>Thank you. Have a good one.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:17.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Thanks. Take care.
