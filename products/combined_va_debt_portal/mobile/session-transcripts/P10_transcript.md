"1  
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300  
Emily  
Ask those questions.  

"
"2  
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:08.480  
Emily  
ask those questions again. So to confirm, are you okay? If I record our video and audio as we talk today.  

"
"3  
00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:11.019  
P10  
It's no problem.  

"
"4  
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.819  
Emily  
Yeah, great. Thank you. And then, are you okay? If we potentially use some clips to show our Va partners from today.  

"
"5  
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.930  
P10  
Yes.  

"
"6  
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.359  
Emily  
Okay, great. Thank you.  

"
"7  
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:32.930  
Emily  
So first, st just overall questions I love and and whatever you are comfortable sharing, I'd love to know a bit about yourself as a veteran could be. What branch you served when you retired or separated.  

"
"8  
00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:39.180  
P10  
So I was in [redacted]. I was in from 2,007 to 2,011.  

"
"9  
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.879  
Emily  
Okay, great. And what sort of interaction and experience have you had with the Va. Since then?  

"
"10  
00:00:49.374 --> 00:00:55.459  
P10  
So I 1st got [redacted] in 2017, and and and June  

"
"11  
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.120  
P10  
I got [redacted]. So.  

"
"12  
00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.650  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.  

"
"13  
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.010  
P10  
So I've been dealing with the Va. For about 7 years. I guess.  

"
"14  
00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:05.389  
Emily  
Alright.  

"
"15  
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.940  
P10  
So any gears, I guess.  

"
"16  
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.590  
Emily  
Yeah. Okay, and oh, sorry. Go ahead.  

"
"17  
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.880  
P10  
Up into like vas from [redacted] as well. So I've been.  

"
"20  
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.490  
P10  
To quite a few different vas.  

"
"21  
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.209  
Emily  
Yeah, sounds like it, all right.  

"
"22  
00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:37.800  
Emily  
And what sort of experience have you had with the with with Va's website? And or the mobile app.  

"
"23  
00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:58.630  
P10  
I've been using both quite regularly since 2017. I've seen, like all the improvements that they've made over the years. It's definitely become a lot more user friendly. And then I've been seeing the updates that's been added to the app in the last couple of years as well. So.  

"
"24  
00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.970  
Emily  
Okay.  

"
"25  
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.069  
P10  
I would say, the advancement of the softwares, and everything like that has been  

"
"26  
00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:11.529  
P10  
pretty good it's been has been slowly modernized.  

"
"27  
00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:22.949  
Emily  
Nice, alright and in excuse me. In what? Instances? Would you use choose to use the mobile app over the website.  

"
"28  
00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:32.710  
P10  
The mobile app. I can just do like the 2 step authentication with my finger, or whatever. So it's definitely quicker.  

"
"29  
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.430  
P10  
And  

"
"30  
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.340  
P10  
if I so pretty much, you can do everything, I believe, on the mobile app, except like, do travel claims.  

"
"31  
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.450  
P10  
yeah. So it's it's  

"
"32  
00:02:48.600 --> 00:03:01.529  
P10  
it's comparable to the to the website. Now, there's a few things that you can't do on the mobile app but prime all the primary thing task and everything you can just do from your phone. That's what I've noticed.  

"
"33  
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:12.219  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And so you said, Is it you mentioned the the authentication? So is it. Is it easier on the mobile app. Is that why you're choosing that I just wanna make sure I'm understanding when you're.  

"
"34  
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.589  
P10  
Yes, faster, it's faster. It takes seconds. It takes seconds if I do it, to go through the website I have to  

"
"35  
00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:25.250  
P10  
go through if id me, and maybe it takes like a minute  

"
"36  
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.880  
P10  
to go through that process. So.  

"
"37  
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:52.090  
Emily  
Okay, got it great. So now we're moving on to the financial portion of the discussion. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have absolutely no information about you or your finances for the Va. So 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for things like benefit, overpayments.  

"
"38  
00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:05.470  
P10  
Yeah. So I was in school from [redacted]. And I was in the [redacted] program. So there was a overpayment  

"
"39  
00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:13.349  
P10  
and I think December of last year it finally got paid off. So they took like [redacted] bucks a month, for  

"
"40  
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.889  
P10  
I don't know. Maybe a year, I think.  

"
"41  
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.630  
Emily  
Got it.  

"
"42  
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:23.460  
Emily  
Okay? So so it sounds like that was paid off by your your benefits being reduced. Is that right?  

"
"43  
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.670  
P10  
It they got it automatically withdrew from my monthly deposit.  

"
"44  
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:35.320  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, all right. And do you recall how you originally notified of this debt?  

"
"45  
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.679  
P10  
So I wasn't notified.  

"
"46  
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.720  
Emily  
You weren't okay.  

"
"47  
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.087  
P10  
I wasn't notified.  

"
"48  
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.590  
P10  
And then I just I just happened to look at my deposit amounts one day.  

"
"49  
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:55.484  
P10  
and I was like, Oh, that doesn't look right. So I end up calling the BA. And then they end up explaining to me that  

"
"50  
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.540  
P10  
I had a school payment overpayment, so.  

"
"51  
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.700  
P10  
I may have received the letter, but I do not recall receiving a letter.  

"
"52  
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.609  
Emily  
Okay. They they said they had milled one.  

"
"53  
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.700  
P10  
Yeah.  

"
"54  
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.290  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.  

"
"55  
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.200  
P10  
And then, like on the on the website. If you see like overpayments, it never showed up there.  

"
"56  
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.710  
Emily  
Oh, okay, interesting. Okay. So it wouldn't. Didn't show up there.  

"
"57  
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:25.480  
Emily  
Good.  

"
"58  
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:35.379  
P10  
It didn't show up at all, so I was just getting deducted. That [redacted] bucks, and the only way I knew what it was is, I have to call and confirm.  

"
"59  
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.193  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.  

"
"60  
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:46.050  
Emily  
Got it? Alright. And then thoughts on how that whole process could have been made easier for you.  

"
"61  
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.700  
P10  
Some type of.  

"
"62  
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:59.829  
P10  
I mean, we live in a kind of a digital world these days. So some type of notification within the app or some type of email notification would have.  

"
"63  
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.230  
P10  
Helped. Because.  

"
"64  
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:19.330  
P10  
yeah, I mean, sometimes the the Va knows you multiple letters when you're going through the claims process. You're going through appointments and stuff like that. And every letter, if I get it digitally  

"
"65  
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:27.040  
P10  
like I may not open up the mail immediately. So just having some type of digital notification would have  

"
"66  
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.849  
P10  
assisted me. And you know, understanding what was happening.  

"
"67  
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.810  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.  

"
"68  
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:42.940  
Emily  
sounds good. Okay. And then, switching gears a tiny bit. Have you had any experience with paying any medical co-payments through the Va.  

"
"69  
00:06:44.250 --> 00:07:00.680  
P10  
I think I only did it once, and that's when I 1st got a service connected. I think it was in [redated] only did only did a a copayment once, and it was like $50 ago. Since then I have never paid anything.  

"
"70  
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:11.509  
Emily  
Okay. Got it? Alright. So let me have you have you share your screen now, and let me know if you need any help doing that.  

"
"71  
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.570  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"72  
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.430  
P10  
you just hit the share button right?  

"
"73  
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:30.810  
Emily  
Yep.  

"
"74  
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.130  
P10  
And then.  

"
"75  
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:33.870  
Emily  
Extra permissions.  

"
"76  
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.060  
P10  
And then screen. After that.  

"
"77  
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:36.530  
Emily  
Yep.  

"
"78  
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.069  
P10  
So it was giving me a list. Do I choose zoom.  

"
"79  
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.929  
Emily  
Yeah. So it's 2. Zoom should probably be at the bottom. It's usually alphabetical.  

"
"80  
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.930  
P10  
Yeah, yeah, it's disabled art.  

"
"81  
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:09.419  
Emily  
Alright great and then let me have you share screen. So let me have you open up the mobile app figma. Now.  

"
"82  
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.025  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"83  
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.480  
P10  
I have it opened.  

"
"84  
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:31.930  
Emily  
Okay. And I'm gonna get so go to login. I'm gonna give you some test credentials. Here.  

"
"85  
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.970  
P10  
All right.  

"
"86  
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:47.930  
Emily  
Okay, so the email is going to be VA test 0 0  

"
"87  
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.040  
Emily  
at gmail.com.  

"
"88  
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:04.699  
P10  
And the password is gonna be VAVA VAVA.  

"
"89  
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.470  
Emily  
8 characters.  

"
"90  
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:19.630  
Emily  
Okay? And I'll just need to get the authentication code. So give me just a moment.  

"
"91  
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:24.499  
Emily  
Okay, it's gonna okay. Code is 6, 0, 6,  

"
"92  
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.619  
Emily  
7, 9, 7, 3.  

"
"93  
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.300  
Emily  
All right, continue with the app.  

"
"94  
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:55.429  
Emily  
Okay? And then I'm gonna send a link to the Zoom chat.  

"
"95  
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:03.639  
Emily  
If you can switch back to zoom and open up that message to tap on this link.  

"
"96  
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.000  
P10  
It's an error.  

"
"97  
00:10:19.546 --> 00:10:25.279  
Emily  
Can you switch back to let me see if it's not available? Try again. Go go back to zoom.  

"
"98  
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.730  
Emily  
Yeah.  

"
"99  
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.779  
P10  
Do I need to do this right here? Tap.  

"
"100  
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:51.760  
Emily  
No, that you can just tap anywhere outside of that. It just it. Sometimes it's a little bit slow, but it looks like it's working.  

"
"101  
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.820  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"102  
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:04.210  
Emily  
Yeah, there we go. All right. We have it here. Okay, so here we have our fake mobile app here.  

"
"103  
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:19.480  
Emily  
So first, st without any sort of tapping. You can scroll around, certainly, but just don't tap. Don't yet tap into anything. Where would you expect to find information on money that you owe specifically for overpayments?  

"
"104  
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.050  
P10  
I mean it should be on this 1st page.  

"
"105  
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.370  
P10  
I would think it would be right below last payment.  

"
"106  
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:35.599  
Emily  
Okay, what?  

"
"107  
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.439  
P10  
Something that was like. I don't know if you're getting.  

"
"108  
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:41.810  
Emily  
It. It'd be what sorry I missed that.  

"
"109  
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.740  
P10  
I said. If there was some like itemized thing right below last payment showing deductions that would be.  

"
"110  
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.550  
P10  
I think that's where it should be, or even on the payments. Page.  

"
"111  
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.420  
Emily  
Okay. Got it  

"
"112  
00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:04.279  
Emily  
all right. Thoughts on. Since you mentioned that that payments page thoughts on the the title of that.  

"
"113  
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.250  
P10  
Payments.  

"
"114  
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.130  
Emily  
Yep.  

"
"115  
00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.740  
P10  
I mean, I think the the title is clear. I mean.  

"
"116  
00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:23.460  
P10  
yeah, I think I mean, I think it's fine.  

"
"117  
00:12:23.934 --> 00:12:28.600  
Emily  
Okay, great. I'll have you tap into that. Since you mentioned that the the payments, tab.  

"
"118  
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:29.850  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"119  
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:30.670  
Emily  
Okay.  

"
"120  
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:44.669  
Emily  
and in this scenario we will. We will pretend that you that you also have medical copays. But thoughts on what you're seeing here, especially as it relates to the the title of payments.  

"
"121  
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.410  
P10  
I mean, this is.  

"
"122  
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:55.809  
P10  
I mean this. This makes sense like the overpayment for debts and co-pays listed here on this page. This makes sense.  

"
"123  
00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:57.920  
P10  
So.  

"
"124  
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:11.999  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And how about the the bit of information that is below the words overpayment debts and below Copays? What sort of information. Might you want to know? There.  

"
"125  
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:16.690  
P10  
If I click the arrow, would it list what it's for?  

"
"126  
00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:31.079  
Emily  
We'll we'll we'll get to that very shortly. But I'm I'm wondering what like what might be the most helpful specifically from this screen to know, for either the overpayment or the co-pays.  

"
"127  
00:13:32.962 --> 00:13:41.770  
P10  
I think this information is pretty clear like it says the total amount, and then the number of different debts you owe, and then, for the co-pays  

"
"128  
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:47.280  
P10  
has a total, and then there's 2 bills. So I mean with  

"
"129  
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:55.420  
P10  
I mean, normally, you should know a veteran should know if they have some type of overpayment  

"
"130  
00:13:56.233 --> 00:13:58.489  
P10  
or copays due cause.  

"
"131  
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.030  
P10  
When you go to  

"
"132  
00:14:01.621 --> 00:14:09.420  
P10  
you should get some receipt or notification, or something like that. When you go to the Va. Or to an outpatient clinic for the co-pays  

"
"133  
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.720  
P10  
and  

"
"134  
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:18.820  
P10  
for the debts. I mean. I'm pretty sure a lot of veterans are watching their deposits every month, so  

"
"135  
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.640  
P10  
If they got overpaid they probably know.  

"
"136  
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:30.439  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Great so if you want, you can tap into the overpayment debt. Since we talked about that.  

"
"137  
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.920  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"138  
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:42.489  
Emily  
And then thoughts here on overall. How clear is it? What what you owe, and what sort of information would you be looking for here.  

"
"139  
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.799  
P10  
It seems like  

"
"140  
00:14:51.010 --> 00:15:01.530  
P10  
I mean, I guess it's pretty, is. It looks pretty clear and standard information that I would expect to see that the full sign, the gi bill for housing.  

"
"141  
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:06.089  
P10  
I know I've I've heard of veterans getting overpaid for that.  

"
"142  
00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:14.960  
P10  
I don't know for the for the books how you would get an overpayment for that, but it's listed.  

"
"143  
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.490  
P10  
And  

"
"144  
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:23.640  
P10  
yeah, it looks like it looks pretty straightforward.  

"
"145  
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.360  
Emily  
Exactly  

"
"146  
00:15:25.747 --> 00:15:35.470  
Emily  
if and then, in this pretense pretend scenario. If you were to incur a new debt, how would you expect to know that there is something new here.  

"
"147  
00:15:36.908 --> 00:15:42.220  
P10  
Some type of like on payments like if you put like a  

"
"148  
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:58.619  
P10  
So a lot of apps when you have an update. There's like a red dot or something like that. So if you had like, some type of dot or number  

"
"149  
00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.060  
P10  
above payments like when you go onto the app.  

"
"150  
00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:07.679  
P10  
I see some type of notification. So you click it. And then you can see that information.  

"
"151  
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.810  
Emily  
Okay, got it, got it?  

"
"152  
00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:22.730  
Emily  
And then how about if there was a debt listed or a debt here that has already paid, been paid off. What if anything, would you want to see here regarding that debt.  

"
"153  
00:16:24.725 --> 00:16:25.960  
P10  
Closed.  

"
"154  
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.850  
Emily  
Closed. Okay.  

"
"155  
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.090  
P10  
Some type of yeah clothes or some type of other  

"
"156  
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.220  
P10  
wording that says it's been paid.  

"
"157  
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:42.020  
Emily  
Okay, got it and let me have you scroll to the top.  

"
"158  
00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:45.570  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"159  
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:58.819  
Emily  
So that the top one for housing. Let me have you tap into that and have a look to see what information would be important to you for this particular debt.  

"
"160  
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.738  
P10  
So for this or whatever.  

"
"161  
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:28.369  
P10  
I mean, all this stuff looks great that I'm seeing here. The only thing that kind of shocked me to see is the late fee.  

"
"162  
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.700  
Emily  
Okay.  

"
"163  
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.379  
P10  
If it's being automatically deducted from your Va.  

"
"164  
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.980  
P10  
Money, your disability compensation.  

"
"165  
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:43.469  
P10  
Why would a late fee even be calculated in?  

"
"166  
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:48.470  
P10  
That's the only thing that comes to mind immediately. But I mean this, this looks  

"
"167  
00:17:49.512 --> 00:17:53.400  
P10  
like it should look. I I would say.  

"
"168  
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:59.102  
Emily  
Okay, so we'll we'll pretend that this particular debt  

"
"169  
00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:15.090  
Emily  
has to be directly paid as as opposed to having it being deducted from from your benefits, thought what specifically or what pieces of information would be important for you to know here, knowing that.  

"
"170  
00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.299  
P10  
Well, it has a due date on it, and  

"
"171  
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.270  
P10  
and I guess at the bottom it it says that  

"
"172  
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.550  
P10  
you were sent a letter. So  

"
"173  
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.530  
P10  
I mean, this information looks pretty straightforward.  

"
"174  
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.739  
Emily  
Okay. Got it  

"
"175  
00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:48.680  
Emily  
since you brought the the debt letter. What might you use that section for, or what what might be important in regards to the Debt letter, history.  

"
"176  
00:18:49.934 --> 00:18:54.280  
P10  
If you can click it and see the letter digitally.  

"
"177  
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.049  
Emily  
Okay, got it.  

"
"178  
00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:09.299  
Emily  
And thoughts on anything. You might or yeah, any other. Any other information you might want here, or anything you might want to do from here.  

"
"179  
00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:20.137  
P10  
So may I see the demand? Letter?  

"
"180  
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:28.010  
P10  
When you see the words, why might I have this debt? So if it gives a clear and concise, like explanation. Why.  

"
"181  
00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:36.900  
P10  
cause maybe you're confused, I guess, and you don't know why, even if you did see the the debt letter down there, so  

"
"182  
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.680  
P10  
maybe some direct contact information.  

"
"183  
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:41.540  
Emily  
Hmm.  

"
"184  
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.649  
P10  
Or something like that to reach out.  

"
"185  
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:55.439  
Emily  
So what I I know you said so. In case you weren't aware why you had the debt. Other reasons you might want to reach out to them.  

"
"186  
00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.699  
P10  
Yeah, so I would. Wanna I would wanna call  

"
"187  
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.470  
P10  
and talk to someone if I didn't understand why I was being  

"
"188  
00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.960  
P10  
why, there was an overpayment.  

"
"189  
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.040  
P10  
So some type of contact information.  

"
"190  
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.730  
P10  
But maybe the debt letter has that on it  

"
"191  
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.750  
P10  
or the demand letter. I don't know.  

"
"192  
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:22.719  
Emily  
Alright. Are there other places you might expect to find contact information.  

"
"193  
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:27.189  
P10  
Well, I would assume it might be on a demand letter, but  

"
"194  
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:36.150  
P10  
it might not. They'll probably just have a standard Va. 800 number on there. But if I were to well, if you have contact.  

"
"195  
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:39.179  
P10  
just added a contact block or something like that  

"
"196  
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.420  
P10  
up under, why, I might have this debt.  

"
"197  
00:20:43.668 --> 00:20:45.999  
P10  
That would probably be cool, because.  

"
"198  
00:20:46.584 --> 00:20:53.869  
P10  
maybe you can just reach out immediately and get a direct person instead of going through the 800 number  

"
"199  
00:20:54.030 --> 00:21:03.310  
P10  
and clicking all the prompts just to get to someone who transfers you. So if you had direct contact information about this specific debt  

"
"200  
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.119  
P10  
that would probably be good.  

"
"201  
00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:13.517  
Emily  
Okay? And then, since you mentioned the why might I have this debt? Let me have you tap into that and see  

"
"202  
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.469  
Emily  
your your thoughts on the information there.  

"
"203  
00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.329  
P10  
Yeah, that's pretty standard.  

"
"204  
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:24.650  
P10  
It's pretty standard, but it is not, is.  

"
"205  
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.090  
P10  
It gives you 3 options to ponder.  

"
"206  
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:37.779  
P10  
So instead of 3 options, if there was some way to know exactly what it is, and that's why I was mentioning the  

"
"207  
00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:43.359  
P10  
some type of way to contact about it. A direct line to contact.  

"
"208  
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.689  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.  

"
"209  
00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:59.609  
P10  
Like, if you if you're in this situation, you know you're suspended. You know you're on academic probation. You know you withdrew from class or you, and you know you've received duplicate payments. But I would want exactly why  

"
"210  
00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:04.849  
P10  
that would be helpful, instead of having to think about all 3 of these things.  

"
"211  
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:12.219  
Emily  
Okay, makes sense. So was it, is it here you would want the contact information or somewhere else.  

"
"212  
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:19.569  
P10  
Maybe below this link that I clicked. [link = ""why might I have this debt""]  

"
"213  
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:26.129  
Emily  
Okay, I got it. Let me have you go tap close here.  

"
"214  
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:48.949  
Emily  
so we'll we'll pretend that this part of the new app is, is built as is just as you're seeing if it were built like this, how? And knowing things that you were looking for, that you were not able to find. How likely do you think it would be that you would use it.  

"
"215  
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:54.770  
P10  
I mean, it gives me enough information to go off of.  

"
"216  
00:22:55.240 --> 00:23:02.549  
P10  
so I would definitely use it just to have some information.  

"
"217  
00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:14.619  
P10  
I mean, you don't have to look that far like if you just go to payments, it's like 3 clicks, and you know exactly what you're being deducted by. So  

"
"218  
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.630  
P10  
think that's pretty convenient.  

"
"219  
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:29.930  
Emily  
Okay, great let me have you tap on the payments button on the lower right. I'm gonna get you to a different section. Have a few more questions, and then scroll all the way to the bottom.  

"
"220  
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:35.930  
Emily  
and then the the blank gray area. Tap once into that  

"
"221  
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:42.140  
Emily  
great and then tap on overpayment debts again. Excuse me.  

"
"222  
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:51.939  
Emily  
Okay, so this is slightly different. So again, we're gonna look at that this, this top  

"
"223  
00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:55.889  
Emily  
debt. Here the the debt for housing  

"
"224  
00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:05.340  
Emily  
thoughts on on the information here and again, what other steps you might want to take from the app here  

"
"225  
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.379  
Emily  
specifically for for that? Yep.  

"
"226  
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:13.689  
P10  
Well, it's definitely a lot different, because it says review details.  

"
"227  
00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:21.109  
P10  
So I would expect it to give me some type of itemized information, and it gives you a resolved debt. So  

"
"228  
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.890  
P10  
if you choose to pay hit off, I'm ex.  

"
"229  
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:31.720  
P10  
I would assume that. You can just click this, and you know. Get to a payment screen.  

"
"230  
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.300  
P10  
So there's definitely a lot more information.  

"
"231  
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:41.570  
Emily  
Okay? Yeah. And you can. You can go ahead and and tap through and see what what you'd want to do here.  

"
"232  
00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:58.050  
P10  
Yeah, yeah, like this, pay a line other ways to pay. And you can request help so that  

"
"233  
00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:03.059  
P10  
that's cool it definitely simplifies, the whole process.  

"
"234  
00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:04.989  
Emily  
Okay, great.  

"
"235  
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:09.459  
Emily  
When when you say simplifies the whole process, can you say more about that?  

"
"236  
00:25:10.873 --> 00:25:14.949  
P10  
So if I you know, maybe I don't want  

"
"237  
00:25:15.633 --> 00:25:22.439  
P10  
I wanna take care of this. So I just hit resolve that pay online  

"
"238  
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.210  
P10  
and then other ways to pay. I can, you know, pretty much. Just click.  

"
"239  
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:31.010  
P10  
resolve that hit, pay online or other ways.  

"
"240  
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:38.109  
P10  
And then maybe I don't have the money, so hit. Request, help to see what type of services are available. So  

"
"241  
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.590  
P10  
that's pretty straightforward for me.  

"
"242  
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.620  
Emily  
Okay. Great.  

"
"243  
00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:44.400  
P10  
So.  

"
"244  
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:54.330  
Emily  
Yeah. So, following up on something you just said, we're gonna pretend that you don't have the money, and you said you would tap the request, help! Let me let me let me have you do that to see  

"
"245  
00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:58.690  
Emily  
if that would be what you might be looking for.  

"
"246  
00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:06.270  
P10  
Oh, yeah, that makes sense.  

"
"247  
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.140  
Emily  
Okay.  

"
"248  
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.096  
P10  
It's kind of like transunion, or whatever.  

"
"249  
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.390  
Emily  
It's it's like what sorry.  

"
"250  
00:26:20.114 --> 00:26:22.049  
P10  
Transunion, like the creditors.  

"
"251  
00:26:23.478 --> 00:26:25.423  
Emily  
You can dispute  

"
"252  
00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.079  
P10  
Yeah, man, this, this is good. I think this is great.  

"
"253  
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:44.749  
Emily  
Great. All right, let me have you close that, and then we'll pretend that you are ready to make a payment. Let me have you walk through that process, and I promise I won't have you enter in any real information.  

"
"254  
00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:45.890  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"255  
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.540  
P10  
So should I hit the pay.  

"
"256  
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.289  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll. We'll pretend that you are actually going to pay.  

"
"257  
00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:02.280  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"258  
00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:05.109  
Emily  
To see what what the process feels like to you.  

"
"259  
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:25.070  
Emily  
so I'll have you tap. I know there's a lot to read, so I won't, I'll actually have you? Have you been to this site before? I know you said your your debt was just removed from your benefits? But have you? Have you made any payments through this site before.  

"
"260  
00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.610  
P10  
No, I've never seen this before.  

"
"261  
00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:49.169  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Great so again, I know there's a lot. So I'm just gonna have you skip ahead. And there's a there's 2 small pay online buttons that the teal ones is one toward the top and one toward the bottom tap. Either one of those there we go, and then a section in the middle where there are some blank spaces. Let me get your thoughts on  

"
"262  
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.379  
Emily  
what you would need to actually pay anything here.  

"
"263  
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.670  
P10  
Okay, so the for the veteran information.  

"
"264  
00:28:00.115 --> 00:28:04.960  
P10  
The file number pay pay number.  

"
"265  
00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:11.178  
P10  
I would. I mean, maybe this information. Once you click that link through the  

"
"266  
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:23.910  
P10  
through the app. Maybe it should auto fill, because I would know I wouldn't know my phone number offhand. I wouldn't know my pay number off hand as well.  

"
"267  
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.050  
P10  
So, or the deduction code.  

"
"268  
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:34.369  
P10  
So maybe that information needs to be auto filled just for convenience, because you'll be going back and forth  

"
"269  
00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:43.209  
P10  
like, I'm gonna have to screenshot the file number or copy the file number, which I don't even think you can copy and paste in the app. So  

"
"270  
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:51.346  
P10  
maybe that information needs to be automatically filled in. For convenience. If you're clicking through the app,  

"
"271  
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:57.469  
P10  
the rest information, first, st name, last name, phone a standard  

"
"272  
00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:02.099  
P10  
and what amount you want to pay. So that's that's pretty straightforward.  

"
"273  
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:10.149  
Emily  
Okay, and let me let me have you switch back to the figma app. Just wanted to have you look@thisfirstst  

"
"274  
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.809  
Emily  
Okay? Actually hold on just a moment because switch head to. You know.  

"
"275  
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.400  
Emily  
this. Does this a lot hold on a second.  

"
"276  
00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:26.190  
Emily  
I'm gonna send you a different link in the zoom, chat.  

"
"277  
00:29:26.907 --> 00:29:31.500  
P10  
There should be one that yeah, so tap that second link.  

"
"278  
00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.879  
Emily  
It'll just be a slight shortcut to where I want us to go.  

"
"279  
00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:42.800  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"280  
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:49.479  
Emily  
Okay, so tap on payments again, and then overpayment debts.  

"
"281  
00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:54.660  
Emily  
review details  

"
"282  
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:18.500  
Emily  
and resolve debt and then pay online. Just going to get you back to the screen that you were okay. This one. Yes. So my hope was that this screen would stay when when you came back to Figma. But that doesn't always happen. So talk to me about I know you said that it would be convenient for things to Autofill  

"
"283  
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:30.030  
Emily  
if they were not. If you were, if you just had this information. And then we're, as you said, going back and forth. Talk to me about how you might do that what sort of experience that might be.  

"
"284  
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.389  
P10  
Like, I said. I don't think you can.  

"
"285  
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.590  
P10  
If I held the number just to copy it. Can I do that?  

"
"286  
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.150  
P10  
I don't think you can copy and paste in the app.  

"
"287  
00:30:41.361 --> 00:30:45.589  
Emily  
I'm not sure. Well, especially not here. This is Figma. So I'm actually not sure but it was so.  

"
"288  
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.770  
P10  
Would that be something.  

"
"289  
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:47.989  
Emily  
You. Oh, sorry! Go ahead.  

"
"290  
00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.539  
P10  
I don't think you can, for sure.  

"
"291  
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:59.110  
Emily  
What? So, knowing that you're not able to copy what else do you think you might? You might do if you were trying to pay.  

"
"292  
00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:05.410  
P10  
I'll just have to. Just switch screens, you know.  

"
"293  
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.200  
Emily  
Remember the number type it in. It doesn't.  

"
"294  
00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:14.889  
P10  
Apps. When you go back and forth it'll remove the numbers.  

"
"295  
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:18.040  
P10  
It'll start you over so hopefully. That doesn't happen.  

"
"296  
00:31:18.366 --> 00:31:19.670  
Emily  
Good point. Okay. Yep.  

"
"297  
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.970  
Emily  
I also hope that would not. Not one that would not would not happen. Okay, okay.  

"
"298  
00:31:27.253 --> 00:31:46.120  
Emily  
and then, so okay, we're we're gonna pretend that you have made the payment after you have made the payment, what would how or what? What would you expect to see, and how quickly with with within the app, after you've made that payment.  

"
"299  
00:31:47.465 --> 00:31:50.090  
P10  
Some type of payment confirmation.  

"
"300  
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:54.239  
P10  
I would like to receive an email saying that.  

"
"301  
00:31:55.255 --> 00:32:04.490  
P10  
your payment was processed. And then when I go, if I go, maybe the balance is reduced.  

"
"302  
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:16.530  
Emily  
Okay,  

"
"303  
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:30.640  
Emily  
And then oh, I forgot to ask question before since we talked about getting help in terms of payment plans or disputing debts.  

"
"304  
00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:35.900  
Emily  
How or or had you been aware that there are options like that.  

"
"305  
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.110  
P10  
No, I did not know that.  

"
"306  
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:39.709  
Emily  
Did not. Okay, got it?  

"
"307  
00:32:40.523 --> 00:33:00.090  
Emily  
And then ask another question that I asked before if the app were to be built just like this, how you're seeing, and that that includes the having to go back and forth between a browser and the mobile app to pay. How likely do you think it would be that you would use it, as is.  

"
"308  
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:08.785  
P10  
Well, I mean, that's the only option that you have, and it's the most convenient. I would definitely just go through the process.  

"
"309  
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:17.920  
P10  
yeah, I would just go through the process if that was the most convenient option versus going to a browser.  

"
"310  
00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:24.459  
P10  
Or or talk to someone on the phone. This, I think, is, if sufficient enough.  

"
"311  
00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:48.159  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And then how about comparing the 2 versions that we've seen with this one version, one being here where there is the payment option that you'd have to switch back and forth, and the 1st option sorry, the 1st version being where there were not any mentions of payments. Which one do you think you would be more likely to use? And why.  

"
"312  
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:56.100  
P10  
Yeah, the second one for sure, because it gives itemized information and options to resolve.  

"
"313  
00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:01.379  
P10  
However, you choose to so definitely. The second option is better.  

"
"314  
00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.060  
Emily  
Okay, got it.  

"
"315  
00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:04.050  
Emily  
It's good  

"
"316  
00:34:04.890 --> 00:34:20.669  
Emily  
and maybe a tap back after overall question. Other thoughts on anything we're seeing here. It could be any additional information you might want to have, or any clarity, or the naming of anything.  

"
"317  
00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:35.690  
P10  
The only thing, I think, would be a little confusing for veterans who never seen this information before is the deduction code.  

"
"318  
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:36.840  
Emily  
Hmm.  

"
"319  
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:49.310  
P10  
But but if you're you know you have school benefits and stuff like that you should be aware  

"
"320  
00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.600  
P10  
of  

"
"321  
00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:59.646  
P10  
all this information as far as like payments. If you did did get overpaid for something. And you know what  

"
"322  
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.599  
P10  
program you're using.  

"
"323  
00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:11.129  
P10  
So chapter 30, chapter 31 program that you're enrolled in. So that's all.  

"
"324  
00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.889  
P10  
Everything else good.  

"
"325  
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:21.009  
Emily  
Okay, sounds good. And I'll quickly go through another section and maybe you tap on the payments again.  

"
"326  
00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:34.749  
Emily  
All right. And we're gonna I know you said. You've only had one copay that you can recall. We're gonna pretend that you have Copay. So let me have you tap into the copay information.  

"
"327  
00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.280  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"328  
00:35:38.309 --> 00:35:46.689  
Emily  
And then thoughts on overall the information presented here. What do you think would be important for you to know.  

"
"329  
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:58.280  
P10  
So how's the Va where the copay occurred? Looks like you can redo review the details on what it was for.  

"
"330  
00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.169  
P10  
You can pay the bill.  

"
"331  
00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.760  
P10  
Yeah, this looks pretty straightforward.  

"
"332  
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:06.310  
Emily  
Okay?  

"
"333  
00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:16.519  
Emily  
And for that the the top one, the James A. Haley hospital. What information specifically for that one? Would you need to know.  

"
"334  
00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:27.550  
P10  
Well, maybe the you can have have the date that the debt occurred.  

"
"335  
00:36:30.120 --> 00:36:32.620  
P10  
Maybe that is that up under review details.  

"
"336  
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:39.140  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah, if you sorry. If you if you want to tap into that, you can see if that that shows you things that you would be looking for.  

"
"337  
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.529  
P10  
Yes, so it does have that  

"
"338  
00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:52.474  
P10  
as a medication that you were charged for, and everything. So yeah, this this looks pretty straightforward.  

"
"339  
00:36:54.190 --> 00:37:05.720  
P10  
it looks like. Also you can. I don't know. The account number was that for, but looks like you can copy that information directly from that which is cool and you can download a statement.  

"
"340  
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.970  
Emily  
All right  

"
"341  
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:17.869  
Emily  
regarding the the statements. Are our statements something that you use could be in really any aspect of your life. Now.  

"
"342  
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.380  
P10  
For sure. Always download anything I have just to keep on on record in case anything happens.  

"
"343  
00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:31.700  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? And is that something? You might do from the app, since there, there's the the statements here.  

"
"344  
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:48.330  
P10  
Yeah, cause. Now, I can download my benefit verification letter and stuff like that through the app. So having access to these Pdfs immediately it it. I think it makes everything more clear and concise and straightforward.  

"
"345  
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:57.200  
Emily  
Okay, great and let me have you tap into that. Pdf, since we've we're talking about that just to get a sense of what is here, and what might be useful for you.  

"
"346  
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:18.421  
P10  
I mean, this is an invoice. So. I think this is good. I mean, you can't have everything listed. It has education listed.  

"
"347  
00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:27.479  
P10  
I don't. If you're paying by mail, you can enter this information. So that's I mean, this looks pretty great. Let me see if there is a  

"
"348  
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:34.079  
P10  
Where is it? Oh, so it gives you where to mail it to, and everything like that. So.  

"
"349  
00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:45.200  
P10  
yeah, this is, I mean, I would assume this would help a lot of veterans with  

"
"350  
00:38:45.440 --> 00:39:01.030  
P10  
this process, because it it gives you a formal formal documentation on everything. It's like receiving a bill that you for these or whatever. So yeah, I think this should help a lot of veterans  

"
"351  
00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.649  
P10  
that might have overpayments or copays.  

"
"352  
00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:11.039  
Emily  
Okay, got it all right. You can press done there.  

"
"353  
00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.193  
Emily  
Okay, and then  

"
"354  
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:32.320  
Emily  
if you were to, we're going to pretend that you see an error, for, let's say, one of those prescriptions you're sure that you didn't order or didn't didn't arrive. What would you do in that case, knowing that there was an error on this.  

"
"355  
00:39:33.942 --> 00:39:37.109  
P10  
So you're talking about, for under the statement charges.  

"
"356  
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:47.300  
Emily  
Yeah. Yeah. So let's say, like that that. That second medication was something that that you didn't order or or didn't arrive, or something. What what would you do? In that case?  

"
"357  
00:39:48.326 --> 00:39:50.309  
P10  
I would definitely click it  

"
"358  
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.830  
P10  
if I could click it and.  

"
"359  
00:39:53.990 --> 00:40:02.489  
Emily  
That that top one you should be should be able to click. So we'll we'll pretend that you did not actually go to that doctor appointment if you wanna. So I think that one you can click into.  

"
"360  
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.759  
P10  
Yeah, I would want some type of way to I guess. Dispute.  

"
"361  
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.620  
Emily  
Okay.  

"
"362  
00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:19.099  
P10  
Or let them know not receive something like that.  

"
"363  
00:40:19.387 --> 00:40:24.270  
Emily  
And and what sort of information would you be looking for? In order to do that.  

"
"364  
00:40:25.428 --> 00:40:27.721  
P10  
So once I click it.  

"
"365  
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:33.601  
P10  
Well, I don't know if I if if it's not clicking  

"
"366  
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:41.260  
P10  
if there was a way to confirm that you received medication.  

"
"367  
00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:46.590  
P10  
Or confirm, or deny something like that.  

"
"368  
00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:47.819  
Emily  
Okay, got it.  

"
"369  
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:57.800  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you go back to Copay Bill, just on the upper left there to get one screen back there you go alright.  

"
"370  
00:40:59.207 --> 00:41:08.119  
Emily  
Any any any place here you might expect to find any like any sort of contact information that we were like we were discussing a moment ago.  

"
"371  
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:15.510  
P10  
Well, it should be in on the it's on the Pdf. Right now. I saw it on the Pdf.  

"
"372  
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:16.350  
Emily  
Okay. Yeah.  

"
"373  
00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:20.990  
P10  
So I mean, that has all the information you're gonna need.  

"
"374  
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.520  
Emily  
Okay?  

"
"375  
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:39.619  
Emily  
And then let's pretend that you are ready to pay this. Walk me through what you would do in this case. And again, like before, not going to have you enter in any real information at all.  

"
"376  
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.850  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"377  
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:49.820  
P10  
yeah, it gives you 4 different options. So  

"
"378  
00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:06.200  
P10  
so I will say that maybe some older vets will probably prefer prefer to pay by phone or mail or in person.  

"
"379  
00:42:06.763 --> 00:42:12.270  
P10  
Younger bets will, you know, probably definitely opt into the pay online. So  

"
"380  
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:18.720  
P10  
I guess it really just depends on the age demographic, on which one, but it definitely gives you 4 options.  

"
"381  
00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:20.660  
P10  
So, so.  

"
"382  
00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:26.650  
Emily  
So let let me let me have you go through the process for for paying online.  

"
"383  
00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:28.070  
P10  
Okay.  

"
"384  
00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:39.570  
Emily  
And we have you tap on. Continue to the form. We'll just skip over this.  

"
"385  
00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:54.759  
Emily  
So really, the yeah, so that that middle section there. Yeah. Thought, oh, yeah, yeah. Go ahead.  

"
"386  
00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:56.719  
P10  
For the account number.  

"
"387  
00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.239  
P10  
Yeah, that's like the same thing from before.  

"
"388  
00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:07.170  
P10  
Having to remember this number.  

"
"389  
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.840  
Emily  
Okay, and let me have you switch back to Figma.  

"
"390  
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:15.716  
Emily  
With any luck it will stay where we left it. Let's see if that is the case.  

"
"391  
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:20.190  
P10  
No.  

"
"392  
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:25.129  
Emily  
Nope, go back to go back to zoom.  

"
"393  
00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:27.610  
P10  
But those.  

"
"394  
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:06.140  
Emily  
Okay. And yeah, there we go. Copays review details.  

"
"395  
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.099  
P10  
Yeah, but you can copy, you can copy this. So, yeah.  

"
"396  
00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:11.670  
Emily  
Right? Yeah, yeah, I just want to get back to that.  

"
"397  
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:12.740  
P10  
Oh, I mean.  

"
"398  
00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:25.819  
P10  
that's good. Yeah. You can at least copy the number and copy and paste and enter it in. Only thing is like, I will say that  

"
"399  
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:36.469  
P10  
when you copy it and then paste it. Is it gonna try to fill in one cell? Or is it gonna automatically add the numbers to all the cells.  

"
"400  
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.780  
Emily  
The goal is  

"
"401  
00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:47.588  
Emily  
into all 5. That's a very good question. So I know I know we wanted to do that. I'm not a developer, so I don't know the details of how possible it is. But that's what we want.  

"
"402  
00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:53.355  
P10  
Yeah, that's possible. I've seen it before, but some web, some websites don't have that functionality.  

"
"403  
00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:58.060  
P10  
Go into the 1st sale, and then you have to like.  

"
"404  
00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:04.430  
P10  
delete everything and then enter everything separately. So as long as you copy this and  

"
"405  
00:45:04.901 --> 00:45:10.199  
P10  
it fills in all the cells on the on the other page. It should be fine.  

"
"406  
00:45:10.448 --> 00:45:11.441  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Yep.  

"
"407  
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:28.849  
Emily  
okay. So those those are my questions here. Anything else to add regarding the stuff that we've looked at, or maybe anything you haven't mentioned on things that could be useful in regards to the finance stuff here.  

"
"408  
00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:34.640  
P10  
So on this page right here the co-payment.  

"
"409  
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.150  
P10  
It doesn't have the amount.  

"
"410  
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.509  
P10  
It doesn't have any information.  

"
"411  
00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.970  
P10  
So so maybe you want to make a partial payment.  

"
"412  
00:45:45.965 --> 00:45:59.480  
P10  
Or you forgot the total. I don't know so it should at least should have the total amount owned owed, and then you enter the amount you want to pay. So having some type of  

"
"413  
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:08.769  
P10  
some type of information on the payment page, so so it's easier, I guess.  

"
"414  
00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:10.519  
Emily  
Yeah, okay, got it?  

"
"415  
00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:17.669  
Emily  
Any? So yeah, that's that's a very good point. Anything else that that could be useful from the app.  

"
"416  
00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.649  
P10  
No, I think that's I think that's pretty. That's pretty much all.  

"
"417  
00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:40.060  
P10  
Okay. They give you a number at the bottom. Give you the hours you can contact. So.  

"
"418  
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:40.400  
Emily  
Yeah.  

"
"419  
00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.259  
P10  
And then you're setting the total.  

"
"420  
00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:55.340  
Emily  
Okay, great so we're at time here. I'm gonna check in with my colleague, Natalie. If you have any questions you can unmute and ask, now.  

"
"421  
00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:12.040  
Emily  
okay, that is it for us. So oh, logged off. All right, we're done. There we go.  

"
