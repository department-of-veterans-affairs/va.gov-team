00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.280
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm sorry, the recording. Wanted to confirm.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Moderator - Emily>Are you comfortable if I record the screen

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Moderator - Emily>and audio as we talk today?

<v P 02>Yes, go ahead.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And are you comfortable if we

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Moderator - Emily>decide to use a recorded clip for the discussion

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.880
<v Moderator - Emily>today with the VA partners?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.360
<v P 02>Of course, of course.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Thank you. All right, now on to the actual

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Moderator - Emily>discussion. I'd love to know just little

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.220
<v Moderator - Emily>bit about you as a veteran branch of milit.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Sorry, what branch of military did you serve

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Moderator - Emily>and when did you retire or separate?

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.020
<v P 02>I served in the [redacted]. I went in in 79

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.700
<v P 02>and got out in 86.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.740
<v P 02>And I quit working well over 10 years ago.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.370
<v P 02>I was diagnosed with [redacted]

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.130
<v P 02>and was deemed disabled by Social Security.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.610
<v P 02>So I, I've been disabled. I do have a part

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.050
<v P 02>time job. I'm an [redacted] and

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.410
<v P 02>I work a couple days a week doing that.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, that sounds pretty interesting actually.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so I'd love to know what sort

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250
<v Moderator - Emily>of involvement you have with Veteran Affairs.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Moderator - Emily>It's gonna be both the past and now and any,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Moderator - Emily>if you do go to their facilities, talk with

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Moderator - Emily>folks there, things like that.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.870
<v P 02>Yes, I get the majority of my health care

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.470
<v P 02>through the va. I do see a local doctor just

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.910
<v P 02>to have that as a. Oh, I need to see someone

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.630
<v P 02>like right now kind of a thing.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And do you use or currently

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Moderator - Emily>the website and.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Moderator - Emily>Or the mobile app?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.720
<v P 02>Both on a regular basis.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Moderator - Emily>There you go. Excellent. What, what sort

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Moderator - Emily>of things do you use the app for as opposed

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.720
<v Moderator - Emily>to the website?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.280
<v P 02>The same thing. I go in and you know, if

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.640
<v P 02>I'm at my computer and I think I, oh look,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.440
<v P 02>you know, let me go check my prescriptions

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.880
<v P 02>or what appointments do I have or if I'm

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.360
<v P 02>sitting in my chair and I'm go, oh gee, I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.510
<v P 02>wonder if I have an appointment or I just

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.790
<v P 02>loaded my pills up in my little Dixie cups.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.670
<v P 02>Oh gee, I need to order some pills. I'll

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.710
<v P 02>hop on the app and check appointments or

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.790
<v P 02>order refills or check tracking.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.669
<v Moderator - Emily>And is there any, any specific reason you

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Moderator - Emily>choose to use the app for those, for those

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Moderator - Emily>things as opposed to the website?

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.390
<v P 02>No, there's. It's whatever device I'm nearest.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.630
<v P 02>I prefer the computer. I really dislike doing

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.190
<v P 02>things on, on the phone.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so whatever is closest. Got it. Okay,

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.230
<v Moderator - Emily>so we're going to move over to the financial

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.030
<v Moderator - Emily>portion of the discussion and I want to make

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.030
<v Moderator - Emily>sure you're only sharing what you are willing.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.430
<v Moderator - Emily>I have zero information about anything, any

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.470
<v Moderator - Emily>financial, any, anything financially related

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Moderator - Emily>to the va. So I know you said that you have

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Moderator - Emily>the majority of your healthcare through the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.700
<v Moderator - Emily>va.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.660
<v Moderator - Emily>So can you just briefly explain experience

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.260
<v Moderator - Emily>with medical co pays through the va?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.540
<v P 02>The only copays that I have are for my prescription

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.450
<v P 02>drugs. And actually, and I don't know if

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.410
<v P 02>I'm jumping ahead or if this is what you're,

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.250
<v P 02>you're, you were asking. I, I learned that

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.090
<v P 02>I was doing something wrong last year that

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.130
<v P 02>I had not been told. And, and it was, was,

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.810
<v P 02>it was, it was like good news, bad news.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.770
<v P 02>It's like, wait a minute, I've been giving

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.850
<v P 02>away money that I didn't need to.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.090
<v P 02>But then, so basically, in a nutshell. Yeah,

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.130
<v P 02>in a nutshell, I didn't know that after I

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.480
<v P 02>had paid $700 worth of CO pays for my medicines,

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.280
<v P 02>I didn't have to pay any more. CO pays. What

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.360
<v P 02>I was doing, because I thought I was being

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.360
<v P 02>proactive is I would go to the website, go

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.920
<v P 02>down to what do I owe you? And I would make

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.600
<v P 02>a payment.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.080
<v P 02>Well, I was told that the website does not

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.430
<v P 02>jive with reality and that only to make payments

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.510
<v P 02>when you got a bill in the mail. If you don't

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.750
<v P 02>get a bill in the mail, don't, don't make

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.470
<v P 02>any payments. And I thought that was a pretty

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.830
<v P 02>huge disconnect.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.590
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, interesting. All right.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.430
<v Moderator - Emily>And do you recall how you learned about this?

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Moderator - Emily>That you should only wait until you're told

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.910
<v Moderator - Emily>specifically to pay?

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.100
<v P 02>So what happened is that we didn't have any

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.540
<v P 02>money and I was calling to ask if I could

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.020
<v P 02>make a payment later than the due date on,

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.060
<v P 02>on the bill. And the young lady on the phone

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.660
<v P 02>said, hold on just a moment, let me check

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.780
<v P 02>something. And she came back and, and then

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.100
<v P 02>she said, you owe nothing and informed me

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.260
<v P 02>about the disconnect between the website

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.250
<v P 02>and reality.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Okay. And so then, so that's

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.090
<v Moderator - Emily>this point you learned that you needed to

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Moderator - Emily>wait until you are specifically told to make

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Moderator - Emily>a payment. Do you recall? So how, how are

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Moderator - Emily>you getting these notifications when you

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Moderator - Emily>do actually have to make a payment?

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.650
<v P 02>It's a letter in the mail.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.810
<v Moderator - Emily>No. Okay, got it. All right, and so up until

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.770
<v Moderator - Emily>then you had been going. So you, Sorry, you

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Moderator - Emily>were logging into.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.170
<v Moderator - Emily>You're going to va.gov to make payments?

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.710
<v P 02>Yeah, yeah. Pay.gov is where I make my payments.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.830
<v P 02>But on the VA website is where it says, hey,

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:09.670
<v P 02>you owe money.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.670
<v P 02>And so I would use that information jump

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.510
<v P 02>to pay.gov and make that payment.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.510
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. All right, and is this a regular

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.230
<v Moderator - Emily>monthly notification that you sent or do

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Moderator - Emily>you recall how often you get the letters?

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.330
<v P 02>I get, I get the letter monthly until I hit

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.650
<v P 02>the 700 mark and then the letters don't come

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.130
<v P 02>anymore.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:41.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.650
<v Moderator - Emily>They just stop. And is there, was there any

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.889
<v Moderator - Emily>indication of when you did hit that mark?

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.810
<v P 02>No.

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.090
<v Moderator - Emily>No. Got it. Okay. They just stopped sending

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.690
<v Moderator - Emily>you letters.

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.260
<v P 02>I'm. Yeah. Yes. That, that's, that's the,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.180
<v P 02>the metric that I'm using. I, I just want

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.780
<v P 02>to say something.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.260
<v P 02>My phone might overheat from an extended

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.140
<v P 02>zoom call.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.500
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, okay.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.259
<v P 02>And if it does, it may just, it may disconnect

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:14.900
<v P 02>us. I can continue. If it does happen, I

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.860
<v P 02>can continue with a phone call.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.220
<v P 02>But the zoom. The video is, is pretty taxing

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.780
<v P 02>and I apologize for that.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, well, the most. In a moment we're going

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Moderator - Emily>to be getting onto some screen sharing stuff.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.820
<v Moderator - Emily>So we will, we'll see how far we can get

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.980
<v Moderator - Emily>and take it as it is.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:37.140
<v Moderator - Emily>If you want to turn. Yeah. If you want to

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.140
<v Moderator - Emily>turn off your video, that, if that. In case

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Moderator - Emily>that saves some battery or. I'm not sure

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.500
<v Moderator - Emily>how it works in terms of overheating, you're

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.700
<v Moderator - Emily>certainly welcome to do that.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.980
<v P 02>That would be awesome. Let me figure out.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Moderator - Emily>Yes, you should be able to tap on the screen

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.740
<v Moderator - Emily>and then at the bottom, I believe there's

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Moderator - Emily>going to be a little camera.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.420
<v P 02>Yep. There we go.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Moderator - Emily>Hopefully that gets us a little more time.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then separate from the CO payments,

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.660
<v Moderator - Emily>do you know if you have had any debts as

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:12.100
<v Moderator - Emily>a result of any benefit overpayments in the

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Moderator - Emily>past? No, you have not. Okay, great.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And I'm going through my questions.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Moderator - Emily>You've already answered a bunch of those,

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:21.910
<v Moderator - Emily>so great.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.990
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so outside, I know obviously the

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.710
<v Moderator - Emily>lack of communication in terms of when you

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:34.110
<v Moderator - Emily>actually need to pay something. Is there

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.630
<v Moderator - Emily>anything else that might make things easier

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.710
<v Moderator - Emily>for you in regards to the CO payments?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.920
<v P 02>No, I mean it's, I'm a very tech savvy person.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.920
<v P 02>I. My career was, you know, 25 years in the

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.360
<v P 02>semiconductor industry working on equipment

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.400
<v P 02>that makes computer chips. So, you know,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.920
<v P 02>I'm real familiar with software and hardware

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:06.910
<v P 02>and the whole system is, is quite easy to

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:08.830
<v P 02>navigate and use.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great.

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.950
<v Moderator - Emily>Good to know.

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:15.710
<v P 02>I'm really happy with my VA experience.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.150
<v Moderator - Emily>Glad to hear that. All right. Always looking

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.750
<v Moderator - Emily>to make it better.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.749
<v Moderator - Emily>So that's, you know, that's why, why you're

00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:23.830
<v Moderator - Emily>here. All right, so now we're going to move

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.550
<v Moderator - Emily>on to the prototype section. Let me have

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.790
<v Moderator - Emily>you share your screen and let me know if

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:30.910
<v Moderator - Emily>you need help with that.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.430
<v P 02>There. My screen. There we go.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.390
<v P 02>Okay. I tapped it and I've Got the spinning

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.190
<v P 02>wheel of death.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Great. Love that.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.830
<v P 02>And now it's wanting me to choose an application.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:58.590
<v P 02>I'm assuming that's that app you had me download.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.060
<v Moderator - Emily>No, not yet. So are you on Android?

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:03.900
<v P 02>Yes.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.340
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so at the bottom there should be a

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:06.740
<v Moderator - Emily>list of it.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, a list of apps. At the bottom you want

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.820
<v Moderator - Emily>to select Zoom.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.140
<v P 02>You got it.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.740
<v Moderator - Emily>And then that should. There's another tab.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.860
<v P 02>Yep. Okay. It's allowed.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.060
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. Not seeing anything.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, perfect. I just had to wait a second.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.830
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, and so now let me have you see. Switch

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.190
<v Moderator - Emily>applications and open up the Figma app that

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:34.190
<v Moderator - Emily>you downloaded.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:36.910

<v Moderator - Emily>Perfect. I have. I have a login.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.060
<v P 02>I'm okay.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. All right. Just waiting for it to catch

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Moderator - Emily>up. Okay, there we go.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.580
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so the email is going to be VA

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.820
<v Moderator - Emily>test000gmail.com.

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, just typo. Yep, There we go. You caught

<v Moderator - Emily>is V A. V A. V A, V A. I had to do eight

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.670
<v Moderator - Emily>characters, so wanted to make it as easy

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.190

<v Moderator - Emily>code is 601-1645.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:10.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, now hopefully that'll log in. It's

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.010
<v Moderator - Emily>spinning and it's thinking. All right, continue

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:14.090
<v Moderator - Emily>with mobile app.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.570

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.250
<v Moderator - Emily>I will get you the. Oops. There we go. Copy

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.610
<v Moderator - Emily>that.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:31.290
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, in the Zoom chat, I am sending

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.610
<v Moderator - Emily>you a very long link, so you may have to.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, you have to switch back to Zoom to

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:38.970
<v Moderator - Emily>see that. There we go.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.490
<v Moderator - Emily>If you tap on that, it should show up at

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Moderator - Emily>the bottom.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:49.780
<v P 02>Yes.

00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:53.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Under chat. There we go. All right, go ahead

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.420
<v Moderator - Emily>and open up that one.

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:55.940
<v P 02>Go ahead and tap the link.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:56.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Yes, please.

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.140
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, it is working. It's just taking

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.780
<v Moderator - Emily>a little bit. When. Once it loads, you can

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.340
<v Moderator - Emily>tap anything. Yeah, I shouldn't have to.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:12.060
<v Moderator - Emily>You shouldn't need to do any of that. It's

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.380
<v Moderator - Emily>just always tells people at the start, but

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.540
<v Moderator - Emily>it's still thinking, come on, Figma.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:48.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Getting close.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.190
<v P 02>Doing something.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.110
<v Moderator - Emily>It is doing something. I have hope.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.870
<v Moderator - Emily>I mean, as someone who works in technology,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.710
<v Moderator - Emily>you know, technology just doesn't always

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.670
<v Moderator - Emily>work the way we want it to, but it's. It's

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.830
<v Moderator - Emily>moving in the right direction.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.390
<v P 02>Okay.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:14.520
<v Moderator - Emily>All right.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.360
<v P 02>Oh, look at that.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:19.360
<v Moderator - Emily>So we are on the home screen of our pretend

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.880
<v Moderator - Emily>mobile app right now. So before I Have you

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.480
<v Moderator - Emily>click anything where. Show me or just tell

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.840
<v Moderator - Emily>me, I guess, where you believe you're going

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.570
<v Moderator - Emily>to find those co payments that you would

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:35.970
<v Moderator - Emily>owe.

00:14:48.450 --> 00:14:51.730
<v P 02>I would click on the details. See details

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.010
<v P 02>under last payment. Well, that probably might

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:55.570
<v P 02>not work.

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:56.610
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.700
<v P 02>But that would be a good start.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.420
<v P 02>Or, or show one of the two.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Looking at a payment. Got it. Any.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Any other spot that might make sense for

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.340
<v Moderator - Emily>you to. To look for these co payments?

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.850
<v P 02>No, that, that, that would be it. I mean,

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.210
<v P 02>maybe if I clicked on profile and, you know.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:31.810
<v P 02>Well, there's nothing there, so. Yeah, that

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:32.410
<v P 02>would be it.

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:35.930
<v Moderator - Emily>So I'll tell you where they actually are.

00:15:36.010 --> 00:15:38.450
<v Moderator - Emily>So they're going to be under the, the, the

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.290
<v Moderator - Emily>payments tab on the lower portion there.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:42.730
<v Moderator - Emily>The. The lower part of the screen.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.770
<v P 02>Yeah, I just saw that.

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.850
<v P 02>My eyes didn't go down that far.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. You didn't look at the bottom.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, got it. So now that you are here

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:54.240
<v Moderator - Emily>and you can.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.720
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm not gonna have you tap into anything

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:01.080
<v Moderator - Emily>yet, but thoughts on the name of the payments

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.960
<v Moderator - Emily>tab as being a place where you would look

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.040
<v Moderator - Emily>for these co payments?

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.560
<v P 02>Yes. Yeah, this looks like it's pretty much

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:09.560
<v P 02>everything I'd need.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.520
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, do they. Can you think of anything

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:15.880
<v Moderator - Emily>else that. Oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.560
<v P 02>No, no, go ahead.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.680
<v Moderator - Emily>I was going to say it's so just noting that

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.240
<v Moderator - Emily>the payments tab was not something you looked

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Moderator - Emily>at first.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.520
<v Moderator - Emily>Any thoughts on maybe a different name or

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.800
<v Moderator - Emily>a different way that would make more sense

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.080
<v Moderator - Emily>to you in terms of finding the co payments?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.600
<v P 02>Well, I know, I mean, I'm just brainstorming

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.320
<v P 02>here, but I know a lot of apps, when you

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.840
<v P 02>log into them for the first time, they kind

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.160
<v P 02>of give you a little, you know, hey, and

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.800
<v P 02>they, you know, here's an arrow and here's

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.760
<v P 02>a bubble and it says, hey, you go here to

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.000
<v P 02>do this, this and this. And then there's,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.160
<v P 02>you know, it kind of gives you a tour the

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.720
<v P 02>first time you log into it. That would have.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:58.840
<v P 02>If.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.440
<v P 02>And I always do, you know, I always click

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.280
<v P 02>and read all that stuff. So something like

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.200
<v P 02>that had been present at the beginning of

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.240
<v P 02>using the app, then it would have been. I

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.400
<v P 02>would have known where to go.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Sure. Okay, got it.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:13.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. So now that you. So, yeah, I got

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.500
<v Moderator - Emily>it. So, yeah, I've definitely seen lots of

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.740
<v Moderator - Emily>those on. On new apps that I've downloaded.

00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.060
<v Moderator - Emily>Download it. Thoughts on the. The naming

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.740
<v Moderator - Emily>of the section it being payments. I s that

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.060
<v Moderator - Emily>confusing? Does it make sense?

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.220
<v Moderator - Emily>What. What do you feel of that?

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.380
<v P 02>That, that. That's 100% spot on.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.870
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, great.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.390
<v Moderator - Emily>And then. Excuse me. And then the information

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:44.350
<v Moderator - Emily>that is here on this page. I know we're just

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:45.870
<v Moderator - Emily>pretending that you might have overpayment

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:47.710
<v Moderator - Emily>debts, even though I know you have not experienced

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:51.990
<v Moderator - Emily>that. Thoughts on the information presented

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.710
<v Moderator - Emily>here specifically about copays before you

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.110
<v Moderator - Emily>actually tap into any more information?

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.760
<v P 02>No, I mean like the direct deposit information.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.480
<v P 02>I, I have no idea what that would be used

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.560
<v P 02>for. Okay. I imagine veterans with higher

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.080
<v P 02>disabilities and other things that might

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:22.040
<v P 02>make more sense for them. For me, it's.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.080
<v P 02>I just, you know, I just owe the VA money

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:25.840
<v P 02>every month and.

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.360
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, got it.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.650
<v P 02>Kind of a thing. So I just, I would automatically.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.120
<v P 02>I would automatically go to the co pay section

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.000
<v P 02>and, and would ignore everything else.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, sure. That makes sense. And how about

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.600
<v Moderator - Emily>the. The small bit of info under the word

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.720
<v Moderator - Emily>copays, the 250do for two bills. Thoughts

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.480
<v Moderator - Emily>on that in terms of what might be useful

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.520
<v Moderator - Emily>when you're first opening up this tab?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.550
<v P 02>Yeah, it'd be not, you know, it. It. I mean

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.470
<v P 02>it. Regardless of what it says, I have to

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:04.350
<v P 02>go into it to the, you know, as, you know,

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.230
<v P 02>when you make a payment through pay.gov,

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.470
<v P 02>you have. There's that long account number

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.990
<v P 02>that you have to type in.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.830
<v P 02>So I'm going into this in hopes of getting

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:13.830
<v P 02>that account number.

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:15.110
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.950
<v P 02>Because it's different every time.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.750
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, the, the account number is different.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.360
<v P 02>It seems to be.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. I actually was not aware of

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:25.560
<v Moderator - Emily>that.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:25.960
<v P 02>I've had it.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.720
<v P 02>I've. I've had it. Yeah, I've had it different.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.880
<v P 02>I've had it change on me at times, so.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.520
<v Moderator - Emily>Ah, got it.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.320
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. All right, so let me have you and you're

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:39.920
<v Moderator - Emily>welcome to tap around, but find out what

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Moderator - Emily>you currently owe for co payments in this

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Moderator - Emily>pretend situation.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:08.490
<v P 02>Well, it looks like I owe a VA clinic $200

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:12.900
<v P 02>and it looks like the Tampa hospital wants

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:13.220
<v P 02>50.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.100
<v P 02>And can I, can I click on details or is that.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:21.340
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep, yeah, you can. You can.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:25.060
<v Moderator - Emily>Go ahead. Just. Just one of them is. Is.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.340
<v Moderator - Emily>Is active.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.180
<v P 02>There we go.

00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:37.140
<v Moderator - Emily>What sort of information? I know you said

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.100
<v Moderator - Emily>the, the account number is going to be useful.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Other things like what else are you looking

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.560
<v Moderator - Emily>at? A copay bill.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.160
<v P 02>So the, the two pieces of information is

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.720
<v P 02>the account number and. And how much, because

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.240
<v P 02>they asked you to type in how much you. You

00:20:56.240 --> 00:21:02.920
<v P 02>want to pay. And I also look at the due date.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:05.600
<v P 02>So I can, I guess there's a fee if you're

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:05.920
<v P 02>late.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.360
<v P 02>I think it's a $35 fee or something like

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.050
<v P 02>that with your payment. And I have to, I

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:14.650
<v P 02>have to juggle that payment with Social Security

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:17.490
<v P 02>payments and things like that. So what you

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.330
<v P 02>have here that I look at.

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.170
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Okay.

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:24.850
<v Moderator - Emily>So nothing will be missing from. For. Of

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.010
<v Moderator - Emily>what you. Of what you're thinking of for

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:26.570
<v Moderator - Emily>what you would need?

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.970
<v P 02>Yeah.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.810
<v P 02>Yeah, nothing's missing.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:38.220
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And are you, for your own personal

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.900
<v Moderator - Emily>copays, are you visiting different VA locations,

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.780
<v Moderator - Emily>or is it all one that you're generally visiting?

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.700
<v P 02>It's just one.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Just one.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.060
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:21:51.499 --> 00:21:54.500
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And I know you said that you noticed

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.860
<v Moderator - Emily>that on the previous page. We've got $50

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:02.100
<v Moderator - Emily>here and $200 for another location. How clear

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.900
<v Moderator - Emily>is that, the fact that it is two different

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.060
<v Moderator - Emily>locations there?

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.460
<v P 02>Oh, it's very clear.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay. Yeah, got it.

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:15.340
<v P 02>Yeah. Whoever's doing this, good job.

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, great. Sounds good. So if you

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:26.860
<v Moderator - Emily>were to pay off a copay, what sort of communication

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.580
<v Moderator - Emily>might you want to see if any within the app

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.980
<v Moderator - Emily>for when you do pay off a particular copay?

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.660
<v P 02>Well, is it. That's kind of a funny question.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.540
<v P 02>I, I, you, When I make a payment, I would

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.620
<v P 02>expect to see the, you know, the confirmation

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.980
<v P 02>that I've made the payment. And just, just

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.260
<v P 02>like I do now, they also tell me, you know,

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:57.100
<v P 02>it may take hours or day, a couple days to

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:02.090
<v P 02>process, and they. I get an email, and one

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.530
<v P 02>thing that's really nice is that I can.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:06.730
<v P 02>It asks, you know, is there someone you want

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:10.570
<v P 02>a courtesy copy that you've paid this? And

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.250
<v P 02>I always put my wife's email address in there

00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:16.690
<v P 02>so that she know, she knows that, you know,

00:23:16.690 --> 00:23:17.570
<v P 02>I paid it.

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:21.570
<v Moderator - Emily>And, and that's within P.gov, is that right?

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.650
<v P 02>Yeah, that's Pay.gov.

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.510
<v Moderator - Emily>Mm.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Got it.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:35.150
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, let me see. Let me have you go back

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.550
<v Moderator - Emily>to. Oh, sorry, I skipped over a question.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.670
<v Moderator - Emily>What else? I know you said grabbing account

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:44.110
<v Moderator - Emily>number and knowing when things are due.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:49.070
<v Moderator - Emily>What else would you want to do here, if anything,

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:50.670
<v Moderator - Emily>regarding your co. Payments?

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:03.100
<v P 02>Well, you know, I would probably go to the

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:03.380
<v P 02>statement.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:04.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:12.060
<v P 02>And either I have a, A NAS setup and I have

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:17.350
<v P 02>folders for VA stuff, I might just pull up

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:21.030
<v P 02>the PDF and then just save it onto my storage

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.550
<v P 02>device.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.670
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.710
<v P 02>Just for my record.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.910
<v P 02>Oh, I did not. Did I do that? I'm sorry.

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:30.350
<v Moderator - Emily>It's okay. You can, you can go.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Moderator - Emily>We will, we will get to that, Charlie. Okay,

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:35.070
<v Moderator - Emily>so you, you often save the, the statement

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:37.270
<v Moderator - Emily>PDFs or you would want to save the statement

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:38.030
<v Moderator - Emily>PDFs?

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.470
<v P 02>Yeah. Yeah.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.070
<v Moderator - Emily>And is that something.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:44.700
<v Moderator - Emily>Where. Is that something you can do from

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.140
<v Moderator - Emily>your phone? Is that something you need to

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:47.500
<v Moderator - Emily>do from your computer?

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.020
<v P 02>Well, I would say if I were on my Phone,

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.300
<v P 02>I would save it to either my Google Drive

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.780
<v P 02>or my OneDrive, and then eventually when

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:00.620
<v P 02>I got to my computer, would move it over

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.060
<v P 02>to my NAS.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Okay, so since you mentioned, you can

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:10.540
<v Moderator - Emily>go ahead and open up a PDF statement here.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.020
<v P 02>Well, that looks very familiar.

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:21.100
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. Yeah. Any other thoughts? Is this

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.500
<v Moderator - Emily>something you would be reading on your phone?

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.220
<v Moderator - Emily>Like what. What exactly are you. Are you

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.740
<v Moderator - Emily>doing with the. The statement PDFs?

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:31.260
<v P 02>I wouldn't.

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.300
<v P 02>Well, first I'd make sure that the payment

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.110
<v P 02>amount matched what the previous screen just

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.790
<v P 02>said, but other than that, it would be, you

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:44.350
<v P 02>know, down, you know, download and save.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. So you. So you're just downloading

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:47.830
<v Moderator - Emily>here? You're not.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.470
<v Moderator - Emily>You're not. Or most likely not viewing it

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.790
<v Moderator - Emily>here?

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:54.590
<v P 02>Yeah, yeah. I mean, I. I don't know if it's

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.550
<v P 02>financially irresponsible of me, but I don't

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.190
<v P 02>go through every drug and make sure, you

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:05.090
<v P 02>know, I just, It's. I just assume the VA

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.290
<v P 02>is doing the right thing here in their billing,

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.570
<v P 02>which is naive of me, I know, but, you know,

00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.330
<v P 02>there's really no way to check it.

00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:17.130
<v Moderator - Emily>Uhhuh. Okay, got it. All right, you can go

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.890
<v Moderator - Emily>ahead and. And click done. And are you ever

00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:23.410
<v Moderator - Emily>looking at older statements or really just

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:24.650
<v Moderator - Emily>the most recent one?

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:34.300
<v P 02>I've never had any time that I ever wanted

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.220
<v P 02>to go back and look at any old statements.

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. If we're just going to pretend

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.060
<v Moderator - Emily>you want to look at, let's say, March, would

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.820
<v Moderator - Emily>you. Where. Where might you look for an older

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:48.500
<v Moderator - Emily>statement here?

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:58.130
<v P 02>Let's see. I'm going to go back to. You want

00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:59.210
<v P 02>me just to drive it?

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:02.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, yeah. You can just show where you believe

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:02.650
<v Moderator - Emily>you would find it.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:06.170
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, it's thinking. There we go. Okay, good.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:13.370
<v P 02>And then VA payment history.

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:16.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, Looking at there. Huh. All right.

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.730
<v P 02>And I'm clicking.

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:23.130
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, that part isn't active, so. Okay, so

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.530
<v Moderator - Emily>you would look under payment history. Yeah,

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.650
<v Moderator - Emily>a lot of it being a prototype, a lot of things

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:29.210
<v Moderator - Emily>are not. Are not connected.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:33.730
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Any. Any other places you might look

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:34.650
<v Moderator - Emily>for older statement?

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.820
<v P 02>Not on. No. This. I mean, this is the money

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.580
<v P 02>tab, right? So this, this you've got.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:56.900
<v P 02>I've got history of my payments. I've got

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.860
<v P 02>direct deposit information which I don't

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.220
<v P 02>use. If I've made an overpayment, which I've

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.260
<v P 02>never done. Well, I, I have, but I didn't

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.140
<v P 02>know. Anyway, if I thought I did an overpayment,

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:07.620
<v P 02>I would look.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.020
<v P 02>If, if my, if. If a dollar amount showed

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.620
<v P 02>up in overpayments, I would be calling the

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:15.690
<v P 02>VA Because I would assume something is very

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:16.170
<v P 02>wrong.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:17.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yeah.

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:18.890
<v P 02>And.

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.330
<v P 02>And the co pay is just to look at what I

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:23.610
<v P 02>currently owe. Yeah, this is, this is one.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.810
<v P 02>One stop shopping.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:30.210
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. All right, so now I'm going to have

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.810
<v Moderator - Emily>you tap into a.

00:28:31.810 --> 00:28:35.130
<v Moderator - Emily>A hidden link. The gray part just below where

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.370
<v Moderator - Emily>it says CO pays. Let me have you tap that

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.770
<v Moderator - Emily>once.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.500
<v P 02>Oh, look at that. I got a pop.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.820
<v Moderator - Emily>Try. Try just a brief. Which it should be

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.500
<v Moderator - Emily>within the prototype.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:54.940
<v Moderator - Emily>But yeah, just tap the gray area like right

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:57.860
<v Moderator - Emily>below where it's. Oh, yeah. Yep, you got

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.140
<v Moderator - Emily>it. Okay. And now.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, actually wait, let me ask a couple of

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.500
<v Moderator - Emily>questions first, which I skipped. My apologies.

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Moderator - Emily>So I know you said you just know to go to pay.gov.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.240
<v Moderator - Emily>You're very experienced with that. Thoughts

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.520
<v Moderator - Emily>on the version that we just saw, not having

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.960
<v Moderator - Emily>any, any direct link over to pay.gov.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.320
<v P 02>Well, that would be convenient. I mean, you

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.800
<v P 02>know, but I will tell you, I'm. I'm pretty

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:39.530
<v P 02>leery about clicking links. I. I don't even

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:43.610
<v P 02>have pay.gov saved on my. On the Ribbon toolbar

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.770
<v P 02>at the top of my browser.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.490
<v P 02>I always type them in.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:47.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, got it.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.570
<v P 02>Just because I'm paranoid about the bad,

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.930
<v P 02>bad people in the world.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. All right.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So let me have. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:00.970
<v P 02>Now. I was just going to say the impression

00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:06.180
<v P 02>I'm getting from this is that that my, like

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:06.540
<v P 02>I'm.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.540
<v P 02>I'm going to be able to make a payment through

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:14.500
<v P 02>this app. It doesn't. It's not clear to me

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.180
<v P 02>that I still need to go to pay.gov to do

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:17.460
<v P 02>that.

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.540
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Would.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.820
<v Moderator - Emily>If you were to see. So if, if, like this

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.900
<v Moderator - Emily>is something that may actually be built,

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.350
<v Moderator - Emily>how do you think you would make a payment?

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.190
<v Moderator - Emily>If we're, if we're. We're pretending that

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.790
<v Moderator - Emily>this, this is actually built the way that

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.870
<v Moderator - Emily>you're seeing it right now.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:42.670
<v P 02>Okay, well, I would go to co pays and then

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:47.950
<v P 02>I would do a review details.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.830
<v Moderator - Emily>And.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.830
<v P 02>Oops, I did not mean to do that. And then

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:00.900
<v P 02>somewhere like maybe underneath the, the

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.220
<v P 02>go to your current statement, maybe if there

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.540
<v P 02>was another little rectangular box that said

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:11.780
<v P 02>go to go. Go to pay.gov you know.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:18.820
<v Moderator - Emily>So. So, you know, pretending that this. The

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:20.780
<v Moderator - Emily>way you're seeing it now, if it might be

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.380
<v Moderator - Emily>built that there would not be a link, what

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.720
<v Moderator - Emily>do you think the likelihood that it would

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.360
<v Moderator - Emily>be knowing that there, that there's not that

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.880
<v Moderator - Emily>specific link that you just referenced?

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.960
<v P 02>I would use the app or use. With no. With

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.840
<v P 02>no link. I'm not sure I understand the question.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:45.920
<v Moderator - Emily>I guess I'm wondering how you feel about

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.280
<v Moderator - Emily>using the app to view things…

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.610
<v Moderator - Emily>That you might have to pay, but not have

00:31:53.610 --> 00:31:55.490
<v Moderator - Emily>that direct link available.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:58.490
<v P 02>Oh, that's fine. I mean, it's kind of like

00:31:58.490 --> 00:32:00.770
<v P 02>what's. What it is now, so, you know.

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:03.330
<v P 02>Yeah, it would be okay.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.770
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, sounds good. Okay, so let me have

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:08.690
<v Moderator - Emily>you go. But if you want to just tap the payments

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.850
<v Moderator - Emily>on the lower right, I'm going to have you

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:13.490
<v Moderator - Emily>go back to that screen. There we go.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:17.050
<v Moderator - Emily>And then scroll to the bottom and tap the

00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:21.180
<v Moderator - Emily>little gray, the, the, the, the blank gray

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:23.580
<v Moderator - Emily>area again. Have you switched to another

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.100
<v Moderator - Emily>version for some reason it switched back,

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:26.860
<v Moderator - Emily>so hopefully.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.780
<v P 02>I'm tapping.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.700
<v Moderator - Emily>If it doesn't work, I'll send something else.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:37.340
<v Moderator - Emily>But.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.060
<v P 02>Maybe if I like, I don't know, go back and

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.220
<v P 02>then come back into it.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:48.760
<v Moderator - Emily>No, try. So, yeah, like, like the, the gray

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.120
<v Moderator - Emily>area just below the word bills, for example,

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Moderator - Emily>if you tap that once, it. I know it worked

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.760
<v Moderator - Emily>before, so it could just be the prototype

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.400
<v Moderator - Emily>as being a little bit slow. In which case

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.720
<v Moderator - Emily>I will send you a different link.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:03.200
<v Moderator - Emily>Give me just a moment.

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.650
<v Moderator - Emily>I just have to bring that up slowness on

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:20.330
<v Moderator - Emily>my end.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:24.970
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. With payments.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:33.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So I'm going to send you a different

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.490
<v Moderator - Emily>link right there. Okay, Go ahead and open

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:37.530
<v Moderator - Emily>the new one.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:39.800
<v P 02>Okay.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.210
<v P 02>My poor little phone. It's trying.

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:20.610
<v Moderator - Emily>I know. It's almost there. It's getting there.

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:24.610
<v P 02>Come on.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.010
<v Moderator - Emily>I can see it. There we go. Okay, so go ahead

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Moderator - Emily>and go back to that, that payments tab on

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:31.490
<v Moderator - Emily>the bottom, right?

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:38.020
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep. And then tap into Co Pays again on the

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:38.460
<v Moderator - Emily>bottom.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.140
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. There. This is the right one. Okay.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:49.900
<v Moderator - Emily>So a couple we're going to get actually,

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.500
<v Moderator - Emily>you know, so let's, let's.

00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:55.300
<v Moderator - Emily>This is a little bit different. So I know

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.780
<v Moderator - Emily>you, you talked about how you might do a

00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.020
<v Moderator - Emily>payment now that it's different. Let me have

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.660
<v Moderator - Emily>you walk me through how you would do a payment

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.140
<v Moderator - Emily>now that we've got a slightly different design

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.500
<v Moderator - Emily>here. Sorry. For that.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.660
<v Moderator - Emily>For that hospital or. Yeah, Veterans hospital

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:13.940
<v Moderator - Emily>in Tampa for the first one.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:18.020
<v P 02>Yeah. So in Tampa, I see the pay bill, so

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.660
<v P 02>I'd be very happy and I will click that.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.260
<v P 02>Oh, look at that.

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:27.100
<v P 02>That's so cool. Now, do people actually.

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.580
<v P 02>Where do you pay in person at? That's a new

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.180
<v P 02>one on me. But anyway, I would go to.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:37.660
<v P 02>I'm sorry, I would Tap on the pay.gov.

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good. And you can go ahead and do that.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.300
<v Moderator - Emily>And I promise I'm not going to have you enter

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.860
<v Moderator - Emily>in any financial information whatsoever.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.140
<v Moderator - Emily>This is just to understand the experience.

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:53.590
<v P 02>And I Am clicking leave. Oh, there we go.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:01.670
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so. And have you paid with pay.gov

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:02.310
<v Moderator - Emily>on the phone?

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.870
<v P 02>No, I always do it on my computer.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.190
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay, great. And let me have you

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.750
<v Moderator - Emily>scroll down there. Just wanted to get to

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:14.710
<v Moderator - Emily>one thing.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:17.270
<v Moderator - Emily>Go to continue to the form. I'm not going

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:19.270
<v Moderator - Emily>to have you add any information beyond this,

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:22.400
<v Moderator - Emily>but just want to get to that so it should

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.640
<v Moderator - Emily>look familiar. And I know you said that you

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.720
<v Moderator - Emily>always need to grab your, your account number.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.240
<v Moderator - Emily>Thoughts on finding that, that account number?

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.760
<v Moderator - Emily>Like if you were actually paying on the phone,

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.560
<v Moderator - Emily>what would you be doing from here now that

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.320
<v Moderator - Emily>you've clicked over.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.080
<v P 02>To pay.gov well, I would be cursing going,

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:47.520
<v P 02>why didn't they give me a link to copy my

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.360
<v P 02>account number before I got here?

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.050
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:59.490
<v P 02>Other than that I would go back to this and

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:03.090
<v P 02>I'm not sure what I'm looking at.

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:08.370
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, that I'm going to go tap on that recent

00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:12.290
<v Moderator - Emily>and let's just see what happens. I love when

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:13.930
<v Moderator - Emily>technology isn't quite working the way that

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:14.770
<v Moderator - Emily>I think it should work.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.940
<v P 02>I really enjoyed doing this. I, I'm, I'm

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.540
<v P 02>excited to help make things better.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, good.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.380
<v P 02>So this is just, you know, sign me up anytime

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.580
<v P 02>you need to test something.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.560
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, there's often a lot of people looking

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.840
<v Moderator - Emily>to test various things.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:49.320
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so tap on the payments.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.080
<v P 02>Oh, I would go.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.200
<v Moderator - Emily>Well, yeah, we're going to try. This is the

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.760
<v Moderator - Emily>different. And scroll to the bottom and try

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.200
<v Moderator - Emily>tapping into that, that gray rectangle again.

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:00.800
<v Moderator - Emily>And we're going to see if I can switch over

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:03.400
<v Moderator - Emily>to the other version. Yes. Okay, good, it

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.730
<v Moderator - Emily>worked. And tap into co Pays again. So I'm

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:10.130
<v Moderator - Emily>going to check out and get you back to where

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:10.650
<v Moderator - Emily>you were.

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.250
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So you had done the pay bill here.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:15.690
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:20.170
<v P 02>Right. And now I would, I would go over to

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:21.530
<v P 02>review details.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.050
<v Moderator - Emily>Can go ahead and do that.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.250
<v P 02>And then. Oh look, there's a copy button

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.170
<v P 02>I didn't see before.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:30.810
<v Moderator - Emily>Right.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:31.770
<v P 02>Okay, thank you.

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.180
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so now that won't actually do

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.380
<v Moderator - Emily>anything. Yeah, we would just pretend that.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.580
<v P 02>Then I would go back to pay.gov.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:48.420
<v Moderator - Emily>And, and I won't. Nothing will copy.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:52.300
<v Moderator - Emily>So that was just. Yeah, just, just fake there.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.860
<v Moderator - Emily>Now that you see how it's. It may work in

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.900
<v Moderator - Emily>an ideal world. Thoughts on that?

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.380
<v Moderator - Emily>On, on having that, that copy option and

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.740
<v Moderator - Emily>getting back to pay.gov.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.930
<v P 02>That'S, that's normal method of operation

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.290
<v P 02>for like almost everything you do when you're

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:12.650
<v P 02>dealing with, you know, even I, I use a password

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:15.530
<v P 02>manager. 1Password and a lot of websites

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.770
<v P 02>aren't integrated with that. And so I Have

00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.650
<v P 02>to go in, copy the username, go back, put

00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:24.290
<v P 02>it, paste it in, go back to 1Password cop,

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:27.050
<v P 02>tap and it copies the password. Go back to

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:29.480
<v P 02>the app. I'm very comfortable with that because

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.680
<v P 02>I do it multiple times a day.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.200
<v P 02>My wife, on the other hand, I would tell

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.880
<v P 02>you that if she were having to deal with

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.280
<v P 02>this, she would have a meltdown.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:38.640
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.240
<v P 02>She doesn't hop between apps very well.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:44.920
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.200
<v P 02>It just seems to flip and beyond her.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:48.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay, got it.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.720
<v Moderator - Emily>And then, so now that you've seen roughly

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.840
<v Moderator - Emily>how this might work in terms of copying,

00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.200
<v Moderator - Emily>knowing you would have to flip applications

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.640
<v Moderator - Emily>how, what do you believe the likelihood of

00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.080
<v Moderator - Emily>using this version that had the direct link

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.839
<v Moderator - Emily>and had the copying compares to the first

00:40:10.839 --> 00:40:13.920
<v Moderator - Emily>version that did not have the payment link?

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:18.400
<v P 02>Oh, this, this, this is now one stop shopping

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.440
<v P 02>and I love that.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:25.930
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And let me have you tap to.

00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Sorry, return to Figma and hopefully it will

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:33.130
<v Moderator - Emily>behave and stay where it was before.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.850
<v Moderator - Emily>Let's find out. Okay, There we go. Excuse

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.690
<v Moderator - Emily>me. Okay, good. So we're gonna, we're gonna

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.410
<v Moderator - Emily>pause on the, the payment conversation.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:47.410
<v Moderator - Emily>So we're going to pretend that you have seen

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:52.040
<v Moderator - Emily>an error this particular, you know, you,

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.200
<v Moderator - Emily>you, you look at this statement to realize,

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.200
<v Moderator - Emily>hey, I didn't actually attend this particular

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.800
<v Moderator - Emily>date, or maybe there was a prescription,

00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.320
<v Moderator - Emily>didn't have, or, you know, something. What

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.720
<v Moderator - Emily>would be your next step in terms of possibly

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Moderator - Emily>correcting or. Yeah, what, what would you

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.280
<v Moderator - Emily>believe you, you would do if you see something

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.960
<v Moderator - Emily>that you don't believe you need to pay?

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:15.640
<v P 02>Well, I would either hit payments or the,

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:19.430
<v P 02>the go back, you know, to co pays. I want

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:20.990
<v P 02>to get back to the payment screen.

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:21.830
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:30.550
<v P 02>And then there was, you know, it would be,

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:32.750
<v P 02>it would be a combination of looking at payment

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:33.070
<v P 02>history.

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:34.110
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:40.110
<v P 02>And, and so I could line up past bills with

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:46.460
<v P 02>past payments, and then I would go back to

00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:50.780
<v P 02>the co pays where it, you know, where it

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.500
<v P 02>says I have a bill to pay.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.060
<v P 02>I would make a note of the Tampa, but I would,

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:59.940
<v P 02>I would do the review details because I'm,

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:02.740
<v P 02>I would bet you good money that they're in

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:08.900
<v P 02>that statement in the PDF that there's a

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.820
<v P 02>phone number in here somewhere I can call.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so you'll be looking for a number.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:13.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it.

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.260
<v P 02>Yep. And I mean, do you want me to do that?

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.780
<v Moderator - Emily>No, no, it's okay. You can go ahead and click.

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.580
<v Moderator - Emily>Click. Done.

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.540
<v P 02>Oh, here's an Oops, I can't zoom.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:30.340
<v Moderator - Emily>There is. So that's a prototype thing. If

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.460
<v Moderator - Emily>you tap once, it should do a little fake

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.020
<v Moderator - Emily>zoom. There you go. Yeah.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.380
<v Moderator - Emily>That's the limitation of the prototype. But

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:41.430
<v Moderator - Emily>reality, you would be able to, you know,

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:42.990
<v Moderator - Emily>do the, the two finger things. So.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:47.230
<v P 02>Yeah, yeah. And there's, let's see, statement

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.030
<v P 02>questions.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.950
<v P 02>I'd call that number first.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.750
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. You did that first. Okay, go

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.950
<v Moderator - Emily>ahead, go ahead and click Done. There would

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.270
<v Moderator - Emily>there be any, any other information or guidance

00:42:58.270 --> 00:43:00.870
<v Moderator - Emily>you might be looking for outside of calling

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:02.270
<v Moderator - Emily>that number that you found in the statement?

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.840
<v P 02>I can't think of any. I mean, I, I, I know,

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.800
<v P 02>I know there's an over. They're telling me

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.760
<v P 02>I owe money. I don't believe. I do think

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:14.520
<v P 02>there's a number.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:16.600
<v P 02>I'm hoping that connects me to the right

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.640
<v P 02>person. If not, they will hopefully connect

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.800
<v P 02>me to the right person and it, you know,

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:22.040
<v P 02>we'll, we'll go from there.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.920
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then second question. Actually,

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.480
<v Moderator - Emily>since you mentioned this was a bit of real

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.000
<v Moderator - Emily>life, you would you, you had called someone

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.380
<v Moderator - Emily>when, when there was concern about, about

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:33.940
<v Moderator - Emily>payment.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.140
<v Moderator - Emily>If you were going to pretend that you didn't

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:39.300
<v Moderator - Emily>believe you had the money to pay a specific

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.220
<v Moderator - Emily>bill, would you, would you still call? You

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:45.820
<v Moderator - Emily>believe. I know you had mentioned that there

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.619
<v Moderator - Emily>was a phone call you had done before.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.620
<v P 02>Yeah, I would call. You know, I mean, I,

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:55.940
<v P 02>there's always that fear that if I, if I

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.510
<v P 02>mess up, you know, I lose my VA benefits.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:03.270
<v P 02>So I'm very proactive about, you know, at

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.310
<v P 02>least, and if, even if there was nothing

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:08.430
<v P 02>that they could do, at least they could put,

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:10.670
<v P 02>they could put notes in the records that,

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:14.510
<v P 02>hey, he called and it'll and notified us

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.310
<v P 02>that the payment was going to be late. He

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:19.230
<v P 02>said he could pay in full on this date so

00:44:19.230 --> 00:44:21.030
<v P 02>that, you know, they know that I'm not just

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.950
<v P 02>neglecting them.

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.520
<v Moderator - Emily>Right. Okay, got it. And were you.

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.520
<v Moderator - Emily>So like, when you had to make a call before,

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.760
<v Moderator - Emily>how did you become aware that there might

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:34.960
<v Moderator - Emily>be options for, let's say, delaying a payment,

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.640
<v Moderator - Emily>for example?

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.600
<v P 02>Well, we never got into that conversation

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.640
<v P 02>because she, she informed me that I'd already

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.400
<v P 02>paid met my $700 and I didn't know anything.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.060
<v P 02>And I was like, oh, you know, bonus.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:59.580
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. And then let me have you tap on

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.740
<v Moderator - Emily>the help on the upper right. I want to get

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.180
<v Moderator - Emily>your thoughts. I think you had tapped on

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.820
<v Moderator - Emily>it earlier accidentally. Yeah.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:13.540
<v Moderator - Emily>So thoughts on the, the topics here, if this

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:17.310
<v Moderator - Emily>might be something you would use or. Yeah,

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Moderator - Emily>what, what your thoughts on these are.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:29.550
<v P 02>I think you've got it pretty much covered.

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.950
<v P 02>It's if I have a question, if I can't make

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:35.710
<v P 02>a payment or I need some assistance or something,

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:41.750
<v P 02>if I am adamantly disagreeing with the bill.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:49.480
<v P 02>I. There's that. And if, let's say, you know,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:54.160
<v P 02>I know that just a few months ago after a

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.600
<v P 02>certain organization visited Social Security,

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.120
<v P 02>my wife didn't get a Social Security check

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.560
<v P 02>and we had to go down to Social Security.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.120
<v P 02>Anyway, we'll leave that there. So, yeah,

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.180
<v P 02>if I, if my Social Security stopped, I would

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.860
<v P 02>definitely be using that bottom option.

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:15.820
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. If you want to go ahead and

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.180
<v Moderator - Emily>tap into that one just to see where that

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:20.620
<v Moderator - Emily>goes.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:29.660
<v Moderator - Emily>And I believe you should be able to tap that

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.220
<v Moderator - Emily>as well.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:35.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Maybe. Okay. Sometimes this one's a little

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.220
<v Moderator - Emily>wonky sometimes.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.240
<v P 02>Yeah, it's kind of you. Yeah, you can see

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:42.560
<v P 02>it's kind of not wanting to.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Moderator - Emily>It's thinking. Yeah, that's okay. That happens

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:48.560
<v Moderator - Emily>sometimes. I'll go ahead and click close

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.280
<v Moderator - Emily>there.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.000
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And. All right.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:03.800
<v Moderator - Emily>So thoughts on this experience on our pretend

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:09.200
<v Moderator - Emily>app compared to how you have done things

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.080
<v Moderator - Emily>on va.gov I know you mentioned this is like

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.280
<v Moderator - Emily>a one stop shop. Other thoughts on the information

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:19.400
<v Moderator - Emily>here, the experience of seeing the co pays

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.480
<v Moderator - Emily>and potentially paying.

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:28.640
<v P 02>So as my method, my MO right now is I get

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:32.490
<v P 02>the bill, I sit down at the computer and

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.490
<v P 02>I go to, you know, I look, I look the bill

00:47:34.490 --> 00:47:39.010
<v P 02>over real quick, go to pay.gov and I pay

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:39.290
<v P 02>it.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.770
<v P 02>This, you know, would be.

00:47:47.850 --> 00:47:52.050
<v P 02>If I didn't have that piece of paper, this

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:57.160
<v P 02>would be a, a perfect option because it provides

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.520
<v P 02>me with everything I need to make that payment.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.560
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good to know.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:06.280
<v P 02>So, you know, you know, here's the thing

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.600
<v P 02>that I would worry about knowing that there's

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.800
<v P 02>a disconnection between the current website

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:20.600
<v P 02>and the getting the bills in the mail. You

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:25.810
<v P 02>know, I would be a little leery of, I wonder

00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:29.210
<v P 02>if that disconnect is still in place with

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:33.130
<v P 02>this new app or if that has been resolved.

00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:34.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.410
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And. Oh, sorry, go ahead.

00:48:37.369 --> 00:48:39.290
<v P 02>No, you know, and then the other thought

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:42.890
<v P 02>would be, well, if there's no PDF, if they

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:46.930
<v P 02>show no, you know, if there's no. If there's

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:51.320
<v P 02>a PDF of a bill, I'm assuming that bill is

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:52.600
<v P 02>also being mailed.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.200
<v P 02>So I would be very confused.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:01.360
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, thoughts on how that could be less

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.840
<v Moderator - Emily>confusing to you so that, you know, you're

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.320
<v Moderator - Emily>looking at the correct information.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.800
<v P 02>So the. Yes, I do have a thought about that.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:16.360
<v P 02>Now, I don't know if that $700 copay cap

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.620
<v P 02>is standard for, you know, people.

00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:22.420
<v P 02>You know, I only have a [redacted] disability, so

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.620
<v P 02>if that's kind of standard, maybe there could

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:29.340
<v P 02>be a little running total somewhere that

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:33.620
<v P 02>says, you know, you've you know, it's like

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:37.620
<v P 02>co pays and it. It'll have, you know, to

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:42.780
<v P 02>date, you've paid $500 slash of the $700.

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.150
<v P 02>That's your cap kind of a thing. You know

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:45.790
<v P 02>what I'm saying?

00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:46.590
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep, yep.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:47.470
<v P 02>Something like that.

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:50.030
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:52.190
<v P 02>That would make me feel really comfortable

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:54.270
<v P 02>that. Oh, hey, they're. They're actually

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:55.790
<v P 02>tracking this for me.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:57.990
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. Some more communication on

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.750
<v Moderator - Emily>just how close you are to that. To that cap.

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:02.510
<v P 02>Yeah.

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then any other thoughts specifically

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:11.320
<v Moderator - Emily>on how any of these pages or sections are

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.520
<v Moderator - Emily>labeled? Anything that might make it more

00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:15.400
<v Moderator - Emily>clear for you?

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.520
<v P 02>No, they're. They're. You're talking about

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.880
<v P 02>like at the bottom of the page.

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:27.880
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, it could be the bottom. Or really any.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:29.840
<v Moderator - Emily>Any of the. The pages that you've gone through,

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.640
<v Moderator - Emily>if there is any parts that.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.280
<v P 02>No, it. It's. It's.

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.730
<v P 02>It's very similar to what I deal with now.

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.810
<v P 02>I mean, if I want to go to health, that brings

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:42.890
<v P 02>me to the appointment thing and the. And

00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:46.210
<v P 02>the refills and. And the tracking and stuff.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:46.490
<v P 02>And.

00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:51.330
<v P 02>And I'm assuming at some point that would

00:50:51.330 --> 00:50:53.850
<v P 02>also let me get into my. Download my health

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:59.290
<v P 02>records. The benefits that just. That's always

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:02.130
<v P 02>just, you know, your 10% and this is how

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:04.190
<v P 02>much you get a month. And that's usually

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:05.910
<v P 02>all that that ever says.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:11.830
<v P 02>And then. And then the payments is very,

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:15.230
<v P 02>very straightforward. I will tell you that

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:19.669
<v P 02>I just discovered on the current system how

00:51:19.669 --> 00:51:25.070
<v P 02>to order my supplies for my CPAP and some

00:51:25.070 --> 00:51:26.710
<v P 02>stuff for my hearing aids, which I thought

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:27.670
<v P 02>was really cool.

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:31.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, okay. Do you recall how you learned how

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:32.080
<v Moderator - Emily>to do that?

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.800
<v P 02>I stumbled upon it.

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:35.680
<v Moderator - Emily>There you go.

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.640
<v P 02>I like to push buttons.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.760
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm sorry, was that on the app or on the

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:44.080
<v Moderator - Emily>website?

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.000
<v P 02>It was the website.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:50.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Well, it's nice to discover

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.360
<v Moderator - Emily>new things then.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:52.800
<v P 02>Yeah.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:56.640
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then anything else you'd like to

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.480
<v Moderator - Emily>share specifically regarding managing finances,

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.140
<v Moderator - Emily>though we have not already gone over in regards

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.660
<v Moderator - Emily>to the VA and the app.

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.100
<v P 02>No, I. I thought your section there with

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.700
<v P 02>the help was. Covered the bases.

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:17.140
<v P 02>I mean, this is. This is. Some people have

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:17.980
<v P 02>worked pretty hard.

00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:18.940
<v Moderator - Emily>All right.

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.140
<v P 02>Where you've gotten.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:20.540
<v P 02>So.

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Good job. Oh, thank you. So I know

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.500
<v Moderator - Emily>you said that you would like if you.

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:27.380
<v Moderator - Emily>I forgot to follow up with this. Like if

00:52:27.380 --> 00:52:30.740
<v Moderator - Emily>you had questions or if you wanted to thought

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:32.660
<v Moderator - Emily>that they made an error, you would call.

00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:38.660
<v Moderator - Emily>Any thoughts of if you might use that. That

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.500
<v Moderator - Emily>help section we looked at to find information

00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:43.460
<v Moderator - Emily>first or just go directly to calling.

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:55.780
<v P 02>I would. That's a good question. When I thought

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:59.600
<v P 02>there. When I needed Help. I didn't go to.

00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.920
<v P 02>I didn't do any web searching or do anything.

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.520
<v P 02>I just grabbed the phone number off an old

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.080
<v P 02>statement and made a phone call.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.280
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.800
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, sounds good. And then I'm gonna

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.040
<v Moderator - Emily>check in with my team here. If anyone has

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Moderator - Emily>any questions, Natasha, Natalie, if you have

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:25.360
<v Moderator - Emily>anything, please unmute yourself and ask.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.400
<v Moderator - Emily>Ask here. Excuse me.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:37.910
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, I'll take that as a no. So now that

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:41.270
<v Moderator - Emily>we've. I think that is everything, but I

00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:43.910
<v Moderator - Emily>want to check in once again. Now that we've

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:46.590
<v Moderator - Emily>had the whole conversation, are you still

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:49.350
<v Moderator - Emily>comfortable if we potentially use a video

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:51.310
<v Moderator - Emily>clip of this with our VA partners?

00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:53.230
<v P 02>Oh, yes, of course.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.040
<v P 02>Anything to help make this better. I mean,

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.120
<v P 02>that's the whole point of the conversation.

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.880
<v Moderator - Emily>It is, it is. All right. Well, yeah, that

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.560
<v Moderator - Emily>is all we have.

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:03.560
<v Moderator - Emily>Really appreciate you taking the time. It's

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.680
<v Moderator - Emily>always helpful. As you know, it's very important

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:10.120
<v Moderator - Emily>to talk with with veterans to get your exact

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:14.320
<v Moderator - Emily>experiences. So I'm sure you'll have fun

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.000
<v Moderator - Emily>doing more of these in the future. Para Jean

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.920
<v Moderator - Emily>will be reaching back out, sending you a

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Moderator - Emily>thank you note.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:23.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Also a little blur, but you can pass along

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:28.070
<v Moderator - Emily>to other veterans and that is it for me.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.350
<v Moderator - Emily>So I really appreciate your time. Thank you

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.990
<v Moderator - Emily>so much. And I hope you're very welcome your

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.270
<v Moderator - Emily>day.

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:35.150
<v P 02>Oh, thank you.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.109
<v P 02>And I hope all of you have a great day. And

00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:41.270
<v P 02>thank you again for allowing participate.

00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:43.350
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, sounds great. Thank you so much.

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:44.310
<v P 02>Have a good, good.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.190
<v P 02>Have a good day.
