Emily  
Recording in progress. So just to confirm sorry the recording wanted to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio. As we talk today.

2  
0:00:12  
P2  
Yes.

3  
0:00:13  
Emily  
Great.

4  
0:00:13  
Emily  
Let's going

5  
0:00:13  
Emily  
okay. Alright. And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip for the discussion today with the Va partners.

6  
0:00:20  
P2  
Of course, of course.

7  
0:00:22  
Emily  
Okay, great. Thank you. All right. Now, onto the actual discussion. I'd love to know just a little bit about you as a veteran branch of military. Sorry. What branch of military do you serve? And when did you retire? Separate.

8  
0:00:37  
P2  
I served in the [redacted]. I went in in 79 and got out in 86.

9  
0:00:43  
Emily  
Okay.

10  
0:00:44  
P2  
And I quit working well over 10 years ago.

11  
0:00:53  
P2  
I

12  
0:00:55  
P2  
was diagnosed with [redacted] and was deemed disabled by social security. So I've been disabled. I do have a part-time job. I'm [redacted], and I work a couple days a week doing that.

13  
0:01:13  
Emily  
Wow! That sounds pretty interesting, actually, alright, so I'd love to know what sort of involvement you have with veteran affairs could be both the past and now, and such as any if you do go to their facilities. Talk with folks there. Things like that.

14  
0:01:31  
P2  
Yes, I get the majority of my health care through the Va. I do see a local doctor just to have that as a oh, I need to see someone like right now.

15  
0:01:43  
Emily  
Kind of a thing.

16  
0:01:46  
Emily  
Got it? And do you use, or currently the website and or the mobile app.

17  
0:01:55  
P2  
Both on a regular basis.

18  
0:01:57  
Emily  
There you go. Excellent! What? What sort of things do you use the app for as opposed to the website.

19  
0:02:07  
P2  
the same thing. I go in. And you know, if I'm at my computer. And I think I Oh, look, you know, let me go check my prescriptions, or what appointments do I have? Or if I'm sitting in my chair and I'm go. Oh, gee! I wonder if I have an appointment, or I just loaded my pills up in my little Dixie cups. Oh, gee! I need to order some pills. I'll hop on the app and check appointments or order refills or check tracking.

20  
0:02:31  
Emily  
Okay, great.

21  
0:02:34  
Emily  
And is there any any specific reason you choose to use the app for those? For those things as opposed to the website.

22  
0:02:43  
P2  
No, there's it's whatever device I'm nearest. I prefer

23  
0:02:48  
P2  
the computer. I really dislike doing things on on the phone.

24  
0:02:55  
Emily  
yeah, okay, so whatever is closest got it? Okay? So we're going, to move over to the financial portion of the discussion and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have 0 information about anything any financially related to the Va.

25  
0:03:14  
Emily  
So so I know you said that you have the the majority of your your health care through the Va. So can you just briefly explain experience with medical Copays through the Va.

26  
0:03:31  
P2  
The only copies that I have are for my prescription drugs.

27  
0:03:35  
Emily  
Okay.

28  
0:03:36  
P2  
And

29  
0:03:39  
P2  
actually, and I don't know if I'm jumping ahead, or if this is what you were asking. I learned that I was doing something wrong last year that I had not been told, and and it was like good news, bad news. It's like, wait a minute. I've been giving away money that I didn't need to.

30  
0:04:04  
Emily  
Oh dear!

31  
0:04:04  
P2  
Then. So basically in a nutshell, yeah, in a nutshell, I didn't know that after I had paid $[redacted] worth of

32  
0:04:13  
P2  
copays for my medicines. I didn't have to pay any more co-pays.

33  
0:04:18  
Emily  
No.

34  
0:04:19  
P2  
What I was doing because I thought I was being proactive is, I would go to the website, go down to what do I owe you.

35  
0:04:27  
P2  
and I would make a payment. Well, I was told that the website does not jive with reality.

36  
0:04:34  
P2  
and then

37  
0:04:36  
P2  
only to make payments when you got a bill in the mail. If you don't get a bill in the mail.

38  
0:04:42  
P2  
don't don't make any payments, and I thought that was a pretty huge disconnect.

39  
0:04:48  
Emily  
Huh? Okay, interesting.

40  
0:04:51  
Emily  
all right. And do you recall how how you learned about this that you should only wait until you're told specifically to pay.

41  
0:05:01  
P2  
So what happened is that

42  
0:05:04  
P2  
We didn't have any money, and I was calling to ask if I could make a payment

43  
0:05:12  
P2  
later than the due date on on the bill, and the young lady on the phone said, Hold on just a moment, let me check something, and she came back, and and then she and said, You owe nothing, and informed me about

44  
0:05:25  
P2  
the disconnect between the website and reality.

45  
0:05:30  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, got it. Okay, and so then, so at this point, you learned that you needed to wait until you are specifically told to make a payment. Do you recall so? How? How are you getting these notifications when you do actually have to make a payment.

46  
0:05:46  
P2  
It's a letter in the mail.

47  
0:05:48  
Emily  
No, okay, got it alright.

48  
0:05:53  
Emily  
And so up until then you had been going. So you sorry you were logging into you're going to va.gov to make payments there.

49  
0:06:02  
P2  
Yeah, yeah, pay.gov is where I make my payments. But we're at on the Va. Website is where it says, Hey, you owe money.

50  
0:06:11  
Emily  
Okay.

51  
0:06:11  
P2  
And so

52  
0:06:14  
P2  
I would use that information, jump to pay.p.gov, and and make that payment.

53  
0:06:20  
Emily  
Okay, got it

54  
0:06:22  
Emily  
alright and do is this a regular monthly notification that you sent? Or do you recall how often you get the letters.

55  
0:06:32  
P2  
I get.

56  
0:06:33  
P2  
I get the letter monthly until I hit the $[redacted] mark, and then the letters don't come anymore.

57  
0:06:40  
Emily  
Okay? So they just start. And is there was there any indication of when you did hit that mark?

58  
0:06:49  
P2  
No.

59  
0:06:50  
Emily  
No got it. Okay. They just stop sending you letters.

60  
0:06:53  
P2  
I'm yeah.

61  
0:06:55  
P2  
yes, that's that's that's the the metric that I'm using. I I just want to say something. My phone might overheat from an extended zoom call.

62  
0:07:07  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

63  
0:07:08  
P2  
And if it does, it may just it may disconnect us. I can continue. If it does happen, I can continue with a phone call. But the zoom, the video is is pretty taxing, and I apologize for that.

64  
0:07:23  
Emily  
Okay? Well, the most in moment we're gonna be getting onto some screen sharing stuff. So we will. We'll see how far we can get

65  
0:07:32  
Emily  
a

66  
0:07:34  
Emily  
take it as it is. If you want to turn. Yeah, if you want to turn off your video that if that in case that saves

67  
0:07:42  
Emily  
some battery, or I'm not sure how it works in terms of overheating.

68  
0:07:46  
Emily  
You're certainly welcome to do that.

69  
0:07:48  
P2  
And it wouldn't.

70  
0:07:49  
P2  
That would be awesome. Let me figure out.

71  
0:07:52  
Emily  
Yes, you should be able to tap on the screen and then at the bottom, I believe there's gonna be a little camera.

72  
0:07:58  
Emily  
Yep, there we go.

73  
0:07:59  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. So hopefully, that gets us a little more time.

74  
0:08:02  
Emily  
Okay. And then separate from the copayments. Do you know, if you have had any debts as a result of any benefit. Overpayments in the past.

75  
0:08:14  
P2  
No.

76  
0:08:14  
Emily  
You have not. Okay. Great. Okay. And I'm going through my questions. You've already answered a bunch of those so great.

77  
0:08:25  
Emily  
alright so outside. I know, obviously the lack of communication. In terms of when you actually need to pay something. Is there anything else that might make things easier for you in regards to the co-payments.

78  
0:08:45  
P2  
No, I mean, it's I'm a very tech, savvy person. My career was.

79  
0:08:51  
P2  
you know, 25 years in the [redacted]

80  
0:08:57  
Emily  
Huh!

81  
0:08:58  
P2  
So you know, I'm real familiar with software and hardware, and

82  
0:09:04  
P2  
the whole system is is quite easy to navigate and use.

83  
0:09:11  
Emily  
Great good to know. Okay.

84  
0:09:13  
P2  
I'm really happy with my.

85  
0:09:15  
Emily  
5, v. 8.

86  
0:09:15  
P2  
Experience.

87  
0:09:16  
Emily  
Glad to hear that all right, always looking to make it better. So that's you know. That's why why you're here, all right. So now we're going to move on to the prototype section. Let me have you share your screen and let me know if you need help. With that.

88  
0:09:35  
P2  
Bear my screen. There we go.

89  
0:09:47  
P2  
okay. I tapped it, and I'm I've got the spinning wheel of death.

90  
0:09:50  
Emily  
Great love, that.

91  
0:09:52  
P2  
And now it's wanting me to choose an application I'm assuming. That's that app. You had me download.

92  
0:09:59  
Emily  
No, not yet. So that are you on on, Android.

93  
0:10:03  
P2  
Yes.

94  
0:10:04  
Emily  
Okay? So at the bottom, there should be a list of it. Yeah, a list of apps at the bottom. You want to select zoom.

95  
0:10:11  
P2  
You got it.

96  
0:10:13  
Emily  
And then that should.

97  
0:10:14  
P2  
And.

98  
0:10:15  
Emily  
Yeah, there's another tab.

99  
0:10:16  
P2  
Alright.

100  
0:10:17  
P2  
Yeah. Okay. It's allowed.

101  
0:10:19  
Emily  
Alright, not seeing it.

102  
0:10:22  
P2  
And start. Now.

103  
0:10:23  
Emily  
There we go. Okay, perfect. I just had to wait a second. Okay, and so now let me have you switch applications and open up the figma app that you downloaded.

104  
0:10:36  
P2  
Okay.

105  
0:10:49  
Emily  
Okay. So go ahead and click on log into figma.

106  
0:10:54  
P2  
Okay. Now, I did not sign up for instruct.

107  
0:10:57  
Emily  
Directions perfect. I have. I have a login.

108  
0:11:00  
P2  
I'm okay.

109  
0:11:03  
Emily  
Yeah, alright, I'm just waiting for it to catch up.

110  
0:11:06  
Emily  
Okay, there we go, all right. So the email is gonna be [redacted]

111  
0:11:27  
Emily  
Oh, just yeah.

112  
0:11:28  
P2  
Well.

113  
0:11:28  
Emily  
Yep, there we go. You caught it before I did.

114  
0:11:32  
Emily  
Okay? And then the password is [redacted]

115  
0:11:37  
Emily  
I had to do 8 characters, so wanted to make it as easy as possible.

116  
0:11:45  
Emily  
Okay, go ahead and tap log in. And then it's gonna send me to my email. So give me just a moment. Let me just refresh. And the authentication code is 6, 0 1, 1,

117  
0:12:03  
Emily  
6, 4, 5.

118  
0:12:06  
Emily  
Okay, now, hopefully, that'll log in. It's spinning, and it's thinking.

119  
0:12:12  
Emily  
all right. Continue with mobile app

120  
0:12:17  
Emily  
alright. Now it's opening. Okay. So now I will get you the

121  
0:12:24  
Emily  
oops. There we go copy that

122  
0:12:28  
Emily  
alright in the Zoom chat. I am sending you a very long link.

123  
0:12:35  
Emily  
So you may have to. Yeah, you have to switch back to zoom to see that there we go.

124  
0:12:43  
Emily  
If you tap on that it should show up at the bottom.

125  
0:12:49  
P2  
Yes.

126  
0:12:50  
Emily  
Under chat. There we go alright. Go ahead and open up that one.

127  
0:12:55  
P2  
And go ahead and tap the link.

128  
0:12:56  
Emily  
Yes, please.

129  
0:13:02  
Emily  
all right, it is working. It's just taking a little bit.

130  
0:13:05  
Emily  
When once it loads, you can.

131  
0:13:08  
P2  
Settings.

132  
0:13:09  
Emily  
Yeah, I shouldn't have to. You shouldn't need to do any of that. It's just always tells people at the start.

133  
0:13:16  
Emily  
But it's still thinking. Come on, figma

134  
0:13:48  
Emily  
getting close.

135  
0:13:48  
P2  
Doing something.

136  
0:13:49  
Emily  
It is doing something. I have hope.

137  
0:13:55  
Emily  
I mean, as someone who works in technology. You know, technology just doesn't always work the way we want it to, but it's it's moving in the right direction.

138  
0:14:04  
P2  
Okay.

139  
0:14:14  
P2  
all right.

140  
0:14:15  
P2  
Look at that.

141  
0:14:15  
Emily  
Great. So we are on the home screen of our pretend mobile app right now. So before I have you click anything where show me, or just tell me, I guess where you believe you're gonna find those copayments that you would owe.

142  
0:14:49  
P2  
I would click on the the details, see details under last payment?

143  
0:14:54  
P2  
Well, that probably might not work.

144  
0:14:56  
Emily  
Okay.

145  
0:14:57  
P2  
But that would be a good start.

146  
0:15:01  
P2  
or or show one of the 2.

147  
0:15:04  
Emily  
Okay, looking at a payment. Got it any any other spot that might make sense for you to to look for these co-payments.

148  
0:15:22  
P2  
No, that that would be it, I mean, maybe if I clicked on profile.

149  
0:15:29  
P2  
And you know well, there's nothing there. So yeah, that would be it.

150  
0:15:33  
Emily  
Okay, got it? So I'll tell you where they actually are. So they're gonna be under the the the payments tab on the lower portion. There the the lower part of the screen.

151  
0:15:43  
P2  
Yeah.

152  
0:15:45  
P2  
I just saw that didn't go down that far.

153  
0:15:48  
Emily  
Okay, got it. You didn't look at the bottom all right. Got it? So now that you are here, and you can, I'm not gonna have you tap into anything yet but thoughts on the name of the payments Tab, as being a place where you would look for these copayments.

154  
0:16:06  
P2  
Yes, yeah, this looks like it's pretty much everything I'd need.

155  
0:16:12  
Emily  
Okay, do they? Can you think of anything else? That? Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

156  
0:16:18  
P2  
No no go ahead.

157  
0:16:19  
Emily  
Oh, I was. Gonna say, it's so just noting that the payments, Tab was not something you looked@firstst Any thoughts on

158  
0:16:28  
Emily  
maybe a different name, or or a different way that would make more sense to you in terms of finding the co-payments.

159  
0:16:36  
P2  
Well, I know.

160  
0:16:38  
P2  
I mean, I'm just brainstorming here, but I know a lot of apps when you log into them for the 1st time. They kind of give you a little, you know, hey? And they, you know, here's an arrow, and here's a bubble, and it says, Hey, you go here to do this, this and this, and then there's you know. It kind of gives you a tour the 1st time you log into it.

161  
0:16:57  
P2  
That would have, if

162  
0:16:59  
P2  
and I always do. You know, I always click and read all that stuff. So something like that had been present at the beginning of using the app. Then it would have been. I would have known where to go.

163  
0:17:10  
Emily  
Sure, okay, got it. Got it? So now that you so yeah, I got it. So yeah, I've definitely seen lots of those on on new apps that I've download downloaded thoughts on the the naming of the section, it being payments. How is that confusing? Does it make sense? What? What do you feel of that.

164  
0:17:31  
P2  
That that that's a hundred percent spot on.

165  
0:17:35  
Emily  
Alright

166  
0:17:36  
Emily  
right and then excuse me. And then the information that is here on this page. I know we're just. We're just pretending that you might have overpayment debts, even though I know you have not experienced that thoughts on the information presented here specifically about Copays before you actually tap into any more information.

167  
0:18:05  
P2  
no, I mean

168  
0:18:08  
P2  
like the direct deposit information. I I have no idea what that would be used for.

169  
0:18:13  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

170  
0:18:14  
P2  
I imagine, veterans with higher disabilities and other things that might make more sense for them. For me. It's I, just.

171  
0:18:23  
P2  
you know. I just owe the Gov. A money every month, and.

172  
0:18:26  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay.

173  
0:18:26  
P2  
Of things. So I just I would automatically I would automatically go to the Copay

174  
0:18:32  
P2  
section and and would ignore, nor everything else.

175  
0:18:36  
Emily  
Okay? Sure, that makes sense. And how about the the small bit of info under the word copays, the 2 50 due for 2 bills thoughts on that in terms of what might be useful when you're 1st opening up this tab.

176  
0:18:52  
P2  
Yeah, it'd be not. You know it it

177  
0:18:56  
P2  
I mean it. Regardless of what it says. I have to go into it to

178  
0:19:03  
P2  
you know, as you know, when you make a payment through pay.gov you have. There's that long account number that you have to type in. So I'm going into this in hopes of getting that account number.

179  
0:19:15  
Emily  
Yeah.

180  
0:19:16  
P2  
Because it's different every time.

181  
0:19:18  
Emily  
Oh, the the account number is different.

182  
0:19:22  
P2  
It seems to be.

183  
0:19:24  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? I actually was not aware of that.

184  
0:19:26  
P2  
Had it. I've had. I've had it.

185  
0:19:27  
P2  
Yeah, I've had it different. I've had it

186  
0:19:30  
P2  
change on me at times, so.

187  
0:19:32  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.

188  
0:19:34  
Emily  
all right. So let me have you, and you're welcome to hop around. But find out what you currently owe for copayments. In this pretend situation.

189  
0:20:03  
P2  
Well, looks like I owe

190  
0:20:06  
P2  
the Va clinic $200, and it looks like the Tampa Hospital wants 50.

191  
0:20:15  
Emily  
Okay.

192  
0:20:17  
P2  
And can I? Can I click on details? Or is that.

193  
0:20:20  
Emily  
Sure. Yep, yeah, you can. You can go ahead.

194  
0:20:23  
Emily  
Just just one of them is, is is active.

195  
0:20:31  
P2  
There we go!

196  
0:20:35  
Emily  
What sort of sort of information I know you said the the account number is gonna be useful, other things like, what else are you looking to find when looking at a Copay bill.

197  
0:20:47  
P2  
So

198  
0:20:49  
P2  
the the 2 pieces of information is the account number, and and how much? Because they ask you to type in how much you you want to pay and

199  
0:21:00  
P2  
I also look at the due date so I can. I guess there's a fee. If you're late. I think it's a $35 fee or something like that. With your payment and I have to. I have to juggle that payment with social security payments and things like that. So what you have here

200  
0:21:19  
P2  
thing that I look at.

201  
0:21:21  
Emily  
Okay, okay, so not, nothing will be missing from our. For of what you of what you're thinking of, for what you would need.

202  
0:21:29  
P2  
Yeah.

203  
0:21:29  
P2  
Yeah, nothing's missing.

204  
0:21:31  
Emily  
Okay? Got it?

205  
0:21:34  
Emily  
And are you?

206  
0:21:37  
Emily  
for for your own personal code base? Are you visiting different Va locations, or is it all one that you're generally visiting.

207  
0:21:46  
P2  
It's just one.

208  
0:21:47  
Emily  
Just one. Okay, got it.

209  
0:21:51  
Emily  
Okay? And I know you said that you notice that on the previous page we've got $50 here, and $200 for another location. How clear is that it? It? The the fact that it is 2 different locations there.

210  
0:22:07  
P2  
Oh, it's very clear.

211  
0:22:09  
Emily  
Yeah, okay.

212  
0:22:10  
P2  
Yeah.

213  
0:22:11  
Emily  
Got it.

214  
0:22:13  
P2  
Yeah, whoever's doing this good job.

215  
0:22:16  
Emily  
Alright! Great

216  
0:22:18  
Emily  
sounds good. So if you were to pay off a copay, what sort of communication might you want to see if any within the app, for when you do pay off a particular copay.

217  
0:22:39  
P2  
was it?

218  
0:22:40  
P2  
That's kind of a funny question. When I make a payment I would expect to see the

219  
0:22:47  
P2  
you know the confirmation that I've made the payment and just just like I do now. They also tell me, you know, it may take hours or day, a couple of days to process. And they, I get an email. One thing that's really nice is that

220  
0:23:04  
P2  
I can. It asks, you know, is there someone you want a courtesy copy that you've paid this. And I always put my wife's email address in there so that she knows she knows that. You know I paid it.

221  
0:23:18  
Emily  
Hmm, and and that's within pay.gov is that right.

222  
0:23:22  
P2  
Yeah, that's pay.gov.

223  
0:23:25  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

224  
0:23:31  
Emily  
Okay? Let me see, let me have you? Go back, to, oh, sorry, I, skipped over a question, what else? I know you said grabbing account number and knowing when things are due. What else would you want to do here? If anything regarding your co-payments.

225  
0:23:57  
P2  
Well, you know

226  
0:24:01  
P2  
I would probably go to the statement.

227  
0:24:04  
Emily  
Okay.

228  
0:24:05  
P2  
And either. I have a a nas setup.

229  
0:24:11  
P2  
and I have folders for Va. Stuff. I might just

230  
0:24:17  
P2  
pull up the Pdf. And then just save it onto my storage device.

231  
0:24:22  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

232  
0:24:23  
P2  
Just for my record.

233  
0:24:26  
P2  
Oh, I did not! Did I do that? I'm sorry.

234  
0:24:29  
Emily  
That's okay. You can go. We will. We will get to that shortly. Okay, so you you often save the the statement. Pdfs, or you would want to save the statement. Pdfs.

235  
0:24:39  
P2  
Yeah, yeah.

236  
0:24:40  
Emily  
And is that something? Where are you? Is that something? You could do from your phone is that something, you need to do from your computer.

237  
0:24:51  
P2  
Well, I would say, if I were on my phone I would save it to either my Google drive or my onedrive. And then eventually, when I got to, my computer, would

238  
0:25:00  
P2  
move it over to my Nas.

239  
0:25:02  
Emily  
Okay, okay, so since you mentioned, you can go ahead and and open up a Pdf statement here.

240  
0:25:13  
P2  
Well, that looks very familiar.

241  
0:25:17  
Emily  
All right. Yeah. Any other thoughts. Is this something you would be reading on your phone like, what? What? Exactly are you? Are you doing with the the statement. Pdfs.

242  
0:25:30  
P2  
I wouldn't.

243  
0:25:32  
P2  
Yep.

244  
0:25:34  
P2  
Well, 1st I'd make sure that the payment amount matched what the previous screen just said, but other than that, it would be.

245  
0:25:41  
P2  
you know, down, you know, download and save.

246  
0:25:45  
Emily  
Okay.

247  
0:25:46  
Emily  
got it. So you. So you're just downloading here? You're not. You're not, or most likely not, viewing it here.

248  
0:25:51  
P2  
Yeah.

249  
0:25:52  
P2  
yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's financially irresponsible of me, but I don't go through every drug and make sure. You know I just it's

250  
0:26:04  
P2  
I just assumed the Va. Is doing the right thing here in their billing, which is naive of me, I know, but

251  
0:26:10  
P2  
you know there's really no way to check it.

252  
0:26:15  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Alright. You can go ahead and and click done. And are you ever looking at older statements? Or really just, the most recent one.

253  
0:26:28  
P2  
I I've never had any any

254  
0:26:33  
P2  
time that I ever wanted to go back and look at any old, old statements.

255  
0:26:37  
Emily  
Okay, got it? If we're just gonna pretend you want to look at, let's say, March, would you? Where? Where might you look for an older statement here.

256  
0:26:52  
P2  
Let's see, I'm going to go back.

257  
0:26:58  
P2  
You want me just to drive it.

258  
0:27:00  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah, you can just show me where you believe you would find it.

259  
0:27:04  
Emily  
It's thinking, there we go. Good.

260  
0:27:09  
P2  
And then va payment history.

261  
0:27:15  
Emily  
Okay, you're looking at there.

262  
0:27:18  
P2  
And I'm clicking.

263  
0:27:21  
Emily  
Yeah, that that part isn't active. So okay, so you would look under payment.

264  
0:27:25  
Emily  
Yeah, a lot lot of it being a prototype. A lot of things are not are not connected.

265  
0:27:31  
Emily  
Okay? Any. Any other places. You might look for older statements.

266  
0:27:47  
P2  
not on.

267  
0:27:49  
P2  
No, this I mean, this is the money.

268  
0:27:51  
P2  
Tab, right? So this this you've got. I've got history of my payments. I've got direct deposit information which I don't use if I've made an overpayment which I've never done well, I I have. But I didn't know. Anyway, if I thought I did an overpayment. I would look if the if my, if if a dollar amount showed up in overpayments.

269  
0:28:12  
P2  
I would be calling the Va. Because I would assume something is very wrong.

270  
0:28:16  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. Yeah.

271  
0:28:18  
P2  
And and the co-pays. Just to look at what I currently owe. This is 1 1 stop shopping.

272  
0:28:26  
Emily  
Got it. Alright. So now I'm gonna have you tap into a a hidden link, the gray part just below where it says Copays. Let me have you tap that once.

273  
0:28:42  
P2  
Oh, look at that! I got a pop.

274  
0:28:45  
Emily  
That's right. Try try just a brief which it should be within the the prototype. But yeah, just

275  
0:28:51  
Emily  
tap the the gray area, like, right like, right below where it's.

276  
0:28:56  
P2  
Oh, yeah.

277  
0:28:57  
Emily  
Yep, you got it. Okay. And now.

278  
0:28:59  
P2  
Okay.

279  
0:29:00  
Emily  
And

280  
0:29:01  
Emily  
Tap Co. Actually wait. Let me ask a couple of questions first, st which I skipped my apologies. So I know you said, you just know to

281  
0:29:10  
Emily  
to go to pay.gov. You're very experienced with that

282  
0:29:14  
Emily  
thoughts on the version that we just saw.

283  
0:29:18  
Emily  
not having any any direct link over to pay.gov.

284  
0:29:29  
P2  
Well, that would be convenient, I mean, you know the but I will tell you I'm

285  
0:29:34  
P2  
I'm pretty leery about clicking links. I don't even have pay.gov saved on my on the ribbon toolbar at the top of my browser. I always type them in.

286  
0:29:47  
Emily  
Got it.

287  
0:29:48  
P2  
Just because I'm paranoid about the bad, bad people in the world.

288  
0:29:53  
Emily  
Got it all right.

289  
0:29:56  
Emily  
Okay, so let me have you? Oh, yeah, go ahead.

290  
0:29:59  
P2  
No, I was just going to say. The impression I'm getting from this is that

291  
0:30:05  
P2  
that my like, I'm I'm going to be able to make a payment through this app.

292  
0:30:12  
P2  
It doesn't. It's not clear to me that I still need to go to pay.gov to do that.

293  
0:30:18  
Emily  
Okay, got it

294  
0:30:19  
Emily  
would. If you were to see. So if, if, like, this is something that may actually be built,

295  
0:30:26  
Emily  
how do you think you would make a payment if we're if we're we're pretending that this this is actually built, the way that you're seeing it right now?

296  
0:30:37  
P2  
Okay. Well, I would go to Copays, and then

297  
0:30:44  
P2  
I would do a review. Details.

298  
0:30:50  
P2  
And oops. I did not mean to do that. And then

299  
0:30:57  
P2  
somewhere, like maybe underneath the the go to your current statement. Maybe if there was another little rectangular box that said, Go to go go to pay.gov.

300  
0:31:11  
P2  
you know.

301  
0:31:14  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So

302  
0:31:16  
Emily  
so you know, pretending that this the way you're seeing it now, if it might be built that there would not be a link. What do you think? The likelihood that you would use? It would be knowing that there, that there's not that specific link that you just referenced.

303  
0:31:35  
P2  
I would use the app or use with no, with no link.

304  
0:31:40  
P2  
I'm not sure I understand the question.

305  
0:31:42  
Emily  
I guess I'm I'm wondering, how how you feel about using the app to to view things that you might be pay, that you might have to pay, but not have that that direct link available.

306  
0:31:56  
P2  
Oh, that's fine! I mean, it's kind of like what's what it is now. So you know.

307  
0:32:01  
Emily  
Okay.

308  
0:32:02  
P2  
Yeah, it would be, okay. Oh, this!

309  
0:32:04  
Emily  
Alright sounds good. Okay, so let me have you go. But if you want to just tap the payments on the lower right. I'm gonna have you go back to that screen. There we go, and then scroll to the bottom and tap the little gray, the the the blank gray area again to have you switch to another version. For some reason it switched back so hopefully.

310  
0:32:29  
P2  
I'm tapping.

311  
0:32:34  
Emily  
If it doesn't work I'll send something else. But

312  
0:32:39  
P2  
Maybe if I like, I don't know, go back and then come back into it.

313  
0:32:45  
Emily  
No try.

314  
0:32:47  
Emily  
So yeah, like, like the the gray area just below the word bills. For example.

315  
0:32:52  
Emily  
if you tap that once it. I know it worked before so it could just be. The prototype is being a little bit slow, in which case I will send you a different link.

316  
0:33:01  
Emily  
Give me just a moment.

317  
0:33:09  
Emily  
Alright

318  
0:33:14  
Emily  
holidays. I just have to bring that up slowness on my end.

319  
0:33:23  
Emily  
Okay, with payment.

320  
0:33:31  
Emily  
Okay? So I'm gonna send you a different link right there. Okay, go ahead and open the new one.

321  
0:33:39  
P2  
Okay.

322  
0:33:41  
Emily  
Okay.

323  
0:34:16  
P2  
My poor little phone.

324  
0:34:17  
Emily  
It's trying.

325  
0:34:19  
Emily  
I know it's almost there. It's getting there.

326  
0:34:24  
P2  
Come on.

327  
0:34:25  
P2  
I can see it. There we go. Okay. So go ahead and go back to that. That payments tab on the bottom right.

328  
0:34:35  
Emily  
Yep, and then tap into copays again on the bottom.

329  
0:34:44  
Emily  
Okay, there we go. This is the right one. Okay, so a couple we're gonna get. Actually, you know, so let's let's this is, this is a little bit different. So I know you, you talked about how you might do a payment.

330  
0:35:00  
Emily  
Now that it's different, let me have you walk me through. How? How you would do a payment now that we've got a slightly different design here.

331  
0:35:08  
Emily  
Sorry for that, for that.

332  
0:35:10  
P2  
Oh, okay.

333  
0:35:11  
Emily  
Hospital or Yeah Veterans Hospital in Tampa.

334  
0:35:13  
P2  
For the 1st one. Yeah, so so

335  
0:35:15  
P2  
so in Tampa, I see the pay bill, so I'd be very happy, and I will click that. Oh, look at that!

336  
0:35:23  
P2  
That's so cool.

337  
0:35:25  
P2  
Now, do people actually, where do you pay in person at? I've

338  
0:35:31  
P2  
that's a new one on me. But anyway, I would go to. I I

339  
0:35:35  
P2  
I'm sorry I would tap on the pay.gov.

340  
0:35:38  
Emily  
Okay, good. And and you can go ahead and do that. And I promise I'm not. Gonna have you enter in any financial information whatsoever. This is, just to understand the experience.

341  
0:35:50  
P2  
And I am clicking. Leave? Oh, there we go!

342  
0:35:58  
Emily  
Okay? So and have you paid with pay.gov on the phone.

343  
0:36:06  
P2  
No, I always do it on my computer.

344  
0:36:09  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, great and maybe you scroll down there just wanted to get to one thing. Go to continue to the form. I'm not. Gonna have you add any information beyond this, but just wanna get to that so it should look familiar. And I know you said that you always need to grab your your account number.

345  
0:36:31  
Emily  
Thoughts on

346  
0:36:33  
Emily  
finding that that account number like, if you were actually paying on the phone. What would you be doing from here now that you've clicked over to pay.gov.

347  
0:36:43  
P2  
Well, I would be cursing going. Why didn't they give me a link to copy my account number before I got here?

348  
0:36:50  
Emily  
Okay.

349  
0:36:51  
P2  
Other than that I would go back to this and

350  
0:37:01  
P2  
I'm not sure what I'm looking at.

351  
0:37:04  
Emily  
Yeah, that.

352  
0:37:04  
P2  
Points.

353  
0:37:06  
Emily  
I, I.

354  
0:37:06  
P2  
Gonna go.

355  
0:37:07  
Emily  
Tap on that recent. And let's just see what happens.

356  
0:37:12  
Emily  
I love when technology isn't quite working the way that I think it should work.

357  
0:37:17  
Emily  
Boo-poo!

358  
0:37:29  
P2  
I really enjoy doing this. I'm excited to help make things better.

359  
0:37:35  
Emily  
I'm good.

360  
0:37:36  
P2  
So this this is just, you know.

361  
0:37:38  
P2  
Find me up anytime you need need need need need to test something.

362  
0:37:42  
Emily  
Well, there's often a lot of people looking to test various things. Okay, so

363  
0:37:48  
P2  
Yeah.

364  
0:37:48  
Emily  
Tap on the payment.

365  
0:37:49  
P2  
So I would go to.

366  
0:37:51  
Emily  
Well, yeah, we're gonna try. This is the different and scroll to the bottom and try tapping into that that gray rectangle again. And we're gonna see if I can switch over to the other version. Yes, okay, good. It worked and tap into copays again.

367  
0:38:08  
Emily  
So I'm gonna check out and get you back to where you were. Okay. So you had done the from here.

368  
0:38:14  
P2  
So.

369  
0:38:15  
Emily  
Yep.

370  
0:38:17  
P2  
Right, and now I would. I would go over to review details.

371  
0:38:22  
Emily  
Okay, go ahead and do that.

372  
0:38:26  
P2  
And then, Oh, look! There's a copy button I didn't see before.

373  
0:38:30  
Emily  
Right? Okay.

374  
0:38:31  
P2  
Thank you.

375  
0:38:34  
Emily  
Alright. So now that won't actually do it.

376  
0:38:36  
P2  
And then.

377  
0:38:38  
Emily  
Yeah, we would just pretend that.

378  
0:38:39  
P2  
And then I would.

379  
0:38:40  
Emily  
And then you would.

380  
0:38:41  
P2  
Go back to pay.gov, and

381  
0:38:46  
Emily  
And I won't, and nothing nothing will copy. So that was just

382  
0:38:50  
P2  
Yeah.

383  
0:38:51  
Emily  
Just just fake there, now that you see how it's it may work in an ideal world. Thoughts on that, on, on having that that copy option and getting back to pay.gov.

384  
0:39:03  
P2  
That's that's normal method of operation, for, like almost everything you do when you're dealing with.

385  
0:39:10  
P2  
you know, even I. I use a password manager, one password, and a lot of websites aren't integrated with that. And so I have to go in.

386  
0:39:19  
P2  
copy the the username, go back, put it paste it in, go back to one password cop tap and it copies the password. Go back to the app. I'm very comfortable with that, because I do it multiple times a day. My wife, on the other hand, I would tell you that if she were having to deal with this she would have a meltdown.

387  
0:39:37  
Emily  
Hmm. Oh, okay.

388  
0:39:41  
P2  
She? She doesn't hop between apps. Very well. That just seems.

389  
0:39:45  
Emily  
The flipping.

390  
0:39:47  
P2  
Beyond her.

391  
0:39:47  
Emily  
Like, yeah, okay, got it.

392  
0:39:50  
Emily  
And then. So now that you've seen roughly how this might work in terms of copying, knowing you would have to flip applications. What do you believe? The likelihood of using this version that had the direct link, and had the copying

393  
0:40:09  
Emily  
compares to the 1st version that did not have the payment link.

394  
0:40:15  
P2  
This is now one-stop shopping, and I love that.

395  
0:40:21  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

396  
0:40:23  
Emily  
And let me have you tap to sorry return to figma, and hopefully, it will behave and least stay where it was before. Let's find out.

397  
0:40:35  
Emily  
Okay, there we go. Excuse me. Okay, good. So we're gonna we're gonna pause on the the payment conversation. So we're going to pretend that you have seen an error. This particular you look at this statement to realize, hey? I didn't actually attend this particular date, or maybe there was a prescription didn't have, or you know, something. What would be your next step in terms of

398  
0:41:04  
Emily  
possibly correcting, or yeah, what? What would you believe you you would do if you see something that you don't believe you need to pay.

399  
0:41:11  
P2  
Well, I would

400  
0:41:14  
P2  
either hit payments or the the go back, you know, to co-pays. I want to get back to the payment screen, and then there was

401  
0:41:30  
P2  
you know it would be. It would be a combination of looking at payment history.

402  
0:41:34  
Emily  
Okay.

403  
0:41:34  
P2  
And and so I could line up past bills with past payments.

404  
0:41:42  
P2  
And then

405  
0:41:45  
P2  
I would go back to the Copays, where it

406  
0:41:50  
P2  
you know where it says I have a bill to pay.

407  
0:41:55  
P2  
I would make a note of the Tampa, but I would. I would do the review details, because I'm I would bet you good money that they're in that statement in the Pdf.

408  
0:42:08  
P2  
that there's a phone number in here somewhere. I can call.

409  
0:42:11  
Emily  
Okay, so you'd be looking for a number. Got it.

410  
0:42:14  
P2  
Yep, and I mean, do you want me to do that?

411  
0:42:18  
Emily  
No, no, it's okay. You can go ahead and click click done.

412  
0:42:22  
P2  
Oh, yeah.

413  
0:42:24  
Emily  
Oops!

414  
0:42:24  
P2  
Here's an oops I can't zoom.

415  
0:42:28  
Emily  
There is so that's a pro tip thing. If you tap once it should do a little fake. Zoom there. Yeah, that's

416  
0:42:35  
Emily  
there you go!

417  
0:42:36  
Emily  
Limitation of the prototype. But and.

418  
0:42:39  
P2  
Okay.

419  
0:42:40  
Emily  
Reality. You would be able to, you know, do the the 2 finger things. So yeah.

420  
0:42:45  
P2  
Yeah. And there's see statement questions. I'd call that number first.st

421  
0:42:50  
Emily  
Okay, got it. You did that first.st Okay, go ahead. Go ahead and click done there. Would there be any any other information or guidance you might be looking for outside of calling that number that you found on the statement.

422  
0:43:06  
P2  
I can't think of any I mean I I know. I know there's an over they're telling me I owe money. I don't believe I do think there's a number. I'm hoping that connects me to the right person. If not, they will hopefully connect me to the right person. And it, you know we'll we'll go from there.

423  
0:43:22  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And then second question, actually, since you mentioned this was a bit of real life, you would you. You had called someone when when there, there was concern about about payment. If you were gonna pretend that you didn't believe you had the money to pay a specific bill. Would you? Would you still call? You believe? I know you had mentioned that there was a phone call you had done before.

424  
0:43:49  
P2  
Yeah, I I would call, you know. I mean I I

425  
0:43:53  
P2  
there's always that fear that if I if I mess up.

426  
0:43:57  
P2  
you know I lose my Va. Benefits. So I'm very proactive about, you know, at least, and if even if there was nothing that they could do.

427  
0:44:07  
Emily  
-h.

428  
0:44:07  
P2  
At least they could put. They could put notes in the records that, hey? He called, and it'll and notified us that the payment was going to be late. He said he could pay in full on this date, so that you know they know that I'm not just neglecting them.

429  
0:44:22  
Emily  
Right? Okay, got it? And were you so like when you had to make a call before how did you become aware that there might be options for let's say, delaying a payment, for example.

430  
0:44:37  
P2  
Well, we never got into that conversation because she

431  
0:44:41  
P2  
She informed me that I'd already paid met my $[redacted], and I didn't know anything, and I was like, Oh, oh, you know, Bonus.

432  
0:44:53  
Emily  
All right, and then

433  
0:44:57  
Emily  
Let me have you tap on the help on the upper right.

434  
0:45:03  
Emily  
I want to get your thoughts. I think you had

435  
0:45:06  
Emily  
tapped on it earlier, accidentally, yeah. So thoughts on the the topics here. If this might be something you would use or

436  
0:45:16  
Emily  
yeah, what? What your thoughts on these are.

437  
0:45:27  
P2  
I think you've got it pretty much covered. It's if I have a question. If I

438  
0:45:32  
P2  
can't make a payment, or I need some assistance or something, if I

439  
0:45:38  
P2  
am adamantly disagreeing with the bill, I there's that, and if let's say

440  
0:45:49  
P2  
you know, I know that just a few months ago.

441  
0:45:53  
P2  
after a certain organization visited social security. My wife didn't get a social security check, and we had to go down to social security.

442  
0:46:03  
P2  
Anyway, we'll leave that there. So yeah, if I if my social security stopped, I would definitely be using that bottom

443  
0:46:12  
P2  
option.

444  
0:46:13  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, got it. If you wanna go ahead and and and tap into into that one just to see where that goes.

445  
0:46:28  
Emily  
and I believe you should be able to tap that as well.

446  
0:46:33  
Emily  
Oh, maybe. Okay. Sometimes this is this, one's a little wonky sometimes.

447  
0:46:38  
P2  
Yeah, it's it's kind of you. Yeah, you can see, it's kind of not wanting.

448  
0:46:43  
Emily  
Thinking.

449  
0:46:43  
P2  
You all here.

450  
0:46:44  
Emily  
Yeah, that's okay. That happens sometimes. I'll go ahead and click close there.

451  
0:46:52  
Emily  
Okay?

452  
0:46:54  
Emily  
And all right.

453  
0:46:58  
Emily  
so thoughts on this experience on our on our pretend app compared to how you have done things on vi.gov. I know you mentioned this is like a 1-stop shop. Other thoughts on the information here, the experience of

454  
0:47:18  
Emily  
seeing the Copays and potentially paying.

455  
0:47:22  
P2  
So as as my method. My mo right now is, I get the bill.

456  
0:47:30  
P2  
I sit down at the computer

457  
0:47:32  
P2  
and I go to, you know. I look. I look the bill over real quick

458  
0:47:37  
P2  
go to pay.gov, and I pay it.

459  
0:47:41  
P2  
This, you know, would be

460  
0:47:48  
P2  
If I didn't have that piece of paper, this would be a a perfect option.

461  
0:47:56  
P2  
because it provides me with everything I need to make that payment.

462  
0:48:00  
Emily  
Okay, good to know?

463  
0:48:03  
P2  
So so you know, you know, here's here's the thing that that

464  
0:48:08  
P2  
that I would worry about, knowing that there is a disconnection between the current website.

465  
0:48:15  
P2  
And the getting the bills in the mail, you know.

466  
0:48:23  
P2  
I would be a little leery of I wonder if that disconnect

467  
0:48:28  
P2  
is still in place with this new app, or if that has been been resolved.

468  
0:48:34  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? And oh, sorry. Go ahead.

469  
0:48:37  
P2  
No, you know. And then the other thought would be, well.

470  
0:48:40  
P2  
if there's no Pdf. If they show. No, you know, if if there's no, if there's a Pdf of a bill.

471  
0:48:49  
P2  
I'm assuming that Bill is also being mailed, so I would be very confused.

472  
0:48:55  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

473  
0:48:57  
Emily  
Thoughts on

474  
0:49:00  
Emily  
how? That could be less confusing to you to, so that you know you're looking at the correct information.

475  
0:49:07  
P2  
So the yes, I do have a thought about that now. I don't know.

476  
0:49:13  
P2  
if that $[redacted] Copay cap is standard, for

477  
0:49:19  
P2  
you know, people, you know, I only have a [redacted]% disability. So if that's kind of standard.

478  
0:49:24  
P2  
maybe there could be a little running total somewhere that says, you know

479  
0:49:32  
P2  
you've you know it's like copays, and it it'll have, you know, to date. You've paid $500 slash

480  
0:49:41  
P2  
of the $700. That's your cap

481  
0:49:44  
P2  
kind of a thing, you know.

482  
0:49:45  
P2  
I'm saying.

483  
0:49:46  
Emily  
Yep. Yep.

484  
0:49:47  
P2  
Something like that.

485  
0:49:49  
Emily  
Okay.

486  
0:49:50  
P2  
That would make me feel really comfortable, that oh, hey! They're they're actually tracking this for me.

487  
0:49:56  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? So more communication on just how close you are to that to that cap.

488  
0:50:02  
P2  
Now.

489  
0:50:03  
Emily  
Okay, and then any other thoughts specifically on how any of these pages or sections are labeled.

490  
0:50:13  
Emily  
anything that might make it more clear for you.

491  
0:50:22  
P2  
No, they're they're you're talking about like at the bottom of the page.

492  
0:50:26  
Emily  
Yeah, it could be the bottom, or really any any of the the pages that you've gone through. If there is any parts that

493  
0:50:32  
P2  
No, it it's it's it's very similar to what I deal with now. I mean, if I want to go to health that brings me to the appointment thing, and the and the refills and

494  
0:50:44  
P2  
and the tracking and stuff and and

495  
0:50:49  
P2  
I'm assuming at some point that would also let me get into my download. My health records.

496  
0:50:55  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

497  
0:50:56  
P2  
The

498  
0:50:57  
P2  
benefits that just that's always just you know, your [redacted]%. And this is how much you get a month. And that's usually all that that ever says

499  
0:51:08  
P2  
and then and then the payments is is very.

500  
0:51:13  
P2  
very straightforward. I will tell you that I just discovered on the current system.

501  
0:51:19  
P2  
How to

502  
0:51:21  
P2  
order my supplies for my [redacted], and some stuff for my [redacted] which I thought was really cool.

503  
0:51:28  
Emily  
Oh, okay, did you recall how you learned how to do that?

504  
0:51:33  
P2  
I stumbled upon it.

505  
0:51:35  
Emily  
There you go!

506  
0:51:39  
Emily  
And that was on.

507  
0:51:40  
P2  
Push buttons.

508  
0:51:41  
Emily  
And I'm sorry was that on the app or on the website.

509  
0:51:45  
P2  
It was the website.

510  
0:51:46  
Emily  
Website. Okay, got it?

511  
0:51:48  
Emily  
Well, it's nice to discover. Discover new things. Then.

512  
0:51:52  
P2  
Yeah.

513  
0:51:53  
Emily  
Okay, and then anything else you'd like to share? Specifically regarding managing finances that we have not already gone over in regards to the Va. In the app.

514  
0:52:07  
P2  
No, I I thought your section there with the help was covered the bases. I mean.

515  
0:52:14  
P2  
this is, this was, some people have worked pretty hard.

516  
0:52:18  
Emily  
All right. Got it.

517  
0:52:19  
P2  
Where you've gotten so.

518  
0:52:21  
Emily  
Okay. I.

519  
0:52:22  
P2  
Job.

520  
0:52:22  
Emily  
Oh, yeah, thank you. So I I know you said that you would like if you I forgot to follow up with this like if you had questions, or if you wanted to thought that they made an error, you would call

521  
0:52:34  
Emily  
any thoughts of if you might use that that help section we looked at to find information first, st or just go directly to calling.

522  
0:52:51  
P2  
I would.

523  
0:52:53  
P2  
That's a good question.

524  
0:52:55  
P2  
When I thought there, when I needed help, I didn't go to.

525  
0:53:01  
P2  
I didn't do any web searching or do anything. I just grabbed the phone number office an old statement and made a phone call.

526  
0:53:08  
Emily  
Okay, got it

527  
0:53:12  
Emily  
all right. Sounds good. And then I'm gonna check in with my team here. If anyone has any questions, Natasha, Natalie, if you have anything, please unmute yourself and

528  
0:53:25  
Emily  
asks, ask here, excuse me.

529  
0:53:33  
Emily  
Okay, I'll take that as a No. So now that we've I think that is everything but I want to check in once again. Now that we've had the whole conversation. Are you still comfortable? If we potentially use a video clip of this with our Va. Partners.

530  
0:53:52  
P2  
Oh, yes, of course. Anything to help make this better, I mean, that's the whole point of the conversation.

531  
0:53:58  
Emily  
It is, it is all right. Well, yeah, that is all we have really appreciate you taking the time. It's always helpful, as you know it's very important to to talk with with veterans to get

532  
0:54:09  
Emily  
your exact experiences, so I'm sure you'll have fun doing more of these in the future. Paragene will be reaching back out, sending you a thank you. Note also a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans.

533  
0:54:25  
Emily  
and that is it for me, so I really appreciate your time. Thank you so much, and I hope.

534  
0:54:32  
P2  
Very welcome.

535  
0:54:33  
Emily  
Your day.

536  
0:54:34  
P2  
Oh, thank you, and I hope all of you have a great day, and thank you again for allowing

537  
0:54:40  
P2  
participate.

538  
0:54:41  
Emily  
Alright sounds great. Thank you so much.

539  
0:54:44  
P2  
Good, good. Have a good day.

540  
0:54:45  
Emily  
I.
