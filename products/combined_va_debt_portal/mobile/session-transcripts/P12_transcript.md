0:00:02  
Emily

3  
0:00:10  
P12  
Yes.

4  
0:00:11  
Emily  
Okay? And are you okay? If I potentially share any clips from our discussion today.

5  
0:00:17  
P12  
Yes.

6  
0:00:18  
Emily  
Okay, if if you want, I know the your video is having trouble. If you want to just turn off your video, that's totally fine.

7  
0:00:24  
Emily  
I know I thought it was kind of

8  
0:00:26  
Emily  
turning off and on, so just have it off. It'll be even easier if you want.

9  
0:00:31  
P12  
Okay, I know I was I was downloading the figma app at the same time.

10  
0:00:36  
Emily  
Oh, oh, that's probably why, okay, cool. That's fine. So 1st in love to know just a little bit about yourself as a veteran in whatever level of detail, is comfortable for you. What branch you served in when you retired or separated.

11  
0:00:50  
P12  
I was in the [redacted] for 9 years. I was a [redacted] and I got out in 2022.

12  
0:00:59  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

13  
0:01:01  
Emily  
And what sort of experience have you had with Va. Since then?

14  
0:01:07  
P12  
I have gotten

15  
0:01:10  
P12  
100% of my care there, especially the [redacted] So yeah, I get all my cover, even cover coverage with the Va.  [redacted]

17  
0:01:41  
Emily  
Okay. Cool.

18  
0:01:41  
P12  
Pardon.

19  
0:01:42  
Emily  
Got it? Great? And then what sort of experience have you had using the Va website and or the mobile app.

20  
0:01:51  
P12  
I usually use the website more. But I still use the app if I'm needing to know information. But

21  
0:02:01  
P12  
I can probably tell you how to do everything on the app and the website.

22  
0:02:07  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. And in what instances are you choosing to use the app as opposed to the website?

23  
0:02:14  
P12  
Like if I need. If I'm on the go, and I need to cancel an appointment, or I need to message my provider or reschedule it. Let them know that I can't. I'm running late. I can message my provider, cancel my appointment. I could look at my upcoming appointments to put on my calendar, or to let [redacted] know if I'm on the go, and I don't have my laptop with me.

24  
0:02:37  
P12  
And for my medication. I usually use that to refill my medication.

25  
0:02:43  
Emily  
No go ahead!

26  
0:02:44  
P12  
And to see when how many refills I have until my prescription expires.

27  
0:02:50  
Emily  
Okay, so is it more. So you're using it when you're on the go.

28  
0:02:55  
P12  
One word.

29  
0:02:55  
Emily  
Y'all getting more so when you're on the go.

30  
0:02:58  
Emily  
Okay. Great.

31  
0:02:59  
P12  
Yeah, like, sometimes questions come up and [redacted] like, Hey, do you have any appointments? I'm like, I'm usually really good at keeping them on my calendar, but I always like to double check.

32  
0:03:08  
P12  
Especially if I get an email saying, Hey, you have a video call 14 days. I'm like what I do. How come? That's not my calendar. And then I look. And I'm like, Oh, yeah. And so yeah, it's just a quick look. But most of the time I use my laptop if I'm home.

33  
0:03:23  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Great. Okay. So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion now. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you're willing. I have 0 information about you or your finances with the Va. So 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money specifically in regard to any benefit, overpayments.

34  
0:03:44  
P12  
Yes.

35  
0:03:45  
Emily  
Okay, and whatever level is any details you'd like to share, you don't have to.

36  
0:03:51  
P12  
Oh, yeah, so I had registered for class when I was [redacted], because I mentally thought I was prepared for class again.

37  
0:04:00  
P12  
I was wrong, like I had the 1st day of orientation, and I was like, I don't have the capacity to do this like [redacted], and the Va. Had already paid my tuition and had already paid me my Mha. Benefits for housing allowance, and I had to

38  
0:04:23  
P12  
let them know that I dropped the class within the grace period. And so by that time they already paid me my book stipend and my

39  
0:04:34  
P12  
housing allowance. And then they had paid my tuition. So I had to send emails out. And then I had a bill for everything, the book stipend and the housing allowance that I had to pay back.

40  
0:04:48  
Emily  
Oh, God, okay. And do you recall how you were notified? Of everything that you had to pay back.

41  
0:04:55  
P12  
I received a letter.

42  
0:04:58  
P12  
I received a letter.

43  
0:05:01  
P12  
I think I think it was, an I'm pretty sure it was a letter.

44  
0:05:04  
Emily  
Okay.

45  
0:05:05  
P12  
It could have been also an email. But I know for a fact it was a letter, for sure.

46  
0:05:11  
Emily  
Okay, great and then how? As a while, while you were paying this, off, do you recall what had had had prompted you every time you did make a payment. If there was

47  
0:05:24  
Emily  
yeah, like, how how you knew when you had to make one.

48  
0:05:28  
P12  
I think the the paper gave me instructions. Go to the website.

49  
0:05:33  
P12  
And then I went to the website. And then I was looking at.

50  
0:05:36  
P12  
What was it that I owed for, and what they were accounting for? And then I don't know if that was a

51  
0:05:43  
P12  
time restriction. I just usually.

52  
0:05:46  
P12  
if something's on my radar, then I keep it on my calendar, and I know when to make a payment towards that

53  
0:05:54  
P12  
bill, so I don't really, if you're asking about a reminder, I don't really remember. I can't say yes or no.

54  
0:06:02  
Emily  
Sure that's fine. Alright. So so you said you you put things on your calendar like when you have to. Okay, got it.

55  
0:06:08  
Emily  
Okay? And then how what methods had were were you using to pay off the debt?

56  
0:06:17  
P12  
You mean like, if I use like a credit card or my bank account.

57  
0:06:20  
Emily  
Yeah, or I, I, if you like, called someone or went in somewhere like, Yeah, what.

58  
0:06:25  
P12  
So I went on the website, paid it with my credit card, and then they actually gave me a confirmation that I saved on my computer, and then they also sent me, which was nice. They sent me a physical copy to my address. With your my debts have already been paid. It says you've paid your Va. Debts. And then here's like the paper confirmation. So that was really nice to get other than having like what they gave me online, just to have a physical copy from the Va.

59  
0:06:55  
Emily  
Okay? And was there also any sort of confirmation online in addition to that letter? Once you had paid it off, there was okay.

60  
0:07:01  
Emily  
Got it. Thoughts on how any of the if if there is anything that could have made that whole process any easier for you.

61  
0:07:18  
P12  
no, I think it was pretty straightforward on the blanks that you were supposed to fill out.

62  
0:07:24  
Emily  
Okay.

63  
0:07:26  
P12  
If I remember correctly.

64  
0:07:28  
P12  
They were specific instructions on how to what to put in the blanks to fulfill that bill for cause. It was for education benefits. And I guess there's there's bills for other things. And so you have to be very specific whenever you're making those payments.

65  
0:07:45  
Emily  
Oh, yeah, okay, yep, I know what you mean.

66  
0:07:47  
Emily  
Okay.

67  
0:07:49  
Emily  
And then have you? I know. So I know you said you do your healthcare through. Va, do you? Do you have experience with medical co-pays

68  
0:07:59  
Emily  
through that? No, okay. Got it all right.

69  
0:08:04  
Emily  
Alright. So let me have you

70  
0:08:08  
Emily  
Share your screen. Let me know if you need help doing that.

71  
0:08:24  
P12  
On my phone before.

72  
0:08:27  
Emily  
Yeah, if you tap it once at the bottom, there should be an option that says, Share.

73  
0:08:31  
P12  
Oh, yeah, I see it.

74  
0:08:32  
Emily  
Thank you.

75  
0:08:33  
P12  
Okay, share, screen.

76  
0:08:35  
Emily  
Green yep.

77  
0:08:37  
P12  
Strip broadcast.

78  
0:08:39  
P12  
Okay, I think it's.

79  
0:08:42  
Emily  
There we go. Yep, okay. And then you can perfect. You've read my mind all right. And now now I'm going to have you open up the figma app. Yep, all right, perfect, and let me have so go to. Oh, if you want to swipe my video just off to the right. Just so you have or left. Yeah, either way. Okay. So go to log into figma.

80  
0:09:05  
Emily  
Yep, continue there.

81  
0:09:08  
Emily  
Okay. And the email that I'll have you enter in is [redacted]

82  
0:09:19  
P12  
Cool.

83  
0:09:19  
Emily  
[redacted]

84  
0:09:26  
Emily  
and password is [redacted]

85  
0:09:34  
Emily  
Okay. And that's I need to get you an authentication code. Give me just a moment. Okay, so the now the number you'll type into the authentication code 2, 6, 5,

86  
0:09:47  
Emily  
0 8, 2, 9 perfect. Alright log in

87  
0:09:53  
Emily  
and then continue with mobile app.

88  
0:09:59  
Emily  
Okay? And then I'm gonna send you a link in zoom. So let me have you switch back to zoom and get a link that

89  
0:10:10  
Emily  
I had sent you.

90  
0:10:12  
Emily  
Yeah, just tap once in the middle you'll have the there we go. Yep, and then hit the chat with the little red button.

91  
0:10:19  
Emily  
a red circle.

92  
0:10:20  
P12  
Sure.

93  
0:10:21  
Emily  
Yep. Tap the very long. URL.

94  
0:10:28  
Emily  
Okay, hopefully, that'll come up soon.

95  
0:10:33  
Emily  
All right, perfect. If you want to swipe my my video out of the way again. Just so you have more screen space. Okay? So we have. Your pretend va mobile app here, you can tap just outside of that blue area like, yeah, perfect.

96  
0:10:48  
Emily  
Okay? So so first, st without tapping, I think you can scroll. But don't yet tap on anything. Where

97  
0:10:56  
Emily  
from here would you expect to find specifically for overpayment benefits, information on money that you owe like for for a particular debt.

98  
0:11:08  
P12  
That's a good question, and let's see payments.

99  
0:11:14  
Emily  
Yeah.

100  
0:11:15  
P12  
Oh, right here, I guess. Overpayments, co-pays.

101  
0:11:18  
Emily  
Okay, great.

102  
0:11:20  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you go back to once. Yeah. Tap on it. Perfect. Exactly. Okay. So thoughts on how easy or difficult it was to to find that, or I guess how how logical or illogical.

103  
0:11:33  
P12  
I think it was logical. Because it's under payments. Which that could go along with copayments, payments, direct deposit stuff. So I think it's in a good category.

104  
0:11:45  
P12  
to access quickly.

105  
0:11:47  
Emily  
Okay, would there be any other title that might make sense outside of payments, that, would still be useful or clear rather.

106  
0:12:00  
P12  
Just no, I think without making it complicated. I think payments should have the all the

107  
0:12:09  
P12  
payment related stuff.

108  
0:12:13  
P12  
And it has overpayment titled. So I feel like it's pretty easy in that sense. But at 1st I was kind of like caught off guard and like. I don't know how to do this. I've never done this, but I was like, Well, I guess we can go under payments to see what

109  
0:12:25  
P12  
my payment history is, because the history does show your overpayment, or what they've paid you. So that was my logic of checking payments, because I'm like, well, if I got overpaid, or if I have a debt, then it would show my Va payment history. And that's where I went, and then it showed overpayment.

110  
0:12:43  
Emily  
Okay, got it great. So on on this page. The the information. That's right below the word overpayment debts, the 2760 due for 4 debts, thoughts on on that information. If there's anything else you would want to know specifically from this page before you dove into the details.

111  
0:13:06  
P12  
No, I think it's pretty self explanatory.

112  
0:13:09  
Emily  
Okay, got it? So yeah. Now, if you wanna tap into the overpayments.

113  
0:13:15  
Emily  
talk to me about how clear it is, just from the information here on what you would currently owe in this pretend scenario.

114  
0:13:37  
P12  
It looks like I owe

115  
0:13:42  
P12  
It looks like there's 3 things I owe. I owe a debt for housing, compensation pension, and then looks like the gi debt for tuition.

116  
0:13:51  
Emily  
Okay.

117  
0:13:55  
Emily  
any thoughts on clarity here. Anything else you might want to know from from this level here.

118  
0:14:22  
P12  
no cause. I think if people have questions on like.

119  
0:14:26  
P12  
if I had a debt for housing, what does this mean?

120  
0:14:30  
P12  
This is really helpful to know

121  
0:14:34  
P12  
And hopefully they got a letter being more specific with why they have that debt. He dropped out of so and so university, or whatever

122  
0:14:44  
P12  
during this time period, whatever the case may be. But I feel like that's really helpful if you go review details, and it says where I might have this debt if people had questions on why they had this. But that's what I was looking for. I was like. Well, if I wanted to know more information about why I have this debt, I would like to know where it's

123  
0:15:02  
P12  
why. But this is perfect.

124  
0:15:04  
Emily  
Okay, good. And would there be? Yeah. Thoughts on on specifically finding out like, why, you would have that debt, what? What might be your next step to to discovering that.

125  
0:15:22  
P12  
Are you mean? Do you mean like? If I still had questions about why I still had a balance.

126  
0:15:28  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah.

127  
0:15:30  
P12  
I think that if I hadn't gotten a letter, and or if I don't know my situation, and I was completely caught off guard, I would call the number. There's a 1 800 Gi. Bill number. I'm not sure where it's at, but

128  
0:15:45  
P12  
it's usually on our on our letters that we get. If we have any questions, let me see.

129  
0:15:53  
Emily  
What would you? So what? What would you specifically be looking for here if you, if you knew you wanted to find out more information.

130  
0:16:01  
P12  
I'd be looking for the 1 800 number like to call for my debt like if I had more questions. Aside from this maybe have the number down here.

131  
0:16:14  
P12  
So that they have a resource to contact someone and talk to them directly instead of trying to look for it, or trying to look for their award letter. I would have like the number to the 1 800 Gi. Bill. Whatever the number is

132  
0:16:30  
P12  
to talk someone to someone specifically about the issue.

133  
0:16:33  
Emily  
Okay, got it? How about the the rest of the of the information that is here, what how useful is it, what what else might you expect to have outside of that phone number that you've mentioned.

134  
0:16:58  
P12  
I think that's it.

135  
0:17:04  
P12  
Cause it has everything here.

136  
0:17:06  
Emily  
-

137  
0:17:07  
P12  
That I would I would be looking for it has the letters that I'm guessing you can download if you need, or just to see

138  
0:17:17  
P12  
Let's see.

139  
0:17:21  
Emily  
Regarding those those debt letters so so you said you would you would expect to be able to download those.

140  
0:17:30  
P12  
Yes.

141  
0:17:30  
Emily  
Okay.

142  
0:17:31  
P12  
I don't know if it's because, like, I'm on this the one that just doesn't

143  
0:17:36  
P12  
that's just like a

144  
0:17:39  
P12  
a trial one, but if this had the letters, I would expect to like click on it and view the letters.

145  
0:17:47  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. Got it.

146  
0:17:49  
Emily  
if if it were built exactly as you're as you're seeing here, whereas you notice you're not able to download – thoughts on how useful that might be?

147  
0:18:03  
P12  
Hmm!

148  
0:18:05  
P12  
I think would be useful if somebody was completely caught off guard, and they didn't understand why they were in debt. But I feel like, for example, my situation. I knew that I had dropped out of class, so I was expecting to pay some debt, so I knew ahead of time to be expecting a letter from the Va. And that should be

149  
0:18:25  
P12  
majority of people's issues if they are in school, and they, specifically for school if they know that they dropped out of school during the semester, or whatever like. I feel like that's an expected that you should be expected to pay that, and I feel like that should be an expectation. So

150  
0:18:41  
P12  
the letters it would be helpful. But also

151  
0:18:47  
P12  
there's a lot of things that you have access to on the website that

152  
0:18:51  
P12  
the mobile app is good just to kind of view real quick. And then, if they really need to see something I feel like a laptop or like getting on the desktop would be helpful. But

153  
0:19:02  
P12  
then again, that's just me, because I like using my desktop more than my phone. My phone's just for quick references not to actually dig into a situation where I might already know the answer I just need to look like, hey? Did my payment go through? Did? Where's this late fee coming from? Like just real quick glances of my payment? Did it go through? How much do I have left? Not really like looking for my letters, but I can see the how that can be helpful. If someone was caught off guard and they didn't know why they had debt.

154  
0:19:32  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So if we're

155  
0:19:35  
Emily  
So if if the if just the the listing of the fact that there was a letter here, but you're not actually able to see it here. Thoughts on that, or just like what a next step might be if you see that there was a letter sent.

156  
0:19:50  
P12  
I feel like it shouldn't show the letter there if you can't click on it and view on it, because I know some people might

157  
0:19:59  
P12  
be like. Hey? They sent. They said they sent me a letter on June 16, th but I never received it.

158  
0:20:06  
P12  
So then that would kind of be triggering to say that there is a letter that was sent by the Va. But they can't click and view it, and they haven't received it so that might be an issue.

159  
0:20:17  
Emily  
Okay.

160  
0:20:18  
P12  
People can run into if they haven't received it.

161  
0:20:22  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Makes sense.

162  
0:20:25  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you. Scroll back up and just any other

163  
0:20:31  
Emily  
thing, you you might expect to to do here from this page.

164  
0:21:03  
P12  
how do I request? Financial?

165  
0:21:06  
P12  
Okay. Says, to avoid late fees or collection action, you must pay your full balance or request financial help. How do you request, financial help.

166  
0:21:16  
Emily  
Okay as well. I'll turn that around. How? How would you? What? What would you be looking for if you did want to request help.

167  
0:21:24  
P12  
I think that it would have a contact information or an email. Who would we be contacting? Maybe office hours.

168  
0:21:34  
Emily  
Okay.

169  
0:21:35  
P12  
Office hours, email, just just contact information.

170  
0:21:42  
Emily  
Okay, so you want contact information there, got it?

171  
0:21:47  
Emily  
And alright, we'll, go, we'll, we'll get back to that in a moment, but

172  
0:21:52  
Emily  
if this, if the app were to be built as you're seeing now,

173  
0:21:58  
Emily  
thoughts on how likely it would be that you would you? You would you would use it the way it's built here.

174  
0:22:07  
P12  
Right now.

175  
0:22:08  
Emily  
Yep.

176  
0:22:10  
P12  
I would use it.

177  
0:22:11  
Emily  
Okay.

178  
0:22:12  
P12  
I would use it like, I said, as a quick glance to see my payments, my history, how much I have left and that's about it, and anything else like, if I need to grab letters or need to do something, I would use my desktop.

179  
0:22:25  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, you'd go to the desktop. Then. All right.

180  
0:22:28  
Emily  
Let me have you tap on the payment section again on the lower. Right?

181  
0:22:33  
Emily  
Okay, and scroll all the way down to the bottom.

182  
0:22:36  
Emily  
and then the blank gray area toward the bottom tap. Once on that

183  
0:22:42  
Emily  
great and then tap into overpayment debts.

184  
0:22:46  
Emily  
And again, we're going to look into so slightly different here again into that post. 9 11 Gi. Bill for housing thoughts on the information and and options. Here.

185  
0:23:16  
P12  
Oh, I think this is really helpful.

186  
0:23:18  
Emily  
Okay, can you say more about that.

187  
0:23:30  
P12  
I think this is really helpful because it gives you a way to resolve an issue or get in contact with someone or steps to

188  
0:23:41  
P12  
what to do if you wanted to start like

189  
0:23:44  
P12  
a payment or a financial status report.

190  
0:23:47  
Emily  
Okay. Great.

191  
0:23:50  
P12  
Let's see.

192  
0:24:13  
P12  
Oh, okay. Okay.

193  
0:24:14  
Emily  
And if you actually stay, stay on that on that page just for a second, yeah, go back to yeah. There you go. I'm not gonna have you read all this, of course, but tap on the the pay online on the upper left the teal button. Oh, either one! Yep, and I'm not gonna have you enter anything in, I promise? But scroll down. And I'm gonna have you look at the yeah. So right in there, the section where you'd have to fill information out.

194  
0:24:39  
Emily  
Love to get your thoughts on where, like, how? How you would get that information that you would need.

195  
0:24:52  
P12  
from here.

196  
0:24:55  
P12  
Cause. Yeah, this is what I was talking about earlier. Yeah, there's like a code. It shows it tells you exactly what codes to put in for your specific

197  
0:25:04  
P12  
payment.

198  
0:25:06  
Emily  
Yeah.

199  
0:25:06  
P12  
Person titled. Yeah, it has all that information. But initially.

200  
0:25:12  
P12  
the 1st statement says, you'll need to provide the following details to pay this debt online. And then it shows pay online. I hope that people don't just kind of go over that and just see that just information and just try to click on things that I feel like people should be very thorough on reading.

201  
0:25:32  
P12  
But I feel like it's very easy to fill in that information if you read the 1st sentence.

203  
0:25:39  
Emily  
Okay.

204  
0:25:40  
P12  
If you read the 1st sentence, if you don't read the 1st sentence, you're probably gonna be like, what do I do here?

205  
0:25:46  
Emily  
Thoughts on since you mentioned people could get confused thoughts on making that even more clear.

206  
0:26:03  
P12  
I don't know. Maybe highlighted or put it in a different color. Maybe that would make it stand out more so people just don't look cause if me, I didn't even read the 1st sentence, but because I I knew like the I've done this before. But.

207  
0:26:19  
Emily  
Okay.

208  
0:26:20  
P12  
If I was a 1st time user, I would just be like, Oh, the 1st thing will catch my eye, was the current balance.

209  
0:26:25  
Emily  
Okay.

210  
0:26:26  
P12  
And the file number, and then all this information, and then

211  
0:26:31  
P12  
maybe that sentence should be after.

212  
0:26:35  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

213  
0:26:36  
P12  
After instead of before. So that way, they are like, Okay, what I do with all this information.

214  
0:26:43  
P12  
But yeah, that would be helpful to do it after, or maybe highlight. It.

215  
0:26:48  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And then so provided someone know, like, you know, that you would need that information, thoughts on actually filling out that payment site. Knowing that the information you need is here.

216  
0:27:05  
P12  
You mean how my thoughts on filling this stuff out right here.

217  
0:27:10  
Emily  
Yeah. And again, I'm not gonna no, don't don't type anything. I'm not gonna.

218  
0:27:12  
P12  
Model, yeah.

219  
0:27:13  
Emily  
Anything. I don't want you to pretend to pay anything here.

220  
0:27:18  
P12  
I think it's pretty straightforward.

221  
0:27:21  
Emily  
Okay.

222  
0:27:23  
P12  
Let me see.

223  
0:27:29  
P12  
72 education.

224  
0:27:32  
Emily  
What would be your process for specifically getting, let's say, the all all that piece of information into this site, like from the app into this payment site.

225  
0:27:57  
P12  
I don't know. I feel like that wouldn't be safe.

226  
0:27:59  
P12  
I mean, if somebody wants to pay someone else's debt. But I feel that if they, another thing that you could do is if they click on it, it could generate. But then it wouldn't go to this page. It would just go to the 1st page, and people would have to actually click on pay online to get to this part right here.

227  
0:28:18  
P12  
And so the initial page might.

228  
0:28:26  
P12  
yeah, I feel like you could just pay online and then read this stuff.

229  
0:28:32  
P12  
Good job.

230  
0:28:34  
Emily  
So if if you if you did did want to pay online, yeah, how? How exactly would you get? I think if there's like an account number or something. Knowing it's in the app, how? How would you then get that into the pay site here.

231  
0:28:52  
P12  
Oh, just copy and paste it.

232  
0:28:55  
Emily  
Okay, you copy and paste.

233  
0:28:57  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

234  
0:29:02  
P12  
Available.

235  
0:29:03  
Emily  
Okay? So then,

236  
0:29:05  
Emily  
if this, if if what we're viewing now is is built in real life, the the app. If you want actually switch back to figma. Just so we're looking at just the app perfect. Yes, if if it were built as is here with that link to the payment site and the information here. Thoughts on the likelihood of using it as is.

237  
0:29:30  
P12  
As this part.

238  
0:29:32  
Emily  
Yeah, that's the whole thing. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

239  
0:29:35  
P12  
I would definitely

240  
0:29:37  
P12  
use it if it had all this information, because there would no need to go to my laptop, because everything would be here.

241  
0:29:45  
Emily  
Okay?

242  
0:29:49  
Emily  
And then they can know the answer just to confirm so comparing the version this version here, where the there's the payment option versus the original version that didn't have any payment option. Thoughts on

243  
0:30:06  
Emily  
which one you'd be more likely to use.

244  
0:30:09  
P12  
Oh, I would for sure be likely to use this one because it's like a 1 stop shop.

245  
0:30:15  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, okay.

246  
0:30:20  
Emily  
And alright, and then any other thoughts on from this page any other information that would be useful for you.

247  
0:30:34  
P12  
Nope.

248  
0:30:36  
Emily  
Okay, great. Let me have you tap on payments in the lower right.

249  
0:30:42  
Emily  
and then let's go to Copays

250  
0:30:46  
Emily  
again. We're going to pretend that you have medical copays in this pretend scenario here.

251  
0:30:53  
Emily  
Thoughts on oh, you know I'm sorry I totally skipped something. Let me have you.

252  
0:31:01  
Emily  
go back to payments. I just forgot one thing and go back to overpayment debts.

253  
0:31:07  
Emily  
So yeah, any just wanna make sure any other

254  
0:31:11  
Emily  
thing to add, if you let's say we're

255  
0:31:15  
Emily  
not sure you would be able to pay. I think we went through some of this before. But yeah, thoughts on where you'd be. Find that information just anything else to add, for how useful that would be.

256  
0:31:28  
P12  
I think it's if I had questions, I would say resolved it, and then I would request help.

257  
0:31:35  
P12  
And then it would give me

258  
0:31:38  
P12  
a lot of questions or a lot of options to

259  
0:31:43  
P12  
do whatever I need to do with whatever I felt like was I need to do for the debt. So I think this is really useful. That it's

260  
0:31:53  
P12  
there.

261  
0:31:56  
P12  
And that all the options are under there.

262  
0:31:58  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, got it? And were you aware of any options like this of like disputing or or getting help financially?

263  
0:32:14  
P12  
If I read my paperwork. Yes.

264  
0:32:17  
Emily  
I know.

265  
0:32:17  
P12  
I I cause I already knew I owed debt, and so I didn't need to dispute it. But I think on the paperwork there is a number on the letter that I can call to ask questions, and I'm not really sure if I'm sure that there was like

266  
0:32:32  
P12  
a number to call for help to, or it was all the same, if I had questions regarding anything

267  
0:32:39  
P12  
with the debt. So yes.

268  
0:32:45  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

269  
0:32:47  
Emily  
Okay? And

270  
0:32:51  
Emily  
okay. Now, let me have you go tap on payments. We're gonna get back to the co-pays where I'd start to have you go. There we go.

271  
0:33:00  
Emily  
So thoughts here again, pretending that you had some medical Copays thoughts on the information presented here, and just what you would find useful

272  
0:33:28  
Emily  
for the statements. Do you? Are there any scenarios now where you are looking at statements? It could be with with anything financial in your life.

273  
0:33:38  
P12  
Well, I look at the whenever I get community care through the Va. They send me the statements. I mean. Not that I have to pay. They're not bills. They're just like letting me know that

274  
0:33:49  
P12  
I don't have to pay anything. So I still have to look at those statements.

275  
0:33:52  
Emily  
Hmm! But.

276  
0:33:53  
P12  
So I get those pretty often.

277  
0:33:55  
Emily  
Okay.

278  
0:33:57  
P12  
But

279  
0:34:03  
Emily  
And thoughts on viewing a statement here within within the app.

280  
0:34:08  
P12  
I think that's perfect. That it's here.

281  
0:34:14  
P12  
As long as that. The date for the description is the date that they visited, or they received the medication, because I know sometimes those dates can be

282  
0:34:25  
P12  
off, sometimes. And that confuses people, or I know that's confused me before, where the dates don't match up. So I'm like, Hey, I never went to this appointment on this date. But that's what the like

283  
0:34:40  
P12  
community care paperwork says. So I just wanna make sure.

284  
0:34:45  
P12  
Yeah, cause here it says the outpatient care was on June 20 second. And so it matches here. So they should know that that's the date that they had their appointment.

285  
0:34:57  
Emily  
And then for the statements. I know you said so. You would look at them, view them. Would you be doing anything else with these statements?

286  
0:35:06  
P12  
if I need to share some information with

287  
0:35:12  
P12  
A doctor show proof that I did pay it. If they said I didn't pay it. I'll just keep it for my records.

288  
0:35:18  
Emily  
Okay?

289  
0:35:19  
Emily  
And what would be your process for keeping it.

290  
0:35:24  
P12  
I would probably save it on my drive. But not download on my phone, probably on my computer.

291  
0:35:30  
Emily  
Hmm.

292  
0:35:30  
P12  
Or I probably print it, but if I don't.

293  
0:35:39  
P12  
there's just so many letters I get from the Va. So I feel like they do. The Va. Does a really good job at making sure that there's paper copies of everything that you have.

294  
0:35:52  
P12  
So as long as that the paper copies are sent out automatically, like they are, it wouldn't be nice to have it online for people that are more tech savvy? But I honestly just like the paper, because it's less memory on my phone or my computer. And I just have, I just have a file that I put on my Va stuff on there and just file it away and call it a day.

295  
0:36:13  
P12  
Okay, good.

296  
0:36:14  
Emily  
Okay.

297  
0:36:15  
P12  
But I mean I can see how it could be useful just to kind of get an overview of all these individual

298  
0:36:21  
P12  
charges.

299  
0:36:25  
P12  
Yeah.

300  
0:36:26  
Emily  
And then how about if you were looking for any pre like older statements.

301  
0:36:33  
P12  
I think I'd go to Pdf statement.

302  
0:36:35  
Emily  
Okay.

303  
0:36:37  
P12  
Oh, yeah, it doesn't click. Yeah, go to Pdf statements. And hopefully, they have like, it's by date or time or appointment time or whatever.

304  
0:36:47  
Emily  
Okay, thoughts on the ease or difficulty in in finding some of those older statements.

305  
0:37:02  
P12  
Well, this person doesn't seem to have like a lot of stuff, but if I wonder what it would look like if there's like a max that's on this page before it gets to the bottom. Because if somebody did get seen pretty often, did they have to scroll like a long way before they get to the bottom, and would they know it's down there? So I wonder if there's like a limit on what they can see like 4 or 5 appointments until they get to the bottom. Cause I know that I get seen weekly.

306  
0:37:28  
Emily  
Hmm.

307  
0:37:28  
P12  
So if I were trying to look, I wouldn't want to scroll all the way down, because I'm like, oh, they're just appointments on appointments and appointments and appointments. So I think there should be a Max of how many they can see and then go to a different page, and then they can see the Pdf. Statements at the, so they know that there's things at the bottom.

308  
0:37:45  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay?

309  
0:37:50  
Emily  
And then, so it's a similar question with the overpayments. Let's say, here, you noticed what you believe is an error could be like you didn't actually attend this, the particular appointment for the outpatient care. What would be your next step if you notice that that error there.

310  
0:38:22  
P12  
I think I would click on the appointment, and then I would click on help.

311  
0:38:31  
Emily  
okay.

312  
0:38:32  
P12  
And then I would look at which one I if you can't pay future if you disagree with commate.

313  
0:38:51  
P12  
Yeah, I think this is good information to have.

314  
0:38:57  
P12  
Should it be a help at the top? I'm not really sure it should be

315  
0:39:06  
P12  
What if somebody doesn't know that that's a option to click. I think it should be stated at the bottom. Like a link at the bottom. $20

316  
0:39:18  
P12  
especially if somebody's not tech savvy, and doesn't know much about how to work apps. I feel like if there was a link at the bottom that took you to this page, or took you to something around this.

317  
0:39:32  
P12  
where they can actually see the options. I think that would be more helpful to have at the bottom versus at the help button at the top, right.

318  
0:39:39  
Emily  
Okay, so more more clear somewhere else. Okay, got it makes sense.

319  
0:39:45  
Emily  
And then so let me have you walk through any, any other information that you would find useful here for this particular bill.

320  
0:40:05  
P12  
I mean other than having the information like for pay your $50 bill to have it at the bottom of July 30, th like the the school that was at the bottom. They had the information rather than having the help button.

321  
0:40:20  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Yeah, okay.

322  
0:40:24  
P12  
I think that's more visible for people to see instead of trying to search for it.

323  
0:40:30  
P12  
So I think that's another thing that

324  
0:40:33  
P12  
would be useful if I said, Oh, wait! What do I do here? Okay, let me. Okay. How do I request financial help.

325  
0:40:41  
Emily  
Okay, so is it right there? It's not clear how to request financial help.

326  
0:40:46  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Makes sense.

327  
0:40:49  
Emily  
Okay? And let me have you. We're gonna walk me through what you do. If you are ready to pay this

328  
0:40:57  
Emily  
again, not going to have you enter any real information.

329  
0:41:01  
P12  
I'll click on pay and then pick either of these options. Is there a specific option you'd like me to pick for this.

330  
0:41:10  
Emily  
Yeah, if you if you want to pay online

331  
0:41:19  
Emily  
and I'll have you just scroll down. We're gonna not. Gonna have you read anything here. Go to continue to the form.

332  
0:41:26  
Emily  
and from here scroll down just to get to the part where you need to enter information and and similar question as before with the overpayment of yeah, like locating that account number you need. How would you go about doing that?

333  
0:41:44  
P12  
Oh, that's pretty useful.

334  
0:41:48  
P12  
Cause I I know that the account number is here. Nice to copy.

335  
0:41:55  
Emily  
Okay.

336  
0:41:55  
P12  
And then paste it.

337  
0:41:59  
Emily  
It won't actually pay something. But okay.

338  
0:42:01  
P12  
Yeah, so it would be nice to paste it in. I like that. There's like this prompt up here. Where do I find my Va. Account number. I like that. It opens up, and it actually shows the statement.

339  
0:42:10  
Emily  
Who.

340  
0:42:14  
P12  
It actually shows the statement.

341  
0:42:18  
P12  
but maybe a screenshot from would be helpful is here too.

342  
0:42:25  
Emily  
You say more about that? About a screenshot.

343  
0:42:27  
P12  
A screenshot of this area here and then highlighting the account number here, too, where they can copy it, maybe reminding them in that

344  
0:42:36  
P12  
part where it says where to find it, and I click on that.

345  
0:42:39  
Emily  
Where is he?

346  
0:42:40  
P12  
This is very useful, too. But then, knowing maybe them knowing it's on their app, and they can copy and paste it, maybe showing them like the same screenshot of

347  
0:42:50  
P12  
that homepage and showing them how to copy it. If that wasn't.

348  
0:42:54  
Emily  
Okay.

349  
0:42:54  
P12  
Option 2. But

350  
0:42:57  
P12  
this is a good this is good to have, too, because I know that if you get a paper copy and you have it in hand, you can write it down, or you can pull it out and

351  
0:43:06  
P12  
know where to exactly where to find it. So this is good. I just think that having the screenshot of this and knowing like, if they're using their phone specifically, and they don't have access to their document or going back and forth, flipping between pages, I think. Just having a screenshot of Hey, just a reminder. This is at the front of your page.

352  
0:43:25  
Emily  
Okay, got it. Could there? Thoughts on anything be made more clear here on this page in terms of having to copy that account number.

353  
0:43:37  
P12  
I feel like it's pretty straightforward.

354  
0:43:41  
Emily  
Okay.

355  
0:43:45  
P12  
Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.

356  
0:43:48  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

357  
0:43:51  
Emily  
Any other? Excuse me, any other thoughts on

358  
0:43:55  
Emily  
how things are labeled or structured could be either through the Copay information, or through the overpayment that you think would make things any easier, more useful.

359  
0:44:08  
P12  
I think other the things I mentioned. I think those are it.

360  
0:44:14  
P12  
But anything outside of that.

361  
0:44:16  
P12  
I don't think that there's anything else I can add.

362  
0:44:20  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

363  
0:44:22  
Emily  
I'm going to check with my colleagues, see if they have any questions. So Charlotte and Tasha, if you have anything you would like to ask, go ahead and unmute and ask, now.

364  
0:44:42  
Emily  
okay, I'm guessing. Not.

365  
0:44:44  
Emily  
So that is all that we have here, unless you have anything else to add regarding your

366  
0:44:51  
Emily  
You know any anything that could that could be made easier with finances here in the app here.

367  
0:44:57  
P12  
No, I feel like that's really helpful under payments. And then having everything broken down here, and then

368  
0:45:05  
P12  
every and then when you click on it. It goes to exactly the details. I think that's

369  
0:45:10  
P12  
that's a really good idea.

370  
0:45:12  
Emily  
Okay, great.

371  
0:45:13  
Emily  
alright. Well, thank you so much for your time. It's always super helpful to to walk through things with veterans. Understand exactly how you might use things, what you would like, so we can continue to make things so. Thank you so much for taking the time. I know Para Jean will be reaching out for next steps on their end. There.

372  
0:45:37  
P12  
Okay.

373  
0:45:37  
Emily  
And otherwise. I hope you have a great rest of your day.

374  
0:45:41  
Emily  
Okay, thank you. Bye.

375  
0:45:42  
Emily  
Take care.
