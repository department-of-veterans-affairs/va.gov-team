WEBVTT

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Moderator - Emily>Ask you yet again. So now that we are recording,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.640
<v Moderator - Emily>are you okay if I record video and audio

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Moderator - Emily>today?

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.720
<v P 09>That's fine.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, great. And are you okay if we

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Moderator - Emily>potentially use a clip clips of this to show

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.880
<v Moderator - Emily>our VA partners?

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.560
<v P 09>That's fine.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, great. Okay, so just general questions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Moderator - Emily>Love to know a bit about yourself and whatever

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Moderator - Emily>you are comfortable sharing as a veteran.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.650
<v Moderator - Emily>What branch you served in, maybe when you

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Moderator - Emily>retired or separated.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.530
<v P 09>Yeah, actually I served in [redacted]  from

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.330
<v P 09>2006, 2010 and then after that I decided

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.850
<v P 09>to separate and go to college instead. And

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.330
<v P 09>then after I worked for the [redacted] as

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.770
<v P 09>I started there. Well, I had different positions

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.180
<v P 09>prior to that, like from like private sector,

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.700
<v P 09>but pretty much like in the software tech

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.540
<v P 09>side of things, just put it that way. I was

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.180
<v P 09>working like a [redacted] . But yeah.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. And then what sort of experience

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.180
<v Moderator - Emily>have you had with va?

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.090
<v P 09>So I had like, I had a couple of surgeries

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.970
<v P 09>from the va. And yeah, I've. I've used, you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.770
<v P 09>know, prescription medications.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:46.130
<v P 09>[redacted] .

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.820
<v P 09>They sourced it out like outside, I think

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.620
<v P 09>is what they did. And then they just, they

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.740
<v P 09>just paid for it. And then. Yeah, so like

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.700
<v P 09>I use VA, like here and there when I can

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.700
<v P 09>first, like for things that are not like

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.660
<v P 09>very, very urgent that I need. Like tomorrow,

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.900
<v P 09>you know, like urgent care.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.260
<v P 09>I would just go to like my, my doctor for

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.340
<v P 09>those kind of things. But otherwise like

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.020
<v P 09>I try to use it since it's free.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yeah, got it. And then what sort of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Moderator - Emily>experience have you had with the VA website

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.380
<v Moderator - Emily>and.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Moderator - Emily>Or the mobile app?

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.530
<v P 09>I used to use just the website because I

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.730
<v P 09>didn't like clogging my phone with like apps

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.770
<v P 09>and stuff like that. So that's why like I

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.650
<v P 09>didn't have Figma on my phone. That's why

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.490
<v P 09>I was using my iPad earlier because where

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.010
<v P 09>I had my Figma. But.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.050
<v P 09>But lately probably in the past year or so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.730
<v P 09>because I've done a number of meetings with,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.440
<v P 09>with Perigean technologies and then I use

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.360
<v P 09>the VA app to, you know, to do some testing.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.120
<v P 09>So I figured like I might as well just keep

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.280
<v P 09>it there. So whenever I. And then since then

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.360
<v P 09>I use it for, let's say I want to request

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.040
<v P 09>for refill for medication or I believe I

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.040
<v P 09>did set up an appointment through there one

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.680
<v P 09>time, but I'm just so used to like doing

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.200
<v P 09>it on the website that Sometimes I'm most

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.320
<v P 09>of the time on my computer anyway. So I would

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.090
<v P 09>just go to like, VA. gov . I forgot the website.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.570
<v P 09>Exactly. It's in my bookmark. I just do it

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.970
<v P 09>through there. But otherwise I just kept

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.050
<v P 09>the app in my o n my phone for like, quick

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.290
<v P 09>things. So if I'm not around my, my computer,

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.610
<v P 09>I just use the app.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.370
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. All right. So if you're, if you're

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.290
<v Moderator - Emily>not close to your computer and any other

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Moderator - Emily>reasons you might choose to use the app over

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:33.570
<v Moderator - Emily>your computer.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.130
<v P 09>Just for mobility, I guess. Yeah. If I'm

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.730
<v P 09>just not around there because like, if I'm

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.870
<v P 09>on my workstation, I'm also. I'm over there.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.990
<v P 09>Like, you know, I don't usually, like when

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.990
<v P 09>I work, I don't.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.150
<v P 09>I have my phone like away so that I don't

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.950
<v P 09>get distracted. So that's why like, I use

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.590
<v P 09>my. Yeah, my workstation like, you know,

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.990
<v P 09>for everything else. Got it.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.670
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so we're going to move into the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.350
<v Moderator - Emily>financial portion of the discussion. So I

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Moderator - Emily>want to make sure that you're only sharing

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.710
<v Moderator - Emily>what you're willing. I have no additional

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Moderator - Emily>info or I have no information whatsoever

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Moderator - Emily>about any sort of finances for you. So any.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.050
<v Moderator - Emily>Let's know, any experience.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Have you had experience with owing the VA

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.930
<v Moderator - Emily>money, such as for benefit overpayments?

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.289
<v P 09>There was a copay a couple years ago and

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.010
<v P 09>there's one, I believe last year, I think

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.130
<v P 09>last year, not too long ago, saying that

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.970
<v P 09>there's a copay. But I. It ended up getting.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.380
<v P 09>I believe they're getting nulled or. Yeah,

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.940
<v P 09>I ended up not paying for it. I talked to

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.860
<v P 09>them about it. I forgot where it was, but

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.340
<v P 09>I had like a physical mailing letter for

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.620
<v P 09>it.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Okay, so it was, it was mailed for

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Moderator - Emily>this copay.

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.620
<v P 09>Yeah. And then I called the VA about it.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.340
<v P 09>I did it through the phone and then it was.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:14.450
<v P 09>I believe it was for my [redacted] . Since

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.610
<v P 09>they couldn't get the appointment for in

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.730
<v P 09>the next 30 days, they had to go outside.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.130
<v P 09>I believe it was for that. And then I called

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.810
<v P 09>the VA about it because I got the letter

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.010
<v P 09>and I told them, yeah, it's supposed to be

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.130
<v P 09>like for free. Oh, good.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. All right. So outside of that, it sounds

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Moderator - Emily>like you. You have not received co pays or

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Moderator - Emily>have there other benefits?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.150
<v P 09>I have a while ago from one of my prescription,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.390
<v P 09>but had since stopped taking my, my prescription

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.230
<v P 09>for like [redacted] .

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.470
<v P 09>It's kind of like, you know, didn't want

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.310
<v P 09>to take any of that anymore. So like, that's.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.590
<v P 09>That's where I received a copay.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.910
<v Moderator - Emily>Mm. Okay, got it.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.910
<v Moderator - Emily>And is that you said you had received a letter

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Moderator - Emily>any other way that you were given information

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.790
<v Moderator - Emily>about these past copays?

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.980
<v P 09>No, it was just a letter that I saw. It was

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.260
<v P 09>a mail in letter. And there was one more

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.900
<v P 09>letter asking me, I don't know if this is

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.979
<v P 09>in relate relation to my VA vertical benefits,

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.420
<v P 09>but it's asking me if I use the va. I believe

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.700
<v P 09>it was last March because there's like a

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.940
<v P 09>bill.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.340
<v P 09>I was like, I used my doctor for that, so

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.430
<v P 09>I don't know how I remember the date, but

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.310
<v P 09>I got a VA letter saying that this is not

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.310
<v P 09>a bill, but, you know, it's like a charge.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.830
<v P 09>Saying that, you know, if you use the va.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.790
<v P 09>I was like, no, I use my regular doctor.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.990
<v P 09>So I don't know how we'd go through va.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.870
<v P 09>So I was kind of confused. But yeah, didn't.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And it sounds.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.590
<v P 09>It says it's not a bill, but it was like

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:56.830
<v P 09>a bill.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.550
<v P 09>It's not billed to me, but it's just like

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.730
<v P 09>there's a charge, so I don't know. Okay,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:02.730
<v P 09>that's confusing.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.170
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, that makes sense. I'd be confused too

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Moderator - Emily>as well. Oh, yeah.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Moderator - Emily>So it's. It sounds like, and correct me if

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm wrong, that you haven't actually paid

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Moderator - Emily>any of these copays that were sent to you.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Moderator - Emily>They were like, they were all in error. Is

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Moderator - Emily>that right?

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.930
<v P 09>It was.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.050
<v P 09>I paid the. The copay for the medication

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.050
<v P 09>that I used to take.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:23.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. All right.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.770
<v Moderator - Emily>And do you. So for that medication, copay.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.090
<v Moderator - Emily>What. How. How did you know when you needed

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Moderator - Emily>to make a payment and what was.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.890
<v Moderator - Emily>What was prompting you to make those.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.990
<v P 09>I got a fiscal letter.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.110
<v P 09>Through the mail.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.630
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.430
<v Moderator - Emily>And outside of the one confusion that you

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.270
<v Moderator - Emily>certainly mentioned, anything else that might

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Moderator - Emily>be made easier in regards to these copay

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Moderator - Emily>notifications?

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.190
<v P 09>I would say an email would be easier because

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.790
<v P 09>like I said, I didn't start using the app

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.070
<v P 09>up until like last year because I kept on

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.390
<v P 09>redownloading it to do these disappointments.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.870
<v P 09>So I figured just, I just, you know, download

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.150
<v P 09>it. I know there's like notifications on

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.470
<v P 09>there, but like, I have all notifications

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.270
<v P 09>turned off on my phone. Like I said, like,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.870
<v P 09>I know you have my phone when I work, so,

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.270
<v P 09>like, I'm not going to get that. So, like,

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.710
<v P 09>usually I get a lot of my.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.990
<v P 09>I prefer like email notifications. You can

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.990
<v P 09>have like a set time to check my emails and

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.740
<v P 09>then I go through. Then I see my emails.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.700
<v P 09>But as far notifications to have. Even if

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.260
<v P 09>I have the VA app right now, all of my notifications

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.780
<v P 09>on my phone, they're just all turned off

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.900
<v P 09>because they get like distracted so easy

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.620
<v P 09>that I.

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:46.300
<v P 09>Nothing will. Yeah. Not even like a text

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.500
<v P 09>message is like off also. So like. Yeah,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.820
<v P 09>so I would say email would be good, but physical

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.900
<v P 09>mail is also works.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.840
<v P 09>But you know, I don't know, like, sometimes

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.880
<v P 09>like physical mail could be lost. So I could.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.440
<v P 09>Yeah.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.760
<v P 09>But yeah, I've never got an email bill from

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.920
<v P 09>the va. Not that I got it.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.600
<v Moderator - Emily>And then what has been your method for paying

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.760
<v Moderator - Emily>these. These previous copays?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.520
<v P 09>So usually when I see like, you know, the

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.240
<v P 09>physical mail, it says like, go to the website.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.840
<v P 09>A call.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.880
<v P 09>I'll just call them.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:23.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.850
<v P 09>Since I already have it right there.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:28.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. All right.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Moderator - Emily>And let me go have you go ahead and share

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Moderator - Emily>your screen.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.970
<v P 09>Okay. On my phone.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me see here.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.250
<v P 09>Okay.

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:50.740
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, there we go. Perfect. And let

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Moderator - Emily>me have you open up the Figma app and I'm

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:56.540
<v Moderator - Emily>going to give you a. A login to use.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, go ahead and log in.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so the email that you'll use is vatest000mail.com

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.350
<v Moderator - Emily>and the password is going to be eight characters,

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Moderator - Emily>va repeated four times. So va v a v a v a

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Moderator - Emily>all lowercase.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then I'm going to get you an authentication

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:44.220
<v Moderator - Emily>code. Give me just a moment. There we go.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so the code will be 4951008.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, go ahead and log in.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, continue with the app and I'm going

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.140
<v Moderator - Emily>to get you a link in just a moment. All right,

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.980
<v Moderator - Emily>so no need, no click on anything quite yet.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.280
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me send you the link through Zoom. So

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.120
<v Moderator - Emily>you should see in your Zoom chat the link.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.880
<v P 09>Do I stop sharing first?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.680
<v Moderator - Emily>So just tap in the middle and at the bottom.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Moderator - Emily>You should see. Yes.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.520
<v P 09>Oh, I see.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.960
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep, there we go. So tap in the extra long

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.160
<v Moderator - Emily>link there and if you want to swipe my image

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.550
<v Moderator - Emily>off to the right, just don't need to see

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Moderator - Emily>me. There we go. All right. Give it just

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.790
<v Moderator - Emily>a moment.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.710
<v Moderator - Emily>Hopefully this works. Sometimes it's a little

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.550
<v Moderator - Emily>on the slower side.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, this seems promising.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.270
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so here we have your pretend app

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Moderator - Emily>home screen. Here you can tap outside. Just

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.790
<v Moderator - Emily>anywhere outside of the. The little help.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Moderator - Emily>There we go.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.670
<v Moderator - Emily>Perfect. So without. I'm gonna. I'm not gonna

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.310
<v Moderator - Emily>have you tap anything quite yet, but from

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.190
<v Moderator - Emily>looking around here, you can scroll as much

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.350
<v Moderator - Emily>as you want. Where would you expect to find

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:36.790
<v Moderator - Emily>these co pays that you might owe in this

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Moderator - Emily>if you were on the app,

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:40.730
<v P 09>like payments.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. And yeah, thoughts on. In this

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.210
<v Moderator - Emily>scenario, we're going to pretend that you

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.770
<v Moderator - Emily>also have overpayment debts in addition to

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.890
<v Moderator - Emily>co pays, but thought actually, well, first

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.930
<v Moderator - Emily>you clearly went straight to payments. Thoughts

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:02.770
<v Moderator - Emily>on the title of that? Would anything be more

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:03.130
<v Moderator - Emily>clear?

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:08.060
<v P 09>No, it literally just says co pays right

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:11.140
<v P 09>there. So it's, it's pretty straightforward,

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.980
<v P 09>you know, Unless you don't know what that

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.700
<v P 09>means. Yeah. And overpayment and debts, like,

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.620
<v P 09>that's pretty much, you know, outstanding

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.820
<v P 09>due or the same thing. Overpayment debts.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.100
<v P 09>It's kind of. Is that for overpayment debts?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.550
<v P 09>Does that mean like the VA overpaid you and

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:34.510
<v P 09>you have to pay them back?

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.510
<v Moderator - Emily>That's exactly what that means, yes. Yep.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:38.630
<v P 09>Okay. Okay.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.310
<v P 09>Just making sure.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep. Yep. You're right. Yeah.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.790
<v Moderator - Emily>And how about. Okay, so it looks like the

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Moderator - Emily>things are pretty clear here on this page.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.910
<v Moderator - Emily>How about the. Specifically the word payments

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:53.870
<v Moderator - Emily>on the bottom right where you had originally

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.720
<v Moderator - Emily>tapped. I know you went straight there to

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.160
<v Moderator - Emily>find it.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.560
<v P 09>Yeah.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.480
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Any thoughts on if that could be even,

00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.600
<v Moderator - Emily>even more clear in terms of where you would

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.680
<v Moderator - Emily>find the CO pays?

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.040
<v P 09>No, actually, that was, that was very clear.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:08.720
<v P 09>That's.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.000
<v P 09>Without even like, you know, as soon as you.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.800
<v P 09>I logged in here, when you asked me, like,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.560
<v P 09>where would you find your. Your co pays?

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.800
<v P 09>Like, that's the first thing that came to

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.280
<v P 09>my mind, like the underpayments. Because,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.970
<v P 09>you know, that's, that's where I would expect

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:23.570
<v P 09>it to be.

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:26.370
<v P 09>So that's a, that's a very, very clear right

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:26.690
<v P 09>there.

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:31.970
<v Moderator - Emily>Great. All right. And then thoughts on what

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.530
<v Moderator - Emily>information you might want to see. So, like,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.170
<v Moderator - Emily>right now there's a bit of info under both

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.730
<v Moderator - Emily>overpayment debts and co pays.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Any thoughts on what would be important to

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.050
<v Moderator - Emily>see as a really high level when you open

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.770
<v Moderator - Emily>up this page?

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.090
<v P 09>Let me see here.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.490
<v P 09>History, Direct deposit.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.770
<v P 09>I would. Maybe not necessary, but your VA

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.490
<v P 09>debt and bills. No, no, actually that's,

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.730
<v P 09>that's, that's right. Because you're the

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.390
<v P 09>one paying. I was, I was thinking something

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:16.790
<v P 09>else.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:17.830
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:19.870
<v P 09>No, I was. I would say that's, that's, that's

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.790
<v P 09>fine right there. Because it clearly says,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.870
<v P 09>like, what you need to pay at the bottom

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.030
<v P 09>right there. The bottom two.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:29.190
<v P 09>I was thinking, like, I was looking for like

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:38.190
<v P 09>something that was. That if I click on one

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:43.720
<v P 09>of these, like, it'll show me the. Okay.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.080
<v P 09>The.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.360
<v P 09>What they're for. Okay. No, that looks, that

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.400
<v P 09>looks good because like these two are bundled

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.320
<v P 09>together, the overpayment. And that's because

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.000
<v P 09>those are the, Those are the things that

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
<v P 09>you need to pay and it separates the. The

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.080
<v P 09>co pays with your actual overpayment.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:08.600
<v P 09>That VA that you know, that paid you. A question

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.920
<v P 09>for these, like, for overpayments. When would

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:17.960
<v P 09>be like a. How would that work? Would it

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.520
<v P 09>be a va, like they overpaid you, like they

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:23.079
<v P 09>overpaid your doctor, or.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.960
<v Moderator - Emily>No, it's not. I don't. I haven't heard that

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.920
<v Moderator - Emily>example. For one example I've heard is if

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.200
<v Moderator - Emily>you were signed up for some classes and then

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.680
<v Moderator - Emily>for some reason had to drop a class, but

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:36.880
<v Moderator - Emily>had already already received the money to

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:40.030
<v Moderator - Emily>take that class, that would be. Okay, that

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:42.070
<v Moderator - Emily>would be an example of an overpayment.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:47.270
<v P 09>Gotcha. Okay. Okay, got it. No, I think this

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.670
<v P 09>looks good because you have the CO pays and

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:52.590
<v P 09>the overpayments separated so you know exactly

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.870
<v P 09>like where to go. And if you want to prioritize

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.430
<v P 09>one or the other, you know.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.990
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. So for the CO pays, let me have

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.670
<v Moderator - Emily>you tap into that and see about the information

00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:07.470
<v Moderator - Emily>presented and just what you feel would be

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.230
<v Moderator - Emily>important for you to know. For the CO pays

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.510
<v Moderator - Emily>here.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:19.630
<v P 09>So this one says you have submitted.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:32.040
<v P 09>So for the middle one, the $200, I noticed

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:36.040
<v P 09>that these two, the top and the bottom, it's

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:40.600
<v P 09>just like when you paid it and when. When

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:43.400
<v P 09>it's due. Just wondering why the middle one

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.360
<v P 09>doesn't say that.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.320
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so I'll take from that that you'd want

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.360
<v Moderator - Emily>to know more information on why it says to

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:56.210
<v Moderator - Emily>call instead of. Yeah, okay, got it.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Moderator - Emily>Any other.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.250
<v P 09>If, If I was like, you know, if I had like

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:03.410
<v P 09>a. One thing that I would prioritize if.

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.130
<v P 09>If it was me was to. To see exactly what

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.690
<v P 09>I need to paint by, you know, like.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.130
<v P 09>Let's just say like, like I'm one of those

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.650
<v P 09>people, like I have time, like kind of like

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.530
<v P 09>procrastinate, even though like debate right

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:20.210
<v P 09>now. But I still want to see like, you know,

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.330
<v P 09>right away when. When it's going to be due.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.140
<v P 09>So that. Yeah, so that's one of those things.

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:31.740
<v P 09>And yeah, for this one, for example, the

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.260
<v P 09>very bottom says payment submitted. Oh, that's

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:38.500
<v P 09>a zero. Okay, so that one's already done.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.820
<v P 09>Right. So there's no balance.

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:43.220
<v P 09>So I would say this one is not necessary.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.060
<v P 09>Then if it's already. It's already paid off,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.460
<v P 09>it should be under like payment history or

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.780
<v P 09>something like that, which I believe I saw

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:52.260
<v P 09>in the previous stage.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.260
<v Moderator - Emily>You wouldn't even want to see it Right here.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.030
<v P 09>No, because, like, when I click on these.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.990
<v P 09>Because I would think that you already have.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:04.790
<v P 09>When I click on. On the payments the CO pays,

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.470
<v P 09>I would think that these are the ones that

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:09.750
<v P 09>are outstanding, not the ones that are, you

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.830
<v P 09>know, they. Yeah, because, like, over here,

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:15.630
<v P 09>if I go back, I got VA payment history. That's.

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.670
<v P 09>That's where I would think that would go.

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.070
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Got it. Okay.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.510
<v P 09>Yeah.

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.590
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, back into copay is

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.670
<v Moderator - Emily>perfect. So looking at that. That top one,

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.910
<v Moderator - Emily>the James A. Haley veteran hospital, what

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:32.230
<v Moderator - Emily>information would you need to know for this

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:32.870
<v Moderator - Emily>one here?

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.870
<v P 09>So this one is actually perfect right here,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.630
<v P 09>like, asset is. And then you could review

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.229
<v P 09>the details because it tells you exactly

00:19:40.229 --> 00:19:42.830
<v P 09>what you. What you need to pay, how much

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:45.550
<v P 09>you need to pay, and. Well, it tells you

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.710
<v P 09>how much you need to pay, and then when you

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.090
<v P 09>need to pay it and buy. Those are the two

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:53.650
<v P 09>important or two important details right

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.090
<v P 09>away that I want to see if it was, you know,

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:57.970
<v P 09>if I was looking at something and I could

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.730
<v P 09>go and review details on what it's for, you

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:01.050
<v P 09>know.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.610
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yep. Oh, yeah, if you want to go.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.610
<v P 09>Right away, what I want to see is these two.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:07.050
<v P 09>Go ahead.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.170
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, so, yeah.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.250
<v P 09>This page. Let me just take a look at it.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.180
<v P 09>Sprint balance 50.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.540
<v P 09>Yeah. So this one has a breakdown of everything,

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:34.020
<v P 09>but what is this at the bottom?

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:42.220
<v P 09>Okay, so this tells me, since it's $50, I

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:48.020
<v P 09>have to pay the 1, 2, 3, 4. The first four

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:50.820
<v P 09>is pretty much the breakdown of the $50.

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.420
<v P 09>But this. The ones that you paid already.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.860
<v P 09>Okay, so what I'm getting out of this is.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:09.620
<v P 09>This is for. For pretty much like one.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:16.450
<v P 09>Let's just say. What's the word I'm looking

00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.010
<v P 09>for? Service. Let's just say, like, for.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.370
<v P 09>Let's just say this is for your knee.

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:22.650
<v P 09>Right? Like, because I have a lot of knee

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.250
<v P 09>issues for va just for my right knee. Let's

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.250
<v P 09>just put it that way. So these are all the.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.010
<v P 09>These are all the.

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:34.530
<v P 09>The co pays and. And pass. Pass payments

00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.380
<v P 09>for my right knee. That's just, you know,

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.860
<v P 09>kind of like you saying it's an example.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.140
<v P 09>Because I see, like, a payment of $45 right

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:41.420
<v P 09>here.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, okay. So. So grouped. This is. This is.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.980
<v P 09>They're grouped. Yeah, they're. They're grouped

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:48.100
<v P 09>into, like, you know, one. One, I guess,

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.940
<v P 09>like, medical issue.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:51.580
<v P 09>Okay.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.540
<v Moderator - Emily>What other. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:04.230
<v P 09>I would say over here, I would. I would just

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.870
<v P 09>put the.

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.870
<v P 09>What I owed for now, like, let's say, like,

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:13.350
<v P 09>because when I click on that bill and let

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:15.510
<v P 09>me just go back real Quick. So when I click

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:19.670
<v P 09>on this bill, $50, I would say separate these

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:25.070
<v P 09>actual balances from the payments already

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.990
<v P 09>received so that it's clear that's exactly

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.690
<v P 09>my balance, you know, and then the payment

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:33.970
<v P 09>received could be like. Yeah, because, like,

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.730
<v P 09>they're kind of grouped into one, if you

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:36.330
<v P 09>look at it.

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Yeah, go ahead.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:47.930
<v P 09>Or just have, like, all my. The. The breakdown

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.330
<v P 09>of the $50. And then if you really want to

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:51.730
<v P 09>see, like, your past payments, you could

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.180
<v P 09>go to, like, your statements or. Yeah, so,

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.660
<v P 09>like, you could see, like, your past payments

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:57.140
<v P 09>on there.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.420
<v P 09>Because if I was looking at it, I just want

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.620
<v P 09>to see right now, like, what the breakdown

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.300
<v P 09>of the $50 is like.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:05.820
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.540
<v P 09>You know, like, if I wanted to see something

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.140
<v P 09>else, like past payments, I could just go

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.580
<v P 09>to, like, the statements or the payment history

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:13.700
<v P 09>on the first page.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, okay. So it's not really clear now what

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:20.340
<v Moderator - Emily>exactly the $50 is from.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:22.810
<v P 09>Yeah, so that's. That's what I'm. That's

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.730
<v P 09>what I'm most concerned about. If I was.

00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:25.090
<v P 09>If.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.570
<v P 09>If I owed $50 is the. Is to look at what

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:32.450
<v P 09>it's for. You know, these 1, 2, 3, 4 right

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:34.770
<v P 09>here. And then these right here could be

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.569
<v P 09>a different one. Because when I was looking

00:23:36.569 --> 00:23:36.769
<v P 09>at.

00:23:36.769 --> 00:23:39.330
<v P 09>When I was scrolling down the. What I noticed,

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.610
<v P 09>like, I was counting the. The amount. The

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:46.690
<v P 09>$20, the $5. $5, and the other $20 right

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:46.970
<v P 09>here.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.490
<v P 09>And then I started seeing the negative 45,

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.370
<v P 09>and I started seeing the $5. You know, it's

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:53.830
<v P 09>kind of like I understood it, like, looking

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.230
<v P 09>at it, but looking at just maybe like, other

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.070
<v P 09>people's, you know, they might cause confusion,

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:03.430
<v P 09>but I mean, I understand, like, what. It's.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.470
<v P 09>What it's doing.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.110
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.230
<v P 09>But it'd be nice to just have that. That.

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.030
<v P 09>Have that breakdown of $50 over there.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.550
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good. And we're going to pretend that.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:21.050
<v Moderator - Emily>That you. You see an error here. You, like,

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.330
<v Moderator - Emily>something is listed where you're very sure

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:25.330
<v Moderator - Emily>you, let's say, didn't attend that appointment

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:27.570
<v Moderator - Emily>or something. What would. What, What.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.290
<v Moderator - Emily>What would you do in that. In that sense

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:30.570
<v Moderator - Emily>or in that instance?

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:36.090
<v P 09>Okay, so let's say outpatient care for optometry.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:39.890
<v P 09>Yeah, so let's say, like, if I didn't attend

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:44.090
<v P 09>this one, I would. I can click on it.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.830
<v P 09>I would. I would try to. Yeah, I would try

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.510
<v P 09>to tap on it and see, like, you know, if

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.510
<v P 09>there's any more information.

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.950
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, God.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:57.910
<v P 09>If, you know, maybe like, provider contact

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:01.790
<v P 09>info, kind of like to confirm with the provider,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.230
<v P 09>the office of the provider that I didn't

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.510
<v P 09>Go.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.950
<v P 09>The outpatient care for optometry that day,

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:10.190
<v P 09>you know, or at least like some. Somewhere

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.340
<v P 09>to compute contact va. Yeah, because I can

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.020
<v P 09>click on anything right now. Maybe it's not

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:16.540
<v P 09>done yet.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, try scrolling up. I think there's one

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.540
<v Moderator - Emily>that might be active.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:24.380
<v Moderator - Emily>Let me see. So the. The. The top. Yeah.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.740
<v Moderator - Emily>So would this. Would this at all be helpful

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:28.220
<v Moderator - Emily>to you?

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.020
<v P 09>Yeah, it would be helpful because there's

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.140
<v P 09>a billing reference right there. It would

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.860
<v P 09>be nice to. To have, like, contact information.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.480
<v P 09>Because, like, if I was. If I was to look

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.520
<v P 09>at that, hey, I didn't do this. I want to

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.960
<v P 09>be able to contact whoever I need to right

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:46.600
<v P 09>away instead of trying to dig in or call

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.120
<v P 09>the va. Like, VA general number, which I

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.280
<v P 09>would get bounced around.

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.920
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, and so where would you expect to. Since

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.640
<v Moderator - Emily>you mentioned calling someone, where do you

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.520
<v Moderator - Emily>believe you would go to look for a number

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.040
<v Moderator - Emily>to call?

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.980
<v P 09>I would try to click on help first. If I

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.620
<v P 09>was me, like, the first thing I would do

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.500
<v P 09>is pop.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.900
<v Moderator - Emily>Right, okay.

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:12.540
<v P 09>And see, you know, what I can find out of

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:16.060
<v P 09>there. If not, let me look at the previous

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:22.300
<v P 09>page, if there's any contact information

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:23.980
<v P 09>at all, anywhere.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:28.060
<v Moderator - Emily>Well, I think. Yeah, go ahead.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.060
<v P 09>Go ahead. Sorry.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.680
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, I was gonna say since.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:33.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Since you mentioned the. The help button,

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.200
<v Moderator - Emily>if you want to tap on that here.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:44.560
<v P 09>Okay, so. So let's say. Let's go back to

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:48.320
<v P 09>that first one. I don't know if the help

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.120
<v P 09>is going to change.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.400
<v Moderator - Emily>I forget if the help is connected to this.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.440
<v Moderator - Emily>Might not be. Oh, it is. Yeah. All right.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:54.760
<v P 09>Okay.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.280
<v P 09>So it's. If you have questions about your

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.800
<v P 09>copay bills. Okay, so you have. You have

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:06.080
<v P 09>the number on here about the copay bill.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.760
<v P 09>So, yeah, that's.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.280
<v P 09>That's the first thing I would do. So you

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.800
<v P 09>guys have that there already. But is this

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.440
<v P 09>like the. Just the general number for the

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.640
<v P 09>VA or is this like the number for.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.040
<v P 09>In regards to this. Go.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.240
<v Moderator - Emily>So what. What would. I mean, what would.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:27.080
<v Moderator - Emily>What would make it more clear as to what

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.760
<v Moderator - Emily>the number actually is that you're seeing?

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.400
<v P 09>Health Resource Center.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:42.920
<v P 09>What is this for? Outpatient care. Family

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.640
<v P 09>medicine.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.100
<v P 09>So this tells me it's more of a general number.

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:51.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.460
<v P 09>But I mean, that. That would. It would be

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:59.580
<v P 09>fine as long as it relates to the actual

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.860
<v P 09>va. VA Services that I.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.740
<v P 09>That I receive, rather than just a general

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.100
<v P 09>VA number. Is that. Does that make sense

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:08.380
<v P 09>or.

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.540
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yes, you do want a more. More focused

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:11.740
<v Moderator - Emily>number.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.420
<v P 09>Yeah, because, like, I've. I've had that

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.260
<v P 09>happen to me before.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:19.050
<v P 09>Believe it was two years ago where I saw

00:28:19.050 --> 00:28:21.210
<v P 09>a number. It was I was using my. My computer

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.530
<v P 09>and I saw a number, and I called that number

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:26.370
<v P 09>and they put me on hold to transfer me and

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.330
<v P 09>then another transfer after that.

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.690
<v P 09>So if. If this number is actually, like,

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.930
<v P 09>it doesn't have to be the. The provider's

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:39.490
<v P 09>actual number, you know, but someone that

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.250
<v P 09>could help me right away rather than like

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.010
<v P 09>putting me on hold for them to find out which

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.790
<v P 09>one it is and then, you know. Yeah, so more

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.550
<v P 09>like, I guess like someone that could help

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.790
<v P 09>me, but not like the.

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.430
<v P 09>The very first number that the VA would.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:55.910
<v P 09>Would give you, like.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.910
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay. And then kind of a similar question.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.910
<v Moderator - Emily>We're going to pretend that you don't believe

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:04.390
<v Moderator - Emily>you have the money right now to make this

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.590
<v Moderator - Emily>payment. What would. What might you do in

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:08.350
<v Moderator - Emily>that situation?

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.960
<v P 09>I would call the outpatient or not the outpatient

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.240
<v P 09>this number right here and then see if they

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.360
<v P 09>have some type of payment plan or anything

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:26.280
<v P 09>like that or what would be even more helpful

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:30.360
<v P 09>because sometimes people would rather avoid

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.770
<v P 09>social interaction when. When they're setting

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:36.450
<v P 09>up payments.

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:39.930
<v P 09>I would, I would think if they have like,

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:42.250
<v P 09>you know, some type of link right here to

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.410
<v P 09>do like a payment plan.

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:47.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, where would you say?

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:51.289
<v P 09>You know, where would I. Where would I expect

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:51.650
<v P 09>that?

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:52.770
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, exactly.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:30:00.210
<v P 09>So are we talking about just. Just for this,

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:04.160
<v P 09>for each of them or just for all of these?

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Moderator - Emily>Let's say for that 50 payment. Since you

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.320
<v Moderator - Emily>mentioned a repayment plan, where would you

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.680
<v Moderator - Emily>hope or believe to find any information regarding

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.960
<v Moderator - Emily>a potential repayment plan?

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.280
<v P 09>I would say just under payments. Hold on,

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.890
<v P 09>let me go back to the payments here and then

00:30:30.730 --> 00:30:40.490
<v P 09>over here. And pay bill is this. So when

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:44.410
<v P 09>you try to pay a bill, does it go. It doesn't

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.210
<v P 09>do through the app.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:47.690
<v Moderator - Emily>Right.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:53.250
<v P 09>Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, like I said, like, when

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:54.930
<v P 09>I've done it before, it was by phone when

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:56.650
<v P 09>I received the letter. So I've actually never

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.450
<v P 09>paid in the app.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:01.420
<v P 09>I don't believe so that makes sense. So I

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.180
<v P 09>would say that's what I would do, what I

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:06.620
<v P 09>just did right now on the pay bill and see,

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:09.580
<v P 09>like, if there's like a payment plan that

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:10.100
<v P 09>I could do.

00:31:10.580 --> 00:31:11.660
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay. So you.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.300
<v P 09>For the $50? Yeah.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:15.540
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, let me have you tap on close here.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.580
<v P 09>It won't.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.300
<v Moderator - Emily>It won't. That's never good.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:25.140
<v P 09>Yeah, actually, I'm trying to tap on.

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Try tapping anywhere outside.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080
<v Moderator - Emily>I might just have to.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.880
<v P 09>Yeah, go back.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.520
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. Nothing. Nothing is responding.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:36.400
<v Moderator - Emily>If you're tapping. Okay.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.560
<v P 09>Looks like Zoom is working, though.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.800
<v Moderator - Emily>I know one. Why don't you go back to Zoom

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:47.280
<v Moderator - Emily>and then re tap that link from yes, the chat.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.720
<v Moderator - Emily>When in doubt, start over. That's my answer

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.200
<v Moderator - Emily>to everything. Oh, come on. Come on, Figma.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.780
<v P 09>Let me quit Figma.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.140
<v P 09>And then tap that.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:00.940
<v Moderator - Emily>That was going to be my next thing. You read

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:01.380
<v Moderator - Emily>my mind.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.060
<v P 09>I wonder if this, if it just got stuck. Let

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.740
<v P 09>me tap on that again just to.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Sometimes it just gets slow. All right, so

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.300
<v Moderator - Emily>tap on payment. Tap on copay.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.300
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, there we go.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:25.860
<v Moderator - Emily>So let me have you swipe my. Out of the way.

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, just a little more space. Yeah.

00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:33.100
<v P 09>Where did I go for that pay bill, I believe.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.700
<v Moderator - Emily>Well, I'm gonna have you do one thing first.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.820
<v Moderator - Emily>We'll get back to the pay bill but tap on

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:43.780
<v Moderator - Emily>the help and the help section we were at

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:47.370
<v Moderator - Emily>before. And if there's anything there that

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.170
<v Moderator - Emily>I know you said you would probably call,

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.610
<v Moderator - Emily>but if there's anything else that you might

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Moderator - Emily>there for that you might find.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:56.890
<v P 09>There for repayment, there's how to request

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:59.050
<v P 09>debt relief. And if you can't pay future

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.090
<v P 09>co pays.

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:06.210
<v P 09>That's the first thing I would click on the

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.850
<v P 09>second one right here or this one. And also

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.890
<v P 09>if you have questions about your copay bills,

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:14.090
<v P 09>it's one of the ones that I would click on.

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.440
<v P 09>But if you're wondering what the top one

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.840
<v P 09>that I would pick if I wanted to see if there's,

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.720
<v P 09>if there's a payment plan, I would say this

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.160
<v P 09>one because it not. It's not quite debt relief.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.080
<v P 09>But I guess like it kind of like for me it

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.240
<v P 09>kind of sounds like it's more on the, on

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.440
<v P 09>the side of like, okay, like what can I do

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:39.880
<v P 09>to like get help to make payments and anything

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.320
<v P 09>like that.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:42.970
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, can you think of, would there be anything

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Moderator - Emily>that would make that even more clear to go

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Moderator - Emily>there for any sort of debt relief?

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:54.410
<v P 09>So I guess like what we're talking about

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:59.130
<v P 09>is to make payment plans. Right. A debt relief

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.170
<v P 09>is more like trying to ask if there's a way

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:07.050
<v P 09>for you to waive your co pays or your debt.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.640
<v P 09>So I guess like it would be more clear, let's

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:16.000
<v P 09>say like if, if I go to like if you have

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.040
<v P 09>questions about your bills, if it has like

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.920
<v P 09>information about like just to, to request

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:25.480
<v P 09>for payment plan, you know. Yeah, like deferred

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.320
<v P 09>payments or anything like that.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.920
<v P 09>Okay, I just thought about that. That really

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.720
<v P 09>because like I kind of bundled it into one

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.640
<v P 09>where you know, payment plan and debt really.

00:34:36.569 --> 00:34:37.849
<v P 09>But I guess they're different because if

00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:39.249
<v P 09>you're asking for a debt relief that means

00:34:39.249 --> 00:34:41.369
<v P 09>just kind of like wipe it out or something,

00:34:41.689 --> 00:34:42.409
<v P 09>wave it.

00:34:43.049 --> 00:34:47.129
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so could that be more clear here in

00:34:47.129 --> 00:34:48.649
<v Moderator - Emily>terms of Finding what's available.

00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:53.969
<v P 09>Yeah, I would say like if you guys could

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:58.289
<v P 09>either have it under this, if you have questions

00:34:58.289 --> 00:35:02.760
<v P 09>about your pay bills, have like a, you know,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.760
<v P 09>if you have questions about your bills or

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:07.600
<v P 09>want to do a payment plan, it could be under

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.800
<v P 09>here also.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:15.280
<v P 09>Or if you want to put another drop down saying

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.880
<v P 09>about like something about payment plans

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.280
<v P 09>but you know, you don't. But at the same

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.880
<v P 09>time you don't want this to be filled up

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:28.410
<v P 09>with a lot of drop downs. So would say like

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.370
<v P 09>if you want to keep it as is with four, four

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:35.890
<v P 09>drop downs, you could put it right here because

00:35:35.890 --> 00:35:37.450
<v P 09>you know that's more like. Yeah, that's more

00:35:37.450 --> 00:35:38.050
<v P 09>like a question.

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:39.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it, got it.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:46.810
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, and then how are you aware that there

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.610
<v Moderator - Emily>are these options that you're seeing here

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Moderator - Emily>of like requesting debt relief and, and finding

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.130
<v Moderator - Emily>information on, on a payment plan, things

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:54.530
<v Moderator - Emily>like that?

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:57.750
<v P 09>No, I actually did not know anything about

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.550
<v P 09>like a debt relief from VA because I figured,

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.550
<v P 09>you know, if you owe something, you just

00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:05.190
<v P 09>kind of owe something. But you know, it's,

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:11.590
<v P 09>it's different people's, you know, people

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:14.630
<v P 09>have like different situation in life so

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:15.750
<v P 09>they may need it.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:20.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good. I'll have you tap on close here.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:29.710
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So other things you would expect or

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.710
<v Moderator - Emily>hope to be able to do from here.

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.190
<v P 09>Let me just look around real quick, see what

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.910
<v P 09>else it has.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:45.150
<v P 09>There's a statement.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.600
<v P 09>Yeah, so like just what I mentioned earlier

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.800
<v P 09>about having the co. Pay separated with your

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:04.040
<v P 09>previous payments. Because I just, for me

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:06.320
<v P 09>like it just has nothing to do with, with

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.360
<v P 09>my copay right now. What I'm worried about

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.040
<v P 09>what I need to pay and when I need to pay

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:17.520
<v P 09>it. So I would just say just keep these four

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:21.240
<v P 09>right here and then I see the PDF statement

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.720
<v P 09>right there also. It's at the top and the

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:24.040
<v P 09>bottom.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.680
<v P 09>So that's good.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:29.160
<v P 09>Yeah, that's. Go ahead.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.840
<v Moderator - Emily>Are PDF statements something that you use

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Moderator - Emily>now for anything?

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:39.480
<v P 09>Yeah, so let's just say not for like in particular

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:42.400
<v P 09>for va but like, let's just say like banking

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.760
<v P 09>information. Right, I see like just the,

00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:47.200
<v P 09>the rundown of what I have. But if I want

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.720
<v P 09>to dig into it, then that's when I would

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.760
<v P 09>use the PDF statement. So if, if, if I have

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.000
<v P 09>like my previous payments, that's where I

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.360
<v P 09>was. That's where I would expect it, I believe.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.120
<v P 09>And yeah, so that's, that's what I would,

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.880
<v P 09>that's what I would go if I really want to

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:07.880
<v P 09>like you know, audit everything what I paid

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.120
<v P 09>and what I owed. Yeah.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.600
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And let me have you open up one of

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.840
<v Moderator - Emily>the statements here to see if just how. How

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.040
<v Moderator - Emily>useful that might be here on the app.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:22.000
<v Moderator - Emily>So pretend you've opened up this statement

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.680
<v Moderator - Emily>here. So is this something. I guess how.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Moderator - Emily>How would you use the statements? And I said

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.850
<v Moderator - Emily>you would like, audit things specifically

00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:35.050
<v Moderator - Emily>on your phone.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.010
<v Moderator - Emily>How might you use it?

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:41.090
<v P 09>So I would go directly to like the. Oh, actually,

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:43.850
<v P 09>this. Let me see here. It might be a. Let

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:44.730
<v P 09>me just zoom it in.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:48.890
<v Moderator - Emily>So if you tap once. Yeah, if you tap once.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. A little fake zoom.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:51.530
<v P 09>Got it.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:52.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Prototype limitation.

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:58.570
<v P 09>Okay. So it says right here, all of my charges,

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.590
<v P 09>which is pretty much the same thing as the.

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:03.870
<v P 09>The one in the front. Not the front, the.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:09.710
<v P 09>The previous page. And it doesn't have your

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:14.990
<v P 09>previous statement. I would think that, you

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.790
<v P 09>know, like, I guess statement balance is

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:21.990
<v P 09>just for the month or. Yeah. So if this is

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:24.310
<v P 09>all you have for that statement, then that's

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.150
<v P 09>what I would expect.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:30.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay. And then would you be doing anything

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.450
<v Moderator - Emily>beyond viewing the statement on the phone?

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:42.410
<v P 09>No, like on the app, I would just look at

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.250
<v P 09>what I would usually do when I. When I've

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.410
<v P 09>done this on a. You know, like for banking

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:49.610
<v P 09>information, I would look at the. Whatever

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.530
<v P 09>the charges for the month and what I need

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:54.410
<v P 09>to pay and see if they add up. I really want

00:39:54.410 --> 00:39:55.050
<v P 09>to audit it.

00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:59.710
<v P 09>But in this particular situation, you only

00:39:59.710 --> 00:40:01.790
<v P 09>have these four, so.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:03.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. All right, let me have you

00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:08.110
<v Moderator - Emily>tap on. Done there, please. So we're pretending

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:13.110
<v Moderator - Emily>that if this is built in real life, if the

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:15.830
<v Moderator - Emily>app had this section in real life here, like

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.630
<v Moderator - Emily>you're seeing, how likely do you think it

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.030
<v Moderator - Emily>would be that you might use it?

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:26.240
<v P 09>The PDF statements, really, this.

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:28.040
<v Moderator - Emily>This whole thing that we've looked at. So

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Moderator - Emily>viewing this, viewing the information, looking

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.760
<v Moderator - Emily>at the PDF, seeing when things are due.

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:40.040
<v P 09>I would use it if, you know, if it's actually.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:42.720
<v P 09>If it's usable right now, I would say it's

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:48.690
<v P 09>usable as it is. I understand it. And if,

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.250
<v P 09>let's say, because the PDF is very minimal,

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:58.690
<v P 09>I would say that it may not really be needed.

00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.890
<v P 09>For me, like, let's say, like, if I'm just

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.410
<v P 09>looking at the statements, because, like,

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:03.690
<v P 09>for.

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:08.890
<v P 09>For VA statements, it's. For me at least.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.810
<v P 09>Like, for me, it would be very rare to have

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:16.930
<v P 09>like, a lot of. A lot of information there

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.010
<v P 09>on the. On the PDF statements.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.730
<v P 09>So, like, I would just have them in the page

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:25.490
<v P 09>and then make this. Make it still available,

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:28.010
<v P 09>the PDF statement. But, like, I would just

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.970
<v P 09>have everything in the pages like this, but

00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:33.570
<v P 09>separate your. Your. What you need to pay

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:34.370
<v P 09>with these.

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:39.190
<v P 09>I would use this if, you know, if I Just

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:41.190
<v P 09>need to. I need to look at it and pay it

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:44.350
<v P 09>on the app rather than calling the phone.

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:45.750
<v P 09>It would be much easier if I could just pay

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:46.510
<v P 09>in the app too.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good. Yeah.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.550
<v Moderator - Emily>So since you specifically mentioned paying

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.310
<v Moderator - Emily>in the app and right now this version is

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:56.910
<v Moderator - Emily>not. Would that be still be something that

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.110
<v Moderator - Emily>you would use knowing that there wasn't the

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.350
<v Moderator - Emily>option to pay right here?

00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:03.590
<v P 09>Actually, I would rather use that than to

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:06.770
<v P 09>call because the reason why I paid over the

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.610
<v P 09>phone before when I got the physical mails

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:11.210
<v P 09>is like to call this number. So.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:12.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep.

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:13.130
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, that's.

00:42:13.290 --> 00:42:14.650
<v P 09>That's what. It's in front of me.

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:16.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Yes. Got it.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, let me have you tap on the payments

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:19.890
<v Moderator - Emily>in the lower. Right. I'm going to get you

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:22.690
<v Moderator - Emily>to another version and we're going to quickly

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.570
<v Moderator - Emily>go with that. And so scroll all the way to

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:29.130
<v Moderator - Emily>the bottom and tap on the blank gray area

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.090
<v Moderator - Emily>toward the bottom there. Yeah, there we go.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.970
<v Moderator - Emily>Perfect. And now tap on co pays.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So again we're going to go through

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Moderator - Emily>again, that top one, the James A. Haley Hospital.

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:46.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Walk me through. We'll pretend that you are

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.419
<v Moderator - Emily>ready to pay. Walk me through how you would

00:42:49.419 --> 00:42:50.180
<v Moderator - Emily>do that here.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.180
<v P 09>Yes. So let's just say I already reviewed

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:56.740
<v P 09>it. I'm ready to pay. I'll just click on

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:57.460
<v P 09>pay bills.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.470
<v Moderator - Emily>And.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:05.910
<v P 09>If there's a pay, you know, I would pay on

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:09.390
<v P 09>pay.gov since there's, you know, it'll take

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:12.230
<v P 09>you to the website anyway instead of paying

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.230
<v P 09>by phone or by mail. Definitely not pay by

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:15.630
<v P 09>mail. I wouldn't even do that.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:21.310
<v P 09>Yeah, I would just pay on pay.gov. oh, there

00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:22.590
<v P 09>you go. You could click this time around

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.990
<v P 09>and.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:27.220
<v Moderator - Emily>Then go ahead and do that. I will.

00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.140
<v Moderator - Emily>I won't have you enter anything in, I promise.

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:37.140
<v Moderator - Emily>And I'm just gonna. I'm gonna skip most of

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.820
<v Moderator - Emily>that, but scroll down a little bit. I'm gonna

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:42.180
<v Moderator - Emily>have you go to continue to the form, the

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:45.820
<v Moderator - Emily>blue one there. Okay. And then scroll down

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:46.180
<v Moderator - Emily>a little more.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:48.180
<v Moderator - Emily>We're just gonna get you to the one specific

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:53.060
<v Moderator - Emily>area. So the. The account number. Thoughts

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Moderator - Emily>on finding the information you would need

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:00.580
<v Moderator - Emily>in order to make the payment and where. Where

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.980
<v Moderator - Emily>I would say I would click.

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.020
<v P 09>On where do I find a VA account number? Because

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.500
<v P 09>I don't know that on top of my head or I

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.620
<v P 09>would look at like any of my. If I do have

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.900
<v P 09>it, any of my paper mail.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:15.940
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:17.510
<v P 09>Yeah.

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:20.190
<v P 09>But usually if I'm already here, I would

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:22.830
<v P 09>just click on that. Where do I find a VA

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:23.470
<v P 09>number?

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.150
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay. And let me have you switch back

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.630
<v Moderator - Emily>to the Figma app.

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.070
<v Moderator - Emily>See if it wants to cooperate.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:39.630
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And click on Go back and then close

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:45.380
<v Moderator - Emily>and let me have you go into review details

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:49.340
<v Moderator - Emily>there. Oh, sorry. Of the. Yeah, there we

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:49.580
<v Moderator - Emily>go.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Thoughts on. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.340
<v P 09>There's pay bill right here.

00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.780
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:00.460
<v P 09>Okay.

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.700
<v P 09>So it's the same thing I would. I would pay

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.740
<v P 09>on pay.gov.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, how about getting that? I know you

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.940
<v Moderator - Emily>said you would. You would look up where to

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:10.940
<v Moderator - Emily>find the account number.

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.730
<v P 09>Yeah, it's. I see it there and I would just

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:18.170
<v P 09>copy it. Okay, so that's very helpful right

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:21.690
<v P 09>there because. So is this account number,

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:24.490
<v P 09>the. The.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:27.449
<v P 09>Your VA account number, or is this account

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:28.810
<v P 09>number of that bill?

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:31.330
<v Moderator - Emily>That's a great question. I do not know, but

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:33.610
<v Moderator - Emily>I know it's the one you would need in pay.gov

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.410
<v Moderator - Emily>so.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:35.050
<v P 09>Okay.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:36.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Not sure what the.

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.410
<v Moderator - Emily>What the full number is. Okay, so you would.

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:41.210
<v Moderator - Emily>You would copy that there. Anything else

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Moderator - Emily>that might make it easier for you in. In

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:48.230
<v Moderator - Emily>terms of getting that in that account information

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:51.670
<v Moderator - Emily>over to pay.gov I would say.

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.150
<v P 09>Can I go back real quick to Copace?

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:55.510
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:59.110
<v P 09>Oops. Over clicked it.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.470
<v P 09>I would say, like, because if I was ready

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:08.030
<v P 09>to. Unless I'm ready in review details, then

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:11.510
<v P 09>I would see it there. But if I was, you know,

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:13.950
<v P 09>like, if I just. If I didn't want to review

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.950
<v P 09>the details, already know it. Let's just

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:16.190
<v P 09>say.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.430
<v P 09>Let's put it this way. So I review the details,

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.510
<v P 09>because I do this all, like, all the time.

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:23.510
<v P 09>I would review the details and I know I have

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:27.230
<v P 09>like 25 days to pay it off. I'm like, okay,

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:29.350
<v P 09>well, I'll pay it off later. I don't know

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:30.190
<v P 09>why I do that.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:34.150
<v P 09>I'm just a procrastinator, I guess. But already

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.430
<v P 09>know the information. So I would go back

00:46:37.050 --> 00:46:39.490
<v P 09>maybe two weeks later and I want to pay the

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:42.330
<v P 09>bill already. Right. What I would do, usually,

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:44.090
<v P 09>since I already know, I would just pay the

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:44.410
<v P 09>bill.

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:47.930
<v P 09>It'd be nice to have that information there.

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.010
<v P 09>The. The account number.

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:52.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Oh, like right here?

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:57.370
<v P 09>Yeah. Because like I said, like, that's the

00:46:57.370 --> 00:47:00.650
<v P 09>type of thing that I would do is I would

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:02.610
<v P 09>review it and then, okay, it's good to go.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.770
<v P 09>I'll pay it later. I don't know why did I

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:07.400
<v P 09>just do it? Um, but, you know, it's one of

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.560
<v P 09>those situations where I go back to VA app.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.080
<v P 09>You know, if I was to use the app and then

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.800
<v P 09>I would just click on pay bill because I

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.040
<v P 09>already know what the bill is.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:18.960
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay.

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.760
<v P 09>And then I would just follow this prompt

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.760
<v P 09>and then now I would go to va pay.gov and

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.040
<v P 09>then now I have to click on where do I find

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.320
<v P 09>it? And then now go back to the app, get

00:47:28.320 --> 00:47:29.480
<v P 09>it, and then put it there.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.360
<v P 09>It'd be nice to have it right there. Ready,

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:31.720
<v P 09>you know?

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.780
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay, got it. And then.

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.500
<v Moderator - Emily>So knowing having this experience where at

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.820
<v Moderator - Emily>least it is possible to pay, even though

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:44.060
<v Moderator - Emily>I know it's switching applications, what

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:46.740
<v Moderator - Emily>would be the likelihood you would use this

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.940
<v Moderator - Emily>version if it were built in real life?

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.980
<v P 09>I would rather use this version because it'll,

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.340
<v P 09>you know, I avoid, like, calling and being

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:59.930
<v P 09>on hold or anything like that. I could just

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:03.490
<v P 09>pay it off online, easy. Like I said, the

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.850
<v P 09>only reason why I paid it through phones,

00:48:05.850 --> 00:48:08.250
<v P 09>because it was right there, and it told me,

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:11.730
<v P 09>like, to call or mail or something like that.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.970
<v P 09>So I was like, all right, let me just call

00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:13.210
<v P 09>this.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:14.330
<v P 09>Take care of it. But.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it, got it. Okay. I think those

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:18.730
<v Moderator - Emily>are all my questions.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:23.130
<v Moderator - Emily>Anything else that you haven't already shared

00:48:23.610 --> 00:48:26.010
<v Moderator - Emily>in regards to, let's say, any of the labeling

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.820
<v Moderator - Emily>of the section or just any of the other experiences

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:30.340
<v Moderator - Emily>regarding the co pays here?

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.020
<v P 09>No, I would say, like, those are the. The

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:39.140
<v P 09>concerns that I. That I, you know, that I

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:41.860
<v P 09>have. Especially the. The pay bill.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:43.660
<v P 09>That's probably like, one of the. The bigger

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:47.740
<v P 09>ones that I. That I want to mention is to

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.460
<v P 09>have the account number somewhere ready.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:50.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. Okay.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.540
<v P 09>Yeah, that's like one of the big ones.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.150
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, Makes sense. All right. And I'm

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:58.670
<v Moderator - Emily>just gonna check in with my colleagues. If

00:48:58.670 --> 00:49:01.470
<v Moderator - Emily>anybody else has any quick questions, feel

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.990
<v Moderator - Emily>free to unmute now and ask them.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.870
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. I'll take that as a no. And we are

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.870
<v Moderator - Emily>a minute over time, and I do apologize. But

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.230
<v Moderator - Emily>thank you so much for taking the time to

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:18.630
<v Moderator - Emily>go over this with us. It's super important

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:21.750
<v Moderator - Emily>for us to actually talk with veterans and

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.280
<v Moderator - Emily>see how you are experiencing the various

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.280
<v Moderator - Emily>things that we are looking to build.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.960
<v Moderator - Emily>So thank you for taking the time with us

00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:30.320
<v Moderator - Emily>today.

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:34.440
<v P 09>Thank you for. For doing this. It would make

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.560
<v P 09>it easier for, you know, for us working on

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:39.680
<v P 09>calling.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.360
<v Moderator - Emily>Yes, exactly.
