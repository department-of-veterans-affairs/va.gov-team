Emily  
Ask you yet again. So now that we are recording, are you okay? If I record video and audio today.

2  
0:00:09  
P9  
That's fine!

3  
0:00:10  
Emily  
Alright great. And are you okay? If we potentially use a clip the clips of this to show our Va partners.

4  
0:00:18  
P9  
That's fine!

5  
0:00:19  
Emily  
Alright great. Okay. So just general questions. Love to know a bit about yourself, and whatever you are, comfortable, sharing as a veteran what branch you served in, if you, when you retired or separated.

6  
0:00:35  
P9  
Yeah, I actually I served in the [redacted] from 2,006, 2,010. And then after that, I decided to separate and go to college instead. And then, after I worked for the [redacted] as I started there. Well, I've had different positions prior to that, like from a

7  
0:00:58  
P9  
out like private sector. But pretty much like in the software, tech tech side of things. Just put it that way.

8  
0:01:06  
Emily  
Okay. Good.

9  
0:01:06  
P9  
So it's working like a [redacted]

10  
0:01:12  
P9  
But yeah.

11  
0:01:13  
Emily  
Okay, great. And then what sort of experience have you had? With Va.

12  
0:01:21  
P9  
So I had, like I had

13  
0:01:23  
P9  
couple of surgeries from the Va. And yeah, I've I've used

14  
0:01:30  
P9  
Yep, prescription medications. Psychiatrists, I believe.

15  
0:01:38  
P9  
They? Oh, no, for Va they they sourced it out. It's not a it's not a Va's

16  
0:01:45  
P9  
psychiatrists. It's a they

17  
0:01:47  
P9  
sourced it out so like outside, I think, is what they did. And then they just they just paid for it. And then, yeah, so like, I, I use va like here and there when I can.

18  
0:01:57  
P9  
1st like, for things that are not like very, very urgent that I need like tomorrow, you know, like urgent care if I would just go to like my my doctor for those kind of things, but otherwise, like I try to use it, since it's free.

19  
0:02:12  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. Got it? And then, what sort of experience have you had with the Va website? And or the mobile app.

20  
0:02:21  
P9  
I used to use just the website, because I didn't like clogging my phone with like apps and stuff like that. So that's why, like, I didn't have fig figma on my phone. That's why I was using my ipad earlier, because where I had my

21  
0:02:34  
P9  
figma, but but lately, probably in the past year or so, because I've done a number of

22  
0:02:42  
P9  
meetings with with prison technologies. And then I use the Va app to you know, to do some testing, so I figured like I might as well just keep it there. So whenever I and then since then I use it for let's say I wanna request for refill for

23  
0:03:00  
P9  
medication or I believe I did set up an appointment through there one time. But I'm just so used to like doing it in the website that sometimes I'm most of the time on my computer, anyway. So I just, I would just go to like Va

24  
0:03:14  
P9  
back over. I forgot the website exactly. It's in my bookmark. I just do it through there. But otherwise, I just kept the app in my on my phone for like quick things. So if I'm not around my my computer, I just use the app.

25  
0:03:27  
Emily  
Okay. Alright. So if you're if you're not close to your computer and any other reasons you might choose to use the app over your computer.

26  
0:03:36  
P9  
just for mobility, I guess. Yeah, if I'm just not around there, because, like, if I'm on my workstation, I'm also I'm over there like, you know, I don't usually like when I work. I don't.

27  
0:03:47  
P9  
I have my phone like

28  
0:03:49  
P9  
away so that I don't get distracted. So that's why like I use my my, yeah, my workstation like you know, for everything else.

29  
0:03:59  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, great, all right. So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion. So I want to make sure that you're only sharing what you're willing. I have no additional info, or I have no information whatsoever about any sort of finances for you. So any, let's know any experience. Have you had experience with owing the Va. Money such as for benefit overpayments.

30  
0:04:25  
P9  
There is

31  
0:04:27  
P9  
a co-pay couple of years ago, and there's 1, i believe, last year. Think last year, not too long ago, say that

32  
0:04:35  
P9  
there was a copay, but I end it ended up getting I believe they're getting

33  
0:04:41  
P9  
nulled, or yeah, I ended up not paying for it. I talked to him about it. I forgot where it was. But I had like a physical mail in letter, for it.

34  
0:04:51  
Emily  
Oh, God, okay. So it was. It was for this Copay.

35  
0:04:54  
P9  
Ye, yeah. And then I called the Va. About it. I I did it through the phone, and then it was I believe it was for my heel, because I did my

36  
0:05:03  
P9  
my Achilles. And then, since they they tore my Achilles and not like completely. But it was like almost completely ruptured. But

37  
0:05:12  
P9  
They.

38  
0:05:14  
P9  
since they couldn't get the appointment, for in the next 30 days I they had to go outside. I believe it was for that.

39  
0:05:22  
P9  
And then I called the Va. About it. Because they got the letter. And they told them, Yeah, it's supposed to be like for free.

40  
0:05:30  
Emily  
Oh, God, okay, alright! So outside of that, it sounds like you. You have not received Copays or or have there other vendors.

41  
0:05:36  
P9  
Have

42  
0:05:38  
P9  
a while ago from one of my prescription, but had since stopped taking my my prescription, for, like antidepressant anti-anxiety. It's kinda like, you know.

43  
0:05:49  
P9  
didn't want to take any of that anymore. So like, that's that's where I receive A click.

44  
0:05:56  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

45  
0:05:57  
Emily  
And is that you said you had received a letter any other way, that you were given information about these past copays.

46  
0:06:07  
P9  
No, it was just a letter that I saw. It was a mail in letter, and there was one more letter asking me. I don't know if this is

47  
0:06:16  
P9  
in relate in relation to my vam

48  
0:06:20  
P9  
what it could benefits. But it's asking me if I use the Va. I believe it was last March.

49  
0:06:27  
P9  
because there's like a bill. I was like, I use my doctor for that, so I don't know how I re. I remember the date, but I got a Va. Letter saying that

50  
0:06:37  
P9  
this is not a bill, but you know it's like a charge.

51  
0:06:40  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

52  
0:06:40  
P9  
Saying that

53  
0:06:42  
P9  
you know, if you use the Va. I was like, no, I use my regular doctor, so I don't know how we'd go through. Va, so I was kind of confused. But yeah, get it.

54  
0:06:52  
Emily  
Okay, and it sounds.

55  
0:06:54  
P9  
It says it's not a bill, but it was like a a bill. It it's not billed to me, but it's just like there's a charge, so I don't.

56  
0:07:01  
Emily  
Okay. Yeah.

57  
0:07:02  
P9  
Confusing.

58  
0:07:03  
Emily  
Yep, that makes sense. I'd be confused, too, as well.

59  
0:07:06  
Emily  
Okay. So it's it sounds like and correct me if I'm wrong that you haven't actually paid any of these co-pays that were sent to you. They were like they were all in error. Is that right?

60  
0:07:18  
P9  
It was, I paid the the copay for the medication that I used to take.

61  
0:07:21  
Emily  
Got it? Okay.

62  
0:07:23  
Emily  
all right. And do you so for that medication, Copay, what? How? How did you know when you needed to make a payment, and what was what was prompting you to make those payments.

63  
0:07:34  
P9  
I got a fiscal letter.

64  
0:07:36  
Emily  
Okay.

65  
0:07:38  
P9  
Through the mail.

66  
0:07:40  
Emily  
Okay, and outside the the one confusion that you certainly mentioned. Anything else, that might be made easier in regards to these copay notifications.

67  
0:07:55  
P9  
I would say an email would be easier. Because

68  
0:08:00  
P9  
like, I said, I didn't start using the app up until like last year, because I was kept on re downloading it to do these these appointments. So I figured just

69  
0:08:09  
P9  
I just you know, download it. I know there's like notifications on there. But like I have all notifications turned off on my phone like I said, like, I know, you have my phone when I work. So like, I'm not gonna get that. So like, usually, I get a lot of my, I prefer like email notification, because you have like a set time to check my emails. And then I go through. Then I see my emails. But as far, no notifications to have.

70  
0:08:34  
P9  
even if I have the Va app right now, all of my notification on my phone. They're just all turned off because they get like distracted so easy. Nothing will. Yeah, not even like a a text message is like, off also. So like, yeah. So I would say, email would be good. But physical mail is also works. But

71  
0:08:56  
P9  
you know, I don't know, like, sometimes, like fiscal mail could be lost. So I could. Yeah.

72  
0:09:04  
P9  
But yeah, I've never got an email bill from the Va. Not that I.

73  
0:09:09  
Emily  
Got it, and then what has been your method for paying these these pre previous co-pays?

74  
0:09:16  
P9  
So usually when I see, like, you know, the Physical Mail, it says, like, go to website a call, I'll just call them. Since I already have it right there.

75  
0:09:25  
Emily  
Yeah, okay, alright, and let me go. Have you go ahead and share your screen?

76  
0:09:33  
P9  
Okay, on my phone. Let me see.

77  
0:09:35  
Emily  
Okay.

78  
0:09:39  
P9  
Okay.

79  
0:09:43  
P9  
Scott. Rocket.

80  
0:09:49  
Emily  
Alright! There we go, perfect and let me have you open up the figma app, and I'm gonna give you a a login to use.

81  
0:09:59  
Emily  
Okay, go ahead and log in.

82  
0:10:08  
Emily  
Okay, so the email that you'll use is [redacted]

83  
0:10:24  
Emily  
And the password is gonna be [redacted]

84  
0:10:36  
Emily  
okay? And then I'm gonna get you an authentication code. Give me just a moment.

85  
0:10:44  
Emily  
There we go. Okay, so the code will be 4, 9, 5, 1 0 0 8.

86  
0:10:54  
Emily  
Okay, go ahead and log in.

87  
0:11:00  
Emily  
Okay, continue with the app. And I'm gonna get you a link in just a moment.

88  
0:11:06  
Emily  
Alright, so no need no click on anything quite yet. Let me

89  
0:11:11  
Emily  
I'm gonna send you the link through zoom. So you should see in your zoom chat the link.

90  
0:11:28  
P9  
Do I stop sharing first.st

91  
0:11:30  
Emily  
So just tap in the middle, and at the bottom you should see. Yeah.

92  
0:11:34  
P9  
Oh, I see. Okay.

93  
0:11:35  
Emily  
Yep, there we go so tap in the extra long link there, and if you wanna swipe my image off to the right, then you don't need to

94  
0:11:43  
Emily  
see me. There we go. All right. Give it just a moment

95  
0:12:03  
Emily  
hopefully. This works. Sometimes it's a little on the slower side.

96  
0:12:10  
Emily  
Alright. This seems promising.

97  
0:12:14  
Emily  
Alright. So here we have your pretend app home screen. Here. You can tap outside just anywhere outside of the the little help. There we go perfect. So without I'm not going to have you tap anything quite yet, but from looking around here you can scroll as much as you want. Where would you expect to find these copays that you might owe in this if you were on the app.

98  
0:12:40  
P9  
Payments.

99  
0:12:41  
Emily  
Okay?

100  
0:12:43  
Emily  
Great. And yeah, thoughts on in this. In this scenario, we're going to pretend that you also have overpayment. That's in addition to copays. But thought actually, well, 1st you clearly went straight to payments thoughts on the title of that. Would anything be more clear.

101  
0:13:05  
P9  
No, it literally just says co-pays right there. So it's it's pretty straightforward, you know, unless you don't know what that means.

102  
0:13:15  
P9  
yeah, and overpayment and debts like that's pretty much, you know, outstanding due or same thing. Overpayment debts.

103  
0:13:24  
P9  
it's kind of is that a for overpayment desk.

104  
0:13:31  
P9  
Does that mean like the Va. Overpaid you, and you have to pay them back.

105  
0:13:35  
Emily  
That was exactly what I mean. Yes, yep.

106  
0:13:37  
P9  
Okay, okay, just making sure.

107  
0:13:39  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah. And how about? Okay? So it looks like the things are pretty clear here on this page. How about the specifically the word payments on the bottom right where you would originally tapped. I know you went straight there to find.

108  
0:13:57  
P9  
Yeah.

109  
0:13:58  
Emily  
Yeah, any thoughts on. If that could be even even more clear in terms of where you would find the co-pays.

110  
0:14:05  
P9  
No, actually, that was that was very clear. That's without even like, you know. As soon as you I logged in here

111  
0:14:14  
P9  
when you asked me like, Where would you find your your copays like? That's the 1st thing that came to my mind, like the under payments, because, you know. That's that's where I would expect it to be. That's a that's a very, very clear right there.

112  
0:14:27  
Emily  
Great, all right.

113  
0:14:29  
Emily  
And then thoughts on what information you want might want to see. So like right now, there's a bit of info under both overpayment debts and copays

114  
0:14:40  
Emily  
any thoughts on what would be important to see as a really high level. When you open up this page.

115  
0:14:49  
P9  
Let me see here

116  
0:14:54  
P9  
history, direct deposit.

117  
0:15:04  
P9  
I would maybe not necessary. But

118  
0:15:09  
P9  
your va debt and bills. No, no, actually, that's that's that's right, because you're the one paying I was. I was thinking something else.

119  
0:15:17  
Emily  
Okay.

120  
0:15:18  
P9  
No, I was, I would say, that's that's that's fine right there, because it clearly says, like what you need to pay at the bottom right there, the bottom 2.

121  
0:15:27  
P9  
I was thinking like I was looking for like something that

122  
0:15:34  
P9  
What's that?

123  
0:15:37  
P9  
If I click on one of these like it'll show me the okay, the what they're for.

124  
0:15:49  
P9  
Okay. Now that

125  
0:15:50  
P9  
that looks that looks good because, like these 2 are bundled together, the overpayment it does because those are the. Those are the things that you need to pay, and it it separates the the co-pays with your actual overpayment. That Va

126  
0:16:04  
P9  
that you know that that paid you.

127  
0:16:08  
P9  
Question for these like for over payments? When would be like A, How would that

128  
0:16:17  
P9  
work with a BA Va like they overpaid you.

129  
0:16:21  
Emily  
Yeah.

130  
0:16:22  
P9  
Is your doctor, or.

131  
0:16:24  
Emily  
No, it's not good. I don't. I haven't heard that example. For what example I've heard is if you were signed up for some classes, and then for some reason, had to drop a class, but had already already received the money to take that class. That would be.

132  
0:16:39  
P9  
Okay.

133  
0:16:40  
Emily  
That would be an example of an overpayment.

134  
0:16:43  
P9  
Gotcha. Okay, okay? Got it? No, I think this this this looks good because you have the the co-pays and then and the overpayments separated. So like, you know, exactly like where to go. And if you want to prioritize one or the other, you know.

135  
0:16:58  
Emily  
Okay, great. So for the the co-pays, let me have you tap into that and see about the information presented. And just what you feel would be important for you to know, for the co-pays here.

136  
0:17:17  
P9  
So this one says you have submitted.

137  
0:17:25  
P9  
So for the middle 1, $200, I noticed that

138  
0:17:33  
P9  
these 2, the top and the bottom. It says like

139  
0:17:37  
P9  
when you paid it, and when when it's due.

140  
0:17:42  
P9  
Just wondering why the middle one doesn't say that.

141  
0:17:45  
Emily  
Okay, so is that I'll take from that that you you'd want to know more information on. Why, it says to call instead of.

142  
0:17:53  
P9  
Yeah.

143  
0:17:54  
Emily  
Okay, got it any other?

144  
0:17:58  
Emily  
Because if if I was like, you know, if I had like a.

145  
0:18:01  
P9  
One thing that I would prioritize if if it was me was to have to see exactly when I need to pay it by, you know, like, let's just say like

146  
0:18:11  
P9  
like, I'm 1 of those people like.

147  
0:18:13  
P9  
oh, I have time. I like kind of like procrastinate, even though like debate right now. But I still wanna see, like, you know.

148  
0:18:21  
P9  
right away when when it's gonna be due. So that

149  
0:18:25  
P9  
yeah. So that's 1 of those things.

150  
0:18:28  
P9  
And yeah, for this one. For example.

151  
0:18:31  
P9  
the very bottom says payment submitted.

152  
0:18:35  
P9  
Oh, that's a 0.

153  
0:18:36  
P9  
Okay, so that one's already done right, so there's no balance. So I would say, this one is not necessary then, if it's already

154  
0:18:46  
P9  
paid off it, it should be under like payment history, or something like that which I believe I saw on the previous page.

155  
0:18:52  
Emily  
So you you wouldn't even want to see it right here.

156  
0:18:55  
P9  
No, because like when I click on these, because I would think that when I click on on the the payments,

157  
0:19:04  
P9  
the copays, I would think that these are the ones that are outstanding, not the ones that are, you know... because, like over here. If I go back.

158  
0:19:14  
P9  
I got VA payment history. That's that's where I would think that would go.

159  
0:19:18  
Emily  
Okay, got it. Okay.

160  
0:19:19  
P9  
Yeah.

161  
0:19:20  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. So back into Copays perfect. So looking at that top one, the James A. Haley veteran hospital. What information would you need to know for this one here.

162  
0:19:35  
P9  
So this one is actually perfect right here, like as it is. And then you could review the details because it tells you exactly what you

163  
0:19:41  
P9  
what you need to pay, how much you need to pay. And well, it tells you how much you need to pay, and then, when you need to pay it by. Those are the 2 important

164  
0:19:52  
P9  
or 2 important details right away that I want to see if if it was, you know, if I was looking at something, and then I could go and review details and what it's for, you know.

165  
0:20:01  
Emily  
Okay.

166  
0:20:02  
Emily  
Yeah. Oh, yeah. If you want to go.

167  
0:20:04  
P9  
Right away. What what I want to see is these 2 go ahead.

168  
0:20:09  
Emily  
Yeah, so is that.

169  
0:20:10  
P9  
And then.

170  
0:20:10  
Emily  
Not on this. Hmm.

171  
0:20:12  
P9  
This page. Let me just take a look at it.

172  
0:20:17  
P9  
Script balance 50.

173  
0:20:25  
P9  
Yeah. So this one has a breakdown of everything.

174  
0:20:29  
P9  
But what is this at the bottom?

175  
0:20:38  
P9  
Okay, so this tells me, since it's $50, I have to pay the 1, 2, 3

176  
0:20:47  
P9  
for the 1st 4 is pretty much the breakdown of the $50.

177  
0:20:51  
Emily  
But.

178  
0:20:53  
P9  
This the ones that you've paid already.

179  
0:21:01  
P9  
Okay, so what I'm getting out of this is

180  
0:21:05  
P9  
This is for for pretty much like one let's just say

181  
0:21:15  
P9  
what's the word I'm looking for

182  
0:21:18  
P9  
service. Let's just say like for let's just say this is for your knee, right like, because I have a lot of knee issues for Va, this for my right knee. Let's just put it that way. So these are all the these are all the the co-pays and

183  
0:21:32  
P9  
and past past payments for my right knee.

184  
0:21:36  
P9  
That's just, you know, kind of like you saying it's an example, because I see, like a payment of $45 right here.

185  
0:21:42  
Emily  
Oh, okay, so, so grouped, this is, this is.

186  
0:21:44  
P9  
Their group. Yeah, they're they're group into, like, you know, 1 1, i guess, like medical issue.

187  
0:21:50  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

188  
0:21:51  
P9  
Okay.

189  
0:21:52  
Emily  
What are there?

190  
0:21:53  
Emily  
It's. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

191  
0:21:57  
P9  
I would say over here, I would. I would just put the

192  
0:22:07  
P9  
what I owed for now like, let's say like, because when I click, click on that bill

193  
0:22:13  
P9  
and let me just go back real quick.

194  
0:22:15  
P9  
So when I click on this bill, $50,

195  
0:22:18  
P9  
I would say, separate these actual balances from the payments already received.

196  
0:22:26  
P9  
So that it's clear that's exactly my balance, you know.

197  
0:22:31  
P9  
And then the payment received could be like, yeah, because, like, they're kind of grouped into one. If you look at it.

198  
0:22:37  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

199  
0:22:39  
Emily  
Or early, think, yeah, go ahead.

200  
0:22:43  
P9  
Or just have, like all my

201  
0:22:46  
P9  
the the breakdown of the $50. And then, if you really want to see, like your past payments. You could go to like your statements, or.

202  
0:22:55  
P9  
yeah, so like you could see like your past payments on there. Because

203  
0:22:59  
P9  
If I was looking at it. I just want to see right now, like what the breakdown of the $50 is like.

204  
0:23:06  
P9  
you know, like, if I wanted to see something else like past payments. I could just go like the statements or the the

205  
0:23:11  
P9  
payment history on the 1st page.

206  
0:23:14  
Emily  
Oh, okay, so so it's it's not really clear. Now, just what exactly the the $50 is is from.

207  
0:23:21  
P9  
Yeah. So that's what I'm that's what I'm most concerned about. If I owed $50, to look at what it's for.

208  
0:23:30  
P9  
You know, these 1, 2, 3, 4, right here and then these right here could be a different one. Because when I was looking at when I was scrolling down the

209  
0:23:38  
P9  
what I noticed like I was counting

210  
0:23:41  
P9  
the the amount, the $20 to $5,

211  
0:23:45  
P9  
$5, and the other $20 right here. And then I started seeing the negative 45, and it starts seeing the $5. You know, it's kind of like I understood it like looking at it. But looking at just

212  
0:23:56  
P9  
maybe like other people's, you know, they

213  
0:23:59  
P9  
might cause confusion. But I mean, that's I. I understand, like what it's what it's doing.

214  
0:24:06  
P9  
But it'd be nice to just have that breakdown of the $50 over there.

215  
0:24:11  
Emily  
Okay, good and we're gonna pretend that

216  
0:24:17  
Emily  
that. You you see an error here you like something is listed where you're very sure you, let's say, didn't attend that appointment or something. What would what? What would you do in that in that sense, or in that instance?

217  
0:24:31  
P9  
Okay. So let's say, outpatient care for optometry.

218  
0:24:38  
P9  
Yeah. So let's say, like, if I didn't attend this one, I would.

219  
0:24:43  
P9  
I can click on it.

220  
0:24:46  
P9  
I would. I would try to

221  
0:24:48  
P9  
Yeah, we try to tap on it and see, like, you know, if there's any more information.

222  
0:24:52  
Emily  
Oh, God!

223  
0:24:53  
P9  
If you know. Maybe like provider contact info kind of like to confirm with the provider the office of sales provider

224  
0:25:04  
P9  
that I didn't go that outpatient care for optometry that day, you know, or at least like some somewhere to con contact. Va.

225  
0:25:13  
P9  
yeah, because I can click on anything right now. Maybe it's not done yet.

226  
0:25:17  
Emily  
Yeah. Try scrolling up. I think there's 1 that might be active. Let me see. It's the the the top. Yeah. Would this? Would this at all be helpful to you?

227  
0:25:30  
Emily  
Yeah, it would be helpful, because there's a billing reference right there. It would be nice to.

228  
0:25:35  
P9  
To have like contact information. Because, like, if I was, if I was to look at that, hey? I didn't do this. I wanna be able to like contact whoever I need to right away, instead of like trying to dig in or call the Va like

229  
0:25:48  
P9  
Va general number, which I would get bounced around, you know.

230  
0:25:53  
Emily  
Okay? And so where would you expect to? Since you mentioned calling someone? Where? Where do you believe you would go to look for a number to call.

231  
0:26:04  
P9  
I would try to click on help first.st If I was me like the 1st thing I would do is pop right.

232  
0:26:09  
Emily  
Okay.

233  
0:26:10  
P9  
And see you know what I can find out of there.

234  
0:26:13  
P9  
If not, let me look at the the previous page.

235  
0:26:17  
P9  
Page. If there's any any contact information at all, anywhere.

236  
0:26:24  
Emily  
Was as I.

237  
0:26:25  
P9  
How would?

238  
0:26:26  
Emily  
Yeah. Go ahead.

239  
0:26:29  
P9  
Go ahead. Sorry.

240  
0:26:30  
Emily  
Oh, I was gonna say, since since you mentioned the the help button, if you wanna tap on that here.

241  
0:26:41  
P9  
Okay. So

242  
0:26:43  
P9  
So let's say, let's go back to that 1st one.

243  
0:26:47  
P9  
I don't know if the help is gonna change.

244  
0:26:50  
Emily  
I forget if the help is connected.

245  
0:26:52  
P9  
It is.

246  
0:26:52  
Emily  
It might not be. Oh, it is. Yeah, alright.

247  
0:26:55  
P9  
So it's it's it's a if you have questions about your copay bills. Okay? So

248  
0:27:01  
P9  
you have a. You have the number

249  
0:27:04  
P9  
on here about the copay bill. So yeah, that's that's the 1st thing I would do. So you you guys have that there already. But is this like the just the general number for the Va. Or is this like the number for

250  
0:27:20  
P9  
in regards to this bill.

251  
0:27:22  
Emily  
So what what would I mean as

252  
0:27:24  
Emily  
around? What? What would? What would make it more clear as to what the number actually is that you're seeing.

253  
0:27:34  
P9  
Health resource center.

254  
0:27:40  
P9  
What is this for outpatient care? Family medicine?

255  
0:27:47  
P9  
So this tells me it's more of a general number. But I mean that that would.

256  
0:27:54  
P9  
It would be fine as long as it relates to

257  
0:27:59  
P9  
the actual Va va services that I that I receive rather than just a general Va. Number is that, does that make sense or.

258  
0:28:09  
Emily  
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yes. You do want a more, a more focused number.

259  
0:28:12  
P9  
Yeah, because, like, I've I've had that happen to me before I leave those 2 years ago where

260  
0:28:19  
P9  
I saw a number. It was I was using my my computer, and I saw a number. And I called that number, and they put me on hold to transfer me. And then another transfer. After that.

261  
0:28:32  
Emily  
Got it.

262  
0:28:32  
P9  
So if if this number is actually like, it doesn't have to be the the providers. Actual number, you know, but someone that could help you right away rather than like putting me on hold for them to find out which one it is. And then.

263  
0:28:45  
P9  
you know, yeah. So more like, I guess, like

264  
0:28:49  
P9  
someone that could help me, but not like the the very 1st number that the Va. Would would give you like.

265  
0:28:56  
Emily  
Yeah, okay? And then, you know a similar question. We're gonna pretend that you don't believe you have the money right now to make this payment. What would what might you do in that situation?

266  
0:29:10  
P9  
I would call

267  
0:29:12  
P9  
the the outpatient or not the outpatient. This number right here, and then see if they have, like, some type of like

268  
0:29:20  
P9  
payment plan, or anything like that.

269  
0:29:24  
P9  
Or what would be even more helpful, because, you know, sometimes, like people would rather avoid

270  
0:29:32  
P9  
you know, social interaction when when they're setting up payments. I would, I would think, if they have like, you know, some type of link right here to do like a payment plan.

271  
0:29:44  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

272  
0:29:46  
Emily  
Where? Where?

273  
0:29:47  
P9  
You said, you know.

274  
0:29:48  
P9  
Oh, where would I?

275  
0:29:50  
P9  
Where would that?

276  
0:29:51  
P9  
Yeah, exactly.

277  
0:29:55  
P9  
So are we talking about? Just just for this

278  
0:30:01  
P9  
for each of them, or just for all of these.

279  
0:30:05  
Emily  
Let's say, for like for like for that, that $50 payment since you mentioned a a repayment plan, where would you hope or believe to find any information regarding a potential repayment plan.

280  
0:30:21  
P9  
I would say.

281  
0:30:24  
P9  
just under payments. Hold on! Let me go back to the payments here, and then over here

282  
0:30:33  
P9  
and pay bill.

283  
0:30:39  
P9  
Is this so when you try to pay a bill, does it go?

284  
0:30:44  
P9  
It doesn't do through the app.

285  
0:30:47  
Emily  
Right.

286  
0:30:49  
P9  
Gotcha. Okay?

287  
0:30:52  
P9  
Yeah. Like, I said, like, when I've done it before. It was by phone when I received the letter. So I've not actually never paid in the app. I don't believe so. That makes sense.

288  
0:31:01  
P9  
So I would say, that's what I would do what I just did right now on the pay bill and see like if there's like a payment plan that I could do.

289  
0:31:11  
Emily  
Got it. Okay. So you.

290  
0:31:12  
P9  
$50. Yeah.

291  
0:31:13  
Emily  
Perfect. Let me have you tap on close here.

292  
0:31:18  
P9  
It won't.

293  
0:31:20  
Emily  
It won't. That's never good.

294  
0:31:22  
P9  
Yeah, no, no. Actually, I'm trying to tap and.

295  
0:31:26  
Emily  
Try typing.

296  
0:31:26  
Emily  
And outside, I might just have to.

297  
0:31:29  
P9  
Yeah.

298  
0:31:30  
Emily  
Go back all right. Nothing is responding. If you're.

299  
0:31:35  
P9  
No.

300  
0:31:36  
Emily  
Okay.

301  
0:31:37  
P9  
Looks like zoom is working, though.

302  
0:31:39  
Emily  
I know one. Why don't you go back to zoom? And then re tap that link from yes, the chat

303  
0:31:48  
Emily  
when in doubt start over. That's my answer to everything. Oh, come on, come on, figma.

304  
0:31:54  
P9  
Let me let me quit Sigma, and then recap that.

305  
0:31:59  
Emily  
That was gonna be my next thing. You read my mind.

306  
0:32:06  
P9  
I wonder if this, if it just got stuck? Let me tap on that again just to

307  
0:32:11  
Emily  
Sometimes it. It just gets slow. Alright, so tap on payment. Tap on Copay.

308  
0:32:16  
Emily  
Yeah, there we go.

309  
0:32:20  
Emily  
So I'll have you swipe. My my.

310  
0:32:25  
P9  
All right.

311  
0:32:25  
Emily  
Getting out of the way.

312  
0:32:26  
P9  
Ouch!

313  
0:32:26  
Emily  
It just a little more space. Yeah.

314  
0:32:30  
P9  
Where did I go for that.

315  
0:32:32  
Emily  
So what?

316  
0:32:32  
P9  
Pay bill. I believe.

317  
0:32:33  
Emily  
I'm gonna have you do one thing first.st

318  
0:32:36  
Emily  
We'll get back to the to the pay bill, but tap on the the help and the help section we were at before.

319  
0:32:46  
Emily  
and if there's anything there that I know you said you would probably call, but if there's anything else that you might there for, or that you might find.

320  
0:32:52  
P9  
Oh!

321  
0:32:53  
Emily  
For repayment.

322  
0:32:56  
P9  
There's how to request debt relief. And if you can't pay future co-pays, that's that's the

323  
0:33:02  
P9  
That stuff.

324  
0:33:04  
P9  
1st thing I would click on the the second one right here or this one.

325  
0:33:09  
P9  
And also if you have questions about your copay bills is one of the ones that I would click on. But if you're wondering what the top one that I would pick if I wanted to. See if there's if there's a payment plan. I would say

326  
0:33:24  
P9  
this one, because, it not, it's not quite debt relief, but

327  
0:33:30  
P9  
I guess like it. It kind of like for me. It kind of sounds like it's more in the on the side of like, okay, like, what can I do to like get help to make payments and anything like that?

328  
0:33:41  
Emily  
Okay. Can you think of? Would there be anything that would make that even more clear? To to go there for any sort of debt, relief.

329  
0:33:52  
P9  
So I guess, like what we're talking about is to make payment plans right a debt. Relief is more like

330  
0:34:00  
P9  
trying to ask if there's a way for you to to waive your

331  
0:34:05  
P9  
your co-pays or your debt, so I guess, like

332  
0:34:10  
P9  
it would be more clear. Let's say like, if

333  
0:34:15  
P9  
if I go to like, if you have questions about your bills like, if it has like information about like this to to request for payment plan.

334  
0:34:23  
P9  
you know. Yeah, like deferred payments or anything like that.

335  
0:34:29  
P9  
I just thought about that that, really, because, like, I kind of bundled it into one where you know payment plan, and that really.

336  
0:34:36  
P9  
But I guess they're different. Because if you're asking for debt relief that means just kind of like wipe it out, or something, or wave it.

337  
0:34:43  
Emily  
Okay? So would could, could that be more clear here in terms of finding what's available.

338  
0:34:50  
P9  
Yeah, I would say, like, if you guys could either have it under this. If you have questions about your call.

339  
0:34:59  
P9  
pay bills have like A, you know. If you have questions about your bills or want to do

340  
0:35:06  
P9  
payment plan, it could be under here also. Or if you, wanna but another

341  
0:35:13  
P9  
drop down saying about like something about

342  
0:35:18  
P9  
payment plans. But you know you don't.

343  
0:35:21  
P9  
But at the same time you don't want this to be filled up with a lot of drop downs.

344  
0:35:26  
P9  
So

345  
0:35:27  
P9  
let's say like, if you want to keep it as is with 4 4 dropdowns, you could put it right here.

346  
0:35:35  
Emily  
Okay. Yeah.

347  
0:35:36  
P9  
Because, you know, that's more like, yeah, that's more like a question.

348  
0:35:39  
Emily  
Got it? Got it? Okay? And then

349  
0:35:41  
Emily  
How oral, were you aware that there are these options that you're seeing here of like requesting debt, relief, and and finding information on on a payment plan. Things like that.

350  
0:35:56  
P9  
No, I actually did not know anything about like a debt relief from Va. Because I figured.

351  
0:36:01  
P9  
you know, if you owe something you just kinda owe something. But then, you know, it's

352  
0:36:05  
P9  
it's different people's

353  
0:36:10  
P9  
You know, people people have like different situation in life so that they may need it.

354  
0:36:18  
Emily  
Okay, got it. I'll have you tap on close here.

355  
0:36:23  
Emily  
Okay, so

356  
0:36:26  
Emily  
Other things you would expect or or hope to be able to do from here.

357  
0:36:34  
P9  
Let me just look around real quick. See what else it has.

358  
0:36:44  
P9  
There's a statement

359  
0:36:53  
P9  
yeah. So like, just what I mentioned earlier about having the

360  
0:36:57  
P9  
co-pay separated with your previous payments, because

361  
0:37:02  
P9  
I just for for me like it just has nothing to do with with my co-pay.

362  
0:37:08  
P9  
Right now, what I'm worried about is what I need to pay, and when I need to pay it so.

363  
0:37:15  
P9  
I would just say, just keep these 4 right here.

364  
0:37:19  
P9  
And then I see the Pdf statement right there. Also. It's it's at the top and the bottom. So that's good.

365  
0:37:25  
Emily  
Okay.

366  
0:37:27  
P9  
So yeah, that's.

367  
0:37:29  
Emily  
Are, are Pdf. Statements something that you use now for anything.

368  
0:37:33  
P9  
Yeah. So let's just say, not for

369  
0:37:38  
P9  
like in particular from Va, but like, let's just say like banking information, right? I see. Like just the the rundown of what I have. But if I want to dig into it, then that's when I would use the Pdf statement. So

370  
0:37:51  
P9  
if if I if I have like my previous payments, that's where I was, that's where I would expect it, I believe.

371  
0:37:59  
P9  
And yeah, so that's that's what I would. That's what I would go if I really want to like, you know. Audit everything.

372  
0:38:07  
Emily  
What I paid and what I owed. Yeah.

373  
0:38:09  
Emily  
hmm, okay, and let me have you open up one of the statements here to see if just how how useful that might be here on the app.

374  
0:38:20  
Emily  
So pretend you've opened up this statement here.

375  
0:38:24  
Emily  
So is this something, I guess. How? How would you use the statements? And I said you would like audit things?

376  
0:38:33  
Emily  
Specifically, on.

377  
0:38:34  
P9  
Yeah.

378  
0:38:35  
Emily  
Phone. How might you use it?

379  
0:38:39  
P9  
So I would go directly to like the oh, actually this! Let me see here it might be. Let me just zoom it in.

380  
0:38:46  
Emily  
So if you tap once, that's yeah. If if you tap once.

381  
0:38:49  
P9  
Okay.

382  
0:38:50  
Emily  
A little fake zoom.

383  
0:38:51  
P9  
Got it.

384  
0:38:52  
Emily  
Prototype, limitation.

385  
0:38:54  
P9  
Okay, so it it says right here.

386  
0:38:57  
P9  
all of my my charges, which is pretty much the same thing as the the one in the front.

387  
0:39:03  
P9  
The not the front, the the previous page, and it doesn't have your previous statement of.

388  
0:39:14  
P9  
I would think that, you know, like,

389  
0:39:16  
P9  
I guess statement balances just for the month.

390  
0:39:19  
P9  
Hmm, okay, yeah. So if this is all you have for that statement, then that's what I would expect.

391  
0:39:26  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? And then would you be doing anything beyond viewing the statements on the phone?

392  
0:39:38  
P9  
No like in the in the app.

393  
0:39:41  
P9  
I would just look at the what I would usually do when I've when I've done this on a, you know, like for banking information. I would look at the whatever

394  
0:39:50  
P9  
the charges for the month, and what I need to pay, and see if they add up, I really wanna audit it. But this in this particular situation, you only have these 4. So.

395  
0:40:02  
Emily  
Okay. Got it? Alright. Let me have you tap on done there, please.

396  
0:40:07  
P9  
So we're pretending that if if this is built in real life, if the if the app had this section in real life here, like you're seeing.

397  
0:40:17  
Emily  
How likely do you think it would be that you might use it.

398  
0:40:23  
P9  
The the Pdf. Statements.

399  
0:40:26  
Emily  
Really this, this whole thing that would that we've looked at. So, viewing this, viewing the information, looking at the Pdf, seeing when things are due.

400  
0:40:35  
P9  
I would use it if

401  
0:40:39  
P9  
you know, if it's actually, if it's usable right now, I I would. I would say it's it's usable as it is. I understand it.

402  
0:40:46  
P9  
And if let's say because the Pdf is A

403  
0:40:52  
P9  
is very minimal, I would say that

404  
0:40:56  
P9  
it may not really be needed

405  
0:40:59  
P9  
for me, like, let's say, like, if I'm just looking at the

406  
0:41:02  
P9  
statements, because, like for for va statements, S.

407  
0:41:07  
P9  
Got it for me, at least like for me. It would be very rare to have like

408  
0:41:13  
P9  
a lot of a lot of information there on the on the Pdf. Statements so like.

409  
0:41:20  
P9  
I will just have them in a page

410  
0:41:22  
P9  
and then make this make it still available via Pdf statement. But like I would just have everything in the pages like this, but separate

411  
0:41:31  
P9  
your your what you need to pay with these. I would use this if

412  
0:41:37  
P9  
you know, if I just need to. I need to look at it and pay it on the app rather than

413  
0:41:43  
P9  
calling the phone. It'd be much easier if I could just pay in the app, too.

414  
0:41:47  
Emily  
Okay? Good. Yeah. So since you specifically mentioned paying in the app. And right now, this version is not would that. Would that be still be something that that you would use, knowing that there wasn't the option to pay right here.

415  
0:42:02  
P9  
Actually, I would rather use that than to call, because the reason why I paid over the phone before when I got the physical mails is like to call this number.

416  
0:42:10  
Emily  
Hmm.

417  
0:42:11  
P9  
So.

418  
0:42:12  
Emily  
Yep. Okay.

419  
0:42:13  
P9  
That's that's what it's in front of me.

420  
0:42:15  
Emily  
Yes, got it all right. Let me have you tap on the payments in the lower right? I'm gonna get you to another version, and we're gonna quickly go with that and so scroll all the way to the bottom

421  
0:42:27  
Emily  
and tap on the blank gray area toward the bottom. There, yeah, there we go, perfect. And now tap on Copays.

422  
0:42:35  
Emily  
Okay? So again, we're going to go through again. That top one, the James A. Haley hospital

423  
0:42:42  
Emily  
walk me through. We'll pretend that you are ready to pay. Walk me through. How you would do that. Here.

424  
0:42:52  
P9  
Yes, so let's just say I already reviewed it. I'm ready to pay.

425  
0:42:56  
P9  
I'll just click on pay bills, and if there's a hey? You know I'm

426  
0:43:05  
P9  
I would pay in pay.gov.

427  
0:43:07  
P9  
since there's you know, it'll take you to a website, anyway, instead of paying by phone or by mail definitely not pay by mail. I wouldn't even do that.

428  
0:43:18  
P9  
Yeah, I would just pay and pay.gov.

429  
0:43:21  
Emily  
Oh, there you go! You could click this time around.

430  
0:43:24  
P9  
And then.

431  
0:43:25  
Emily  
Go ahead and do that.

432  
0:43:27  
Emily  
I won't. I won't have you enter anything in, I promise.

433  
0:43:35  
Emily  
And I'm gonna I'm gonna skip most that. But scroll down a little bit. I'm gonna have you go to continue to the form the blue one there.

434  
0:43:45  
Emily  
Okay, and then scroll down a little more. We're just going to get you to the one specific area. So the the account number thoughts on

435  
0:43:55  
Emily  
finding the information you would need in order to make the payment, and where, where.

436  
0:44:00  
P9  
Ah yes

437  
0:44:01  
Emily  
Active fines, I would say.

438  
0:44:03  
P9  
I would click on "where do I find my VA account number?" Because I don't know that off top of my head. Or, if I do have it any of my paper mail.

439  
0:44:14  
P9  
mail.

440  
0:44:15  
Emily  
Okay. Okay.

441  
0:44:17  
P9  
yeah. But usually, if I'm already here, I would just click on that. How? Where do I find the account? Number.

442  
0:44:24  
Emily  
Yeah, okay, and let me have you switch back to the figma app.

443  
0:44:29  
Emily  
See? If it wants to cooperate.

444  
0:44:35  
Emily  
Okay? And click on, go back and then close

445  
0:44:41  
Emily  
and let me have you go into review details there?

446  
0:44:48  
Emily  
Oh, sorry of the yes, there we go.

447  
0:44:53  
Emily  
Thoughts on. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

448  
0:44:56  
P9  
There's pay bill right here.

449  
0:44:58  
Emily  
Okay.

450  
0:45:00  
P9  
Okay, so same thing. Yeah, I would. I would pay and pay that golf.

451  
0:45:04  
Emily  
Okay, how about getting that? I know you said you would you would look up where to find the account number.

452  
0:45:12  
P9  
Yeah, it's a i see it there, and I would just copy it.

453  
0:45:16  
Emily  
Okay.

454  
0:45:17  
P9  
So that's very helpful right there, because so is this account number the

455  
0:45:24  
P9  
the Your Va. Account number? Or is this the account number of that bill?

456  
0:45:29  
Emily  
A great question I do not know, but I know it's the one you would need in pay.gov. So.

457  
0:45:34  
P9  
Okay.

458  
0:45:35  
Emily  
Sure what the what? The full number is. Okay? So you would. You would copy that there anything else that might make it even easier for you in terms of getting that in that account. Information over to pay.gov.

459  
0:45:51  
P9  
I would say, can I go back real quick to co-pace.

460  
0:45:55  
Emily  
Yep.

461  
0:45:57  
P9  
Oops. I click over, clicked it.

462  
0:46:02  
P9  
I would say like, because if I was ready to, unless I'm ready and review details.

463  
0:46:08  
P9  
Then I would see it there.

464  
0:46:09  
P9  
But if I was, you know, like if I just if I didn't want to review the details already know it. Let's just say, let's put it this way. So I reviewed the details because I do this all like all the time

465  
0:46:21  
P9  
I would review the details, and I know I have like

466  
0:46:24  
P9  
25 days to pay it off. I'm like, Okay, well, I'll I'll pay it off later. I don't know why I do that. Just a procrastinator, I guess. But already know the the information. So I would go back, maybe 2 weeks later, and I want to pay the bill already. Right? What I would do usually be, since I already know I would just pay the bill.

467  
0:46:45  
P9  
It'd be nice to have that information there. The the account number.

468  
0:46:50  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. Oh, like right here.

469  
0:46:54  
P9  
Yeah, because like, I said, like, that's the type of thing that I would do

470  
0:47:00  
P9  
is I would review it. And then, okay, it's good to go. I'll pay it later. I I don't know. Why did I just do it? But you know it's 1 of those situations where I go back to Va

471  
0:47:11  
P9  
app, you know, if if I was to use the app

472  
0:47:15  
P9  
and then I would just click on pay Bill, because I already know what the bill is.

473  
0:47:18  
Emily  
Yeah, okay.

474  
0:47:19  
P9  
And then I would just follow this prompt, and then I would go to Va. Pay, pay.gov, and then now have to click on. Where do I find it? And then now go back to the app, get it, and then put it there. It'd be nice to have it right there already, you know.

475  
0:47:32  
Emily  
Yeah, okay, got it? And then so knowing having this experience where at least it it is possible to pay, even though I know it's switching applications. What would be the likelihood? You would use this version if it were built in real life.

476  
0:47:50  
P9  
I would rather use this version, because.

477  
0:47:53  
Emily  
Okay.

478  
0:47:53  
P9  
It. It'll you know.

479  
0:47:55  
P9  
I I avoid like calling and being on hold, or anything like that, I could just pay it off online. Easy.

480  
0:48:03  
P9  
Like, I said. The only reason why I paid it through phones because it was right there, and it told me it like to

481  
0:48:09  
P9  
call or mail, or something like that, so I was like, alright, let me just call this, take care of it, but.

482  
0:48:14  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Got it?

483  
0:48:16  
Emily  
Okay? I think those are all my questions. Anything else that you haven't already shared in regards to, let's say, any of the labeling of the section, or just any of the other experiences regarding the Copays here.

484  
0:48:34  
P9  
no, I would say, like, those are the the concerns that I that I you know that I have, but especially the the pay bill. That's probably one of the the bigger ones that I that I want to mention is to have the account number somewhere already.

485  
0:48:49  
Emily  
Yeah, okay.

486  
0:48:51  
P9  
Yeah. So that's like one of the big ones.

487  
0:48:54  
Emily  
Alright makes sense alright, and I'm just gonna check in with my colleagues. If anybody else has any quick questions, feel free to unmute now and ask them.

488  
0:49:09  
Emily  
Okay, I'll take that as a no, and we are a minute over time, and I do apologize. But thank you so much for taking the time to go over this with us. It's super important for us to actually talk with veterans and see how you are experiencing the various things that we are looking to build. So thank you for taking the time with us today.

489  
0:49:31  
P9  
No worries, thank you for for doing this. Make make it easier, for you know, for us.

490  
0:49:38  
Emily  
Working on.

491  
0:49:38  
P9  
Been calling.

492  
0:49:40  
Emily  
Yes, exactly, that's the goal. Alright, thanks so much. Hope. You have a great rest of the day.

493  
0:49:46  
P9  
Thank you, you, too. Bye.
