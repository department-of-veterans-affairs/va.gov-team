Yes, I'm perfectly fine. Yeah.

4  
0:00:11  
Emily  
Great. Thank you. And would you? Okay, with potentially showing our Va partners some clips from today's session.

5  
0:00:19  
P7  
Yeah, that's perfectly fine.

6  
0:00:20  
Emily  
Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. So on to oh, excuse me. First, st I'd like to know? Just a little bit about yourself as a veteran. What branch were you serving in when when you retired or separated.

7  
0:00:36  
P7  
I really need to disclose all the information.

8  
0:00:40  
Emily  
Oh, sorry! Sorry! I wasn't quite hearing that.

9  
0:00:43  
P7  
Oh, I mentioned no! Do I really need to disclose all of that? I don't feel comfortable.

10  
0:00:48  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Okay? Sure, no problem.

11  
0:00:50  
Emily  
Okay. And then excuse me. At whatever level you're comfortable. What sort of experience have you had with Va. In terms of any sort of if you've gone to any any buildings or any sort of use on the website, or app.

12  
0:01:05  
P7  
Yeah, I think everything. So far I've had. I've had a good experience for the most part. I think that sometimes it's like, it's very stressful, a lot of the, for example, the medical benefits. It's like very straightforward. They're really clear. I think maybe on the when it comes to the finance side. That's where I find that maybe I might be struggling a little bit with, and I think that's where probably

13  
0:01:34  
P7  
looking for the most guidance.

14  
0:01:38  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

15  
0:01:40  
Emily  
Excuse me, and are you? Are you often or, ever on the va website and or the mobile app.

16  
0:01:48  
P7  
I am on, especially on the mobile, on the mobile app.

17  
0:01:53  
Emily  
Okay, yeah.

18  
0:01:54  
Emily  
and are there. So are you? Are you only on the mobile app, or occasionally on the website as well.

19  
0:02:00  
P7  
Also on the website. I think maybe the way my brain works is that sometimes when I'm dealing with finances, I think I need to work out my laptop. I think I find myself that because it's a serious interaction I'm gonna be engaging with. I think I need my laptop. So when it comes to like anything, finance, debt related. That's when I would use my laptop for the most part.

20  
0:02:26  
Emily  
Okay, finance and lots of got it. In. In what cases would you choose to use the mobile app over the website?

21  
0:02:34  
P7  
The mobile app. I think I found myself when I'm just like checking, like you know, any benefits, or I think, especially if I need to book any medical appointments prescriptions. That sort of thing. I gravitate. I see. I gravitate myself to just like picking up my phone and doing that.

22  
0:02:55  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Great.

23  
0:02:56  
Emily  
Okay? So we're going to be moving on to the financial portion. So I want to make sure that you're only sharing what you are willing. I have 0 information as to any sort of financial information records with you, so I only know what you would you choose to share.

24  
0:03:14  
Emily  
So first, st we're going to be talking about both a little bit of medical Copays and or benefit overpayment, 1st wondering if you've had experience with owing the Va. Money.

25  
0:03:30  
P7  
Yes, I do. I think I think at some point I fell behind on certain payments. And yeah, I was trying to maybe find a way to just let you know. Repay that. But I did. I did fall behind in that regard.

26  
0:03:44  
Emily  
Okay, you got a 5 pm, do you recall? Exactly how or when? Oh, yeah. More how you were you. You were notified of the money that you had to pay.

27  
0:03:56  
P7  
I was notified through a letter. So I think this is when it comes to. I think I think it becomes more top of mind when I receive a paper letter. And that's how I would get my notifications. I don't think I feel comfortable doing paperless, so that's what I prefer just getting a paper letter.

28  
0:04:15  
Emily  
Oh, oh, you're not! You're you said you're you're not comfortable, doing paperless.

29  
0:04:18  
P7  
Yeah, I think I find myself. Maybe I might distract, or sometimes I find them a little. I might miss them, or hard or it's a bit hard for me to find them. I think maybe I forget that I get that notification. Maybe so. I prefer getting them on on an actual, you know, envelope like snail mail.

30  
0:04:39  
Emily  
Got it?

31  
0:04:39  
P7  
It's top of mind. Yeah.

32  
0:04:40  
Emily  
Okay, you prefer to get all right. Got it? And then what is or what? What prompts you to make payment, or like. How how do you know when you may need to make a payment.

33  
0:04:53  
P7  
I think what I do. I just set myself up, either on a weekend just set aside some time just to go through my mail. And that's when I was like, okay, I think I could make the payment this time around at least a minimum and that's what I know I would I would describe some time. So a lot of manual stuff.

34  
0:05:17  
Emily  
Okay, so you're covering your time. And do you are you getting a letter each time you have to pay? Or is it less frequent than that.

35  
0:05:26  
P7  
I definitely get letters. When it comes to copayments. Frequently. So so yeah, it's like, no regardless like or treatment. I will get a letter. And that's when I would know that. Okay, I need to make a co-payment. Or if there's anything outside of that, I need to pay.

36  
0:05:47  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And then how about? And for outside of of copayments, if there's any debt that you have, is that something you're you're receiving every time you need to make a payment, or less frequently.

37  
0:05:59  
P7  
I think I think it's less frequently. I think maybe I probably get that letter. Maybe probably about I will say maybe quarterly, maybe every 3, every 3 or 4 months I would get a reminder that, hey, you have this like outstanding balance? Yeah.

38  
0:06:18  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And with that, so with the ones that you get quarterly, are you? Are you making payments more often than that? Or are you making the payments quarterly when you receive the letters.

39  
0:06:29  
P7  
I think, I think when I get the letter quarterly, that's when I know, okay, I'm I need to make a payment. I think, yeah.

40  
0:06:38  
Emily  
Got it all right. And thoughts on. If there are any ways that things could be made easier in regards to any like having having to make the payments either for the the debt or for the medical co-payments.

41  
0:06:56  
P7  
I think I think when it comes to medical Co payments for the most part. That's something, I think, because it happens more frequently. I'm on top of it a lot more, I think, when it comes up any debt outside of that.

42  
0:07:09  
P7  
Sometimes I'm looking for, maybe, like, you know, if maybe down the line. I could get some kind of just like, you know, option where maybe some of the debt might be forgiven, or or or or to work out some kind of like, you know, plan where? Yeah. Like, you know, I could

43  
0:07:27  
P7  
of.

44  
0:07:28  
P7  
They make those payments much more doable for me.

45  
0:07:33  
Emily  
Okay? And is there? What sort of communication is there now in regards to helping to make these payments more doable?

46  
0:07:41  
P7  
So far, so far, just. The correspondence I received is just like this is your outstanding balance, and this is how like you know the payments that you should be making and so I've tried to adhere to them as much as possible.

47  
0:07:56  
Emily  
okay, so so right now, it sounds like, there's there's not any communication, in regards to making anything easier to pay is that right.

48  
0:08:03  
P7  
Yeah, I think so far, I that I remember, you know.

49  
0:08:08  
Emily  
Got it.

50  
0:08:09  
Emily  
and then thinking of both the copayments and the the debts. I know you said the copayments you're receiving fairly often, and then the debt you're receiving less often, maybe quarterly. How are you? Are you thinking of those as being similar types of money that you pay, or different? Or I'm wondering how you categorize those in your head.

51  
0:08:37  
P7  
Yeah, I think of anything when I when I look at medical payments, because it involves my health and well being and I think just because of the frequency of the reminders, and because I think I just see them on my app.

52  
0:08:53  
P7  
on my, on my phone, I think they become very much top of mind priority. That sort of sense. And I think, for, like any outstanding balance, I think it's more just like I know that. I need to make those payments. But I think just like, because of my income and everything. I think it's just

53  
0:09:16  
P7  
adds that stress. And so I just wait for that letter to arrive. Just so. Yeah, just have to make that payment. But I think that's how pretty much just like, you know. Ensuring that I'm taking care of myself physically and mentally. Once.

54  
0:09:35  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, got it? Got it?

55  
0:09:37  
Emily  
Okay? I'm gonna have you? We're gonna move on to some screen share and eventually get to the prototype. Could I have you share your screen now, and let me know if you need help making that happen?

56  
0:09:52  
P7  
Let's see.

57  
0:10:03  
Emily  
All right sharing screen. That was nice and easy. I love that.

58  
0:10:06  
P7  
Yeah.

59  
0:10:07  
Emily  
And now let me have you open up the figma app that you had downloaded.

60  
0:10:15  
Emily  
and I'm going to give you a login in just a moment. There we go, all right. And so so oh, yeah, they're just about to say you can swipe my video out of the way you read my mind.

61  
0:10:23  
P7  
At least I'm tech savvy? Somewhat.

62  
0:10:26  
Emily  
Perfect, easy peasy. So let me have you go to log into figma. And I'm going to give you some credentials here.

63  
0:10:36  
Emily  
Okay, so the email is [redacted]

64  
0:10:48  
P7  
Okay.

65  
0:10:49  
Emily  
And the password [redacted]

66  
0:10:54  
Emily  
There is a minimum of 8 characters.

67  
0:10:57  
P7  
Oh, it's 8 characters. Okay?

68  
0:10:59  
P7  
Oh.

69  
0:11:03  
Emily  
Yes, all right. And then it's just gonna prompt me for a code. Okay, there we go. That's coming through. So let me have you type in 4, 7, 0

70  
0:11:14  
Emily  
3, 9, 4, 3.

71  
0:11:20  
Emily  
Okay. Now, let's hopeful. This works continue with mobile app.

72  
0:11:27  
Emily  
All right. So I'm going to give you a link. Give me just a moment.

73  
0:11:33  
Emily  
I will do so in the zoom chat. Okay. Just sent that from into the Zoom chat.

74  
0:11:45  
P7  
okay.

75  
0:11:47  
Emily  
Yeah, the extra. There we go.

76  
0:11:51  
Emily  
Okay, hopefully, that comes out. It's working. I like, when things start working.

77  
0:11:58  
Emily  
Oh, that was faster than than normal. I like it all right. So here we have the fake app home screen. So before I have you tap on anything just looking at this and pretending this was you opening up your mobile app thoughts on where you might find money that you owe, and this could be both the debts and the copayments.

78  
0:12:25  
P7  
Yeah, I think opening this app.

79  
0:12:30  
P7  
I think if anything I would probably look at maybe I would probably check messages just to see if I had any notifications regarding any of those outstanding debts, or if that were empty, then I will tap on payments at the bottom, right.

80  
0:12:52  
Emily  
Okay. Got it. Thoughts on that payments that you mentioned in terms of the title. How clear or not clear might that be as a place to find that information.

81  
0:13:04  
P7  
I think it's I think it's clear enough. I think. I'm inclined to have. Maybe payments might be anything I might be receiving. But then that's why the benefits tab is there? I think payments is very clear enough.

82  
0:13:22  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Any thoughts on any title that might be even more clear.

83  
0:13:28  
P7  
I think maybe I think maybe either maybe payments, or maybe if I provide something that says balance, or just maybe just just straightforward to it, just like outstanding balance. Would be great. Just so like I know exactly where that option is.

84  
0:13:49  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Alright, and since you mentioned the payments, let me have you go ahead and tap into payments.

85  
0:13:58  
Emily  
Okay? So now that you're seeing this screen again, I'll ask you any thoughts, especially knowing that this is called Payments thoughts on the information that you're seeing here in terms of the clarity of calling it payments.

86  
0:14:14  
P7  
Yeah, in terms of payments. Payment history to you. Yeah, I think it's very straightforward. I like it. I like how it's

87  
0:14:26  
P7  
quickly. Just categorize into 2 separate boxes if you will, maybe payments to you. So that makes sense that anything that I'm receiving from the Va, and then any debt that I have. That oh, to the Va, so so yeah, I think it's very. I think it's very clear. And understandable. Yeah.

88  
0:14:53  
Emily  
Yeah, great. And then how about the the brief bit of information that is below both overpayment debt and copays the amount. And then how many debts or bills? What other are? Is there other information you might want to know, just as a super high level from this page.

89  
0:15:12  
P7  
No, I think of anything I think of anything. Maybe I'd be curious to know if

90  
0:15:20  
P7  
if maybe they could separate debts, or maybe just like if I'm about to click on overpayment, that's it. Maybe there'd be some kind of option to help me pay those make those payments more easier.

91  
0:15:39  
Emily  
Oh, okay. So so, something from this page to to clearly make it easier to make those payments.

92  
0:15:44  
P7  
Yeah, I think maybe it says copays maybe just mentioned, maybe medical Co pays or prescription copays just so. Just so. I know.

93  
0:15:55  
Emily  
Oh, oh, even even more clear! On what type of Copays.

94  
0:15:58  
P7  
Yeah, maybe that. But I but I imagine that maybe if I click on the arrow, maybe it will give me more information. But I think, just like looking at it from an high level. It's it's very understandable. Yeah.

95  
0:16:11  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So first, st we're gonna look just at the the overpayment section and you can tap into anything, scroll around and stuff. But let me let me get a sense of of what you are from this app, like what you believe that you currently owe, according to all this fake data here for specifically for the overpayments.

96  
0:16:33  
P7  
Yeah. So according to the information I'm given, yeah, I owe $2,760. That. Oh, and this is according to here.

97  
0:16:50  
Emily  
Okay and let me have you get even more information on these, just to see how clear everything is laid out.

98  
0:16:57  
P7  
Okay, should I check on the arrow?

99  
0:16:59  
P7  
Yep, yeah. Yeah. It's right on the the overpayment. That's yep.

100  
0:17:02  
Emily  
Yeah. So so again, just yeah, give me a brief overview of just what you're seeing here in terms of clarity, of of how much you owe with with this this fake example. Here.

101  
0:17:15  
P7  
Yeah. So I think here is it shows the 4 debts that are part of that in the payment. I do see here that one of them the post focus. I think it's really it's already been paid for. So that's really out of the picture. But it's nice to have that I think maybe this is a reminder that

102  
0:17:41  
P7  
I was able to make that that, or it's no longer top of mind. But yeah, but everything else. I do see. The balance that I owe and of course I think maybe what I

103  
0:17:56  
P7  
appreciate a little is the the next steps to approach these steps.

104  
0:18:08  
Emily  
Okay, so so since you mentioned next steps, what? And just the the this top one is active here, but what it. What information would be important to you specifically in regards to next steps, that you might have to take.

105  
0:18:22  
P7  
I think maybe I think maybe that's probably what maybe I'm not being fine to click on review details. Like, for example, like the one at the bottom contact the Department of Treasury. If I click on review details, I hope that maybe I'll be given some sort of maybe direct phone number. And I can do like a generic phone number to try to see if I could work that balance out

106  
0:18:50  
P7  
at least, for, like the disability, pension, and compensation and pension that I do see that, for example, at least fair enough. They give me the warning that benefits will be reduced or can be enacted. So yeah, we'll definitely click on review details to see what's gonna be the outcome of that.

107  
0:19:13  
Emily  
Okay. Well, since you said the details, let me have you tap on the details for the top one, the housing one, and let me know if, like, yeah, with the information here, how complete or incomplete is are things here that you would need for your next steps.

108  
0:19:34  
P7  
Let's see.

109  
0:19:42  
P7  
Yeah, I think it's I think it's complete. Enough. I think it's no. I think it's very complete. Yeah. It shows me again, like the the balance that I currently owe. When I need to. Make that payment or give them a call to see if maybe I can work the date out somehow.

110  
0:20:05  
P7  
I do like this signal. Why might I have this that I do like that reminder. So I don't think at least I don't have this

111  
0:20:14  
P7  
thinking that like, where did this come from? At least there's context behind that debt. And then I know I do like the

112  
0:20:25  
P7  
the the history of the payments I've made, and I think if anything, also the the letters I've been receiving. Yeah, I think this is also a a good post that I appreciate.

113  
0:20:38  
Emily  
Okay? Great in regards to the the debt letter history. What are how? How would you use that that section? What? What would be helpful for you right here.

114  
0:20:49  
P7  
I think maybe I think for me it would be just like the the dates. I think maybe that's when I would, you know, at least for me, like well, I can't let this

115  
0:21:00  
P7  
keep just like, you know, snowballing and so I think that, for example, April 1st 2025. It kind of says a mental reminder for me that. Okay, that's when they sent the letter. And I really need to get on on top of this.

116  
0:21:16  
Emily  
Okay, so is, is the the information here sufficient? Seeing exactly the date the letters were.

117  
0:21:23  
P7  
Yeah, I think if anything ever wanted to see the letter, I'd be curious to know if I could like tap on it the 1, st 2025, 1st demand letter and see if the letter will pop up or Pdf of it. But yeah, I think I find this section very helpful.

118  
0:21:40  
Emily  
Okay, great. Got it, and then see what else? Here, if you let's say you did pay this debt off completely, what information would you want to see that that may or may not indicate that.

119  
0:21:56  
P7  
If I pay this debt completely, I think we I think that letter history. I would want maybe some kind of this, like final letter or something indicating that. You're. You know this debt is close and that you've made your final payment.

120  
0:22:14  
P7  
And yeah, and maybe like, no, whether it's in yellow, maybe something in green or a balance of 0, just letting me know that there's no further action or activity required on my end.

121  
0:22:27  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And are there other things that? You know, we're, we're gonna pretend that this is being built in in the app. So about what you're seeing here? Are there other other things that you would expect to be or want to be able to do from here?

122  
0:22:47  
P7  
Yeah, I think if anything, what I'm looking for. Interestingly enough, I'm looking for, maybe like, kind of what banks have like a payment option. So I'm looking for like, oh, I know that I owe in this case 830. I'm I'm looking for a way to, maybe. Okay, well, let's let's make a payment right now. I don't see that. So maybe I'm looking for that. Yeah. Or maybe just because

123  
0:23:15  
P7  
because this because of how much I owe. I'm looking for, maybe just a button or something, just to let me know like, Hey, how can I? Maybe? How can we work something out so that I can continue to make these payments? At a more, maybe tailored approach. Given my income.

124  
0:23:38  
Emily  
Okay. So you you'd want something to to potentially work with you to make the payments and also something to make the payments.

125  
0:23:46  
P7  
Yeah, I know that like no, I don't. I saw the previous option that they had some sort of like, you know, contact us, and we'll work something out or something along those lines. But I don't know, I'm thinking, maybe kind of like

126  
0:24:00  
P7  
kind of like with other apps like or paypal, where you could just automatically, just opt in into maybe a way to consult to maybe break this payments apart or make them more doable. Yeah, I'm kind of looking for that. Maybe like an option. Here.

127  
0:24:21  
Emily  
Okay, got it? Yeah, that makes sense. So noting that you have stated those things that you want that are not here. If this were built in real life, as is without the payment options and without the communication about how how they could they could work with you, how likely would you be to use it as is.

128  
0:24:42  
P7  
I would. I would likely very. I would. I would use it. I think maybe I think maybe it's very. It's very clean. It's very informative. It provides me everything about like, you know the payments that I've made, including any late fees, that sort of nature. So I think with that in mind?

129  
0:25:02  
P7  
Yeah, it would definitely. I would see myself. Adding it to my well, that's maybe being more comfortable. Seeing this on my phone and engaging with it with making payments, or having that in top of mind.

130  
0:25:17  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And I'm gonna so we're gonna get back. Get back to the payments in just a moment. But let me have you go one screen back to the the debts page is one other question I had.

131  
0:25:29  
Emily  
Yeah. So if you were going to pretend that there is a new debt that you have incurred in this in this pretend situation, how would you expect to be notified? Obviously you would. I know you would get the the debt letter, but in terms of the app. How might you expect to to know that that information is in here?

132  
0:25:51  
P7  
Yeah, I think maybe I think if it if if I haven't got the letter, but I know that I owe something, then probably I would go here again under payments, and see if maybe try refreshing the page and see if it's there.

133  
0:26:08  
P7  
or or if it's not there just yet. Then probably I'll just go to my home to the home page. Maybe the bottom left, and I guess wait until I get some kind of push notification or some kind of internal notification, letting me know that where it's gonna be posted, or when it's posted.

134  
0:26:30  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

135  
0:26:31  
Emily  
And all right, let me have you tap on the payment section i'm going to have you and scroll all the way down we're going to get to a little hidden section. The blank gray area below Copays. Go ahead and tap that.

136  
0:26:46  
P7  
Focus, or the blank.

137  
0:26:48  
Emily  
The the blank area that's below. Could the copays?

138  
0:26:53  
Emily  
Yeah, there, perfect. Okay. And let me have you tap into the overpayment debt section again.

139  
0:27:00  
Emily  
All right. So again, we're going to look at this very top one, the housing we're going to pretend that since we've talked about looking to to get help in terms of making different payment structures. What would you want to do if you were looking to make a different payment plan or something for this top on this debt, for housing.

140  
0:27:29  
P7  
Yeah, I think maybe I think if I'm looking for maybe some kind of maybe different option, or maybe a more tailored option. And I would click on or tap on our resolve gap and see if maybe they could provide me with some

141  
0:27:47  
P7  
options where we could have it with no mutual benefit or understanding. Okay.

142  
0:27:52  
Emily  
Okay? Oh, yeah, you can go ahead and do that. Since you mentioned it.

143  
0:27:57  
P7  
Okay?

144  
0:27:59  
P7  
Yeah. So so yeah, I, I like this, like, how? Like, yeah, I can either pay online or other ways to pay. I think maybe I'd be inclined to, by the way, click on other ways to pay. Just so. Maybe it would give like no more options.

145  
0:28:18  
Emily  
Nice.

146  
0:28:18  
P7  
To calculating this debt.

147  
0:28:21  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. Yeah. If you want to go and tap through that, some of these are are actually linked in the prototype here.

148  
0:28:27  
P7  
Okay.

149  
0:28:28  
P7  
Okay. So pay by phone pay by mail.

150  
0:28:33  
P7  
Yeah, give- give them a call.

151  
0:28:39  
P7  
But

152  
0:28:43  
P7  
no, that's.

153  
0:28:44  
Emily  
Information here. Would there be something else you might be looking for?

154  
0:28:48  
P7  
Yeah, I think maybe pay by mail. I think I think I imagine that I thought that I thought that I would be getting. Maybe in my mind I thought that maybe there'd be other options where maybe I can. They can help me with just like, you know. making these payments much more doable. But instead, I got that. What if I can't pay online? Then I could do this

155  
0:29:14  
P7  
pay that post $10, either on the phone or by mail. So I think my mind was just thinking about something else. But yeah.

156  
0:29:24  
Emily  
Okay, I'll have you go ahead and tap close there.

157  
0:29:28  
Emily  
And yeah. Thoughts on what? What would you be? What would you expect to find, under the the request, Help, Button.

158  
0:29:38  
P7  
Request help, I think. I think, initially, I thought that maybe initially, I thought that by tapping on request help. That's when I would anticipate to maybe get a phone number or something to contact them. That's what I initially thought. But now that I see the other ways to pay is going down. That phone number. Then, I imagine, request to help now

159  
0:30:03  
P7  
should be, I hope, ways that maybe I could make these payments much more doable for me.

160  
0:30:13  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. And you can. You can go ahead and tap or request help. And just see how that lines up with what you're expecting.

161  
0:30:20  
P7  
Yeah, yeah, this is exactly what I was. I was looking for initially. Yeah. So I think I think, by the way, I would tap on request a payment plan.

162  
0:30:34  
P7  
just to see like, you know, what options?

163  
0:30:37  
P7  
So

164  
0:30:39  
P7  
so yeah, I think it gives me just like, you know, general information. I think, knowing me either, like, you know, I will try going online and see if I could work something out. Obviously to ask ea otherwise, if I find that tricky or cumbersome, then maybe I'll just give them a call directly

165  
0:31:04  
P7  
and before before I proceed with that? I'll I'll probably also click on and see again. I know what I can do. And I think and I think maybe because he starts to request for that help.

166  
0:31:21  
P7  
I might be inclined to actually tap on that and see if I fit that requirement when it comes to putting out the paperwork and see if I'm eligible for any further help or the legal.

167  
0:31:36  
Emily  
Okay? Yeah, you can go ahead and tap on the the debt relief one and see if if this page looks like it would be, it would be helpful from what we have. And obviously I'm not going to have you read everything but just a quick skim. If this would be be helpful for you if you, if you were for help.

168  
0:31:56  
P7  
Yeah, I think if anything it looks, it looks very promising. Da da da.

169  
0:32:03  
P7  
Yeah, I think if anything

170  
0:32:10  
P7  
request I like how it it kind of it gives you. By the way, the step by step, as like no, what? What information they're gonna need, and the timeline whenever we have time for just the process step by step. I do like. How like they mentioned how long it'll probably take. So I really do appreciate that. Because you never know

171  
0:32:34  
P7  
just like how much time I need to carve out. I anticipated. Maybe I thought that maybe I would just it would just take me 1520 min to submit it. But I do like how they give me the actual timeframe. So that's very helpful and I do like how the start. The request is mentioned at the top and bottom, and it's indicated in green, so I don't know. Maybe just for me. The green just makes me a bit more optimistic.

172  
0:33:04  
Emily  
Okay, great. Let me have you tap on done here on the upper left yep, and then

173  
0:33:12  
Emily  
oh, if in case you or let's say you believe that you don't actually owe this money, this particular debt for housing? Would it be clear what your next steps would be if you don't believe you, you owe this bill. I'm sorry this this debt.

174  
0:33:29  
P7  
Yeah, yeah. So so yeah. So if if I feel that, maybe this was posted by error, or maybe the debt that I owe is higher than what I anticipated. Well, if there's maybe some sort of discrepancy, then yeah, I would click on then I think it would tap on request help.

175  
0:33:54  
P7  
And then I think I saw an option. Yeah, here. So we click on on dispute this, that yeah, I would tap on that start here, that dispute.

176  
0:34:05  
Emily  
Okay, great. I'll have you close this one.

177  
0:34:10  
Emily  
So overall how I know you said when you have received the debt letters in person. There really wasn't any communication in terms of any help you might be able to request overall. How? How have you become aware that it is possible to request help from Va. Or any other resources in that in that sense.

178  
0:34:35  
P7  
Oh, me, personally, I well, I think I think for me personally, maybe just like, you know, going online and maybe doing a quick Google search but I think maybe just for me, maybe, like, you know, I haven't. Maybe you know, had the time, or I really don't know how. Maybe

179  
0:34:56  
P7  
time consuming. That might be, or if it's even worth exploring. So I don't know. Maybe that's why I haven't attack with that, or make that approach but maybe just seeing the options here, like, you know, on this, on this screen, on my phone. I don't know. Maybe just holding in my hands. It kind of gives me a sense of just like it's not.

180  
0:35:20  
P7  
it's it. It could be maybe easier. And maybe I should have done this maybe a while back.

181  
0:35:26  
Emily  
Okay, so you, it sounds like you, you would. You would want more communication just to

182  
0:35:31  
Emily  
just give like laying out options.

183  
0:35:35  
P7  
Yeah.

184  
0:35:36  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

185  
0:35:38  
Emily  
And then we're going to pretend that you are ready to make a payment on this particular debt on this particular debt for the housing. Walk me through how you might, and again, I'm not going to have you enter in any payment information, I promise, but walk me through what your steps would be if you are ready to make a payment through here.

186  
0:35:59  
P7  
Yeah. So I will want to make a payment. I'll probably click on resolve that and then, because yeah, probably

187  
0:36:10  
P7  
how seamless this experience has been. Then I probably click on pay online.

188  
0:36:17  
P7  
Okay. So it provides me with the details. And then from there I would have to click on or tap on pay on pay and I think from there it will just take me to like, you know the other page where I could make the payment.

189  
0:36:41  
Emily  
Okay, let me let me have you tap on that. And again, I'm not gonna have you type in anything real, so you will not make any payments, I promise.

190  
0:36:48  
Emily  
Yeah, you can continue through that to.

191  
0:36:51  
P7  
So if you click on view, let me open here.

192  
0:37:01  
Emily  
So here we have the the and and have you have you encountered this site before?

193  
0:37:06  
P7  
Yes, I have.

194  
0:37:07  
Emily  
Yeah, okay, got it. Okay? So I'm not. Gonna have you read everything? But let me have you just skip right ahead and tap on the the Blue green button on the upper left. I think it says pay online. It's very tiny. I can't actually tell.

195  
0:37:21  
P7  
Yeah, it's yeah. It's.

196  
0:37:23  
Emily  
Yeah, line. There we go. Yeah, okay. And then, I just want you to scroll down to where you you would be entering information. Not again. Not gonna have you do that, but thoughts on the process of entering the required information here.

197  
0:37:42  
P7  
Yeah, I think. I think it's very yeah. It's it's very straightforward. I do like how in the previous page, they did give me the just like as a as a reminder, just the information that I should be entering. Just so. It's when I make a when I make a payment, it's tethered to that, that. But yeah, I think if anything, it's it's very straightforward. And very clear.

198  
0:38:11  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And what would be your process if you were to to be making a payment on your phone here in in terms of getting the the required numbers into this.

199  
0:38:24  
P7  
I think I think for me my process would normally be that I already have all of my personal information just like on on the iphone, on the notes, on the notes app. So whenever I need to make a payment, I just use that and of course, if they're asking for any, maybe a reference code, or or any of that, that any additional information?

200  
0:38:49  
P7  
Then I take a note of that. But yeah, I think everything more or less. It's it's the same.

201  
0:38:55  
Emily  
Okay, okay, so so you would be using your your notes app instead sorry, or to to copy the information.

202  
0:39:02  
P7  
Yeah, so like, no, anything, anything that's personal. Fine. Yeah, I would just use my notes. App. That's why I would just kind of have my own, like no personal information from my own reminder.

203  
0:39:14  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And talk to me about the experience of of having to use multiple apps to do this, since, of course you mentioned using the notes app, and then having to open this page as well.

204  
0:39:26  
P7  
I think, I think, where I was kind of maybe hoping for. And initially was when I was making the payment online. I was kind of hoping that all of the information it would just be

205  
0:39:38  
P7  
already tied to my personal information. So all, all I need, I just thought, all I need to do, which is maybe enter the amount.

206  
0:39:46  
P7  
and then maybe confirm my bank and then make a payment, and that'll be the end of that. But yeah, that's why I felt like, you know, the very seamless. But if I need to, just like, you know populate here this page again with my information and all of that. It's it's not a huge lift, I think. Maybe I think maybe for me it's just like something with the process. I'm comfortable with it.

207  
0:40:16  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And if if and actually, let me have you, switch, back to the figma app

208  
0:40:27  
Emily  
yep, and then go to go back, so we'll get there. Yep, so pretending that this feature is built in the app as is just like using paying just like we we talked about how how likely would you be to use to to use the app as is here.

209  
0:40:49  
P7  
If I were to use the app as is yeah, like with the with the payment, and then having to tap on that link, and then and then going over to the other Gov page and and confirmation. Yeah, I would. Still, I would still use it, I think, for me even though that kind of want, that seamless portion, I think maybe for me mentally, because I'm seeing the official, the official Gov. Page. It gives me like

210  
0:41:17  
P7  
it probably gives a much more sense of confidence that.

211  
0:41:20  
Emily  
Hmm.

212  
0:41:20  
P7  
Receiving my payment as opposed to. If I maybe make the payment here. And if, whatever reason, there's an error now, I don't know if

213  
0:41:31  
P7  
if our payments in the limbo, or if they got it or not, so maybe just doing it on the government page, gives me a much more sense of like security and confidence.

214  
0:41:41  
Emily  
Okay, so is, would you? Would you actually rather have that payment in the the official Gov page, as opposed to within the app.

215  
0:41:50  
P7  
I think I think I think for me. I would still prefer to have it on the app. Personally, I would like to have an app. But-. But if it's if, if, for whatever reason, that's not possible, and I just need to

216  
0:42:05  
P7  
use the link, I'm perfectly fine. Also doing that.

217  
0:42:09  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And then compare for me the this version here, which we have the payment through the pay.vi.gov. Versus the version that we looked at before that did not have any payment. Options talk to me about which one you might prefer, and why.

218  
0:42:30  
P7  
I would definitely prefer this option, the one that I'm looking at right now.

219  
0:42:34  
P7  
I love. How excuse me! I like how you know, in the review details again. It just gives me a quick sense of just you know where my debt is. And any of my payment history in that regard. But I do like how it has a separate option. So resolve that and it helps, and it gives me a sense of just like know that? I don't know. Maybe because I like the word resolve that or that phrase. It gives maybe a sense of maybe

220  
0:43:02  
P7  
comfort that maybe like no they're looking out for me to kind of like, you know. Help tackle this that together.

221  
0:43:10  
Emily  
Okay, looking after you. I like that.

222  
0:43:13  
Emily  
Got it. And then any other thoughts regarding the screen, or really any of the screens we've looked at so far, any any labels or the sections or pages are labeled anything that might be that might make things more clear for you.

223  
0:43:32  
P7  
I think I think maybe

224  
0:43:35  
P7  
no, I think it's i i like it. I like how like, you know, for example, here, pay a request. Help by May 1, st 2025. I like how it's in bold letters, just to remind me. I also like no, the the colors of it like make it very simple and plain. So I'm not getting, you know, bombarded with too many

225  
0:43:57  
P7  
bells and whistles, which is a lot of yeah. So I think it's, it's very clean. And like, I said before, I do like the resolve that option. And yeah, and maybe kind of was hoping that maybe resolve that, but would also be at the bottom these other 2 deaths. But

226  
0:44:15  
P7  
but yeah, I I really like the aesthetic. It's very concise and clear.

227  
0:44:19  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And then if you, if you're able, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this, what you're seeing here would compare to anything you're seeing on va.gov, on on the website in terms of any any overpayment debts, and just in terms of the experience, or things that have been like. How how clear things are.

228  
0:44:43  
P7  
Yeah, I think maybe I think now that you know, I think about doing it on my laptop and then doing it here. I like, how like I said, like, how very clean it is. Very straight to the point.

229  
0:45:01  
P7  
yeah, I think it's just like not having it on my phone. It's, I think, for me, it's just it's extremely aesthetically pleasing. Because I know, like on the laptop, maybe I could get distracted, or or they get too many, too much information on the page. And I think here, on on my phone, on the on this app, it it just gives me the the correct amount of information that I need. Without being

230  
0:45:29  
P7  
overwhelmed by so many options.

231  
0:45:31  
Emily  
Okay, too many options. Alright. You got it and let me have you tap on the the payment section again. One more small section. I want to go through before before we wrap up. In regards to the co-pays. Let me have you tap into that.

232  
0:45:49  
Emily  
And then thoughts on, you know similar question as I had asked with the overpayments, but thoughts on the clarity in terms of bills here, how much you owe for Copays in this pretend situation.

233  
0:46:04  
P7  
Yeah. So I think so far, it's more or less the same amount information and overview. So I do like how it informs me when my payment is due, or when I should reach out in case I need any help. I like how I think what was missing? Maybe in the previous page with the payments

234  
0:46:31  
P7  
was this information that contact the Department of Treasury? And here's the phone number. So I do. I do appreciate that. Just like that contact information. And I think your co-, your Co pay bills for the past 6 months. That's informative, I think. I think that gives maybe a a sense of comfort

235  
0:46:54  
P7  
for me, because at least I know that the amount the amount balance that I owe is up to date, and that's something that I've just let. There let it just rest there, for

236  
0:47:06  
P7  
on and on.

237  
0:47:08  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And let me have you tap into the top one. The James A. Haley Hospital hospital in Tampa, to look at the information here.

238  
0:47:19  
Emily  
and see what information would be important to you if you if you had received, or if you were, you were looking at this particular bill.

239  
0:47:29  
P7  
Yeah, I think, it's

240  
0:47:32  
P7  
yeah. My information I'm giving it. It's it's standard I think maybe I think I might be inclined to be go to maybe premise statement and maybe see just like

241  
0:47:45  
P7  
the actual maybe paperwork of it all. But yeah, it's it's the option to pay Bill right away. So I think maybe just because I do like that option.

242  
0:48:06  
Emily  
Okay, great and since you mentioned the statements, what would you be looking for with the statements? How? How are you using them?

243  
0:48:15  
P7  
I think for me, just like my statements might be just like if there's as a reminder, maybe. What kind of treatment one of the service that I got. So instead of seeing here that well, $50 and that's that

244  
0:48:31  
P7  
I would like to let you know just as a reminder for myself. See? Well, why do I owe that much, and maybe just see the statement, and maybe say, Oh, it was maybe for X or Y service. And so I think for me, it's just that reminds me of like, know the context behind that payment.

245  
0:48:49  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, good and and let me have you. Look at a statement to just see like how how you would be. I know you said you would. You would review it? To make sure to see what is on there. Is there anything else you would do with the statements from the phone.

246  
0:49:05  
P7  
No, I think if anything

247  
0:49:08  
P7  
no, I think I think for me it would just be just that I think. I think, because I know I would still be in kind of pay it to pay it online. But I think for me, my my peace of mind is maybe just looking at it. Then just knowing what the context of the bill is.

248  
0:49:32  
Emily  
Okay, you're just looking at them. Got it? Okay, maybe tap done there, please.

249  
0:49:38  
Emily  
And let's pretend that you are ready to make a payment you can walk me through. How? You would be making a payment for this particular one.

250  
0:49:48  
P7  
Yeah, so I've got the options is pay bill. So we'll click on that and then, yeah, probably probably this is so seamless. I'll go on pay.gov, so I would like track on that, and go from there.

251  
0:50:05  
Emily  
Okay and let me have you go go through that as well.

252  
0:50:16  
Emily  
Okay, and just scroll down. I know there's a lot to read, so I don't. Wanna

253  
0:50:19  
Emily  
have you and tap on. Continue to the form again, not going to have you enter in any real information.

254  
0:50:26  
Emily  
And then scroll down a little bit. So yeah, thoughts on how you would get the the account number that you would need into into this page.

255  
0:50:39  
P7  
Yeah, I think here. So I think here, either. I would check maybe my my notes app and see if if I have that information

256  
0:50:51  
P7  
or if the information that I have is the one that they're asking for that regard, or otherwise, just to be on the safe side and not and avoid any discrepancies or errors. Then I would definitely just tap on whether I find my account number just to be in the safe side that I'm providing the correct information.

257  
0:51:14  
Emily  
Okay? And when you mentioned again, you're gonna use the the notes app is, is that like, are you? How? How are you getting the information into the notes app? Is this something you're you're copying or forwarding, or how are you actually putting it in? There.

258  
0:51:30  
P7  
Yeah, some just copy and pasting. So if there's something, if like, if there's information or anything that's given to me, that maybe it's personal, or something of account number or an Id or something. Then I just said, That's I just copy and paste that maybe it might be relevant in the future.

259  
0:51:56  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you, Tab. I'm sorry not tab switch back to the figma app.

260  
0:52:01  
P7  
Okay.

261  
0:52:03  
Emily  
Yeah, and then go to go back

262  
0:52:05  
Emily  
close. Yeah. Okay. So thoughts on on copying the account number from here into the paying website. We just had.

263  
0:52:16  
P7  
Yeah, yeah. So I think so I think I would go. I would probably copy that account number into my

264  
0:52:27  
P7  
into my notes app, maybe again, like, you know, it just looked at a very important number that is, gonna be tabit to me. I do see how like when it's now I look at it. It's broken into 5 parts. So maybe that might be the information that they're looking for. When it comes to making that payment but I would still, I would still tap on or click on the how to find my account number.

265  
0:52:52  
P7  
just to be just to double or triple check on my end. Yeah, just to avoid any any errors or yeah.

266  
0:53:00  
Emily  
Oh, from the the payment site you would tap on how to find your account number.

267  
0:53:04  
P7  
Yeah, I would say, yeah, just so, because I know that I am entering the the correct information. And it's not just a coincidence that

268  
0:53:16  
Emily  
Okay, and then thoughts on. If you ever might use the copy button here on this on the app for the account number.

269  
0:53:27  
P7  
I think I think I would. I think I would. I would definitely copy but then I imagine that on the other page, because I see 5 separate lines. Then then I don't know if they want me to like.

270  
0:53:43  
P7  
enter it into just like line 1, 5, 3, 4, line 2, 1 0 0 1. So if I copy and paste it, I'm just gonna be doing a lot of just like pasting and deleting. Yeah.

271  
0:53:57  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, got it.

272  
0:53:59  
Emily  
Okay? And we are just about time. So I believe those are all my questions I'm going to check in with my colleagues here. If anybody has

273  
0:54:08  
Emily  
questions. Natasha, Michelle Ashley, if anyone would like to unmute and ask, you may do so now.

274  
0:54:23  
Emily  
Okay, it looks like no one asked questions. Any other final thoughts you'd like to share in regards to finances and all the designs we've been looking at.

275  
0:54:35  
P7  
No, I think this is a really really clean design. There's a lot of comfort around the design. So so, yeah, I do like like I said before, just like and the other payments page. Nothing helping me with something like that, I think. I think it's very well designed. It's very crystal clear.

276  
0:54:58
