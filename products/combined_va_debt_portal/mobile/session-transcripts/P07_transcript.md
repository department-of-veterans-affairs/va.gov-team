00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.600
<v Moderator - Emily>are you okay if I record the audio and video

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Moderator - Emily>as we talk today?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.960
<v P 07>Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.920
<v Moderator - Emily>Great, thank you.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Moderator - Emily>And would you okay with potentially showing

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Moderator - Emily>our VA partners some clips from today's session?

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.240
<v P 07>Yes, it's perfectly fine.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great, thank you. Okay, so on to. Excuse

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.320
<v Moderator - Emily>me.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Moderator - Emily>First, I'd like to know just a little bit

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Moderator - Emily>about your. As a veteran, what branch were

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Moderator - Emily>you serving in when you retired or separated?

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.190
<v P 07>I really need to disclose all information.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, sorry, sorry, I wasn't quite hearing

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Moderator - Emily>that.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.550
<v P 07>Oh, I mentioned. Do I really need to disclose

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.470
<v P 07>all of that? I don't feel comfortable.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.910
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, sure, no problem. Okay. And then. Excuse

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Moderator - Emily>me. At whatever level you're comfortable,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Moderator - Emily>what sort of experience have you had with

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Moderator - Emily>VA in terms of any sort of.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Moderator - Emily>If you've gone to any, any buildings or any

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Moderator - Emily>sort of use on the website or app?

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.050
<v P 07>Yeah, I think if, I think so far I've had,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.490
<v P 07>I've had a good experience for the most part.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.050
<v P 07>I think that sometimes it's like, it's, it's

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.450
<v P 07>very strict. So a lot of, for example, the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.450
<v P 07>medical benefits, it's like they're really

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.650
<v P 07>straightforward, they're really clear. I

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.610
<v P 07>think maybe on the, when it comes to the

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.890
<v P 07>finance side, that's where I find that maybe

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.490
<v P 07>I might be struggling a little bit with.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.210
<v P 07>And I think that's where probably I'm looking

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.850
<v P 07>for the most guidance.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.850
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Excuse me. And are you often

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Moderator - Emily>or ever on the VA website and. Or the mobile

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.410
<v Moderator - Emily>app?

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.580
<v P 07>I am especially on the mobile app. The mobile

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.860
<v P 07>app.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.860
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And are they. So are you, are you only

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Moderator - Emily>on the mobile app or occasionally on the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Moderator - Emily>website as well?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.060
<v P 07>Also the website. I think maybe the way my

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.300
<v P 07>brain works is that sometimes when I'm dealing

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.380
<v P 07>with finances, I think I need to work out

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.900
<v P 07>my laptop. I think I find myself that because

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.860
<v P 07>it's a serious interaction I'm going to be

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.190
<v P 07>engaging with. I think I need my laptop.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.790
<v P 07>So when it comes to anything finance, debt

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.910
<v P 07>related, that's when I would use my laptop

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.710
<v P 07>for the most part.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.870
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Finance and lots of. Got it in. In

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Moderator - Emily>what cases would you choose to use the mobile

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Moderator - Emily>app over the website?

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:35.230
<v P 07>The mobile app.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.070
<v P 07>I think I find myself when I'm just like

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.270
<v P 07>checking like, you know, any benefits or

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.310
<v P 07>I think especially if I need to book any

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.900
<v P 07>medical appointments, prescriptions, that

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.980
<v P 07>sort of thing. I gravitate. I see. I gravitate

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.660
<v P 07>myself to just like picking up my phone and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.100
<v P 07>doing that.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Great. Okay. So we're going to be moving

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.620
<v Moderator - Emily>on to the financial portion. So I want to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.020
<v Moderator - Emily>make sure that you're only sharing what you

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.900
<v Moderator - Emily>are willing. I have zero information as to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Moderator - Emily>any sort of financial information records

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.220
<v Moderator - Emily>with you.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Moderator - Emily>So I only know what you would you choose

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.730
<v Moderator - Emily>to share. So first we're going to be talking

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Moderator - Emily>about both a little bit of medical co pays

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Moderator - Emily>and or benefit overpayment first wondering

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.770
<v Moderator - Emily>if you have had experience with owing the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.530
<v Moderator - Emily>VA money.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.290
<v P 07>Yes, I do. I think at some point I fell behind

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.570
<v P 07>on certain payments and yeah, I was trying

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.330
<v P 07>to maybe find a way to just repay that but

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.800
<v P 07>I did, I did fall behind in that regard.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, you got to follow up.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Do you recall exactly how or when or. Yeah,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.920
<v Moderator - Emily>more. More how you were. You. You.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.560
<v Moderator - Emily>You were notified of. Of the money that you

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.080
<v Moderator - Emily>had to pay?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.280
<v P 07>I was notified through, through a letter.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.720
<v P 07>So I think it's just when it comes to. I

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.400
<v P 07>think, I think it becomes more top of mind

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.520
<v P 07>when I receive a paper letter and that's

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.400
<v P 07>how I would get my notifications.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.470
<v P 07>I don't think I feel comfortable doing paperless.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.190
<v P 07>So that's why I prefer just getting a paper

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.670
<v P 07>letter.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, oh you're not, you're. You said you're.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Moderator - Emily>You're not comfortable doing paperless.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.590
<v P 07>Yeah, I think I find myself maybe I might

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.470
<v P 07>lose track or sometimes I find them a little.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.910
<v P 07>I might miss them or hard or it's a bit hard

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.070
<v P 07>for me to find them. I think maybe I forget

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.310
<v P 07>that I get that notification maybe so I prefer

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.750
<v P 07>getting them on an actual envelope like snail

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.070
<v P 07>mail type of mine.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, you prefer to get in snail. All right,

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Moderator - Emily>got it.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Moderator - Emily>And then what is. Or what. What prompts you

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.150
<v Moderator - Emily>to make payment or like how, how do you know

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Moderator - Emily>when you may need to make a payment?

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.670
<v P 07>I think what I do, maybe itâ€™s old school.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.350
<v P 07>I just set myself up either on a weekend,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.910
<v P 07>just set aside some time just to go through

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.030
<v P 07>my mail and that's when I was like, okay,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.350
<v P 07>I think I could make the payment this time

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.870
<v P 07>around, at least the minimum.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.950
<v P 07>And that's where I know I would. I would

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.830
<v P 07>be subscribed by some time. So a lot of manual

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.270
<v P 07>stuff.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.630
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so you're covering your time and do

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.150
<v Moderator - Emily>you. Are you getting a letter each time you

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.990
<v Moderator - Emily>have to pay or is it less frequent than that?

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.110
<v P 07>I definitely get letters when it comes to

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.630
<v P 07>co payments frequently. So. So yeah, it's

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.790
<v P 07>like you know, act like no regardless, like

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.340
<v P 07>what treatment I will get a letter and that's

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.660
<v P 07>when I would know that okay, I need to make

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.020
<v P 07>a co payment or if there's anything outside

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.620
<v P 07>of that I need to Pay.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then how about for outside

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Moderator - Emily>of co payments, if there's any debt that

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.500
<v Moderator - Emily>you have, is that something you're receiving

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Moderator - Emily>every time you need to make a payment or

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Moderator - Emily>less frequently?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.260
<v P 07>I think it's less frequently. I think maybe

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.940
<v P 07>I probably get that letter maybe, probably

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.600
<v P 07>about. I will say maybe quarterly, maybe

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.880
<v P 07>every three, every three or four months,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.320
<v P 07>I would get a reminder that, hey, you have

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.960
<v P 07>this outstanding balance. Yeah.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.320
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Moderator - Emily>And with that. So with the ones that you

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.880
<v Moderator - Emily>get quarterly, are you making payments more

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.800
<v Moderator - Emily>often than that or are you making the payments

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.440
<v Moderator - Emily>quarterly when you receive the letters?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.880
<v P 07>I think when I get the letter quarterly,

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.900
<v P 07>that's when I know. Okay, I'm. I need to

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.860
<v P 07>make a payment.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, okay, got it. All right. And thoughts

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.540
<v Moderator - Emily>on if there are any ways that things could

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.179
<v Moderator - Emily>be made easier in regards to any like having,

00:06:50.179 --> 00:06:51.940
<v Moderator - Emily>having to. Having to make the payments either

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.140
<v Moderator - Emily>for the, the debt or for the medical co payments.

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.620
<v P 07>I think, I think when it comes to medical

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.030
<v P 07>co payments, for the most part that's something

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.310
<v P 07>I think because it happens more frequently,

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.990
<v P 07>I'm on top of it a lot more.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.070
<v P 07>I think when it comes like, you know, any,

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.430
<v P 07>any debt outside of that, sometimes I'm looking

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.150
<v P 07>for maybe like, you know, maybe down the

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.150
<v P 07>line I could get some kind of just like,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:18.550
<v P 07>you know, option where maybe some of the

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.630
<v P 07>debt might be forgiven or, or, or to work

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.350
<v P 07>out some kind of like, you know, plan where.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.540
<v P 07>Yeah, like, you know, I could make those

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.620
<v P 07>payments much more doable for me.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, and is there, what sort of communication

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.380
<v Moderator - Emily>is there now in regards to helping to make

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Moderator - Emily>these payments more doable?

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.500
<v P 07>So far. So far, just the correspondence I

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.260
<v P 07>received is just like, this is your outstanding

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:49.460
<v P 07>balance and this is how the payments that

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.220
<v P 07>you should be making.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.100
<v P 07>And so I try to adhere to them as much as

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:54.380
<v P 07>possible.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so right now it sounds like there's

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.020
<v Moderator - Emily>not any communication in regards to making

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.980
<v Moderator - Emily>anything easier to pay, is that right?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:06.100
<v P 07>Yeah, I think so far that I remember.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then thinking of both the

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:17.580
<v Moderator - Emily>co payments and the debts, I know you said

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Moderator - Emily>the co payments you're receiving fairly often

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.170
<v Moderator - Emily>and then the debt you're receiving less often,

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.210
<v Moderator - Emily>maybe quarterly.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Moderator - Emily>How are you, Are you thinking of those as

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Moderator - Emily>being similar types of money that you pay

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.050
<v Moderator - Emily>or different or I'm wondering how you categorize

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:35.970
<v Moderator - Emily>those in your head.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.650
<v P 07>Yeah, I think of anything when I, when I

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.170
<v P 07>look at medical payments because it involves

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:47.170
<v P 07>my health and well being and I think just

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.910
<v P 07>because of the frequency of the reminders

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:51.950
<v P 07>and because I think I just see them on my

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.270
<v P 07>app on on my phone, I think they become very

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:00.870
<v P 07>much top of mind priority, that sort of sense.

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.750
<v P 07>And I think for like any outstanding balance,

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:08.910
<v P 07>I think it's more just like I know that I

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.110
<v P 07>need to make those payments but I think just

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.310
<v P 07>like because of my income and everything,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.050
<v P 07>I think it just adds that stress and so I

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.210
<v P 07>just wait for that letter to arrive. Just

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.650
<v P 07>so yeah, just have to make that payment.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.610
<v P 07>But I think that's the point being pretty

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.370
<v P 07>much the signal ensuring that I'm taking

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.210
<v P 07>care of myself physically and mentally wise.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.210
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Okay, I'm going to have you.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.570
<v Moderator - Emily>We're going to move on to some, some screen

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.290
<v Moderator - Emily>share and eventually get to the prototype.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.860
<v Moderator - Emily>Could I have you share your screen now and

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Moderator - Emily>let me know if you need help making that

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Moderator - Emily>happen?

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:04.500
<v Moderator - Emily>All right. Sharing screen. That was nice

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:09.100
<v Moderator - Emily>and easy. I love that. And now let me have

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.420
<v Moderator - Emily>you open up the Figma app that you had downloaded

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.610
<v Moderator - Emily>and I'm going to give you a login in just

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.010
<v Moderator - Emily>a moment.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.210
<v Moderator - Emily>There we go. All right. And so, so. Oh yeah,

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.850
<v Moderator - Emily>they're just about to say you can swipe my

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.570
<v Moderator - Emily>video out of the way. You read my mind.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.770
<v P 07>At least I'm tech savvy somewhere.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Moderator - Emily>Perfect. Easy peasy. All right, so let me

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.210
<v Moderator - Emily>have you go to log into Figma and I'm going

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:32.890
<v Moderator - Emily>to give you some credentials here.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:45.680
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So the email is v atest000mail.com.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.480
<v P 07>Okay.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Moderator - Emily>And the password v a v a v a v a. There is

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.000
<v Moderator - Emily>a minimum of eight characters.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.640
<v P 07>Oh, it's eight characters. Okay.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.960
<v Moderator - Emily>Yes. All right. And then it's just gonna

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.720
<v Moderator - Emily>prompt me for a code. Okay, there we go.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.360
<v Moderator - Emily>That's coming through.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:17.100
<v Moderator - Emily>So let me have you typ 03943.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:22.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, now let's hopefully this works. Continue

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Moderator - Emily>with mobile app.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so I'm going to give you a link.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.780
<v Moderator - Emily>Give me just a moment. I will do so in the

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.020
<v Moderator - Emily>zoom chat. Okay. Just sent that from into

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.180
<v Moderator - Emily>the zoom chat.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.560
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, the extra. There we go. Okay. Hopefully

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:52.880
<v Moderator - Emily>that comes out. It's working.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.320
<v Moderator - Emily>I like when things start working.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.320
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, that was faster than normal. I like it.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.320
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so here we have the fake app home

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.120
<v Moderator - Emily>screen. So before I have you tap on anything

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Moderator - Emily>just looking at this and pretending this

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.900
<v Moderator - Emily>was you opening up your mobile app. Thoughts

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:20.020
<v Moderator - Emily>on where you might find money that you owe?

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.260
<v Moderator - Emily>And this could be both the debts and the

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.100
<v Moderator - Emily>co payments.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.420
<v P 07>Yeah. I think opening this app, I think if

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.700
<v P 07>anything I would probably look at maybe I

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.260
<v P 07>would probably check messengers just to see

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:42.630
<v P 07>if I had any notifications regarding any

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:46.110
<v P 07>of those outstanding debts or if that were

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:50.710
<v P 07>empty, then I would tap on payments at the

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:51.070
<v P 07>bottom.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.630
<v Moderator - Emily>Right, okay, got it. Thoughts on that payments

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Moderator - Emily>that you mentioned.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.830
<v Moderator - Emily>In terms of the title, how clear or not clear

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.750
<v Moderator - Emily>might that be as a place to find that information?

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.510
<v P 07>I think it's. I think it's clear enough.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:11.220
<v P 07>I think I'm inclined to think that maybe

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:13.700
<v P 07>payments might be anything I might be receiving,

00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.900
<v P 07>but then that's why the benefits tab is there.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:20.620
<v P 07>So, yeah, I think payments is very clear

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:20.980
<v P 07>now.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.780
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Any thoughts on any title that

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:26.020
<v Moderator - Emily>might be even more clear?

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.020
<v P 07>I think maybe. I think maybe either. Maybe

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.780
<v P 07>payments or maybe if I could find something

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:39.890
<v P 07>that says balance or just maybe just straightforward

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:43.610
<v P 07>to it, just like outstanding balance would

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.050
<v P 07>be great.

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:48.370
<v P 07>Just so like I know exactly where that option

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.690
<v P 07>is.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.170
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. All right. And since you mentioned

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:52.890
<v Moderator - Emily>the payments, let me have you go ahead and

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:54.290
<v Moderator - Emily>tap into payments.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so now that you're seeing this screen

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.570
<v Moderator - Emily>again, I'll ask you any thoughts, especially

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.350
<v Moderator - Emily>knowing that this is called payments. Thoughts

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.630
<v Moderator - Emily>on the information that you're seeing here

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:12.750
<v Moderator - Emily>in terms of the clarity of calling it payments?

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.830
<v P 07>Yeah, in terms of payments. Payment history

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.590
<v P 07>to you? Yeah, I think it's very straightforward.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:28.110
<v P 07>I like it. I like how it's quickly just categorized

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:34.860
<v P 07>into two separate boxes, if you will. Maybe

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:37.580
<v P 07>payments to rule, so that makes sense of

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.540
<v P 07>anything that I'm receiving from the VA and

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:45.380
<v P 07>then any debt that I have that I owe to the

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:51.380
<v P 07>va. So yeah, I think it's very clear and

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.340
<v P 07>understandable. Yeah, got it.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.060
<v Moderator - Emily>Great. And then how about the brief bit of

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.860
<v Moderator - Emily>information that is below both overpayment

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Moderator - Emily>debt and. And co pays the amount and then

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.650
<v Moderator - Emily>how many debts or bills? What other are.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:05.970
<v Moderator - Emily>Is.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.490
<v Moderator - Emily>Is there other information you might want

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.530
<v Moderator - Emily>to know just as a super high level from this

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:10.930
<v Moderator - Emily>page?

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.410
<v P 07>No, I think of anything. I think of anything.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:21.610
<v P 07>Maybe I'd be curious to know if. If maybe

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.010
<v P 07>they could separate debts or maybe just like

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.210
<v P 07>if I'm curious about.

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.220
<v P 07>On overpayment debts, maybe there'd be some

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:34.940
<v P 07>kind of option to help me pay those, make

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.420
<v P 07>those payments more easier.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:42.260
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so something from this page to clearly

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.020
<v Moderator - Emily>make it easier to make those payments.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:47.700
<v P 07>Yeah, yeah, I think maybe it's just cold

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.060
<v P 07>case. Maybe just mention maybe medical co

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:54.090
<v P 07>pays or prescription co pays, just so. Just

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:54.690
<v P 07>so I know.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.690
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, even more clear on what type of code

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.130
<v Moderator - Emily>base.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.330
<v P 07>Yeah, maybe that, but I. But I imagine that

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.890
<v P 07>maybe if I click on the arrow, maybe it'll

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.970
<v P 07>give me more information. But I think just

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.850
<v P 07>like looking at it from a high level, it's

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.930
<v P 07>very understandable.

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. So first we're going to look

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.930
<v Moderator - Emily>just at the overpayment section and you can

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.330
<v Moderator - Emily>tap into anything, scroll around and stuff.

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:25.270
<v Moderator - Emily>But let me get a sense of what you from this

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.390
<v Moderator - Emily>app, like what you believe that you currently

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:29.790
<v Moderator - Emily>owe according to all this fake data here

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.030
<v Moderator - Emily>specifically for the overpayments.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:36.789
<v P 07>Yeah. So according to the information I'm

00:16:36.789 --> 00:16:45.230
<v P 07>given, $2,760 that owe and this is according

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:47.550
<v P 07>to here only before debts.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.900
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And let me have you get even more information

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Moderator - Emily>on these just to see how clear everything

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Moderator - Emily>is laid out.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.860
<v P 07>Okay, so I tap on the arrow.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:01.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep. Yeah, yeah, it's right on the, the overpayment

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:01.460
<v Moderator - Emily>debts.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep. Yeah. So. So again just, yeah, give

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.260
<v Moderator - Emily>me a brief overview of just what you're seeing

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:10.260
<v Moderator - Emily>here in terms of clarity of, of how much

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:13.260
<v Moderator - Emily>you owe with, with this, this fake example

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:13.540
<v Moderator - Emily>here.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.350
<v P 07>Yeah.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:21.830
<v P 07>So I think here is it shows the four debts

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:25.990
<v P 07>that are part of that overpayment. I do see

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.750
<v P 07>here that one of them, the post sign of the

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.390
<v P 07>event for books and supplies. I think it's

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.470
<v P 07>really, it's really been paid for. So that's

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.910
<v P 07>really out of the picture. But it's nice

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.590
<v P 07>to have that.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:42.070
<v P 07>I think maybe this is a reminder that I was

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.390
<v P 07>able to make that debt or it's no longer

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.070
<v P 07>top of mind. But. Yeah, but everything else

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:53.910
<v P 07>I do see the balance that I owe and of course

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.189
<v P 07>I think maybe what I appreciate a little

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:01.590
<v P 07>is the next steps to approach these debts.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.030
<v P 07>For example, the bottom ones, I need to contact

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.110
<v P 07>the Department of Treasury.

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.810
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so since you mentioned next steps,

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:14.770
<v Moderator - Emily>just this top one is active here.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.250
<v Moderator - Emily>But what information would be important to

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.530
<v Moderator - Emily>you specifically in regards to next steps

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.490
<v Moderator - Emily>that you might have to take?

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.090
<v P 07>I think maybe that's probably what. Maybe

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.610
<v P 07>I'm not being inclined to take on review

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.210
<v P 07>details. Like for example, like the one at

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.850
<v P 07>the bottom, contact the Department of Treasury.

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.540
<v P 07>If I click on review details, I hope that

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.540
<v P 07>maybe I'll be given some sort of maybe direct

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.500
<v P 07>phone number and not maybe like a generic

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.540
<v P 07>number to try to see if I could work that

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.300
<v P 07>balance out.

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.180
<v P 07>I do sort of like the disability, pension

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:57.820
<v P 07>and compensation and pension debt. I do see

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.300
<v P 07>that for example, at least fair enough, they

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.940
<v P 07>give you the warning that benefits will be

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.850
<v P 07>reduced or can be enacted. So. Yeah, well,

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:11.130
<v P 07>again I click on review details to see what's

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:12.890
<v P 07>going to be the outcome of that.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.050
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, well since you said the details, let

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.210
<v Moderator - Emily>me have you tap on the details for the top

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:21.850
<v Moderator - Emily>one, the housing one, and let me know if

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:22.170
<v Moderator - Emily>like.

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:26.370
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, with the information here, how complete

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:30.130
<v Moderator - Emily>or incomplete is are things here that you

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:32.300
<v Moderator - Emily>would need for your next steps.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:34.540
<v P 07>Let's see.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.580
<v P 07>Yeah, I think it's, I think it's complete

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.940
<v P 07>enough. I think it's, I think it's very complete.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.460
<v P 07>Yeah. It shows me again, like the balance

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:58.130
<v P 07>that I currently owe when I need to make

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:01.890
<v P 07>that payment or give them a call to see if

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.850
<v P 07>maybe I can work the date out somehow. I

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.770
<v P 07>do like this, like, no, why might I have

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:08.370
<v P 07>this debt?

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.410
<v P 07>I do like that reminder. So I don't think,

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.130
<v P 07>at least I don't have this thinking that

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.730
<v P 07>I. Where did this come from? At least there's

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:23.570
<v P 07>context behind that debt. And then I do like

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:28.750
<v P 07>the, the, the history of the payments I've

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.550
<v P 07>made and I think if anything, also the, the

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.550
<v P 07>letters that receiving.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:35.590
<v P 07>Yeah, I think this is also a good post that

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:37.750
<v P 07>I, I appreciate.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. In regards to the, the debt

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:44.350
<v Moderator - Emily>letter history, what are, how, how would

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.110
<v Moderator - Emily>you use that, that section? What, what would

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.430
<v Moderator - Emily>be helpful for you right here?

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:51.230
<v P 07>I think, maybe, I think for me would be just

00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:52.840
<v P 07>like the, the dates.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.400
<v P 07>I think maybe that's when I would, you know,

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.720
<v P 07>at least for me, like, well, I can't let

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.000
<v P 07>this keep just like, you know, snowballing.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.840
<v P 07>And so I think, I think for example, April

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.040
<v P 07>1, 2025, it kind of saves them mental reminder

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.120
<v P 07>for me that, okay, that's when they sent

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.200
<v P 07>the letter. And like, I really need to get

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.400
<v P 07>on top of this.

00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.810
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so is the information here sufficient

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.370
<v Moderator - Emily>seeing exactly the date the letters were?

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:25.090
<v P 07>Yeah, I think if anything, if I wanted to

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.570
<v P 07>see the letter, I'd be curious to know if

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:30.570
<v P 07>I could like tap on it on that April 1, 2025,

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:32.730
<v P 07>first demand letter and see if the letter

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.210
<v P 07>will pop up or PDF of it.

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.610
<v P 07>But yeah, I think I find this section very

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:39.090
<v P 07>helpful.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.500
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. Got it. And then, so see what

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.140
<v Moderator - Emily>else here. If you, let's say you did pay

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.900
<v Moderator - Emily>this debt off completely, what information

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:52.220
<v Moderator - Emily>would you want to see that.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:54.300
<v Moderator - Emily>That may or may not indicate that.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:58.780
<v P 07>If I paid this debt completely, I think maybe,

00:21:59.019 --> 00:22:02.220
<v P 07>I think in the debt letter history I would

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.820
<v P 07>want maybe some kind of just like final letter

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:05.420
<v P 07>or something.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.360
<v P 07>This debt is closed and that you make your

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:15.840
<v P 07>final payment and. Yeah, and maybe I don't

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.840
<v P 07>know whether it's in yellow, maybe something

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.680
<v P 07>in green, or a balance of zero, just letting

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.320
<v P 07>me know that there's no further action or

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.400
<v P 07>activity required on my end.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:30.640
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, I got it. And are there other things

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.880
<v Moderator - Emily>that, you know, we're going to pretend that

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.760
<v Moderator - Emily>this is being built in, in the app. So about

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.760
<v Moderator - Emily>what you're seeing here, are there other,

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.600
<v Moderator - Emily>other things that you would Expect to be

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.560
<v Moderator - Emily>or want to be able to do from here.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.600
<v P 07>Yeah, I think if anything, what I'm looking

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.960
<v P 07>for, interestingly enough, I'm looking for

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.280
<v P 07>maybe like kind of what banks have, like

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.880
<v P 07>a payment option. So I'm looking for like,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.160
<v P 07>oh, I know that I owe, in this case, 830.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.180
<v P 07>I'm looking for a way to maybe. Okay, well,

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.060
<v P 07>let's. Let's make a payment right now. I

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:10.420
<v P 07>don't see that. So maybe I look, I'm looking

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.060
<v P 07>for that.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:19.020
<v P 07>Yeah. Or maybe just like, because of how

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.220
<v P 07>much I owe. I'm looking for maybe just like

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.380
<v P 07>a button or something just to let me know,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.930
<v P 07>like, hey, how can I maybe. How can we work

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:31.610
<v P 07>something out so that I can continue to make

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:36.170
<v P 07>these payments at a more maybe tailored approach?

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.370
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so you'd want something to potentially

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.050
<v Moderator - Emily>work with you to make the payments and also

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.290
<v Moderator - Emily>something to make the payments.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:48.570
<v P 07>Yeah, I know that. I know. I don't understand

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:52.090
<v P 07>the previous option that they had some sort

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.050
<v P 07>of like, you know, contact us and we'll work

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.050
<v P 07>something out or something along those lines.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:23:59.650
<v P 07>But I don't know, I'm thinking maybe kind

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.650
<v P 07>of like. Kind of like with other apps like

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.090
<v P 07>flora now or PayPal, where you can just automatically

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.330
<v P 07>just opt in into maybe a way to consult to

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.810
<v P 07>maybe break those payments apart or make

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.570
<v P 07>them more doable.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.930
<v P 07>Yeah, I'm kind of looking for that maybe

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:20.290
<v P 07>option here.

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:23.010
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. Yeah, that makes sense. So

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.090
<v Moderator - Emily>noting that you have stated those things

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.890
<v Moderator - Emily>that you want that are not here, and if this

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.770
<v Moderator - Emily>were built in real life, as is, without the

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:34.170
<v Moderator - Emily>payment options and without the communication

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:36.410
<v Moderator - Emily>about how. How they could.

00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:38.690
<v Moderator - Emily>They could work with you, how likely would

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:40.410
<v Moderator - Emily>you be to use it as is?

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:44.610
<v P 07>I would. I would likely very. I would. I

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:45.370
<v P 07>would use it.

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:49.650
<v P 07>I think maybe. I think maybe it's very. It's

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:53.440
<v P 07>very clean, it's very informative. It provides

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.680
<v P 07>me everything about, like, you know, the

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.840
<v P 07>payments that I've made and late be that

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.800
<v P 07>sort of nature. So I think with that in mind.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.040
<v P 07>Yeah, it would def. I would see myself adding

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.560
<v P 07>it to my. Well, I guess maybe being more

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:14.040
<v P 07>comfortable seeing this on my phone and engaging

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:16.080
<v P 07>with it with making payments or having that

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.840
<v P 07>type of fund.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.470
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And I'm gonna.

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.430
<v Moderator - Emily>So we're gonna get back. Get back to the

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.270
<v Moderator - Emily>payments in just a moment. But let me have

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:26.750
<v Moderator - Emily>you go one screen back to the debts page.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.190
<v Moderator - Emily>There's one other question I had. Yeah.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:31.710
<v Moderator - Emily>So if you. We're gonna pretend that there

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:36.550
<v Moderator - Emily>is a new debt that, that you have incurred

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.990
<v Moderator - Emily>in this. In this pretend situation, how would

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:41.270
<v Moderator - Emily>you expect to be notified. Obviously you

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.390
<v Moderator - Emily>would. I know you would get the, the debt

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:43.870
<v Moderator - Emily>letter.

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:46.830
<v Moderator - Emily>But in terms of the, the app, how might you

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.950
<v Moderator - Emily>expect to know that information is in here?

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:56.790
<v P 07>Yeah, I think if I haven't got the letter,

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.910
<v P 07>but I know that I owe something, then probably

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:02.870
<v P 07>I would go here again under payments and

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:06.150
<v P 07>see if. Maybe try refreshing the page and

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:10.150
<v P 07>see if it's there or if it's not there just

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:14.270
<v P 07>yet, then probably I'll just go to the home

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.680
<v P 07>page, maybe in the bottom left and I guess

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.240
<v P 07>I can wait until I get some kind of push

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.600
<v P 07>notification or some kind of internal notification

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.400
<v P 07>letting me know that where it's going to

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:29.040
<v P 07>be posted or when it's posted.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.160
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:34.240
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, let me have you tap on the payments

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:37.880
<v Moderator - Emily>section. I'm going to have you. And scroll

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.600
<v Moderator - Emily>all the way down. We're going to get to a

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.130
<v Moderator - Emily>little hidden section, the blank gray area

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.650
<v Moderator - Emily>below copays. Go ahead and tap that.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.770
<v P 07>Copays or the blank.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.290
<v Moderator - Emily>The. The. The blank area that's below the

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.410
<v Moderator - Emily>co pays. Yeah, there.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.610
<v Moderator - Emily>Perfect. Okay. And let me have you tap into

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.170
<v Moderator - Emily>the overpayment debt section again.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.250
<v Moderator - Emily>All right, so again we're going to look at

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:07.130
<v Moderator - Emily>this very top one, the housing. We're going

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:10.450
<v Moderator - Emily>to pretend, pretend that since we, we've

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:14.370
<v Moderator - Emily>talked about looking to, to get help in terms

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:19.050
<v Moderator - Emily>of making different payment structures. What

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.210
<v Moderator - Emily>would you want to do if you were looking

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:25.170
<v Moderator - Emily>to make a different payment plan or something

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.370
<v Moderator - Emily>for this, for this top on this debt for housing?

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.890
<v P 07>Yeah, I think maybe. I think if I'm looking

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.990
<v P 07>for maybe some kind of, maybe different option

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.750
<v P 07>or maybe a more tailored option and I would

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.110
<v P 07>click on, or tap on, resolve that and see

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.990
<v P 07>if maybe they could provide me with some

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:49.830
<v P 07>options where we could have, you know, mutual

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.110
<v P 07>benefit or understanding.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:53.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yeah, you can go ahead and do that.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Since you mentioned it.

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:04.200
<v P 07>Okay. Yeah. So, so yeah, I like this. Like

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.440
<v P 07>how like I can either pay online or other

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.120
<v P 07>ways to pay. I think maybe I'd be inclined

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.280
<v P 07>to right away click on other ways to pay

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.680
<v P 07>just so maybe you can give me like no more

00:28:16.759 --> 00:28:20.200
<v P 07>options as to tackling this step.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.200
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Yeah, yeah. If you want to go and tap

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.000
<v Moderator - Emily>through that. Some of these are actually

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.360
<v Moderator - Emily>linked in the prototype here.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:27.650
<v P 07>Okay.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.690
<v P 07>Okay. So pay by phone, pay by mail.

00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Moderator - Emily>Information here. Would there be something

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.010
<v Moderator - Emily>else you might be looking for?

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.730
<v P 07>Yeah, I think maybe pay by mail. I think,

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.470
<v P 07>I think, I imagine that. I thought that.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.510
<v P 07>I thought that I would be getting maybe in

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.310
<v P 07>my mind I thought that maybe there'd be other

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:03.750
<v P 07>options where maybe I can, they can Help

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.670
<v P 07>me with just like you know, making these

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:10.710
<v P 07>payments much more durable. But instead I

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.790
<v P 07>got that what if I can't pay online? Then

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.550
<v P 07>I can either pay that outstanding balance

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:18.040
<v P 07>either on the phone or by mail. So I think

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:20.160
<v P 07>my mind was just thinking about something

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.640
<v P 07>else.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.320
<v Moderator - Emily>But yeah, okay, let me go ahead and tap close

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.280
<v Moderator - Emily>there and yeah.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.600
<v Moderator - Emily>Thoughts on what, what would you be, what

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.600
<v Moderator - Emily>would you expect to find under the, the request

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.320
<v Moderator - Emily>help button?

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:42.480
<v P 07>Request help. I think, I think initially

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.370
<v P 07>I thought that maybe initially I thought

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.370
<v P 07>that by tapping on request help that's when

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.650
<v P 07>I would anticipate to maybe get a phone number

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.130
<v P 07>or something to contact them. That's what

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.570
<v P 07>I initially thought but now that I see that

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:59.890
<v P 07>other ways to pay is going down that phone

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.570
<v P 07>number then I imagine request for help now

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:07.850
<v P 07>should be I hope ways that maybe I could

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.900
<v P 07>make these payments much more durable for

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:12.180
<v P 07>me.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:13.180
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.620
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, you can, you can go ahead and tap request

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.140
<v Moderator - Emily>help and just see how that lines up with

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.220
<v Moderator - Emily>what you're expecting.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.660
<v P 07>Yeah, yeah. This is exactly what I was, I

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:26.900
<v P 07>was looking for initially. Yeah. So I think,

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:31.540
<v P 07>I think right away I would tap on request

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.030
<v P 07>a payment plan just to see know what options.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:42.230
<v P 07>So. So yeah, I think it gave me just like

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:45.550
<v P 07>no general information. I think knowing me

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.190
<v P 07>either like you know, I will try going online

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:52.830
<v P 07>and see if I could work something out obviously

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:58.190
<v P 07>to ask va otherwise if I find that tricky

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:02.050
<v P 07>or cumbersome then maybe I'll just give them

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:06.810
<v P 07>a call directly and before, before I proceed

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.850
<v P 07>with that I'll probably also click on tap

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:15.450
<v P 07>on request deadly and see again, you know

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:18.250
<v P 07>what I can do. And I think, I think maybe

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.490
<v P 07>because it starts to request for dead help,

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.370
<v P 07>I might be inclined to actually tap on that

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:29.300
<v P 07>and see if I fit that requirement when it

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.700
<v P 07>comes to looking at the paperwork and see

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.500
<v P 07>if I'm eligible for any further help or relief.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:36.100
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.180
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, you can go ahead and tap on the, the

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.380
<v Moderator - Emily>the debt relief one and see if, if this page

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.140
<v Moderator - Emily>looks like it would be, it would be helpful

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.140
<v Moderator - Emily>from what we have. And obviously I'm not

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.420
<v Moderator - Emily>going to have you read everything but just

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.580
<v Moderator - Emily>a quick skim if this would be helpful for

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.070
<v Moderator - Emily>you if you, if you were gr.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:58.630
<v P 07>Yeah, I think if anything it looks, it looks

00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.310
<v P 07>very promising.

00:32:04.910 --> 00:32:10.910
<v P 07>Yeah, I think if anything request. I like

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:13.150
<v P 07>how it, it kind of, it gives you by the way

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:17.710
<v P 07>the step by step as like know what, what

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:19.230
<v P 07>information they're pro. They're going to

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.950
<v P 07>need and the timeline, whatever the timeline

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:26.450
<v P 07>for just the process of step by step. I do

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.690
<v P 07>like how like they mentioned how long it'll

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.530
<v P 07>probably Take. So I really do appreciate

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.650
<v P 07>that because you never know just like how

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.330
<v P 07>much time I need to carve out.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:39.250
<v P 07>I anticipate a baby. I thought that maybe

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.810
<v P 07>I would just, it would just take me 15, 20

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.450
<v P 07>minutes to submit it. But I do like how they

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:46.330
<v P 07>giving me the actual time frame, so that's

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.170
<v P 07>very helpful. And I do like how the start

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:53.810
<v P 07>request is mentioned at the top and bottom

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:57.890
<v P 07>and it's indicated in green. So I don't know,

00:32:57.890 --> 00:33:01.010
<v P 07>maybe just for me the green just makes me

00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.490
<v P 07>a bit more optimistic.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:06.090
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. Let me have you tap on. Done

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:10.410
<v Moderator - Emily>here in the upper left. Yep. And then.

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.210
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, I, I, if in case you, or let's say you

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:18.130
<v Moderator - Emily>believe that you don't actually owe this

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Moderator - Emily>money, this before particular debt for housing,

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:22.780
<v Moderator - Emily>would it be clear what you, what your next

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.460
<v Moderator - Emily>steps would be? If you don't believe you,

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.220
<v Moderator - Emily>you owe this bill. I'm sorry, this, this

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:27.620
<v Moderator - Emily>debt.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:29.860
<v P 07>Yeah. Yeah.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:33.940
<v P 07>So, yeah. So if I feel that maybe this was

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:38.220
<v P 07>posted by error or maybe the debt that I

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.860
<v P 07>owe is higher than what I anticipated or

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.580
<v P 07>if there's maybe some sort of discrepancy,

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.780
<v P 07>then yeah, I would click on tap on dissolve

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.340
<v P 07>debt. Then I think it would tap on request

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:56.340
<v P 07>help. And then I think I saw an option. Yeah

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:56.660
<v P 07>here.

00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:00.580
<v P 07>So I would click on dispute this debt and

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.500
<v P 07>yeah, I would tap on that start your debt

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.060
<v P 07>dispute.

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.420
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great, we'll have you close this one.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.220
<v Moderator - Emily>So overall, how I know you said when you

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.290
<v Moderator - Emily>have received the debt letters in person,

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.000
<v Moderator - Emily>person, there really wasn't any communication

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.840
<v Moderator - Emily>in terms of any help you might be able to

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.400
<v Moderator - Emily>request. Overall, how, how have you become

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.720
<v Moderator - Emily>aware that it is possible to, to request

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.479
<v Moderator - Emily>help from VA or any other resources in that,

00:34:32.479 --> 00:34:33.240
<v Moderator - Emily>in that sense?

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.120
<v P 07>Oh, me personally, I, well I think, I think

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.160
<v P 07>for me personally maybe there's something

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.240
<v P 07>else going online and if you do want to come

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.970
<v P 07>up with Google search. But I think maybe

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:48.850
<v P 07>just for me, maybe, I know I haven't, you

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.090
<v P 07>know, had the time or I really don't know

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:58.970
<v P 07>how maybe time consuming that might be or

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.370
<v P 07>if it's even worth exploring. So I don't

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:04.490
<v P 07>know, maybe that's why I haven't tackled

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.530
<v P 07>that or make that approach.

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:12.330
<v P 07>But maybe just seeing the options here like

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.450
<v P 07>you know, on this, on this screen, on my

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:17.050
<v P 07>phone, I don't know, maybe just holding in

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:18.730
<v P 07>my hands, it kind of gives me a sense of

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:22.050
<v P 07>just like it's not, it's, it's, it could

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.770
<v P 07>be maybe easier and maybe I should have done

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:25.850
<v P 07>this maybe a while back.

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.250
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so you, it sounds like you, you would,

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.250
<v Moderator - Emily>you would Want more communication just to

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.330
<v Moderator - Emily>just get like laying out options.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:35.560
<v P 07>Yeah.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.480
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then we're going to pretend

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.840
<v Moderator - Emily>that you are ready to make a payment on this

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.800
<v Moderator - Emily>particular debt.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.360
<v Moderator - Emily>On this particular debt for the housing.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Walk me through how you might. And again,

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.360
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm not going to have you enter in any payment

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.600
<v Moderator - Emily>information, I promise. But walk me through

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:55.720
<v Moderator - Emily>what your steps would be if you are ready

00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.080
<v Moderator - Emily>to make a payment through here.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.080
<v P 07>Yeah.

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:03.230
<v P 07>Want to make a payment? I'll probably click

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:09.190
<v P 07>on Resolve debt. And then because, yeah,

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:13.870
<v P 07>probably how seamless this experience has

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.150
<v P 07>been. Then I probably click on Pay Online.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:21.310
<v P 07>I suppose it's asking me like, no, you don't

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:25.150
<v P 07>need to find YouTube. Okay. It provides me

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:29.090
<v P 07>with the details and then from there I would

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:33.450
<v P 07>have to click on or tap on pay on pay the

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:36.090
<v P 07>va.gov and I think from there it will just

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:39.610
<v P 07>take me to the other page where I could make

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:40.210
<v P 07>the payment.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.930
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, let me have you tap on that. And again,

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm not going to have you type in anything

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:45.090
<v Moderator - Emily>real.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:47.490
<v Moderator - Emily>So you will not make any payments, I promise.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.970
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, you can continue through that to.

00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:52.450
<v P 07>Click on tap on you.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:03.710
<v Moderator - Emily>So here we have the. The. And have you, have

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:05.190
<v Moderator - Emily>you encountered this site before?

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.870
<v P 07>Yes, I have.

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:07.190
<v Moderator - Emily>You have.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.150
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Okay, so I'm not going to have you

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:12.110
<v Moderator - Emily>read everything, but let me have you just

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:15.990
<v Moderator - Emily>skip right ahead and tap on the, the blue

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.110
<v Moderator - Emily>green button on the upper left. I think it

00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:20.430
<v Moderator - Emily>says page Pay online. It's very tiny. I can't

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.950
<v Moderator - Emily>actually tell.

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.230
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, online. There we go. Yeah.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:29.230
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then I just want you to scroll

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.830
<v Moderator - Emily>down to where you, you would be entering

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:33.630
<v Moderator - Emily>information. Not again, not going to have

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Moderator - Emily>you do that. But thoughts on the process

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:40.790
<v Moderator - Emily>of entering the required information here?

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:45.120
<v P 07>Yeah, I think, I think it's very.

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.560
<v P 07>Yeah, it's, it's very straightforward. I

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.280
<v P 07>do like how in the previous page they did

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.640
<v P 07>give me the. Just like as a, as a reminder,

00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:59.040
<v P 07>just the information that I should be entering.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.800
<v P 07>Just so it's. When I make a, when I make

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:04.640
<v P 07>a payment, it's tethered to that debt.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.480
<v P 07>But yeah, I think if anything it's, it's

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.480
<v P 07>very straightforward and very clear.

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:13.890
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And what would be your process

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:17.770
<v Moderator - Emily>if you were to. To be making a payment on

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.370
<v Moderator - Emily>your phone here in, in terms of getting the,

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.690
<v Moderator - Emily>the required numbers into this?

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:26.970
<v P 07>I think I, I think only my process would

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.290
<v P 07>normally be that I already have all of my

00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:34.530
<v P 07>personal information, just like on, on the,

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.480
<v P 07>on my iPhone or the Notes on the Notes app.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.560
<v P 07>So whenever I need to make a payment, I just

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.880
<v P 07>use that. And of course if they're asking

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.720
<v P 07>for any, maybe a reference code or any of

00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.480
<v P 07>that that can. Additional information, then

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.120
<v P 07>I take a note of that. But yeah, I think

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.000
<v P 07>everything more or less, it's the same.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:55.800
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.320
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. So you would be using your Notes app

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.240
<v Moderator - Emily>instead. Sorry. Or to copy the information.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:02.650
<v P 07>Yeah.

00:39:02.650 --> 00:39:05.090
<v P 07>So like no, anything. Anything that's personal.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.690
<v P 07>Mine, yeah, I would just use my Notes app.

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.450
<v P 07>That's why I would just kind of have my own

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.610
<v P 07>like no personal information, but my own

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.650
<v P 07>reminder.

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:14.850
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.210
<v Moderator - Emily>And talk to me about the experience of. Of

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.370
<v Moderator - Emily>having to use multiple apps to do this since

00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:22.250
<v Moderator - Emily>of course you mentioned using the Notes app

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.370
<v Moderator - Emily>and then having to open this page as well.

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.010
<v P 07>I think, I think where was kind of maybe

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.720
<v P 07>hoping for and initially was it when I was

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.720
<v P 07>making the payment online? I was kind of

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.360
<v P 07>hoping that all of the information it would

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:41.640
<v P 07>just be already tied to my personal information.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.960
<v P 07>So all I needed.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.600
<v P 07>I just thought all I needed to do was maybe

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:48.680
<v P 07>enter the amount and then maybe confirm my

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:51.320
<v P 07>bank and then make a payment and that'll

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:55.240
<v P 07>be the end of that. But yeah, that's where

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.600
<v P 07>I felt like, you know, the problems would

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.310
<v P 07>be just very seamless. But if I need to just

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.510
<v P 07>like know, populate here, this page again

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:05.590
<v P 07>with my information and all of that, it's.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.750
<v P 07>It's not a huge lift. I think maybe.

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:10.790
<v P 07>I think maybe for me it's just like, because

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.470
<v P 07>I'm familiar with the process, I'm comfortable

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.950
<v P 07>with it.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.430
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And if, if. And actually let

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:22.710
<v Moderator - Emily>me have you switch back to the Figma app.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.400
<v Moderator - Emily>Yep. And then go to go back. So we'll get

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:34.000
<v Moderator - Emily>there. Yep. So pretending that this feature

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.680
<v Moderator - Emily>is built in the app as is just like using

00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:39.760
<v Moderator - Emily>paying.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.640
<v Moderator - Emily>Just like we. We talked about. How, how likely

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.760
<v Moderator - Emily>would you be to use to. To use the app as

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.360
<v Moderator - Emily>is here?

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.200
<v P 07>If I would use the app as is.

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:54.780
<v P 07>Yeah. I think with it, with the payment and

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.700
<v P 07>having to type in that thing and then going

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.500
<v P 07>over to the other gov page and confirmation.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:04.460
<v P 07>Yeah, I would still. I would still use it.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.300
<v P 07>I think for me, even though I kind of want

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.660
<v P 07>that seamless portion.

00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.380
<v P 07>I think maybe for me mentally, because I'm

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.620
<v P 07>seeing the official. The official gov page,

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.950
<v P 07>it gives me that. It probably gives me a

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:20.630
<v P 07>much more sense of confidence that they're

00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:24.430
<v P 07>receiving my payment as opposed to if I maybe

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.750
<v P 07>make the payment here and if whatever reason

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.750
<v P 07>doesn't error. Now I don't know if my payment's

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:34.030
<v P 07>in the limbo or if they got it or not. So

00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:36.070
<v P 07>maybe just doing it on the government page

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.550
<v P 07>gives me a much more sense of like, security

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.470
<v P 07>and confidence.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.030
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, so would you actually rather have that

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:48.280
<v Moderator - Emily>payment in the official Gov page as opposed

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.200
<v Moderator - Emily>to within the app?

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:54.600
<v P 07>I think. I think. I think for me, I would

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.240
<v P 07>still prefer to have it on the app. Personally,

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:02.520
<v P 07>I would like to have an app, but whatever

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.360
<v P 07>reason, that's not possible and I just need

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.080
<v P 07>to use the link.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:08.320
<v P 07>I'm perfectly fine with that.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.280
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And then compare for me this

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.840
<v Moderator - Emily>version here, which we have the payment through

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.600
<v Moderator - Emily>the pay.vi.gov versus the version that we

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.080
<v Moderator - Emily>looked at before that did not have any payment

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Moderator - Emily>options. Talk to me about which one you might

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Moderator - Emily>prefer and why.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.560
<v P 07>I would definitely prefer this option, the

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.120
<v P 07>one that I'm looking at right now.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.880
<v P 07>I love how. Excuse me. I like how in the

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.240
<v P 07>review details, again, it just gives me a

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:43.030
<v P 07>quick sign to signal where my debt is and

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.430
<v P 07>any of my payment history in that regard.

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:49.310
<v P 07>But I do like how it has a separate option,

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:52.790
<v P 07>so resolve debt. And it helped.

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:54.470
<v P 07>And it gives me a sense of just like, oh,

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:56.430
<v P 07>that. I don't know, maybe because I like

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:59.270
<v P 07>the word resolve debt or that phrase. It

00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:02.670
<v P 07>gives maybe a sense of maybe comfort that

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:06.470
<v P 07>maybe like. No, they're looking out for me

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.830
<v P 07>to try to like, you know, help tackle this

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.630
<v P 07>together.

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:12.350
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, I like that.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.750
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. And then any other thoughts regarding

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.630
<v Moderator - Emily>the screen over any of the screens we've

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:25.390
<v Moderator - Emily>looked at so far. Any. Any labels or the

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.670
<v Moderator - Emily>sections or pages are labeled. Anything that

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:28.190
<v Moderator - Emily>might be.

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:30.670
<v Moderator - Emily>That might make things more clear for you?

00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:36.200
<v P 07>I think. I think maybe, you know, I think

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.320
<v P 07>it's. I. I like it. I like how, like, you

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.280
<v P 07>know, for example, here, pay a request help

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.400
<v P 07>by May 1, 2025.

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.360
<v P 07>I like how it's in bold letters just to remind

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.920
<v P 07>me. I also like, know the, The. The colors

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.720
<v P 07>of it. Like, things are very simple and plain,

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.680
<v P 07>so I'm not getting like, you know, bombarded

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:59.520
<v P 07>with too many bells and whistles, which is

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.200
<v P 07>a lot of. And yeah, so I think it's.

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:03.830
<v P 07>It's very clean. And like I said before,

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:08.990
<v P 07>I do like the resolve that option. And yeah,

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.710
<v P 07>maybe. Kind of was hoping that maybe this

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:11.390
<v P 07>off. That would.

00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:13.350
<v P 07>Would also be at the bottom of these other

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:15.870
<v P 07>two debts. But. But yeah, I. I really like

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:18.790
<v P 07>the aesthetic. It's very concise and clear.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.390
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:24.150
<v Moderator - Emily>And then comp. If. If you're able, I'd love

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:27.630
<v Moderator - Emily>to hear your thoughts on how this. What you're

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.900
<v Moderator - Emily>seeing here would compare compared to anything

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.180
<v Moderator - Emily>you're seeing on va.gov on. On.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:37.260
<v Moderator - Emily>On the website in terms of any. Any overpayment

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Moderator - Emily>debts. And just in terms of the experience

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.140
<v Moderator - Emily>or things that have been like how, how clear

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:42.820
<v Moderator - Emily>things are.

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:46.100
<v P 07>Yeah. I think maybe.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.500
<v P 07>I think now that. No, I think about like,

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:52.900
<v P 07>no doing it on my laptop and then doing it

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.380
<v P 07>here. I like how, like I said, I like how

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:58.740
<v P 07>very clean it is. Very straight to the point.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.840
<v P 07>Yeah, I think it's just like not having it

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:05.400
<v P 07>on my phone. It's. I think for me it's just.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.160
<v P 07>It's extremely aesthetically pleasing because

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:11.320
<v P 07>I know like on like a laptop, maybe I could

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.320
<v P 07>get distracted out or, or maybe I put too

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.000
<v P 07>many. Too much information on the page.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.600
<v P 07>And I think here on, on my phone, on this

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.250
<v P 07>app, it just gives me the, the correct amount

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.970
<v P 07>of information that I need without being

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:30.610
<v P 07>overwhelmed by so many options.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.810
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. Too many options. All right, you got

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:36.210
<v Moderator - Emily>it. Let me have you tap on the, the payment

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.250
<v Moderator - Emily>section again.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.890
<v Moderator - Emily>One more small section I want to go through

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:44.730
<v Moderator - Emily>before, before we wrap up in regards to the

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Moderator - Emily>CO pays. Let me have you tap into that.

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.650
<v Moderator - Emily>And then thoughts on, you know, similar question

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.450
<v Moderator - Emily>as I had asked with the overpayments. But

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:56.340
<v Moderator - Emily>thoughts thoughts on the clarity in terms

00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.500
<v Moderator - Emily>of bills here, how much you owe for co pays

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.740
<v Moderator - Emily>in this pretend situation.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:08.220
<v P 07>Yeah. So I think so far it's more or less

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:12.860
<v P 07>the same information, the overview. So I

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:17.300
<v P 07>do like how it. It informs me when my payment

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.380
<v P 07>is due or when I should reach out in case

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.040
<v P 07>I need any help. I like how.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.120
<v P 07>Yes, I like. I. I think what was missing

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.720
<v P 07>maybe in the previous page with the payments

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:35.200
<v P 07>was this information that contact the Department

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.120
<v P 07>of Treasury and here's the phone number.

00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.800
<v P 07>So I do, I do appreciate that. Just like

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:44.480
<v P 07>that contact information. And I think your

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:44.800
<v P 07>co.

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.960
<v P 07>Your CO pay bills for the past six months.

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.880
<v P 07>That's informative. I think, I think that

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.760
<v P 07>gives maybe a sense of comfort for me because

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.240
<v P 07>at least I know that the amount, the amount

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.120
<v P 07>balance that I owe is up to date and not

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.520
<v P 07>something that I just let there. Let it just

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.080
<v P 07>fester for on and on.

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.080
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, good.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.840
<v Moderator - Emily>And let me tap into the top one, the James

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.720
<v Moderator - Emily>A. Haley Hospital Hospital in Tampa to look

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.840
<v Moderator - Emily>at the information here and see what information

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.240
<v Moderator - Emily>would be important to you if you, if you

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.880
<v Moderator - Emily>had received or if you, you were looking

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.080
<v Moderator - Emily>at this particular bill.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.480
<v P 07>Yeah, I think it's the amount I'm giving

00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:37.400
<v P 07>it. It's. It's standard. I think maybe.

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:41.520
<v P 07>I think I might be fine to be go to maybe

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:43.880
<v P 07>current statement and maybe see just like

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:49.120
<v P 07>the actual maybe paperwork of it all. But

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.920
<v P 07>yeah, I obviously see the option to pay bill

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.720
<v P 07>right away. So I think maybe I'm always on.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.480
<v P 07>On Top of my co pays this second. Very straightforward.

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:05.800
<v P 07>So yeah, I do like that option.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.480
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, great. And since you mentioned the

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.960
<v Moderator - Emily>statements, what would you be looking for

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.320
<v Moderator - Emily>with the statements? How. How are you using

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:13.680
<v Moderator - Emily>them?

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.880
<v P 07>I think for me just like my statements might

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.760
<v P 07>be just like if there's as a reminder maybe

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.760
<v P 07>what kind of treatment or maybe service that

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.560
<v P 07>I got. So instead of just seeing here that

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:31.970
<v P 07>well, you owe $50 and that's that I would

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:33.730
<v P 07>like to like, you know, just as a reminder

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:36.290
<v P 07>for myself, see, well why do I owe that much?

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:38.770
<v P 07>And maybe just see the statement and maybe

00:48:38.770 --> 00:48:42.090
<v P 07>say, oh, it was maybe for X or Y service.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:46.170
<v P 07>And so I think for me it just. That reminds

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:48.330
<v P 07>me of like all the context behind that opinion.

00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:52.290
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, got it. And let me have you look at

00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Moderator - Emily>a statement that just see like how. How you

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:56.770
<v Moderator - Emily>would be. I know said you would. You would

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:58.740
<v Moderator - Emily>remember review it to make.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:01.180
<v Moderator - Emily>To see what is on there. Is there anything

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.980
<v Moderator - Emily>else you would do with the statements from

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:03.460
<v Moderator - Emily>the phone?

00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:09.740
<v P 07>No, I think if anything. No, I, I think,

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.740
<v P 07>I think for me it would just be just that.

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:18.060
<v P 07>I think, I think because I know I would still

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.700
<v P 07>be inclined to be here to pay it.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.820
<v P 07>To pay it online, but I think for me my peace

00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.030
<v P 07>of mind is maybe just looking at it than

00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:30.670
<v P 07>just knowing what the context of the bill

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.030
<v P 07>is.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, you're just looking at them. Got it.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.710
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay, I'm gonna have you tap done there please.

00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:40.470
<v Moderator - Emily>And let's pretend that you are ready to make

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:41.190
<v Moderator - Emily>a payment.

00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:45.310
<v Moderator - Emily>You can walk me through how you would be

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Moderator - Emily>making a payment for this particular one.

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:51.480
<v P 07>Yeah, so I've got the options pay bill. So

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.280
<v P 07>we'll click on that and then. Yeah, probably.

00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.880
<v P 07>Probably use it.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:00.600
<v P 07>So seamless. I'll go on pay.gov so I would

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.760
<v P 07>like tap on that and go from there.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.720
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And let me have you go. Go through

00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:08.400
<v Moderator - Emily>that as well.

00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:17.800
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And just scroll down. I know there's

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.900
<v Moderator - Emily>a lot to read, so I don't want to have you.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:23.020
<v Moderator - Emily>And tap on, continue to the form again. Not

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:24.660
<v Moderator - Emily>going to have you enter in any real information

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:28.180
<v Moderator - Emily>and then scroll down a little bit.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.140
<v Moderator - Emily>So. Yeah. Thoughts on how you would get the.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.700
<v Moderator - Emily>The. The account number that you would need

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.100
<v Moderator - Emily>into.

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:37.460
<v Moderator - Emily>Into this page?

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.940
<v P 07>Yeah, I think here. I think here either I

00:50:42.940 --> 00:50:46.400
<v P 07>would check maybe my. My Notes app and see

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:52.560
<v P 07>if I have that information or if the information

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:55.080
<v P 07>that I have is the one that they're asking

00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:59.280
<v P 07>for in that regard or otherwise just to be

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:05.080
<v P 07>on the safe side and not. And avoid any discrepancies

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.360
<v P 07>or errors, then I would definitely just tap

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.440
<v P 07>on whether I Find my VA account number just

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.440
<v P 07>to be in the safe side that I'm providing

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.360
<v P 07>the correct information.

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.060
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And when you mentioned again you're

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:20.580
<v Moderator - Emily>going to use the, the Notes app, is that

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.420
<v Moderator - Emily>like, are how. How are you getting the information

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.300
<v Moderator - Emily>into the Notes app? Is that something you're.

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.180
<v Moderator - Emily>You're copying or forwarding or how are you

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:29.260
<v Moderator - Emily>actually putting it in there?

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:32.300
<v P 07>Yeah, I'm just copy and pasting, so I see.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.380
<v P 07>So if there's something, if, like, if there's

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:38.940
<v P 07>information or anything that's given to me

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:43.110
<v P 07>that I deem I think it's personal or something

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.230
<v P 07>of account number or an ID or something,

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:49.030
<v P 07>then I just said that's I just copy and paste

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:53.630
<v P 07>it on my notes. It might be relevant in the

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.910
<v P 07>future.

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:57.030
<v Moderator - Emily>Got it. Okay, let me have you tap.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.950
<v Moderator - Emily>I'm sorry, not tab switch back to the Figma

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:00.310
<v Moderator - Emily>app.

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:07.450
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah. And then go to. Go back close. Yeah.

00:52:07.850 --> 00:52:08.330
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay.

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:11.450
<v Moderator - Emily>So thoughts on. On copying the account number

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:15.130
<v Moderator - Emily>from here into the paying website we just

00:52:15.130 --> 00:52:15.450
<v Moderator - Emily>had?

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:20.130
<v P 07>Yeah, yeah. So I think, so I think I would

00:52:20.130 --> 00:52:24.330
<v P 07>go. I would probably copy that account number

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:28.010
<v P 07>into my, into my Notes app.

00:52:28.410 --> 00:52:30.890
<v P 07>Again, just look at a very important number

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:34.360
<v P 07>that's going to be tethered to me. I do see

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.840
<v P 07>how like, it's not. I look at it, it's broken

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.320
<v P 07>into five parts. So maybe that might be the

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:43.200
<v P 07>information that they're looking for when

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.120
<v P 07>it comes to making that payment. But I would

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:48.680
<v P 07>still, I would still tap on or click on the.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:52.760
<v P 07>How to find my account number just to be.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:56.040
<v P 07>Just to double or triple check on my end.

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:00.000
<v P 07>Yeah. Just to avoid any, any errors or. Yeah.

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:02.240
<v Moderator - Emily>Oh, from the, the payment site, you would

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.920
<v Moderator - Emily>tap on how to find your account number.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.960
<v P 07>Yeah, I would still tap on it. Yeah. Just

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.360
<v P 07>so. Because I know that I am entering the

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.720
<v P 07>correct information and it's not just a coincidence

00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:14.160
<v P 07>that it's.

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.120
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. And then thoughts on if you ever might

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:24.530
<v Moderator - Emily>use the copy button here on this, on the

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.690
<v Moderator - Emily>app for the account number?

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:30.650
<v P 07>I think, I think I would. I think I would.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:31.930
<v P 07>I would definitely copy.

00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:35.450
<v P 07>But then I imagine that on the other page

00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:41.090
<v P 07>because I see five separate lines, then I

00:53:41.090 --> 00:53:43.570
<v P 07>don't know if they want me to like enter

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:48.890
<v P 07>it into just like line 1, 5, 3 4, line 21001.

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:51.420
<v P 07>So, so if I copy and paste it, I'm just going

00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.660
<v P 07>to be doing a lot of just like pasting and

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:55.220
<v P 07>deleting.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:59.380
<v Moderator - Emily>Yeah, got it. Okay, got it. Okay.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:01.820
<v Moderator - Emily>And we are just about out of time, so I believe

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.740
<v Moderator - Emily>those are all my questions. I'm going to

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:07.580
<v Moderator - Emily>check in with my colleagues here. If anybody

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:12.380
<v Moderator - Emily>has questions. Natasha, Michelle, Ashley,

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.260
<v Moderator - Emily>if anybody would like to unmute and ask,

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.380
<v Moderator - Emily>you may do so now.

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:24.610
<v Moderator - Emily>Okay. It looks like no one asked questions.

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:28.210
<v Moderator - Emily>Any other final thoughts you'd like to share

00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:32.530
<v Moderator - Emily>in regards to finances and all the designs

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:33.410
<v Moderator - Emily>we've been looking at?

00:54:34.690 --> 00:54:38.130
<v P 07>No, I think this is a really, really clean

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:42.770
<v P 07>design. There's a lot of comfort around the

00:54:42.770 --> 00:54:43.090
<v P 07>design.

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:46.270
<v P 07>So. So yeah, I do like, like I said before,

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:51.070
<v P 07>just like in the other payments page, nothing

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.990
<v P 07>about helping me with something like that.

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:55.550
<v P 07>I think, I think it's very well designed.

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:56.750
<v P 07>It's very crystal clear.

00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:58.910
<v Moderator - Emily>Great, thank you.

00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:00.710
