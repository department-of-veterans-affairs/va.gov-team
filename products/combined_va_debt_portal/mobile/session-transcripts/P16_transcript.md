Emily  
Ask you the same.

2  
0:00:02  
Emily  
Okay? So now that we are recording, confirm once again, are you okay? If I record the video and audio today.

3  
0:00:10  
P16  
That's fine. Do you need to turn on the my video?

4  
0:00:12  
Emily  
No, no, totally fine. You're fine as is and then as and also, are you okay? If I potentially share any clips with our Va partners.

5  
0:00:21  
P16  
That's fine!

6  
0:00:22  
Emily  
Okay, great. So first, st I'd love to know, and whatever level you are comfortable sharing a little bit about yourself as a veteran could be. What branch you served in when you were tired or separated?

7  
0:00:35  
P16  
I was in the [redacted] from 2011 to oh, oh, gosh! 2020.

8  
0:00:46  
P16  
But I joined in the reserves. So I'm I'm a i'm a reservist now.

9  
0:00:52  
Emily  
Got it? Got it? Okay? And then how about any experience you have had with the Va. Over the years.

10  
0:01:02  
P16  
Like in terms of what?

11  
0:01:04  
Emily  
In terms of let's say, have you visited any of their sites or like? What sort of epic and whatever level. You're comfortable. If you utilize any of their benefits. If you have healthcare things like that.

12  
0:01:17  
P16  
I do have healthcare with them. I do use them. I don't currently have medical insurance with my company since I have Va.

13  
0:01:28  
P16  
I've been to one in [redacted]

14  
0:01:35  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

15  
0:01:37  
Emily  
And then what sort of experience have you had with the Va website and or their mobile app.

16  
0:01:45  
P16  
I think it's it's kinda hard to navigate it sometimes, especially if I'm looking for things.

17  
0:01:54  
Emily  
Okay.

18  
0:01:55  
P16  
And a lot of times in terms of payment.

19  
0:02:00  
P16  
Either I would have to call

20  
0:02:04  
P16  
to make a payment, or I would have to submit a form instead of just paying online.

21  
0:02:10  
Emily  
Hmm.

22  
0:02:12  
P16  
Like it's not very modern.

23  
0:02:15  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, and is this is this the website? Or is this the mobile app the website?

24  
0:02:22  
P16  
Okay, yeah. Do you? Have you used the mobile app at all?

25  
0:02:27  
P16  
No.

26  
0:02:27  
Emily  
You have not okay. Got it? Have you? Have I downloaded it? Or just not? Not even downloaded.

27  
0:02:32  
P16  
Like the figma, or the.

28  
0:02:34  
Emily  
Oh, no! Sorry! The the Va mobile app.

29  
0:02:38  
P16  
I wasn't aware that there's a a mobile app.

30  
0:02:41  
Emily  
Oh, okay, there we go.

31  
0:02:43  
Emily  
Okay. So next, we're going to move to the financial portion of the discussion. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are comfortable. I have absolutely no information about you or finances with with Va. So.

32  
0:02:57  
Emily  
And can you tell me if you have had any experience with owing the Va. Money from such things as overpayment from benefits.

33  
0:03:08  
P16  
Yes, I have since I'm in the reserves, I sometimes go on active duty orders and

34  
0:03:20  
P16  
it. Basically they don't. They won't know until the reserves send that information to them, so I'd have to

35  
0:03:28  
P16  
pay them back what they have paid me since I was in orders.

36  
0:03:34  
Emily  
Oh, interesting. Okay.

37  
0:03:37  
Emily  
got it, got it. And do you recall? So when these these have happened, how exactly you were notified of the debt that you then had.

38  
0:03:47  
P16  
It's usually by mail.

39  
0:03:49  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

40  
0:03:52  
Emily  
And what sort of

41  
0:03:55  
Emily  
thoughts on the the communication that you were given you said it was. It was sent by mail. Yeah. Thoughts on on what you what you were told exactly from from these letters.

42  
0:04:07  
P16  
It. It states that I was in orders in

43  
0:04:11  
P16  
such and such dates, and that it tells me, since I'm in orders, I'm not entitled to that benefits during that

44  
0:04:20  
P16  
time period, so I would have to pay them back what they have paid me for those benefits.

45  
0:04:26  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. Got it. And was it did did it do these letters share like options for for how exactly you you could pay these back.

46  
0:04:38  
P16  
Either I pay via phone call or through online.

47  
0:04:45  
Emily  
Okay? And have you, have you done both of those online and phone calls?

48  
0:04:48  
Emily  
Yes, yes, thoughts on the experience of both of those both paying online and phone call.

49  
0:04:56  
P16  
The phone call.

50  
0:04:59  
P16  
It usually takes a while because I'm on waiting.

51  
0:05:04  
Emily  
Hmm.

52  
0:05:04  
P16  
Sometimes it could go up to an hour, just.

53  
0:05:07  
Emily  
No worries.

54  
0:05:08  
P16  
Person.

55  
0:05:09  
P16  
Online.

56  
0:05:12  
P16  
it's it's kind of like a Pdf form. It's not really an actual payment. They I would have to submit the form, and then

57  
0:05:23  
P16  
they will use that to pay. It's not like a direct deposit.

58  
0:05:29  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? So so yours, like, you're submitting this form back to Va, then.

59  
0:05:33  
P16  
Yes.

60  
0:05:34  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Understandable and how? What? What prompts you? For whenever you do make payments.

61  
0:05:46  
P16  
What do you mean? Prompts.

62  
0:05:48  
Emily  
Like. How, I guess. How do you? How do you know when you need to make payments? Is this something you're you're waiting on. Do you set yourself a schedule? What like? I'm wondering what what's your process.

63  
0:05:59  
P16  
So when I get a letter they usually give me a due date.

64  
0:06:03  
Emily  
Okay.

65  
0:06:04  
P16  
To pay to pay them back.

66  
0:06:06  
Emily  
Got it and then thoughts on how this whole process might be made easier.

67  
0:06:14  
P16  
I think they could. Redesigned the website.

68  
0:06:24  
P16  
Or I could be informed via email instead of mail.

69  
0:06:32  
P16  
And sometimes I get this mail like months later.

70  
0:06:37  
Emily  
Oh, got it. Okay?

71  
0:06:39  
Emily  
Okay, so you're you're you're only getting the mail. You're not being notified any other way. At this point.

72  
0:06:45  
P16  
No, not unless I check my Va. There's usually like a message portion in there. But I rarely go on that website.

73  
0:06:52  
Emily  
Okay. So okay. So if you logged in, you would see it, but otherwise no

74  
0:06:57  
Emily  
got it. Alright, and then so a different topic. Do you also, or do you have any experience with medical copays through Va.

75  
0:07:06  
P16  
Yes, it they have the same process. And I both used I bought.

76  
0:07:13  
P16  
I have both paid via phone call or via online.

77  
0:07:17  
Emily  
Okay? And is it? The same process for paying online as with the overpayment debts.

78  
0:07:22  
P16  
Yes, it's also the the form.

79  
0:07:24  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? And then same thing where you're you're receiving a letter, but nothing no email or anything.

80  
0:07:31  
P16  
Correct.

81  
0:07:31  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

82  
0:07:33  
Emily  
And it is all the same thing that you know, to pay when you get a letter.

83  
0:07:38  
P16  
Yes.

84  
0:07:38  
Emily  
Okay, okay?

85  
0:07:41  
Emily  
And then comparing those 2, both the overpayment debt and the medical copays in your mind, do they feel like different kind of financial issues? Or do you think they would belong in the same category in your mind like, how are you thinking about them?

86  
0:07:59  
P16  
I think it would be the same.

87  
0:08:01  
Emily  
Same. Okay.

88  
0:08:03  
Emily  
can you? Can you say a little more about that? Why, you why, you why, it feels the same to you.

89  
0:08:08  
P16  
Cause.

90  
0:08:11  
P16  
Well, actually, no.

91  
0:08:13  
P16  
because when I have to pay my benefits, I usually just tell them to deduct it to my future

92  
0:08:21  
P16  
benefits. Months.

93  
0:08:24  
Emily  
Okay.

94  
0:08:25  
P16  
And then, whereas for the copay, that's actually where I have to make a payment.

95  
0:08:30  
Emily  
I see. Okay. So with the benefit overpayments, it sounds so it's not. Just make sure I got it. You're you're given a choice as to whether or not you can outright pay or have it deducted. Is that right?

96  
0:08:41  
P16  
Yes, for for my benefits. I just tell them to not pay me the next month, or however how much I I owe.

97  
0:08:50  
P16  
But I'm also given the choice to just pay right away. But it wouldn't really make sense, since I'll get benefits the next month. So I just tell them to take it off.

98  
0:08:58  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay, and how are you communicating with them to tell them to to just reduce your benefit payments?

99  
0:09:05  
P16  
There's an option on there, or usually I think it's easier when I just call them.

100  
0:09:13  
P16  
And let them know, and then they do it for me for the form. I don't believe that there's an option for that, so usually for the benefits I would call them.

101  
0:09:23  
Emily  
Okay, so there, there's there's no other option right now, outside of calling to do that.

102  
0:09:30  
P16  
For that option. I I don't believe so. I don't remember but the copay I can easily pay online with that PDF form

105  
0:09:38  
Emily  
Got it. Got it? Okay, great let me go. Have you go ahead and share your screen and let me know if you need any help doing that.

106  
0:09:58  
Emily  
Alright perfect, and let me have you open up the figma app. Also.

107  
0:10:06  
Emily  
I'm gonna give you a login.

108  
0:10:08  
P16  
Is it this one.

109  
0:10:09  
Emily  
Yep.

110  
0:10:22  
Emily  
okay, perfect and if you wanna swipe my video off to the right, just so it's you get a little more screen test. There you go. Okay, so the email you're gonna be putting in is [redacted]

111  
0:10:36  
Emily  
[redacted]

112  
0:10:47  
Emily  
Emily

113  
0:10:54  
Emily  
okay. And I just need to get you a code. Give me just a moment, takes a moment to come through sometimes. There we go. The code is gonna be 2, 3, 7,

114  
0:11:09  
Emily  
3, 3, 5, 8.

115  
0:11:16  
Emily  
Alright. Continue with mobile app. And then I am going to. All right. Great. Now, I'm gonna put a link into the Zoom chat. So if you can go back to zoom for a moment to

116  
0:11:29  
Emily  
grab the chat link at the bottom.

117  
0:11:35  
Emily  
Yeah, the extra long URL you should be able to tap on it. It should open up. Figma.

118  
0:11:42  
Emily  
Yeah, perfect.

119  
0:11:44  
Emily  
Wait for that to load a bit.

120  
0:11:52  
Emily  
All right, perfect.

121  
0:11:54  
Emily  
Okay. And you can just tap just above where it says, tap and hold, we don't need that message there.

122  
0:12:01  
Emily  
Yeah, perfect. Okay, so so this is what the mobile app looks like, roughly. So pretending you have, you have opened up the mobile app. I'm not gonna have you tap on anything quite yet. So without tapping, where would you expect to go if you needed to find out information on? Let's say, the overpayments and the copays. Where would you expect to find that.

123  
0:12:27  
P16  
The claims.

124  
0:12:28  
Emily  
And the claims. Okay, got it

125  
0:12:30  
Emily  
any any other spot you might think to look.

126  
0:12:34  
P16  
Probably the messages.

127  
0:12:36  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, claims and messages. Okay?

128  
0:12:41  
Emily  
So where it actually is, is gonna be in the payments section on the very bottom. I know you didn't open that. So yeah. Thoughts on how that that might be more clear. How like what? What might change? Excuse me for you to think to to look there.

129  
0:13:00  
P16  
Since it's in the middle

130  
0:13:03  
P16  
and if I think if I am due to pay something.

131  
0:13:07  
P16  
maybe there should be like on the top like says, like on red, or something that I'm due. I'm due.

132  
0:13:15  
Emily  
For payment.

133  
0:13:18  
Emily  
Got it? Okay? So some sort of notification front got it makes sense, right?

134  
0:13:21  
Emily  
Any thoughts on the word payments that's that's used for that section. Would there be anything else that might make it more clear for you.

135  
0:13:31  
P16  
Payments for me is, I think, when I have to pay something.

136  
0:13:36  
Emily  
Okay.

137  
0:13:38  
P16  
So maybe if I'm due for something, it would have that red bubble kind of like when I get messages.

138  
0:13:44  
P16  
If there's no notification on the very top screen, that's probably my prompt to go into that icon.

139  
0:13:52  
Emily  
Okay, got it makes sense.

140  
0:13:54  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you go ahead and tap that payment section on the bottom right?

141  
0:14:01  
Emily  
Great. So to have you look at this at this page for a moment. Here thoughts on the information that is presented here. If you 1st came to this and opened up this payments, tab this payment section? What would be your thought on just how how things are structured.

142  
0:14:22  
P16  
I actually do like this.

143  
0:14:24  
Emily  
Okay.

144  
0:14:25  
P16  
Cause. It shows me the history, and also if I have anything to.

145  
0:14:31  
P16  
In one screen.

146  
0:14:34  
Emily  
Hmm, okay?

147  
0:14:35  
Emily  
And then. So now that you're seeing the the screen would thoughts on the term payment that is used for this? Does that? Does that still make sense? Is there another title that you think would make more sense to you?

148  
0:14:51  
P16  
Maybe. Hmm!

149  
0:14:55  
P16  
I think payments is fine. I was just more so looking for like debt or bills.

150  
0:15:01  
Emily  
Oh, okay, got it.

151  
0:15:05  
Emily  
So so you'd want. So instead of it saying payments at the very bottom, it would make more sense to you to say either debts or bills.

152  
0:15:13  
P16  
Yeah, our payments and other payments or debts, or something like that.

153  
0:15:18  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, got it?

154  
0:15:20  
Emily  
Okay? And then the little bit of information that is below both overpayment debts and copays where it says the amount thoughts on just from this screen, any different or other information that you might. That might be useful for you, just looking at things high, level.

155  
0:15:40  
P16  
What I would look for usually is

156  
0:15:44  
P16  
in what section I owe them something like medical, is it for school, or is it home loan, or something like that?

157  
0:15:51  
Emily  
Okay.

159  
0:15:55  
Emily  
Something.

160  
0:15:56  
P16  
Yeah.

161  
0:15:56  
Emily  
Okay. So under overpayment debts, you, you'd you'd want to know the detail of exactly what the debt is.

162  
0:16:01  
P16  
Yeah.

163  
0:16:01  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

164  
0:16:04  
Emily  
So we're going to look first.st Look at the overpayments, and you can see you can tap into this section. Have a look around, and just let me know how like what you believe from this in this scenario you currently owe, and just how clear or not clear things are.

165  
0:16:50  
P16  
if I click on this, does, it tells me the due date I'm supposed to pay it.

166  
0:16:56  
Emily  
So we can look at. So not all of them are connected, but just that top one where it says for housing that one is so if you want to tap into that. And just see, is this sharing? Is this showing everything that you would want to know for this debt?

167  
0:17:17  
P16  
Okay.

168  
0:17:22  
Emily  
What sorts of information would you be looking for.

169  
0:17:26  
P16  
When I'm supposed to pay it, and

170  
0:17:30  
P16  
and how will I pay it?

171  
0:17:34  
Emily  
Okay.

172  
0:17:37  
P16  
Second.

173  
0:17:38  
P16  
Okay.

174  
0:17:40  
P16  
yeah, I like that it also tells when the 1st and second letter was sent, I think they they usually do this already.

175  
0:17:54  
Emily  
And and how so, since you mentioned the the letters being sent, how would that be useful for you?

176  
0:18:00  
P16  
Because sometimes I miss a letter.

177  
0:18:03  
Emily  
Okay.

178  
0:18:04  
P16  
But it tells me. Oh, we submitted like months ago.

179  
0:18:09  
Emily  
Hmm.

180  
0:18:09  
P16  
And I or I probably just ignore it too.

181  
0:18:15  
P16  
But it doesn't. I'm not sure where I'm supposed to pay it from this page.

182  
0:18:22  
Emily  
Okay. So it's not clear about payment.

183  
0:18:26  
P16  
Oh, good, or where, where? I'm supposed to pay it is it, just informational.

184  
0:18:36  
Emily  
So that I'll I'll I'll turn that around to you. Yeah. What where? Where would you expect to find any sort of information on paying.

185  
0:18:45  
P16  
On the same page.

186  
0:18:47  
Emily  
Okay.

187  
0:18:48  
P16  
Or probably also on this screen.

188  
0:18:54  
P16  
But if I click on this, I would like an option of

189  
0:18:59  
P16  
a link where I'm supposed to pay, or a phone number or something.

190  
0:19:04  
Emily  
Oh, okay, either phone number or link to pay, got it? If if something were built like this that as as you say, you say, does not currently have anything about paying. How likely do you think it would be that you would use something like this where it would be just informational.

191  
0:19:23  
P16  
Since I have my phone all the time. It's good to have it.

192  
0:19:28  
P16  
But then it would also be a hassle, since I would have to actually go to the Va website.

193  
0:19:33  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

194  
0:19:34  
P16  
And their website right now, I don't think it's really phone friendly their interface. So I would have to actually use a PC.

195  
0:19:45  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, you'd have to be on a on a larger computer.

196  
0:19:49  
Emily  
Okay? And then going back to the to the letters that you mentioned like you said like, if by chance you had missed a letter, hadn't opened it, hadn't seen it, for whatever reason, what would you want to do here, let's say you saw one letter was sent. I don't remember the dates on June 16, th but hadn't actually seen it in your home. What would be your next step.

197  
0:20:14  
P16  
There, there's usually majority of the time. There's not really a fee that I have to pay.

198  
0:20:21  
P16  
They just kept sending me letters.

199  
0:20:23  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

200  
0:20:24  
P16  
So it wasn't really an issue for me. I would say but I I would say that

201  
0:20:32  
P16  
did mention here that I can request for help.

202  
0:20:35  
P16  
But there's also not an info regarding that on how I can request help to.

203  
0:20:41  
Emily  
Then.

204  
0:20:41  
P16  
Balance.

205  
0:20:43  
Emily  
Okay, where? Where? Where would you want to see that that info, on how to request help.

206  
0:20:49  
P16  
Probably the same page, or if there's a help, icon.

207  
0:20:54  
P16  
Like at the the very. Oh, there's 1 right here.

208  
0:20:56  
P16  
Okay, I guess.

209  
0:20:57  
P16  
Sort of.

210  
0:21:01  
P16  
Oh, okay.

211  
0:21:02  
Emily  
Yeah. Go ahead.

212  
0:21:04  
P16  
Sorry. Bye, yeah, I just didn't notice that.

213  
0:21:11  
Emily  
Would there be something that could make it more clear, since, as you said, you didn't notice it@firstst

214  
0:21:16  
P16  
Yeah.

215  
0:21:20  
Emily  
Would that would there be something that that might make that even more clear.

216  
0:21:25  
P16  
Probably on just on here.

217  
0:21:27  
Emily  
Okay.

218  
0:21:28  
P16  
Like a help link.

219  
0:21:30  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, so just right below.

220  
0:21:32  
P16  
Yeah.

221  
0:21:33  
Emily  
Information you're already reading.

222  
0:21:36  
Emily  
Okay? Got it? For the the debt letters at the bottom. Would you expect to be able to read the the letters here.

223  
0:21:47  
P16  
Yes, normally I can go to the letters if I'm on the site.

224  
0:21:51  
Emily  
Oh, okay, all right. So you've you've you've been able to read those letters when you're logged into va.gov.

225  
0:21:56  
P16  
Correct.

226  
0:21:57  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.

227  
0:22:02  
Emily  
would there be anything else here on this page that you would want or expect to be able to do.

228  
0:22:13  
P16  
Nothing that I can think of.

229  
0:22:15  
Emily  
Okay, and since we were talking about requesting help.

230  
0:22:20  
Emily  
Were you aware, that that was an option that that there that there that you could request help for debts like this.

231  
0:22:28  
P16  
Yes.

232  
0:22:29  
Emily  
You are okay. And do you do you recall how you originally learned about that.

233  
0:22:35  
P16  
I've never used it, but I know it's it's available.

234  
0:22:39  
Emily  
Okay.

235  
0:22:42  
Emily  
would you do you recall if that's listed in the letters that you received or you might have learned about it elsewhere.

236  
0:22:49  
P16  
I saw it online like it was an option when I'm paying.

237  
0:22:55  
Emily  
Oh, okay. So when you're logged into va.gov.

238  
0:22:58  
P16  
Yes.

239  
0:22:58  
Emily  
Okay, got it. Okay.

240  
0:23:01  
Emily  
Let me have you go back to the payments button on the lower. Right?

241  
0:23:07  
Emily  
Okay. Oh, sorry one tap once more. Okay, perfect. Yes, and then scroll all the way to the bottom of this screen.

242  
0:23:16  
Emily  
and then the the blank, light gray area at the bottom tap once into that

243  
0:23:22  
Emily  
perfect and then go back to overpayment debts.

244  
0:23:27  
Emily  
So we have a slightly different design. And again, we're going to be just focusing on this top. Actually, one question I forgot to ask. So I know we've been looking at just this top one, the debt for housing thoughts on the information that you have here on the other debts just at this high level? Would there be other things that you would want to know from this page regarding the other debts, like the books and supplies, etc.

245  
0:23:57  
P16  
Let's see.

246  
0:24:11  
P16  
I'm not sure why the

247  
0:24:14  
P16  
the books and supplies are here, since it's supposed to be an overpayment.

248  
0:24:22  
P16  
Or Oh, I paid it!

249  
0:24:27  
P16  
Oh, okay, because it cause it was an overpayment, for on my end or on them.

250  
0:24:36  
Emily  
Right? Yeah, yeah, that's that's in this scenario.

251  
0:24:39  
Emily  
Could could could something be be more clear about that?

252  
0:24:45  
P16  
I think it's fine, but maybe after a month it will go away.

253  
0:24:51  
Emily  
Okay, would you? Would there be any place on like on the phone that you would want to see any previous debts that had already been resolved.

254  
0:25:00  
P16  
I think the maybe the payment history.

255  
0:25:03  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, under history. Okay.

256  
0:25:05  
P16  
Because if it's on here it I would feel like I still owe them something.

257  
0:25:10  
Emily  
Okay, so all right. So these would be more active.

258  
0:25:14  
Emily  
Okay, makes sense.

259  
0:25:15  
P16  
But I think for a recent like July, I think it's fine, but for another, for August I think it should be automatically moved.

260  
0:25:25  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, makes sense.

261  
0:25:28  
Emily  
Okay.

262  
0:25:29  
Emily  
so again, we're going to go back to this, the housing debt, the top one. So we'll pretend that you're you're concerned. You might not have the money to pay this when you next need to what? From here, what might be your next steps in that scenario.

263  
0:25:52  
P16  
I would click on the resolve that probably.

264  
0:25:56  
Emily  
Yeah, you can. You can go go ahead and do that. And just yep.

265  
0:25:59  
P16  
Okay? And then I would choose request help.

266  
0:26:03  
Emily  
Okay, you can go ahead and tap on request help.

267  
0:26:12  
P16  
Go to Sba, and then either a call here or request that relief.

268  
0:26:23  
Emily  
Okay

269  
0:26:25  
Emily  
with with, when when would be instances where you would choose to call as opposed to you know following any directions under request Debt relief.

270  
0:26:39  
P16  
Let's see, I think it for me. It's easier if I just fill out something via form, so I would more likely to choose that that relief.

271  
0:26:49  
Emily  
Okay, got it

272  
0:26:50  
Emily  
and have you? I know you said you filled out forms for payment for do you fill those those out on your phone? Do you fill them out on a laptop or a desktop?

273  
0:27:00  
P16  
Laptop.

274  
0:27:01  
P16  
Okay? Got it? Yeah.

275  
0:27:02  
P16  
Stuff.

276  
0:27:03  
Emily  
Got it? Any any reason you choose that over? Filling it out on on your phone?

277  
0:27:08  
P16  
Usually the the phone

278  
0:27:12  
P16  
for me to talk to a person. It takes a while, and I think it's more convenient to just

279  
0:27:18  
P16  
and faster for me to just fill up the form.

280  
0:27:20  
Emily  
Okay. So for for filling out forms, and and would, would there be any reasons where you might fill out the form specifically on on your phone?

281  
0:27:33  
P16  
If the interface is probably easy, I could.

282  
0:27:37  
Emily  
Okay.

283  
0:27:38  
P16  
Yeah.

284  
0:27:40  
Emily  
And what? And you said, some forms have not been what would make them easier to fill out on the form

285  
0:27:46  
Emily  
phone.

286  
0:27:47  
P16  
Just a better layout.

287  
0:27:49  
Emily  
Okay, yeah, okay, and then, okay, so you've done that.

288  
0:27:59  
Emily  
let me have you. You can close this. Let me have you walk through. We're gonna pretend that you are ready to make a payment, and I promise I'm not going to have you enter in any actual information, no matter what page we get to walk me through, how you would want to do that, how? How, if you, if you're ready to make a payment now.

289  
0:28:20  
P16  
I'll go on the review details and resolve and then pay online.

290  
0:28:27  
Emily  
Okay.

291  
0:28:29  
P16  
And then click, probably click, the link.

292  
0:28:39  
Emily  
okay, you can, you can you can go ahead and do that. Again, i'm, not gonna have you enter in this just to to look at. Look at a couple of pages.

293  
0:28:49  
P16  
Okay.

294  
0:28:53  
Emily  
And have you? Yeah. Oh, you can. Yeah, you can go to. Oh, switch back to chrome.

295  
0:29:03  
Emily  
Yep, yeah. So this would be the page that you come to. I'm not. Gonna have you read through all this, have you? Is is this a site that you've been to before?

296  
0:29:13  
P16  
Yes!

297  
0:29:14  
Emily  
Yeah, okay, got it? So let me have you tap the the pay online. There's a button on the upper. Let? Yep. There we go perfect.

298  
0:29:23  
Emily  
and then scroll down about halfway

299  
0:29:26  
Emily  
and let me get to the section where there are the the blank fields to fill out again. Not going to have you actually type in anything but thoughts on

300  
0:29:37  
Emily  
finding that information that you would need to enter in

301  
0:29:41  
Emily  
what would be your steps for doing that.

302  
0:29:45  
P16  
So usually I have troubles finding pay number.

303  
0:29:50  
Emily  
Hmm.

304  
0:29:50  
P16  
Sometimes it's not on the letter. I would have to actually go to my Va

305  
0:29:56  
P16  
account to look for that.

306  
0:29:58  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So so you're right. So right now, you're both using the letters that you get and logging into your account.

307  
0:30:04  
P16  
Correct.

308  
0:30:05  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, let me have you switch back to Figma?

309  
0:30:15  
Emily  
Perfect.

310  
0:30:16  
Emily  
So thoughts on. So this was the last screen that you were on in our pretend mobile app thoughts on the information here.

311  
0:30:27  
P16  
I do like it. However, I think it would be easier if I can actually just use this app to pay.

312  
0:30:36  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

313  
0:30:37  
P16  
Actionable.

314  
0:30:39  
Emily  
if it were not possible. How like, what? What do you think would be your your process

315  
0:30:46  
Emily  
for filling out for for filling out the fields.

316  
0:30:49  
P16  
I would just go to the to the link.

317  
0:30:54  
P16  
and I guess you have this open and also the the link.

318  
0:31:00  
Emily  
Okay.

319  
0:31:01  
P16  
So I can copy like the file number and pay a number stuff like that.

320  
0:31:05  
Emily  
Oh, okay, okay. So so copy from here, and then bring them over to the paying site.

321  
0:31:09  
P16  
Yeah.

322  
0:31:10  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Thoughts on that experience of of how you think it might. It might go to to copy from here and then bring it over into the payment site.

323  
0:31:22  
P16  
If it could automatically generate, that would probably easier.

324  
0:31:27  
P16  
Like for the fields.

325  
0:31:29  
Emily  
Yeah. Once you click on the link.

326  
0:31:32  
P16  
Cause. It's not. It's not asking me to sign in. It's just

327  
0:31:36  
P16  
like it's kind of like a public form that I just submitted.

328  
0:31:42  
P16  
Yeah.

329  
0:31:42  
Emily  
Okay, alright, alright! So so you would. You would like it to? To to fill in this information.

330  
0:31:48  
P16  
Yeah.

331  
0:31:49  
Emily  
Okay? So if

332  
0:31:51  
Emily  
if things were built, as is the what you're seeing right now, where it's, it's not currently possible to automatically enter in. You would like you mentioned, you would have to copy from one from the app and bring it over to the payment site. How likely. Do you think it might be for you to use for use it as is.

333  
0:32:13  
P16  
I think it's more so just informational.

334  
0:32:16  
Emily  
Okay.

335  
0:32:19  
P16  
And it's easier access. But I would still probably use my desktop to make it easier.

336  
0:32:25  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, got it. Sorry. So you would. Would probably not use the payment section.

337  
0:32:30  
Emily  
Yeah.

338  
0:32:31  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

339  
0:32:31  
P16  
Just like to see.

340  
0:32:33  
P16  
Yeah.

341  
0:32:34  
Emily  
Okay? So then, the 1st version that we looked at that did not have a link to the payment site, thoughts on which of those 2 versions would be more useful for you.

342  
0:32:48  
P16  
I prefer the second one.

343  
0:32:50  
Emily  
Okay, the one, the one with the with the payment site.

344  
0:32:53  
P16  
Yeah.

345  
0:32:54  
Emily  
Okay, got it, can you? Can you say, why?

346  
0:32:57  
P16  
It still gives me the option to pay on my phone.

347  
0:33:01  
P16  
Even though I'm more likely to not use it.

348  
0:33:04  
Emily  
Okay, got it. So so you, you just want to have that option.

349  
0:33:09  
P16  
Yeah.

350  
0:33:10  
Emily  
Alright. Got it?

351  
0:33:12  
Emily  
Okay? Any other thoughts regarding

352  
0:33:18  
Emily  
regarding the information presented here? If you want to go back one screen the back on the upper left.

353  
0:33:24  
Emily  
Any other thoughts on how things are presented, if there's anything else you feel might be missing.

354  
0:34:01  
P16  
Maybe like the original debt

355  
0:34:08  
Emily  
Oh the the original amount?

356  
0:34:10  
P16  
Yeah, cause I see that there's a partial on here.

357  
0:34:14  
Emily  
Okay, you don't even want to know originally how much was Owed here.

358  
0:34:18  
P16  
Yeah.

359  
0:34:18  
Emily  
Okay. Where? Where? Might you expect to see that.

360  
0:34:26  
P16  
No, it could be at the on this stop.

361  
0:34:33  
P16  
On this main icon, but at the bottom.

362  
0:34:38  
Emily  
Sorry. Which which section.

363  
0:34:40  
P16  
Like the the current, square.

364  
0:34:46  
Emily  
Oh, the one that.

365  
0:34:47  
P16  
For housing.

366  
0:34:48  
Emily  
Alright. So so right right there, you'd want to see the total amount. Yeah.

367  
0:34:52  
P16  
At the bottom.

368  
0:34:54  
Emily  
Oh, okay, toward toward the bottom of that square.

369  
0:34:56  
P16  
Yeah.

370  
0:34:57  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Understandable.

371  
0:35:00  
Emily  
Okay. Any. Anything else that might be might be helpful for you from here.

372  
0:35:05  
P16  
I think that's it.

373  
0:35:06  
Emily  
Okay and thought, since I know you've you've gone to va.gov quite a bit for finances. Thoughts on how what we've been experiencing here compares to va.gov.

374  
0:35:23  
P16  
I do like that. There's a mobile option.

375  
0:35:27  
Emily  
Okay?

376  
0:35:29  
Emily  
What? What? Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

377  
0:35:31  
P16  
I just have my phone all the time. So.

378  
0:35:34  
Emily  
Okay.

379  
0:35:34  
P16  
And if it, if once I have

380  
0:35:38  
P16  
like a debt, it will give me like maybe that red bubble on that

381  
0:35:45  
P16  
on the icon of the app, so I know that I'm supposed to look in the app.

382  
0:35:50  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

383  
0:35:51  
P16  
Like a notification or something. Instead of waiting for the mail.

384  
0:35:55  
Emily  
Okay. So so you'd want some sort of notification on your phone instead.

385  
0:35:59  
P16  
Yeah.

386  
0:36:00  
Emily  
Okay. Makes sense. Alright. Any other differences you're noticing either you like or don't like between this and what you've experienced on the website.

387  
0:36:15  
P16  
Hmm!

388  
0:36:18  
P16  
Can I go back? Hold on.

389  
0:36:39  
P16  
Nothing that I can think of.

390  
0:36:41  
Emily  
Okay, got it. Let me have you tap again into payments on the lower right.

391  
0:36:47  
Emily  
all right. And now we're going to look at the co-pays side toward the bottom there.

392  
0:36:53  
Emily  
and so similar question as before, with the overpayments. Looking at this, what sort of information

393  
0:37:01  
Emily  
might you be looking for and like. How, what, what are your thoughts on how things are presented here.

394  
0:37:11  
P16  
Trying to pass next month?

395  
0:37:16  
P16  
It just gives me the past 6 months. Does it give me like the whole history, or do I have to go back to the payment history?

396  
0:37:24  
Emily  
Oh, as well. I'll turn that around. Is that where? Where might you expect to see that.

397  
0:37:30  
P16  
The history.

398  
0:37:31  
Emily  
History. Okay, you wanna go in history. Okay.

399  
0:37:34  
P16  
If it's if it's already paid.

400  
0:37:38  
Emily  
Oh, oh, to see so to see bills that you have already paid! You'd you'd want to find them.

401  
0:37:46  
P16  
On the history, not not on here.

402  
0:37:48  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? So you would you? So similar as the overpayments? You would not want to see bills that you've already paid here.

403  
0:37:54  
P16  
Yeah, yeah.

404  
0:37:55  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. Got it. Okay? And for that, we're just gonna look at the top on the James A. Haley hospital. What sort of information would be important to you for this particular bill.

405  
0:38:10  
P16  
From just looking at the screen.

406  
0:38:13  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah. You can scroll down.

407  
0:38:17  
Emily  
Oh, sorry if yeah. Yeah. I was. Gonna say, yes, you can tap into it. Yes.

408  
0:38:23  
P16  
Is the account number mine? Or the Va's.

409  
0:38:32  
Emily  
What would make it more clear what that is.

410  
0:38:38  
P16  
I mean, if I have to pay it, I think it should be a way to pay them.

411  
0:38:44  
P16  
Not sure what the account, or unless it's like an id for me.

412  
0:38:48  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. Wha what would make it more clear? So you knew what? That is exactly.

413  
0:38:54  
P16  
Like Va number, or like a member number.

414  
0:39:03  
Emily  
Okay.

415  
0:39:04  
Emily  
so so you'd want it. So in instead of saying account number you'd you'd want it labeled differently.

416  
0:39:12  
P16  
Yeah, cause it sounds like a bank.

417  
0:39:16  
Emily  
Got it.

418  
0:39:27  
P16  
Be Miss Balance. Okay.

419  
0:39:38  
Emily  
What other information might you be looking for.

420  
0:39:42  
P16  
How to pay the bill.

421  
0:39:43  
Emily  
Okay.

422  
0:39:46  
P16  
And and what what it, what it is for for lack of medication. And

423  
0:39:55  
P16  
okay, like, yeah, what care it was from.

424  
0:40:02  
Emily  
Okay any with what is here? Would there be anything different that you might want to know?

425  
0:40:15  
P16  
June

426  
0:40:19  
P16  
we see.

427  
0:40:32  
P16  
There are some, for like different dates on here.

428  
0:40:49  
Emily  
And is that not what you're expecting to? Is it? Say more about the different dates that you just referenced.

429  
0:40:56  
P16  
Usually cause they go by dates.

430  
0:41:00  
P16  
Instead of the clinic like this.

431  
0:41:03  
Emily  
Hmm. Oh, okay.

432  
0:41:04  
P16  
Then each.

433  
0:41:06  
P16  
It's like individualized. It's not

434  
0:41:12  
P16  
gathered in for for each clinic.

435  
0:41:16  
Emily  
Okay. So that so the way that you're you're currently receiving copays, it's it's not. It's not like this.

436  
0:41:23  
P16  
I I don't think so. It was just by date. And what copay that is.

437  
0:41:28  
Emily  
Oh, okay, okay.

438  
0:41:38  
Emily  
Would there be anything that could make it more clear, since since you referenced the grouping it by location.

439  
0:41:56  
P16  
I think this is okay, actually.

440  
0:41:58  
Emily  
Okay.

441  
0:41:59  
P16  
It's cause it looks cleaner. And then when I go here, it actually tells me the dates.

442  
0:42:08  
Emily  
Okay.

443  
0:42:12  
Emily  
anything else you might want to know in regards to the dates yeah, for this for this particular one.

444  
0:42:19  
P16  
If it's already paid.

445  
0:42:20  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

446  
0:42:24  
P16  
Let's see. Okay.

447  
0:42:29  
Emily  
How would you want to see it notified forever.

448  
0:42:32  
P16  
5

449  
0:42:34  
Emily  
Go ahead. Sorry.

450  
0:42:38  
P16  
I'm sorry. Hold on!

451  
0:42:40  
P16  
Say that one more time.

452  
0:42:45  
Emily  
Yeah, thoughts, on.

453  
0:42:46  
P16  
Time.

454  
0:42:47  
Emily  
Oh, there we go! Yeah. Thoughts on how it could be more clear because you mentioned you. You would want to see if something has not been paid. What are your thoughts on? How to make that more clear?

455  
0:42:59  
P16  
Probably, if it's highlighted, or like the the icon, the the warning icon. Next to this.

456  
0:43:08  
P16  
the ones that have not been paid compared?

457  
0:43:11  
P16  
No, this one payment received has that check icon from here.

458  
0:43:18  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

459  
0:43:20  
Emily  
Okay? So for for each each of those the the those listings you you want to know if it has been paid, or if it has not yet been paid.

460  
0:43:29  
P16  
Yeah.

461  
0:43:29  
Emily  
Okay. Got it alright. Type on pay. Oh, there we go now it's come back.

462  
0:43:37  
Emily  
Tap into yeah. Let's say, go back into here.

463  
0:43:41  
Emily  
Thoughts on yeah. Other other information you would. You would want to know here.

464  
0:43:49  
P16  
And

465  
0:44:08  
P16  
I guess so, since they're different dates.

466  
0:44:12  
P16  
I was wondering if the due dates would be different as well.

467  
0:44:17  
Emily  
Oh, okay. So for each of the each, each of the charges.

468  
0:44:21  
P16  
Yeah, cause there's 20 second, and then there's the 4.th But there's only one due date.

469  
0:44:26  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

470  
0:44:26  
P16  
So I don't know if they compiled they just made one due date for both.

471  
0:44:32  
Emily  
Hmm, is there, what could make that more clear as to when exactly things are due.

472  
0:44:39  
P16  
Probably next to the actual copay

473  
0:44:44  
P16  
do like, for like June 4, th due on something something.

474  
0:44:48  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? So for each one broken up like this, all right.

475  
0:44:56  
Emily  
And do you ever look at it could be in really any other financial aspect of your life. Do you ever look at statements that you receive.

476  
0:45:07  
P16  
No.

477  
0:45:08  
Emily  
Yeah, okay. Got it.

478  
0:45:10  
Emily  
Thoughts on if you might look at the statements here on this page.

479  
0:45:19  
Emily  
Or I guess, would you?

480  
0:45:24  
Emily  
would would you? Would you know how how those might be useful?

481  
0:45:29  
P16  
Yes, if I want to see like the overall

482  
0:45:36  
P16  
balance or account.

483  
0:45:44  
Emily  
Okay, do you think you might? I know you said, now, you're, not, you don't look at statements in other areas, would that be something you might look at here in this section.

484  
0:45:56  
P16  
Probably still not.

485  
0:45:57  
Emily  
No. Okay.

486  
0:45:58  
P16  
I. I may look at it from time to time, but I usually don't check my statements.

487  
0:46:03  
Emily  
Hmm, okay, got it.

488  
0:46:05  
Emily  
Okay. Let me have you scroll up toward the top. And even though I know you just said you probably wouldn't look at it. Let me have you tap on the go to current statement

489  
0:46:17  
Emily  
and let me know your thoughts on. If this is something you might you might find useful at all from within an app.

490  
0:46:27  
P16  
Yeah, it's just it's the same. It looks like the same letter I get when I owe them something.

491  
0:46:32  
Emily  
Okay.

492  
0:46:37  
Emily  
so know, knowing what it looks like. Do you think this might be something that that you would ever look at? If if it were in

493  
0:46:45  
Emily  
a section like this.

494  
0:46:48  
P16  
Yeah, I if I lost the letter or something like for this. Yeah.

495  
0:46:53  
Emily  
Okay, and then what what might you do with it? If you did? Let's say, lose lose a letter.

496  
0:47:01  
P16  
Just to verify that the info is correct.

497  
0:47:08  
Emily  
Okay? And might, there be anything else that that you would do outside of verification.

498  
0:47:18  
P16  
If I have to pay, I usually go here to look at the my number.

499  
0:47:25  
Emily  
Okay, the the number you would need to pay.

500  
0:47:28  
P16  
Yeah.

501  
0:47:29  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, so let me have you tap done there?

502  
0:47:37  
Emily  
Oh, sorry. At the the upper left. You can tap done.

503  
0:47:42  
Emily  
Yep, perfect. So we're gonna pretend that you see an error. Let's say one of the doctor appointments. You're sure you didn't actually attend what would be your next step, knowing that you have seen an error here.

504  
0:48:01  
P16  
I would go to the help button, and probably call them.

505  
0:48:05  
Emily  
Okay, looking to call

506  
0:48:08  
Emily  
and then walk me through. If you were ready to pay from this walk me through how you think you might do, or how how you would, you would potentially do that.

507  
0:48:20  
P16  
Like I would click on the pay, and then more. If there's no error, I would go to the to pay that golf.

508  
0:48:29  
Emily  
Okay, yeah, you can go ahead and do that. And again, I'm not. Gonna have you actually enter any real information.

509  
0:48:34  
Emily  
So scroll down, we're going to skip most of this, as I know. There's lots of reading, and then go to continue to the form. Oh, we just passed it just like, yep, right there in the middle. There we go.

510  
0:48:43  
Emily  
and again scroll down. Yeah. So thoughts on you've tapped on that, and you've opened up pay.gov. What would be your next step to actually fill this out and make the payment.

511  
0:48:57  
P16  
Just before. I also have the other

512  
0:49:02  
P16  
I have the letter with me to fill out, like the account number.

513  
0:49:07  
P16  
And like how much I owe.

514  
0:49:11  
Emily  
Okay. So so you you would do this when you're when you're holding the physical letter that they had mailed.

515  
0:49:16  
P16  
Yeah.

516  
0:49:17  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, let me have you switch back to the figma app.

517  
0:49:23  
Emily  
Okay? And you can click, go back and close. So we're just gonna pretend you've this is where you left off from. Yeah. Thoughts on on on using this at all. The information you would need to actually pay.

518  
0:49:38  
P16  
Yeah, I I do like this.

519  
0:49:45  
P16  
If they can also automate it. If not, I think the just. The link is fine.

520  
0:49:50  
Emily  
Okay.

521  
0:49:50  
P16  
Okay.

522  
0:49:51  
Emily  
What would be your step to getting the information.

523  
0:49:55  
P16  
And you know.

524  
0:49:55  
Emily  
The into pay.gov.

525  
0:49:59  
P16  
If I'm using the phone, I just copy paste it.

526  
0:50:02  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

527  
0:50:04  
Emily  
And then anything else I know you said outside of it being automatically entered. Your information. Anything else that might make it easier to to make a payment.

528  
0:50:17  
P16  
No, it gives me all the options I would probably need, like the call, or by person.

529  
0:50:25  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

530  
0:50:27  
Emily  
And then anything else on this screen that you haven't already mentioned that you think could be useful, or that you might be looking for.

531  
0:50:38  
P16  
In terms of payment. No.

532  
0:50:40  
Emily  
No, okay, got it. And then a similar question as I asked with the the overpayments

533  
0:50:47  
Emily  
thoughts on. If you might use a section like this that had the payment as opposed to a section like this, that maybe only had the information

534  
0:50:58  
Emily  
which one would be would would do you? Do you think you would use more.

535  
0:51:03  
P16  
The one where I can pay.

536  
0:51:04  
Emily  
Gigabyte. Okay, got it

537  
0:51:07  
Emily  
all right. And I'm gonna check in with my colleagues. If anyone else has questions here, feel free to unmute and ask them.

538  
0:51:23  
Emily  
Okay.

539  
0:51:24  
Janelle  
For me at this time. Thanks for the feedback.

540  
0:51:28  
Emily  
Awesome.

541  
0:51:30  
Emily  
Alright, I believe that is it so? Unless you yeah. Anything else that you haven't yet shared regarding managing finances with the Va.

542  
0:51:41  
P16  
No! That's it.

543  
0:51:42  
Emily  
Okay, great. Well, I really appreciate your help. This is super helpful to speak directly with veterans about experiences and about what is useful, not useful, as we work on making things better for everyone using them. So thank you so much for taking the time, and I know Paragene will be reaching out as a thank you for the next steps.

544  
0:52:04  
Emily  
and I hope you have a great rest of your day.

545  
0:52:07  
P16  
Thank you, you too.

546  
0:52:08  
Emily  
Alright! Thanks, take care!
