3  
0:00:10

Okay, great. And excuse me, are you okay? If we potentially use some clips from today's session to show our Va partners.

Okay, great. Thank you.

0:00:22  
Emily  
So all right, let's dive in first.st I'd love to know a bit about you as a veteran, at whatever level you're comfortable sharing, such as branch you served in when you retired or separated, etc.

7  
0:00:38  
P14  
Well, I'm I'm an old timer. I'm 82 years old.

8  
0:00:42  
P14  
I was in the [redacted] from 64 to 70.

9  
0:00:47  
Emily  
Great.

10  
0:00:48  
P14  
And I separated at [redacted].

11  
0:00:54  
P14  
Oh, God!

12  
0:00:56  
P14  
[redacted]Vehicle, mechanic!

13  
0:00:58  
Emily  
All right.

14  
0:00:59  
Emily  
And what sort of experiences and interactions have you had with Va. Since then?

15  
0:01:08  
P14  
With a Va! What.

16  
0:01:13  
Emily  
If you if you have.

17  
0:01:14  
P14  
I don't get a VA pension.

18  
0:01:16  
P14  
I was only in for 6 years, so I'm not eligible for any kind of a pension.

19  
0:01:21  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

20  
0:01:24  
Emily  
And have you have you ever attended any of the or I've ever, ever gone to any of their locations or have any experience with their healthcare.

21  
0:01:35  
P14  
Yes.

22  
0:01:37  
P14  
I live in a small city, [redacted]

23  
0:01:40  
P14  
and we have a clinic here in [redacted]

24  
0:01:43  
Emily  
Okay.

25  
0:01:43  
P14  
And I go there.

26  
0:01:46  
P14  
If I need to go into the hospital.

27  
0:01:49  
P14  
We're midway between [redacted]

28  
0:01:53  
Emily  
Oh, got it!

29  
0:01:55  
P14  
And I prefer the [redacted]. It's more user accessible. [redacted] is an old building. You know.

30  
0:02:06  
P14  
any clinics are on various floors.

31  
0:02:09  
P14  
If you're if you're not very mobile, it's hard to get to them.

32  
0:02:14  
Emily  
Got it.

33  
0:02:16  
P14  
But it seems like the the one in [redacted]

34  
0:02:20  
P14  
I think there's only a 2 floor building, and it's very easy to get around.

35  
0:02:25  
P14  
and the parking is much closer.

36  
0:02:27  
Emily  
Well, all those sound like better things in that case

37  
0:02:31  
Emily  
got it. And what sort of experience if any, have you had with the Va website, and or the mobile app.

38  
0:02:42  
P14  
No problems. Really, it's it's fairly easy to sign in. And I go to my healthy vet and do what I need to do

39  
0:02:53  
P14  
as far as ordering scripts and seeing what's happening.

40  
0:03:00  
Emily  
And is that all? So is that is that my health event? Is that an app, or are you on the website?

41  
0:03:08  
P14  
It's it's it's a government website by healthy vet through the Va.

42  
0:03:12  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And are you? Oh, yeah. And are are you ever using the Va's mobile app.

43  
0:03:20  
P14  
No, not really I I you know I'd rather do that on my laptop.

44  
0:03:26  
Emily  
Oh, got it? Okay.

45  
0:03:27  
P14  
It's it's just easier for me to do on my laptop this year is a little bit more difficult.

46  
0:03:35  
Emily  
Okay, what? What is more difficult? If you're on the phone.

47  
0:03:39  
P14  
You, you for me, using the phone rather than my laptop.

48  
0:03:44  
P14  
You know. It's just, you know, just an old guy thing.

49  
0:03:52  
Emily  
All right, got it? Got it? So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion, and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you're willing. I have absolutely no information about you or your finances. So I have no yeah, no information. There. Have you had any experience with owing the Va. Money, such as for a benefit, overpayment.

50  
0:04:17  
P14  
About 2 or 3 years ago I got a call from the Va.

51  
0:04:22  
P14  
Saying that I owed a copayment from like 2 years previous.

52  
0:04:28  
Emily  
Oh, wow! Okay.

53  
0:04:29  
P14  
And I had no, I had no way of proving it.

54  
0:04:33  
Emily  
And the guy says, Well.

55  
0:04:35  
P14  
He says the Va. Can go back 5 years

56  
0:04:38  
P14  
on copayments if you don't pay them, and if you don't pay them you don't get your benefits

57  
0:04:43  
P14  
so naturally I had no, I had no way to prove it, so I paid the copay.

58  
0:04:49  
P14  
even though I you know I keep pretty well track, but you know I didn't. I didn't. Who? Who think you would have to go back 5 years.

59  
0:04:59  
Emily  
Wow! Alright!

60  
0:05:00  
P14  
That to me. That's a long time. So now

61  
0:05:03  
P14  
I do go back. I can go back 5 years now.

62  
0:05:08  
Emily  
Got it alright. And so, as you said, this was, this was a phone call. This was how you had learned about this one.

63  
0:05:15  
P14  
Yes, yes, they called me, which was kind of

64  
0:05:19  
P14  
kind of surprising, you know. You think they would have sent me a letter.

65  
0:05:24  
Emily  
Got it. Okay.

66  
0:05:25  
P14  
You know what I mean?

67  
0:05:27  
Emily  
And do you recall? Well, actually, since then, have you had additional co-pays that you've had to pay since that one phone call.

68  
0:05:37  
P14  
Oh, yeah, I get. I'm [redacted - diagnosis]

69  
0:05:42  
P14  
So I get my [redacted] to the Va. And I have. I do have to pay a modest copay, usually [redacted]

70  
0:05:51  
P14  
per script, which isn't, which isn't unreasonable.

71  
0:05:56  
P14  
Oh, and that being because I was in the  Guards rather than a full time [redacted], or

72  
0:06:06  
P14  
any other branch of service.

73  
0:06:09  
P14  
So I happily pay the copay.

74  
0:06:12  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

75  
0:06:13  
Emily  
And do you how are you receiving these bills, or or how do you know when you need to pay.

76  
0:06:21  
P14  
Well, when they send. When they send the meds or the scripts, there's paperwork inside.

77  
0:06:28  
P14  
and it will tell me if there's a copay or not.

78  
0:06:31  
Emily  
Okay.

79  
0:06:32  
P14  
If if it says Copay and I take that, I put it in my files, I wait for them to send me a bill.

80  
0:06:40  
P14  
and then I pay it.

81  
0:06:41  
Emily  
Okay, got it. And and how is this bill coming to you?

82  
0:06:46  
P14  
Through the mail.

83  
0:06:47  
Emily  
Okay, got.

84  
0:06:50  
Emily  
And what's been your method for making the payments?

85  
0:06:55  
P14  
Usually, I go online. And I pay through.

86  
0:06:59  
P14  
The online site.

87  
0:07:02  
P14  
It's you know. I go on my laptop

88  
0:07:05  
P14  
and I and I pay it that way.

89  
0:07:07  
Emily  
Okay.

90  
0:07:09  
Emily  
got it? And do you do you know about how often you are receiving the bills?

91  
0:07:18  
P14  
Well, it's they usually send the the scripts. And for 90 days, okay, so probably every 3 months.

92  
0:07:32  
Emily  
And so is that so? So you're you're usually paying about every 3 months for the co-pays?

93  
0:07:37  
P14  
Yes, yeah.

94  
0:07:38  
Emily  
Okay. Got it.

95  
0:07:41  
Emily  
And could there be anything that might be made easier on your end in regards to the co-pays, when, how you're notified, how you're paying things like that.

96  
0:07:55  
P14  
No, really, it's kind of straight. It's kind of straightforward, because I know when I get my my [redacted] there's a copay on my [redacted].

97  
0:08:04  
P14  
And that's [redacted] a month. And it clearly states on on the paperwork, there's a copay due.

98  
0:08:12  
P14  
Okay. But if it's like for the [redacted]. There's no copay.

99  
0:08:18  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

100  
0:08:19  
P14  
And it will say No, Co. It'll say no Copay, so I know there's a bill

101  
0:08:25  
P14  
coming. Once I get my [redacted], I know there's a bill coming.

102  
0:08:29  
Emily  
Hmm! But.

103  
0:08:29  
P14  
Which is, which is like, I say, [redacted] a month for me which is very reasonable.

104  
0:08:36  
Emily  
Okay, got it? And are you? Is the bills that you're getting in the mail? Is that the only way that you are notified? Are you seeing anything online for these bills.

105  
0:08:49  
P14  
No just just paper, bill.

106  
0:08:51  
Emily  
Okay, got it great?

107  
0:08:54  
Emily  
Alright, so now I'm gonna have you. We're gonna get to the prototype section. So let me have you go ahead and share your screen on the phone. Let me know if you need help walking you through that.

108  
0:09:09  
P14  
I do? I do?

109  
0:09:10  
Emily  
Okay, so tap once in the middle of the screen.

110  
0:09:14  
Emily  
and then there should be some options coming up on the bottom.

111  
0:09:19  
Emily  
One of them should say, share.

112  
0:09:23  
P14  
Well, it was there, and then it went away.

113  
0:09:26  
Emily  
Oh, yeah, let's try. Yeah. It does that try tapping again?

114  
0:09:31  
Emily  
And then once it's there, tap right where it says, share.

115  
0:09:37  
P14  
Okay, how's that.

116  
0:09:42  
Emily  
Not quite yet. There might be a couple of other options. Does it ask you to share.

117  
0:09:46  
P14  
Panicry, photo, image, from file, document, web, URL, or what screen.

118  
0:09:55  
Emily  
I was.

119  
0:09:55  
P14  
Camera, share whiteboard.

120  
0:09:57  
Emily  
Yeah, so share share the screen.

121  
0:10:00  
P14  
Okay.

122  
0:10:02  
P14  
Now, what?

123  
0:10:04  
Emily  
What do you see? I'm not seeing anything yet, so what are you seeing on your screen now?

124  
0:10:08  
P14  
I I see a bunch of apps.

125  
0:10:13  
Emily  
Try going. Let's see

126  
0:10:16  
P14  
About zoom zoom.

127  
0:10:19  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah. So go go back to zoom.

128  
0:10:26  
Emily  
And we're just gonna try this again. It looks like.

129  
0:10:28  
P14  
So once I turn it on, then what appear on top.

130  
0:10:33  
Emily  
So let's see. So are you. Are you in you're in zoom right now.

131  
0:10:39  
P14  
I don't know.

132  
0:10:41  
Emily  
What do you? What are you seeing on screen.

133  
0:10:44  
P14  
There.

134  
0:10:45  
P14  
Oh, okay.

135  
0:10:47  
Emily  
Oh, there we go. Okay, it's it's there we go. And you gotta hurry. Right? Okay,

136  
0:10:51  
P14  
We got it.

137  
0:10:52  
Emily  
Yep, yep, you. It's perfect right now. Okay. So next we got a couple more steps. And next I'm gonna have you open the app figma that you had downloaded.

138  
0:11:04  
Emily  
So if you need to I

139  
0:11:09  
Emily  
go back to the phone so to are you? Are you on an iphone or an android.

140  
0:11:15  
P14  
Android.

141  
0:11:16  
Emily  
Android. Okay? So if you, I believe you, okay, I see the the 3 lines on the very lower left.

142  
0:11:28  
Emily  
See if that.

143  
0:11:29  
P14  
Okay.

144  
0:11:30  
Emily  
Actually, actually, the the kind of circle square at the very, very bottom tap that once

145  
0:11:39  
Emily  
think that should get us to

146  
0:11:43  
Emily  
at even even below that at the very, very bottom of your screen there is a an empty rectangle.

147  
0:11:58  
Emily  
Okay, and now, if you wanted in the search bar. You can

148  
0:12:04  
Emily  
actually tap into that. It looks like you're muted now. So

149  
0:12:10  
Emily  
tap into the zoom right in front there.

150  
0:12:15  
Emily  
Okay, and then tap to speak right in the middle.

151  
0:12:19  
P14  
Okay.

152  
0:12:21  
Emily  
Okay

153  
0:12:23  
Emily  
Oh, you know. Okay? Oh, it's in safe driving mode. Interesting. Okay? At the very top. There's a leave button. We're gonna leave safe driving mode because you're not driving right now. So the the red button, the very top right

154  
0:12:38  
P14  
Look.

155  
0:12:38  
Emily  
Nope, sorry.

156  
0:12:39  
P14  
No, it's not.

157  
0:12:40  
Emily  
That was my fault. Go to go to go to cancel at the very, very top.

158  
0:12:46  
P14  
Okay.

159  
0:12:47  
Emily  
Okay, all right. The microphones unmuted. Okay, I think I think we're okay. All right. So go back to that open square at the very bottom. Tap on that.

160  
0:13:08  
P14  
You know I don't know. I think I lost.

161  
0:13:10  
Emily  
No, no, that's right, that's right. And so where it says, Search, let me have you type.

162  
0:13:16  
Emily  
Are are you still able to able to hear me?

163  
0:13:19  
P14  
Nope! I lost you!

164  
0:13:21  
Emily  
You lost me all right. Tap back into.

165  
0:13:24  
P14  
Still on that. I'm on the one where it says they've driving mode yet.

166  
0:13:29  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah.

167  
0:13:30  
P14  
That says your microphone is muted.

168  
0:13:33  
P14  
Your video is stopped.

169  
0:13:35  
Emily  
Look up alright. Yeah. Well, Video, stop. But that that's perfectly fine. How do

170  
0:13:40  
Emily  
I'm looking up because I this is something I actually don't know safe driving mode.

171  
0:13:46  
Emily  
I'm just gonna let you. I'm guessing the the safe driving mode is blocking some things.

172  
0:13:52  
P14  
I'm gonna try to leave that again.

173  
0:13:56  
Emily  
no, because I think that's what what I want you to do is we're gonna search for the mobile app figma

174  
0:14:06  
Emily  
because I want to have you open that up. We'll we'll just try once more, and then I've got. I've got a plan for a second a second thing. So let me have you just once more tap that open square at the very bottom.

0:15:56  
P14  
There are no 3 lines on the bottom anymore.

195  
0:16:00  
P14  
I got recent activity mirror.

196  
0:16:04  
Emily  
Actually right below where it says recent, there's another another section. Yeah, it's it's pretty hard to see. It's it's hard on my end, too. Okay, so now oh, hit that. Hit those 3 lines again

197  
0:16:19  
Emily  
alright, and then scroll to the right. I wanna get to the zoom app. I'm just seeing where, because this is your, these are your recent applications. Scroll to the okay. So now scroll to the left.

198  
0:16:32  
Emily  
Oh, there, yeah, there we go so tap on. Yeah, go into zoom. Nope, one to the right.

199  
0:16:39  
Emily  
one to the left.

200  
0:16:40  
Emily  
Yeah, right there.

201  
0:16:43  
Emily  
Yeah. No. Go go to one to the right.

202  
0:16:47  
P14  
Wait a minute, because I'm all done.

203  
0:16:51  
Emily  
No, go in.

204  
0:16:53  
Emily  
Alright I am. Let's see. Give me just a moment. I'm actually gonna try something else. Let me have you stop screen sharing. So? Let's see, I think you have to go so tap on those those 3 lines again on the very bottom.

205  
0:17:11  
Emily  
which are kind of hard to see right now, but at the very bottom yes, no, at the very bottom of your.

206  
0:17:17  
P14  
Wonderful.

207  
0:17:19  
P14  
Yeah. I went to figma again.

208  
0:17:21  
Emily  
Yeah, no, I'm we actually want to get to zoom.

209  
0:17:26  
Emily  
So let me have you at like below where it says recent. The 3 lines on the left hand side.

210  
0:17:34  
Emily  
even even below recent. So there's a there's 3 very light lines.

211  
0:17:38  
Emily  
Yeah, right there. Yeah. Tap that again. Okay? And we want to get to zoom.

212  
0:17:44  
P14  
Okay, zoom, you want zoom.

213  
0:17:46  
Emily  
Yes, I want to get to zoom. Yep, okay, perfect. Alright. So now, tap once in the middle there.

214  
0:17:57  
Emily  
okay. And then there's a little where it says Chat, and there's a little red circle. I want to get to that tap once more in the middle of the screen. Yeah, so right at the bottom. Yes, perfect, and wait for that to load alright. So all the words in the middle tap that, and that should open up figma.

215  
0:18:18  
Emily  
All right. Now give it just a moment.

216  
0:18:26  
Emily  
Sometimes it's a little bit slow to to load, so give it just a moment.

217  
0:18:40  
Emily  
Alright, it's it's loading. It's loading

218  
0:18:46  
Emily  
almost there.

219  
0:18:54  
Emily  
Alright. Great! So this is this. This is similar to what the mobile app looks like. So have you? Have you seen this at all? 1st of all.

220  
0:19:06  
P14  
No, no.

221  
0:19:07  
Emily  
Yeah, okay, got it. Okay? So we're gonna pretend that you have just opened up the brand new mobile app. The va mobile app you're all logged in. We're pretending that. You're all logged in there.

222  
0:19:20  
Emily  
Where, if if you were looking for information on any any copays that might be active, that you might have to pay. Where would you expect, or where would you look around to find them?

223  
0:19:35  
P14  
Well, that looks like latest payment.

224  
0:19:41  
Emily  
Okay, and any any other places you might look to find them.

225  
0:19:51  
P14  
Mama messages, maybe. Or claims

226  
0:19:57  
Emily  
Okay, message or claims. Got it? Okay?

227  
0:20:01  
Emily  
I'm actually gonna have you tap

228  
0:20:04  
Emily  
into the at the at the very bottom, right where it says payments. Let me have you tap into that at the toward the at the yeah. Exactly perfect. So thoughts on where I just directed you. I know it wasn't a place that you had looked for first, st but thoughts on finding the information here.

229  
0:20:29  
P14  
Va payment history. Huh?

230  
0:20:32  
P14  
Va payment history.

231  
0:20:34  
Emily  
Yeah, yeah, just yeah. Thoughts on on what you're seeing here in terms of the information that is

232  
0:20:43  
Emily  
presented to you.

233  
0:20:52  
P14  
Well, I'm tapping on almost everything. You're there.

234  
0:20:57  
P14  
There we go! How's that?

235  
0:20:59  
Emily  
Okay, let me actually have you go back. So tap on payments at the upper left.

236  
0:21:07  
P14  
Okay.

237  
0:21:08  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. There you go, and scroll down to the bottom of this one.

238  
0:21:15  
Emily  
All right. Great! And the the blank gray area at the bottom. Tap once into that.

239  
0:21:30  
P14  
Not doing nothing.

240  
0:21:32  
Emily  
Try so

241  
0:21:34  
Emily  
below where it says Co, like below that that blue button where it's just the the light gray area. Can you try tapping into there?

242  
0:21:44  
Emily  
No, below, like in the place where there are no words at the at the bottom there's a light gray.

243  
0:21:52  
P14  
Yeah, not what's happening.

244  
0:21:55  
Emily  
Okay, yeah, alright, that's perfect. Alright. So now you can tap into co-pays.

245  
0:22:04  
Emily  
Okay.

246  
0:22:05  
Emily  
okay, great. So yeah. So we're pretending that you that, you have some copayments here. I'd love to get your thoughts on what sort of information you would be looking for in regards to any co-payments you may have.

247  
0:22:22  
P14  
Well, excuse me, I would look to see what the payments are for

248  
0:22:34  
P14  
you know. Give me a balance. I want to see why I have a balance, so I would review the details.

249  
0:22:44  
Emily  
okay? And yeah, and you can, you can go ahead. We'll we'll, just use that top one, the James A, Haley hospital, if you want to review those details.

250  
0:22:54  
P14  
Okay.

251  
0:22:54  
Emily  
Yeah.

252  
0:22:58  
P14  
The balance the due date account number, and

253  
0:23:06  
P14  
there's a copay for doctors or medicine.

254  
0:23:10  
Emily  
Okay.

255  
0:23:11  
P14  
But yeah, different stuff.

256  
0:23:15  
Emily  
Okay.

257  
0:23:18  
P14  
I don't see one for $50, though.

258  
0:23:21  
Emily  
Okay. So can you say more about like what? Exactly you are looking for?

259  
0:23:30  
P14  
Well, no, because I want the one for $50.

260  
0:23:34  
Emily  
Okay.

261  
0:23:35  
P14  
With the payment of by the 30th and it's not on there.

262  
0:23:38  
Emily  
Okay. So it's not. It's not lining up.

263  
0:23:44  
P14  
Yeah.

264  
0:23:47  
Emily  
Okay. Got it when you when you get your bills in the mail for the co-payment. Do you know,

265  
0:23:56  
Emily  
are you only getting one charge. Are you getting multiple charges? Do you remember.

266  
0:24:02  
P14  
Well, it depends. It depends on what they send me.

267  
0:24:06  
Emily  
Okay.

268  
0:24:08  
P14  
As I say, for for

269  
0:24:10  
P14  
for my scripts, let's say pills and stuff that's still [redacted] a month, no matter what I order.

270  
0:24:18  
P14  
It's $8 a month.

271  
0:24:20  
Emily  
Okay.

272  
0:24:21  
P14  
Except except for my [redacted]. There's no copay.

273  
0:24:30  
Emily  
Okay.

274  
0:24:33  
Emily  
got it? Alright. So then, then, so with yours, with your [redacted], is that so is is that showing up that [redacted]. Is that showing up 3 times? If you're getting the bill about once every 3 months.

275  
0:24:47  
P14  
Well, well, no. What they do is

276  
0:24:52  
P14  
How can I explain this?

277  
0:24:55  
P14  
On on the line where it's showing what's charged? It says [redacted], and then another line over it will say [redacted - 3 times the previous number.

278  
0:25:04  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

279  
0:25:04  
P14  
Because it's for 90.

280  
0:25:06  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? So it's saying, exactly there. Okay, so yeah, so it looks like this. What you're looking here is is confusing because the $50 is not represented in the charges.

281  
0:25:18  
P14  
Right.

282  
0:25:19  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

283  
0:25:21  
Emily  
Great so if you so let's let's use what you just said. If you thought that there might be something wrong here, and what? What would be your next step?

284  
0:25:34  
Emily  
If if you wanted to see about about something potentially being incorrect.

285  
0:25:39  
P14  
I probably look for a phone number on the bill and call them, just, you know, to see what's happening.

286  
0:25:48  
Emily  
And got it.

287  
0:25:49  
Emily  
And if you were let's pretend that you're on the app here, where? Where would you think to look for that phone number.

288  
0:25:58  
P14  
Probably towards the top, someplace.

289  
0:26:00  
Emily  
Okay.

290  
0:26:10  
Emily  
alright. So so some somewhere up here, you you'd be looking for a phone number to call.

291  
0:26:16  
P14  
Yeah, it would be. I would look on the top.

292  
0:26:19  
P14  
In fact, if I get a bill out.

293  
0:26:28  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

294  
0:26:31  
Emily  
And then would you? Oh, let me have you tap back into back into payments on the lower right.

295  
0:26:37  
P14  
Yeah. Okay, yeah. The phone number to call is in the upper right hand corner of the bill.

296  
0:26:43  
Emily  
Oh, on the bill is where the phone number. Okay, got it.

297  
0:26:47  
Emily  
Let me have you tap back into payments on the lower right.

298  
0:26:54  
P14  
Okay.

299  
0:26:55  
Emily  
Yeah, and then

300  
0:26:57  
Emily  
excuse me, oh, excuse me, and then the the co-pays on the bottom there.

301  
0:27:08  
Emily  
Yeah, perfect.

302  
0:27:08  
P14  
Okay.

303  
0:27:09  
Emily  
And then back to those review details. We're just gonna get back to where we were.

304  
0:27:16  
P14  
Right.

305  
0:27:20  
Emily  
So you you tap into the the details for that top one for the Haley Veterans Hospital.

306  
0:27:28  
P14  
All right. Okay.

307  
0:27:29  
Emily  
Okay, so sorry. So you said here you would be looking for for a phone number which you're not seeing here. And and any other place on this screen that you

308  
0:27:39  
Emily  
might be looking for a of a phone.

309  
0:27:43  
P14  
Well, I tried go to the current statement, the Pdf. And it might be on.

310  
0:27:49  
Emily  
Okay. If you wanna go ahead and tap that and see if that would be useful for you.

311  
0:28:12  
P14  
yeah, there's a phone number.

312  
0:28:13  
Emily  
Okay, got it.

313  
0:28:15  
Emily  
Okay? And so this Pdf statement? I know. Of course, you would use it to look for the phone number. Would there be anything else you might use this Pdf statement for.

314  
0:28:27  
P14  
It would take me to the to www.pay.gov. And to pay the bill.

315  
0:28:33  
Emily  
Hmm, okay.

316  
0:28:37  
Emily  
Got it, and then would do you. Do you keep your statements? What do you? What are you doing? With them when you actually get them at home.

317  
0:28:47  
P14  
I file them in my filing cabinet. I do not throw them away.

318  
0:28:51  
Emily  
Got it? Okay, how about with any digital statements like this? Have you? Have you used digital statements at all?

319  
0:28:59  
P14  
Any what.

320  
0:29:00  
Emily  
Any, and like any statements like this that you're just seeing on screen.

321  
0:29:06  
P14  
Yeah, anything I get from the Va, I save.

322  
0:29:09  
Emily  
Okay.

323  
0:29:10  
P14  
No matter what kind of court

324  
0:29:12  
P14  
it is. I I keep it, and then I file it. I file it in my filing cabinet. I save it.

325  
0:29:18  
Emily  
Oh, okay, yeah. Have you? Have you ever printed anything from the phone like like this? For example, view it. If you might print something like this.

326  
0:29:30  
P14  
Through the Va.

327  
0:29:33  
Emily  
So if like, if you are using this on your phone, might you print this particular statement.

328  
0:29:42  
P14  
if I knew how. Yeah, but I usually don't print off my phone. Don't know how to do that.

329  
0:29:48  
Emily  
Okay, yeah, no problem. Alright. Let me have you tap done right? There.

330  
0:29:55  
Emily  
Is that correct?

331  
0:29:55  
P14  
Okay.

332  
0:29:56  
Emily  
Yeah. So tap done on the toward the upper left.

333  
0:30:00  
Emily  
Yep, perfect. Okay. Great.

334  
0:30:01  
P14  
Okay.

335  
0:30:01  
Emily  
Okay? Anything else that you might be looking for?

336  
0:30:08  
Emily  
here on the on this page, in terms of information on this particular Copay bill.

337  
0:30:14  
P14  
No, not really as long as they what it was for, and I recognize it then I like I pay it, you know.

338  
0:30:22  
P14  
if I don't

339  
0:30:25  
P14  
Then I would get a hold of

340  
0:30:28  
P14  
my clinic first.st Actually, what happened was I was on [redacted].

341  
0:30:34  
P14  
and I was on one unit a week.

342  
0:30:39  
P14  
And actor decided to up it to 2 units a week.

343  
0:30:44  
P14  
and when I started taking it I [redacted]

344  
0:30:48  
Emily  
Oh!

345  
0:30:49  
P14  
In the meantime I called them and told them I wanted to go back to one.

346  
0:30:54  
P14  
and the doctor ended up ordering another. Another script

347  
0:31:01  
P14  
of the 2. So now Va. Shows up at my door with more more [redacted] at 2.

348  
0:31:10  
Emily  
Oh, wow!

349  
0:31:11  
P14  
So then I told him I called the the clinic back up, and I said, This is wrong, I said, I want that Copay taken away, and it took me almost a

350  
0:31:20  
P14  
with the Va.

351  
0:31:22  
P14  
To get them admit that the doctor was wrong in ordering that.

352  
0:31:26  
P14  
and to get the the copay off, but they finally did take it off.

353  
0:31:32  
P14  
So I do watch pretty carefully what I'm you know, receiving from the Va.

354  
0:31:39  
Emily  
Sure. Sure. Yeah, that certainly makes sense. Okay.

355  
0:31:43  
Emily  
From you know, pretending you're you're looking at at the phone for for your actual Copay. What else might you want to do from here?

356  
0:31:55  
P14  
Really nothing. I mean, you know, I mean, like, I say, as long as what I'm seeing is what happened.

357  
0:32:03  
P14  
yeah, I'm happy, you know, if I'm seeing something I'm not happy about, then I

358  
0:32:09  
P14  
I will call the Va. About it.

359  
0:32:11  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

360  
0:32:12  
P14  
Either the clinic I go to, or the number on the bill.

361  
0:32:20  
Emily  
Got it?

362  
0:32:22  
Emily  
And if you were Hello.

363  
0:32:26  
Emily  
want wanted to make a payment from here, what would be your next steps look looking at at what you have here on screen.

364  
0:32:38  
P14  
I go to the Pdf.

365  
0:32:41  
P14  
And probably the payments, and and then pay it out of my banking account.

366  
0:32:47  
Emily  
Okay. So you pay with from the statement, got it?

367  
0:32:51  
Emily  
And then can you? So can can you walk me through exactly how you would do that.

368  
0:32:58  
P14  
No, because I don't do it that way. I do it on my laptop.

369  
0:33:02  
Emily  
Okay. Oh, yeah.

370  
0:33:03  
P14  
I don't pay any of my bills through my phone.

371  
0:33:07  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, you're not paying the phone. Okay?

372  
0:33:11  
P14  
My phone is my phone for what it is.

373  
0:33:14  
P14  
Any bills I pay I pay through the bank on my laptop.

374  
0:33:18  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Only paying there. Okay, great so if this if if something like this existed where you could, you could see all the information from from a bill and look at the details.

375  
0:33:34  
Emily  
But you, of course you're still using your laptop to pay, so you're not paying on your phone. How likely do you think it would be that you might use something like this that we're looking at here?

376  
0:33:45  
P14  
Well, I probably wouldn't, because again.

377  
0:33:49  
P14  
my phone is not hooked up to my printer.

378  
0:33:52  
P14  
So I can't.

379  
0:33:53  
P14  
I can't print anything out, you know. I could save it in the phone.

380  
0:33:58  
P14  
but I can't print it out, and I like hard copy.

381  
0:34:03  
Emily  
Got it. Okay, you like hard copy, though.

382  
0:34:07  
Emily  
Would there? Would there be any instance where? You would find it useful just to to view the information E, even if you're not able to print it out or pay from here.

383  
0:34:18  
P14  
Yes.

384  
0:34:20  
Emily  
Okay, in what? In in what instances, do you think you would use it for that.

385  
0:34:27  
P14  
Well.

386  
0:34:31  
P14  
you know, if if I get something in my email from the Va. I would open it up, read it.

387  
0:34:37  
P14  
and then then I save it to my documents.

388  
0:34:42  
Emily  
Oh, okay.

389  
0:34:44  
Emily  
is that so? So the saving to documents is that something you've ever done from your phone? Or is that only on your laptop?

390  
0:34:53  
P14  
And both.

391  
0:34:54  
Emily  
On both. Okay, got it.

392  
0:34:56  
Emily  
Would that be something you might do? Would would you ever save Pdf statements to your documents?

393  
0:35:05  
P14  
On my laptop. Yes.

394  
0:35:07  
Emily  
But not but not.

395

396  
0:35:15  
Emily

397  
0:35:21  
P14

409  
0:35:58  
Emily

410  
0:36:01  
Emily

411  
0:36:10

412  
0:36:30  
Emily  
Okay? So again, looking at this, the Haley Veterans Hospital, let me have you tap into that. This is a slightly different version that I'd want to get your

413  
0:36:42  
Emily  
thoughts on.

414  
0:36:45  
P14  
And review details, or pay bill.

415  
0:36:48  
Emily  
Well, yeah, let's go into review details. Here.

416  
0:36:52  
P14  
Okay.

417  
0:36:53  
Emily  
Yeah, great so so acknowledging that you wouldn't actually pay here, I I understand that I still would. I'm curious to get your thoughts on

418  
0:37:06  
Emily  
How like what information you would need in, or if if you were going to pay, I know you said you. You have paid on pay.gov before.

419  
0:37:15  
P14  
Well, I'd I'd go to the current statement.

420  
0:37:20  
P14  
And then go from there and then probably you know them.

421  
0:37:24  
P14  
If if that was the way I did it, then I would pay it online or on the phone through the phone.

422  
0:37:31  
Emily  
Oh, okay, you've you've you would. You would call instead of using paid.

423  
0:37:35  
P14  
5 bucks, yeah.

424  
0:37:39  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

425  
0:37:41  
Emily  
Let me actually have you tap on pay Bill.

426  
0:37:46  
P14  
Okay.

427  
0:37:49  
P14  
And it says, and it shows you different ways to pay.

428  
0:37:53  
P14  
And I usually pay on pay.gov.

429  
0:37:56  
Emily  
Okay.

430  
0:37:59  
Emily  
so let me have you. So so you said that you may. You may also pay by phone as one option.

431  
0:38:08  
P14  
I may, but probably not.

432  
0:38:11  
Emily  
You.

433  
0:38:12  
P14  
Give me my phone, and I'm not gonna do it.

434  
0:38:16  
Emily  
I promise it won't actually make you pay anything. I promise you that this is just getting getting feedback here. So have you. Have you paid by by actually calling anybody or or all of your payments have been on pay.gov.

435  
0:38:31  
P14  
Oh, it's pay.gov.

0:38:37  
Emily  
Okay. Got it? Got it? Let me have you? see? Actually, let me have you go and close this

0:39:11  
Emily  
No? What happens when? Where, where? It says, close at the bottom. What happens when you tap into that.

443  
0:39:20  
P14  
Nothing's happening.

444  
0:39:21  
Emily  
Nothing's happening. Oh, technology.

445  
0:39:25  
Emily  
Let me have you? Let's see.

446  
0:39:29

Hmm! My system not in froze. Yeah, I think I'm froze, but.

448  
0:39:38  
Emily

449  
0:39:43  
Emily

450  
0:39:46  
Emily

451  
0:39:58  
P14  
Hang on!

452  
0:39:59

0:40:11  
Emily  
Alright, alright. I think it just got restarted. That's fine. Okay, so that that top section there where it says, Mfs, tap into that.

457  
0:40:21  
Emily  
We'll just get it to where it was. It just may take a moment.

458  
0:40:26  
Emily  
Sometimes technology just wants to kick us off for some reason.

459  
0:40:48  
Emily  
Okay. Great.

460  
0:40:50  
P14

461  
0:40:51  
Emily  
Oh, any. Oh, great, great! Back to where we weren't nice!

462  
0:40:57  
Emily  
It's a tap on payments on the lower right again. Just gonna get you back to where we were, had another question to ask. Great.

463  
0:41:07  
P14  
Okay, and.

464  
0:41:08  
Emily  
And then again scroll down to the bottom.

Emily  
Yeah. And then that blank gray area there. Tap one. Yeah, perfect. You got it? Yep, exactly. And again into this top. James A. Haley Veterans hospital tap into that.

466  
0:41:35  
Emily  
Yeah, alright perfect and so we're gonna pretend that so you have you have this bill? You see that it's for $50. We're gonna pretend that you're not sure that you actually have the money at the moment, and you want to see what sort of options there are. What might be a next step for you in that scenario.

467  
0:42:02  
P14  
Let's see.

468  
0:42:14  
P14  
I might have to go to the statement to see who I have to call.

469  
0:42:18  
Emily  
Hmm, okay. So you got a statement for a phone number.

470  
0:42:22  
P14  
Let me have you? Oh, sorry! Go ahead!

471  
0:42:26  
P14  
Go ahead! Go ahead!

472  
0:42:28  
Emily  
The let me have you tap.

473  
0:42:31  
Emily  
What was that.

474  
0:42:35  
P14  
I was gonna tap on the Pdf. One.

475  
0:42:37  
Emily  
Okay, got it?

476  
0:42:41  
P14  
She never see. No, that would give me the number to call for.

477  
0:42:48  
Emily  
Get the number. Okay, great.

478  
0:42:51  
Emily  
perfect. Alright, and let me have you tap on. Done there on the upper left.

479  
0:43:00  
P14  
Okay.

480  
0:43:01  
Emily  
Alright perfect and and if you could tap on the help button on the upper right, let me get your thoughts on this here

481  
0:43:12  
Emily  
yeah, perfect.

482  
0:43:13  
P14  
Okay.

483  
0:43:13  
Emily  
Thoughts on, if you might use any of these options here that would be under help

484  
0:43:21  
Emily  
for it. For in this sorry in this scenario. If you're worried that you're not, you wouldn't be able to make the payment to see what sort of other options there are.

485  
0:43:29  
P14  
How to request debt relief.

486  
0:43:33  
Emily  
Okay, great, you can. You can tap into that.

487  
0:43:36  
Emily  
See what is under there.

488  
0:43:41  
P14  
Well, I got to submit a form.

489  
0:43:46  
Emily  
Okay.

490  
0:43:47  
P14  
Surprise, right.

491  
0:43:49  
Emily  
I'm guessing. This wouldn't be the 1st form you've ever submitted with the Va.

492  
0:43:55  
P14  
Right.

493  
0:43:57  
Emily  
Got it?

494  
0:43:59  
Emily  
And have you always filled out forms on your laptop, or I'm assuming you haven't done any on your phone before.

495  
0:44:06  
P14  
I would do it on my laptop.

496  
0:44:07  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? Great. Alright.

497  
0:44:10  
P14  
Absolutely.

498  
0:44:11  
Emily  
Okay, yeah. Got it. And you can close you can. If you want to tap that one again just to close that thoughts on the information that was found under help. If that would be ever something that would be useful. You think.

499  
0:44:31  
P14  
Yeah, I mean, you know that.

500  
0:44:33  
P14  
Did they give you different options?

501  
0:44:36  
P14  
So yeah, I would try the easiest 1 1st and go from there.

502  
0:44:40  
Emily  
Got it. Okay?

503  
0:44:42  
Emily  
And how easy or difficult do you think it would be to to find those help options.

504  
0:44:53  
P14  
I don't know not not for not, you know, not not

505  
0:44:58  
P14  
not easy and not hard, you know. I mean it. It might take some getting to to get to the right number.

506  
0:45:07  
Emily  
Okay. Well, if could, you, would there be any way that it could be made easier to to show you what sort of help. Options there are.

507  
0:45:18  
P14  
Well, they could look the phone number

508  
0:45:21  
P14  
on on that last page we were on instead of submitting a form.

509  
0:45:27  
P14  
Maybe they, if they had a phone number, you could call, call and talk to a live person.

510  
0:45:33  
Emily  
Got it. Okay? So you don't want a phone number there?

511  
0:45:37  
Emily  
And and and how about

512  
0:45:40  
Emily  
knowing to to tap the help button at all. Was that something you would you had noticed as we're going through this these.

513  
0:45:49  
P14  
That's something I wouldn't have noticed before you told me.

514  
0:45:53  
Emily  
Oh, good. Okay. Any thoughts on how to make it more noticeable.

515  
0:45:59  
P14  
Yeah. Make the button bigger.

516  
0:46:00  
Emily  
Bigger button. Got it all right.

517  
0:46:04  
Emily  
Any anything else that might make it more clear.

518  
0:46:08  
P14  
No, no.

519  
0:46:09  
Emily  
Okay, I mean, it says, help. So, yeah.

520  
0:46:13  
Emily  
okay, so make it make it bigger there, all right. And I don't remember if I asked you, but if you were looking for any older statements, where would you expect to find those.

521  
0:46:31  
P14  
Well, let's see if we go to help.

522  
0:46:36  
P14  
and there would be if you have questions about Copay bills.

523  
0:46:46  
Emily  
Okay, questions there. All right. You you would look for older statements here.

524  
0:46:51  
P14  
Yeah.

525  
0:46:51  
Emily  
Okay. Got it? Alright. Let me have you.

526  
0:46:54  
P14  
A tool.

527  
0:46:58  
Emily  
Okay, let me have you close that.

528  
0:47:03  
P14  
Nice.

529  
0:47:04  
Emily  
Yeah, great, great. All right, I'm going to have you scroll to the very bottom of this screen here.

530  
0:47:16  
P14  
Okay.

531  
0:47:17  
Emily  
Okay. So the the where, where it's where it says, Pdf, statements here. At the bottom.

532  
0:47:26  
Emily  
Thoughts on how easy or difficult it might be to to come across that.

533  
0:47:36  
P14  
Well.

534  
0:47:42  
P14  
I tap on it. It's not doing nothing.

535  
0:47:45  
Emily  
Okay.

536  
0:47:45  
P14  
Or go to payment. It goes to payments.

537  
0:47:49  
P14  
The last week about payments.

538  
0:47:53  
Emily  
Alright. Yeah, no, that that's fine. Yeah. I I think that was one that just wasn't wasn't connected. That's not a problem. May have you tap back into co-pays on the bottom here.

539  
0:48:05  
P14  
Oh, okay.

540  
0:48:08  
Emily  
Yeah, perfect, great. All right.

541  
0:48:12  
Emily  
And again, go into review details for that. That 1st one, the Haley Veterans Hospital.

542  
0:48:22  
Emily  
Okay? Great.

543  
0:48:24  
Emily  
yeah. So I know that the the Pdf statements that you tried clicking it. It was not there. Thoughts on how easy or difficult it might be to actually find those statements, now that I've shown you where they are.

544  
0:48:43  
P14  
Oh, we're talking about this one, bill. Right? I would copy. I try, copy and see what what

545  
0:48:54  
Emily  
It's just happy.

546  
0:48:56  
Emily  
Yeah, okay.

547  
0:49:00  
Emily  
And what? What would you then want to do after you've you've copied that.

548  
0:49:07  
P14  
I would look for what I'm looking for.

549  
0:49:10  
Emily  
Okay.

550  
0:49:10  
P14  
What's ship?

551  
0:49:14  
Emily  
Alright got it.

552  
0:49:17  
Emily  
And just an overall question. Thoughts on how the different sections are labeled here in terms of how clear or not clear things might be. Could anything be more clear.

553  
0:49:33  
P14  
No, I mean, they've got it in bold type where the bills are originating are originating out, and what they're for. Got it, you know.

554  
0:49:45  
Emily  
All right. Good, all right. I believe those are all my questions. I'm just gonna check in with my colleagues here. If anybody observing has any questions you'd like to ask, feel free to unmute now and ask them.

555  
0:50:07  
P14  
How do I get back there?

556  
0:50:09  
Emily  
No, you're you're you're fine, just as you are one. Once we log off it should, I can make sure that we we quit out of figma first.st So but those are all the questions I have anything else you'd like to add regarding.

557  
0:50:27  
P14  
No, that very interesting topic here.

558  
0:50:32  
Emily  
Yeah, it is. Yeah, well, we're we're seeing what we can do to hopefully, make things make things easier at all. Yeah, is, is there anything else you can think of that might make things easier in terms of.

559  
0:50:44  
Emily  
Knowing about these Copay bills and and paying them and making sure you're all up to date.

560  
0:50:51  
P14  
I'm fine the way they are really.

561  
0:50:53  
Emily  
They are, okay. Great, thanks.

562  
0:50:56  
Emily  
Yeah. Okay, sounds good. So yeah, we can.

563  
0:51:01  
Emily  
that should be. Do you? Do you want to go. We we can go ahead and close out, figma, if you'd like up up to you. But where? I'm just about to to end the call first, st though.

564  
0:51:13  
P14  
Okay.

565  
0:51:15  
Emily  
So if you actually, I think if you scroll up from the very, very bottom of your phone.

566  
0:51:22  
Emily  
see if I can get to.

567  
0:51:24  
Emily  
So even below like from the the actual bottom of the physical phone, not just the screen.

568  
0:51:35  
Emily  
See if you can scroll up. I was seeing if we could potentially quick.

569  
0:51:43  
Emily  
See our try if you can you scroll or swipe rather than scroll swipe? Sorry. From the very top of the phone. Can you swipe down from the very top from the phone.

570  
0:51:58  
P14  
Okay.

571
